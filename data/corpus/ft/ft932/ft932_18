FT  02 JUN 93 / SPD accepts Deutsche Telekom reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S coalition government and opposition Social Democrats (SPD) have
paved the way for the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the state
telecommunications monopoly, by agreeing to reform post and
telecommunications services.
The agreement, which closes two years of difficult negotiations, will create
separate joint stock companies for Deutsche Telekom, the postal services and
the German postal bank. The three enterprises will operate under a holding
company controlled by the state.
The move will allow Deutsche Telekom to move towards its target of selling
49 per cent of its capital to the private sector, starting in January 1996.
Details of how much control the holding company will have over its
subsidiaries still have to be worked out between the coalition and the SPD,
whose support in parliament is needed to change the constitution and allow
telecommunications to leave state ownership.
But the agreement represents a victory for Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the posts and
telecommunications minister, who has been pushing the SPD to accept the
privatisation of Deutsche Telekom.
Deutsche Telekom itself has repeatedly warned that it would not be
competitive in a liberalised telecommunications market in the EC unless it
could get access to the capital markets and restructure itself.
'We are greatly relieved that a solution was found which allows for the
privatisation of the German telecoms,' a spokesman from Deutsche Telekom
said yesterday.
The agreement foresees that the holding company will be an Anstalt des
offentlichen Rechts, or public law corporation, a special legal status
enjoyed by some regional banks and television channels. Such a corporation
would initially offer non-tradable certificates to private buyers but voting
rights would remain with the state.
This arrangement is a compromise to win over the SPD, which is insisting on
some state control in order to ensure that all parts of the country are
serviced.
The SPD has also been concerned about the special job security and pension
rights of employees. 'The agreement was done in such a way that the
professional future of the post and telecom staff will not be jeopardised,'
the negotiating parties said on Friday.
The negotiators are due to submit the agreement to the executive committees
of their parliamentary caucuses on June 14.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Pechiney insider dealing trial opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NINE PEOPLE are due to appear before the Paris criminal court today charged
with passing, or receiving, inside information on the purchase by Pechiney,
the French metals and metal packaging group, of the US company Triangle in
late 1988.
The case, though it involves events more than four years old, has continued
to reverberate through the French political and financial establishment.
One of the accused, Mr Alain Boublil, headed the private office of Mr Pierre
Beregovoy when the latter was finance minister. Mr Roger-Patrice Pelat, who
was implicated earlier in the affair but is now deceased, was a close friend
of President Mitterrand.
Mr Beregovoy himself was called to give evidence to the investigating
magistrate after his election defeat as prime minister in late March and
before his suicide on May 1.
Mr Boublil, now a senior executive of Framatome, the state nuclear reactor
group, has denied passing on information allowing others to profit from
buying shares in Triangle, which controlled American National Can, just
before Pechiney, a state-controlled group, made a Dollars 56-a-share bid.
Others in the dock maintain they concluded from market research, rather than
any tip-off, that Triangle shares were a good buy. But the US Securities and
Exchange Commission detected unusually heavy buying in the US stock and
passed on its suspicions to the French authorities.
A conviction for insider trading can carry a prison sentence of between two
months and two years as well as a fine of between FFr6,000 to FFr10m (Pounds
1.18m). Where an insider trade has made a profit, the fine can be up to 10
times the profit, without limit.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Kuchma backs greater presidential power: Ukrainian
parliament urged to give Kravchuk control over economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN prime minister Leonid Kuchma yesterday urged parliament to support
President Leonid Kravchuk in his bid to assume extraordinary powers over the
economy.
Mr Kuchma also repeated his offer to resign, despite parliament's refusal to
accept his resignation 10 days ago. He said that the president should have
the right to choose his own prime minister.
Mr Kuchma's move is likely to resolve the political stalemate which began
two weeks ago when the president and prime minister put forward conflicting
proposals to create a single centre of executive authority in Ukraine.
Today parliament, which in the past has put more faith in the prime
minister's economic leadership than the president's, is due to decide
whether or not to grant Mr Kravchuk's request for additional powers. Now
that Mr Kuchma has withdrawn his own proposal to be granted extensive
control over the economy and backed the president's bid, parliament is more
likely to support Mr Kravchuk.
Mr Kuchma justified his decision to support the president - whose commitment
to the tough economic reforms Mr Kuchma has championed has been lukewarm -
on the grounds that without a single source of executive power Ukraine would
be unable to cope with its deepening economic crisis.
But the future direction of Ukrainian economic policy remains unclear.
Although Mr Kuchma repeated his offer to resign he left open the possibility
that he would serve as Mr Kravchuk's prime minister, if the president were
willing to back the harsh economic decisions Mr Kuchma believes Ukraine must
make.
Mr Kuchma yesterday painted a bleak picture of the economy in the aftermath
of Russia's decision to charge world prices for fuel sold to Ukraine. He
said that many chemical and metallurgical factories are now unprofitable and
must be shut down, that 45 per cent of coal mines should be closed and that
even Ukraine's defence industries might go bankrupt.
'Whether you like it or not, the reality is that we have already entered
into a hyper-inflationary spiral,' Mr Kuchma said. 'We have no alternative
but to introduce a system of ration cards for some basic foods.'
Mr Kuchma also insisted that political considerations must give way to
economics. As an example, he said that Ukrainian leaders must 'be honest and
recognise that in the near future Russia will never leave Sevastopol (the
disputed Black Sea port).'
He said that Ukraine 'must recognise this reality and make money from it' by
charging Russia for the use of the harbour.

FT  02 JUN 93 / House prices rise for third month in a row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES in the UK rose by 1 per cent in May, the third consecutive
monthly increase, according to Nationwide, Britain's second biggest building
society.
The society's monthly price index, published yesterday, provides the firmest
evidence so far that the revival in house sales is starting to spill over
into price rises.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said: 'House prices have
now risen in four out of the first five months of 1993, reflecting increased
activity in the housing market.'
The average price of a home acquired with a Nationwide loan has risen by 1.9
per cent since the beginning of this year, from Pounds 51,862 to Pounds
52,866.
Despite the improvement, the average price of a home last month was still
5.5 per cent lower than during May last year, said the society. House prices
collapsed last summer and autumn when the pound came under severe pressure
and sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism.
Sales have improved since Christmas, however, halting the slide in prices.
Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, reported that house prices in
April rose by 1.6 per cent, the largest monthly increase for more than four
years.
Halifax is due to publish house price figures for May on Friday. The society
is not expecting the large increases it reported in April and March to be
repeated. Building societies say prices traditionally pick up at this time
of year and they do not expect monthly price rises to continue at the
current rate during the remainder of the year.
Mr Davis said: 'We are likely to see a continuing upturn in house sales over
the next few months, provided buyer confidence is reinforced as the economic
recovery develops. If confidence continues to build, we expect house prices
to strengthen somewhat in the remainder of 1993.' Sales figures for 15 of
the country's largest housebuilders show that offers to buy new homes rose
by 29 per cent during the first 20 weeks of this year.
The weekly figures compiled by the Housebuilders Federation measure net
reservations (sales on which a deposit has been paid) less cancellations,
including purchases by housing associations.
They show that the rate of increase in net reservations slowed in April and
May compared with the corresponding months last year.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the housebuilder, said yesterday:
'The rise in sales is helping builders to reduce sales incentives and
discounts.'

The European Commission denied a report in yesterday's Financial Times that
it supported in a new document sterling's exit from the European Monetary
System's exchange rate mechanism last September. 'The conclusions drawn by
the Financial Times on a technical document drawn up by the Commission . . .
are not correct and do not correspond to the conclusions in the document', a
Commission spokesman said. EC officials confirmed privately, however, that
the document refrains from criticising Britain's withdrawal from the ERM, as

FT  02 JUN 93 / OECD reduces forecast for industrial growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ORGANISATION for Economic Co-operation and Development has sharply
reduced its growth forecast for the industrialised nations this year and
painted a bleak picture of high and rising unemployment in Europe over the
next 18 months.
Largely because the OECD now expects Germany to suffer a serious recession,
the Paris-based organisation has revised down its growth forecast for its 24
member nations to 1.2 per cent in 1993 from 1.9 per cent forecast last
December.
It expects unemployment in the OECD area to rise to nearly 36m next year - a
new postwar record - from 35m this year. As a percentage of the OECD labour
force, it is forecast to rise from 7.9 last year to 8.5 in 1993 and 8.6 next
year.
The German economy is now expected to shrink by 1.9 per cent this year with
the result that the European members of the OECD will experience a 0.3 per
cent fall in output. Six months ago, the OECD expected both Germany and
Europe to grow by 1.2 per cent in 1993.
The OECD expects the much worse outlook for the German economy to be
reflected in sharply higher unemployment. Germany's jobless total is
expected to increase to about 4.5m, or 11.4 per cent of the labour force, by
the end of next year from 4m or 10.1 per cent this year. Six months ago, the
OECD forecast a slight decline in German unemployment to 8.1 per cent of the
labour force next year from 8.3 per cent in 1993.
The latest OECD forecasts form a gloomy backdrop to the annual meeting of
finance, trade and economics ministers from the OECD countries which begins
in Paris today. The OECD secretariat has said social cohesion in western
industrial countries will be threatened if unemployment persists.
Officials are especially concerned that unemployment is falling far more
slowly than in previous upturns in those countries such as the US which are
recovering. Another problem is that unemployment has affected white collar
workers and upper and middle management far more severely in the latest
downturn than previously.
Europe is a particular problem. The OECD's latest forecast implies that its
European member states will have a total of just under 23m jobless by the
end of 1994 compared with about 8.25m in the US and 1.7m in Japan.
The OECD has made only a slight downward revision to its forecast for US
growth. Officials regard the US economy's weak performance in the first
quarter as a temporary aberration that should be followed by a gradual
recovery in the current quarter.
The organisation also believes Japan is close to recovery although it has
revised down its expectation of Japanese growth this year to 1 per cent from
2.3 per cent six months ago.
Adding to the gloom is the realisation that there is relatively little that
governments can do to spur growth and create jobs.
There is little scope for more expansionary monetary or fiscal policies,
although the OECD believes that countries should try to improve the quality
of the public spending programmes to obtain 'more bang for the buck' in
terms of growth. Over the next two days, it will urge member countries to
reject protectionism and to focus on improving the skills of their
workforces to combat unemployment.
Trade ministers will meanwhile be engaged in talks on the margins of the
OECD meeting in the hope of achieving progress in the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks.

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK will challenge EC rule on 48-hour week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK for the first time faces having to legislate to guarantee British
workers' mandatory time off, after its 11 EC partners yesterday voted
through the Community's working time directive, the so-called 48-hour-week
law.
But Britain said it would challenge the directive at the European Court of
Justice and would not start putting it on the UK statute book until that
ruling came through.
After blocking the measure for nearly three years, Britain abstained
yesterday, in the face of its partners' determination to force through what
they regard as a much-needed gesture towards reinforcing workers' rights.
The UK is challenging the legal basis of the directive, proposed by the
European Commission as a health and safety measure and thus requiring a
majority vote rather than unanimity. This deprived the UK of its national
veto.
But over the past 15 months, Britain has negotiated assiduously to dilute
the impact of the measure, while making light of its possible impact, which
would be mostly in the UK. Both British and Brussels officials privately
concur that the UK's legal challenge is unlikely to succeed.
Mr David Hunt, the new employment secretary, claimed the Commission had
abused its treaty powers and said: 'I am confident we will win' in the
court. But he was keen at the same time to emphasise that 'we have drawn
most of the teeth from this directive', which in its original form would
have been 'inflexible, extremely damaging, and placed enormous burdens on
British industry'.
The UK secured a 10-year grace period before it might have to introduce the
48-hour week, which its partners must implement within three years. After
the additional seven years, there will be a 'review' of the derogation,
leaving open the possibility that it may be extended.
British workers who want to work more than 48 hours a week will be able to
do so; those who do not will have the protection of the law. Employers will
have to keep records of both categories, for inspection by national health
and safety authorities whose job it will be to ensure no discrimination. But
workers in the UK will for the first time have the legal right to:
A minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours.
Mandatory daily rest breaks after six hours.
At least one day a week off.
No more than eight hours a shift on average for night work.
Four weeks' annual paid holiday, although the UK would have to guarantee
only three weeks for the six years after the directive is formally adopted,
probably in seven months' time.
There are exemptions on the working week rules for transport, agriculture,
fisheries, all work at sea such as the offshore oil industry, and - at UK
insistence - for doctors in training.
Ireland and Denmark are the only other countries affected by the 48-hour
week limit. Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal will have to
extend guaranteed paid leave; and these countries, plus Greece and the
Netherlands, will have to modify laws on time off.
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the government's undertaking
not to implement the directive in the UK until its legality was determined
by the European Court. But Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades
Union Congress, said: 'Once again Britain is the odd one out in Europe. It
will send the signal to potential investors that it is less committed to
Europe than our competitors.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / Britain faces Pounds 18bn nuclear bill: NAO report on
decommissioning cost raises fear of burden on taxpayer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOTAL cost of scrapping the UK's civil nuclear facilities could approach
Pounds 18bn, according to a National Audit Office report to be published on
Friday.
The report - the most comprehensive study of UK decommissioning costs to
date - will raise fears of a heavy burden facing the taxpayer and will
deepen the controversy surrounding the future of Britain's nuclear industry.
Whitehall officials are worried that the Public Accounts Committee, which
will assess the report on June 30, could judge that not enough money will be
available to pay for decommissioning on present plans.
Nuclear plants have a limited lifetime and safely dismantling them and
storing the radioactive waste is one of the industry's biggest future costs.
The nuclear industry is likely to use the report to argue that it needs more
new stations to provide revenue for decommissioning those going out of
service. Nuclear Electric hopes to start building a Sizewell C nuclear
station in Suffolk next year for commissioning early in the next century.
Nuclear Electric may also use the report to lobby against a reduction in the
nuclear levy, paid by electricity consumers and worth more than Pounds 1.2bn
a year.
The industry also wants to persuade the Department of the Environment that
it should be allowed to take at least 135 years to decommission nuclear
facilities instead of 100 years, a move that will provoke fierce opposition
from environmental groups.
The report comes just months before the government's nuclear industry
review. Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, says in a report this week
that it fears the review may not consider who picks up the bill for
decommissioning. It believes the full costs could be Pounds 30bn, although
it has no detailed projections.
The NAO's report says the cost of decommissioning Nuclear Electric's eight
Magnox power stations and five advanced gas-cooled (AGR) stations makes up
some Pounds 7bn of the Pounds 17.9bn total, in 1992 money values.
Scottish Nuclear's Magnox station and two AGR stations make up just over
Pounds 1.5bn. British Nuclear Fuels' fuel treatment and reprocessing
facilities contribute about Pounds 6bn and the Atomic Energy Authority's
research and reprocessing facilities about Pounds 3.5bn. It is understood
that about a third of the estimates of BNF's costs represent work carried
out for the Ministry of Defence - a tiny fraction of the cost of dismantling
missiles under anti-nuclear warfare treaties.
The nuclear industry is likely to argue, however, that the figures are not
discounted to reflect the fact that much of the spending will not take place
for decades and that the true amount needed will be much lower.
The industry is also likely to welcome the report's suggestion - based on an
independent engineering assessment - that nuclear companies have estimated
the costs prudently and that technological improvements may bring estimates
down further.
However, the report throws a spotlight on the thorniest of the decisions
facing the government's nuclear policy - the timing and method of
decommissioning. This is central to the question of whether cashflow from
the industry will be adequate to cover decommissioning.
The nuclear industry has been pushing for months for a 'deferred safe
storage strategy' which would spread decommissioning over 135 to 150 years,
instead of the 100 years assumed in the NAO report.
The first stage - stripping out the highly radioactive fuel rods - would
still happen immediately. The facility would then be left - supervised - for
35 years, when a concrete shell would be built around it. After another 100
years, when much of the radioactivity had declined, the site would be razed.

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK to challenge EC's 48-hour working week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>

   LUXEMBOURG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK for the first time faces having to legislate to guarantee British
workers mandatory time off, after its 11 EC partners yesterday voted through
the Community's working time directive, the so-called 48-hour-week law.
But Britain said it would challenge the directive at the European Court of
Justice and would not start putting it on the UK statute book until that
ruling came through.
After blocking the measure for nearly three years, Britain abstained
yesterday, in the face of its partners' determination to force through what
they regard as a much-needed gesture towards reinforcing workers' rights.
The UK is challenging the legal basis of the directive, proposed by the
European Commission as a health and safety measure and thus requiring a
majority vote rather than unanimity. This deprived the UK of its national
veto.
But over the past 15 months, Britain has negotiated assiduously to dilute
the impact of the measure, while making light of its possible impact, which
would be mostly in the UK. Both British and Brussels officials privately
concur that the UK's legal challenge is unlikely to succeed.
Mr David Hunt, the UK's new employment secretary, claimed the Commission had
abused its treaty powers and said: 'I am confident we will win' in the
court. But in the same breath he was keen to emphasise that 'we have drawn
most of the teeth from this directive,' which in its original form would
have been 'inflexible, extremely damaging, and placed enormous burdens on
British industry.'
The UK secured a 10-year grace period before it might have to introduce the
48-hour week, which its partners must implement within three years. After
the additional seven years, there will be a 'review' of the derogation,
leaving open the possibility that it may be extended.
British workers who want to work more than 48 hours a week will be able to
do so; those who do not will have the protection of the law. Employers will
have to keep records of both categories, for inspection by national health
and safety authorities whose job it will be to ensure no discrimination. But
workers in the UK will for the first time have the legal right to:
A minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours.
Mandatory daily rest breaks after six hours.
At least one day a week off.
No more than eight hours a shift on average for night work.
Four weeks' annual paid holiday, although the UK would have to guarantee
only three weeks for the six years after the directive is formally adopted,
probably in seven months' time.
There are exemptions on the working week rules for transport, agriculture,
fisheries, all work at sea such as the offshore oil industry, and - at UK
insistence - for doctors in training.
Ireland and Denmark are the only other countries affected by the 48-hour
week limit. Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal will have to
extend guaranteed paid leave; and all these countries, along with Greece and
the Netherlands, will have to modify other laws on time off. The
Confederation of British Industry said it welcomed the government's
undertaking not to implement the directive in the UK until its legality was
determined by the European Court.
Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: 'To
introduce directives on working hours under the guise of health and safety
regulations is unprincipled and reflects poorly on the integrity of the
European Commission'. The government's stance was attacked, however, by Mr
Norman Willis, general secretary of Britain's Trades Union Congress and
president of the European Trade Union Confederation. 'The government would
be foolish in the extreme to pursue this cause', he said. 'Once again
Britain is the odd one out in Europe. It will send the signal to potential
investors that it is less committed to Europe than our competitors'.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Spain's Socialists lag in polls: Gonzalez more popular than
conservative leader Aznar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S ruling Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) may suffer a devastating
defeat in next Sunday's general election.
Even the most favourable of opinion polls, published on Sunday and yesterday
by the daily newspaper El Pas, shows the conservative Partido Popular (PP)
leading the Socialists by 34.8 per cent of the vote to 34.5 per cent, or a
maximum of 155 and 151 seats respectively in the Cortes (parliament). Behind
that apparently close race lurks a Socialist nightmare.
El Pas found that the Socialists, in power in Spain since 1982, had lost
support in all Spain's 52 voting districts, or provinces.
The poll suggested that the PP would reverse Socialist victories in 1989 in
the autonomous regions (which each include one or more province) of
Valencia, Aragon, Madrid, Castilla la Mancha, the Canaries, the Balearics
and Murcia.
The Socialists would hold majorities only in Andalucia and Extremadura in
the poor south, where the government nurtures its support through a subsidy
paid to farmworkers between harvests.
The threat to Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, is that within each
province very small shifts can produce dramatic results in the number of
seats each party wins.
Spain's system of proportional representation does not allow voters to
choose names from all of the lists of candidates presented by parties. Only
one party can be voted for.
That is important because while the PP is clearly taking a lead over the
Socialists as the most popular party, voters still prefer many Socialist
leaders over the untried faces in the PP. Mr Gonzalez holds a big lead over
the PP leader, Mr Jose Mara Aznar, in personal polls.
Recognising that, Mr Gonzalez did not campaign on Sunday, instead preparing
for a second and final television debate with Mr Aznar last night. The
conservative leader easily, and surprisingly, beat Mr Gonzalez in the first
debate last Monday.
In the last few days of the campaign, the two men are fighting for the
support of between 3m and 6m of the country's 30m voters who, according to
weekend polls, remain undecided.
The undecided vote has never been so high this close to a Spanish election
and is a measure of how difficult ex-Socialist supporters are finding it to
move to the PP. Last night was Mr Gonzalez's last chance to appeal to them
to stay with him. To an extent, however, the undecided vote is being skewed
in this election by the advent of TV debating between prime ministerial
candidates.
Only Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar have been invited to appear. Mr Javier
Arzallus, leader of the Basque nationalist PNV, said this weekend it might
be a good idea for all other parties to drop out of the election.
He was only half serious, but two of Spain's new commercial channels, Antena
3 and Tele 5, have scrambled to secure the debates. Little wonder: more than
10m people watched the first debate on Antena 3. Tele 5 was last night
expecting up to 15m viewers. Politicians from other parties fear that by
concentrating attention on the two lead candidates and by becoming the key
flashpoints of the campaign, the TV debates oversimplify Spanish politics.
The smaller Basque and Catalan regional parties are critical to Spain's
youngish democracy. They stand a good chance of being invited to help form a
government after June 6 because no large party will have an overall
majority.
Without their presence in the debates, along with the third-largest party,
the communist-led United Left, the undecided vote risks being left without a
home to go to.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Fire attack fails to surprise Solingen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD, recently at Solingen
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was anger, violence, despair and discouragement at Solingen this
weekend. But no-one voiced surprise.
'How can I be surprised?' asked Christian, a young German student, standing
in front of the house where, until the lethal fire on Saturday, a family of
20 Turks had lived for over two decades. Neo-Nazi youths have often been
seen in the town, minor arson attacks have occurred, and everybody has heard
of violence against foreigners elsewhere in Germany.
'Every day in Germany, racist attacks are carried out and not reported in
the media. At Solingen, the result was five deaths. But it could have been
anywhere, anytime,' Christian says.
Grouped in small circles in front of the burned-out house, hundreds of
demonstrators, mostly Turkish, have spent the weekend arguing and venting
their anger.
The same questions have come up again and again: Why had the police not
acted against the neo-Nazis, whom the neighbours had often seen in the local
park assembling around a fascist flag? Why was the government doing nothing
to integrate foreigners in Germany?
'They are kids, these neo-fascists, they don't think. They don't know what
they are doing,' one woman argued in front of the closed window shutters of
the house next door.
'Not at all - they follow an ideology, they are systematic,' retorted Hasan,
a Turk who has lived in near-by Essen for 12 years. 'They want to push us
toward violence until the whole society hates us,' he added.
Christian believes the racism will continue to grow as long as the 6.2m
foreigners living in the country cannot become German and vote. But the more
pragmatic Hasan said that his name will never sound German enough to erase
the differences.
'In a racist Germany, why would I become German anyway,' he said, as
whistles covered the sound of his voice. Escorted by a flurry of policemen,
Mr Norbert Blum, federal labour minister, walked through the crowd to the
patch of flowers and candles laid in front of the house. After a few
inaudible words, he quickly turned around.
'Where is Chancellor Kohl? Why has he not come?' a demonstrator asked.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Kiev pays the price of indecision: Chrystia Freeland on the
background to Ukraine's political crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S parliament reconvenes today to try to resolve the stalemate that
has led to the most dangerous political and economic crisis since it won
independence 18 months ago.
Unless the three-way tug-of-war between the parliament, the prime minister
and the president is quickly resolved, Kiev is unlikely to muster the
political will to cope with Russia's decision to raise prices for fuel to
world levels.
Failure to respond to steeper energy prices with an austere fiscal and
monetary policy and more rapid moves toward the market could push Ukraine
into hyper-inflation and exacerbate the country's painful drop in industrial
output.
The crisis began two weeks ago, when the cabinet of ministers' extraordinary
power to rule the economy by decree ran out. Promising 'sweat and tears',
Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma asked parliament to extend his powers, and give
him control over Ukraine's spendthrift central bank, in order to push
through his stalled programme of market reforms.
Instead of backing Mr Kuchma, as he had been expected to do, President
Leonid Kravchuk made his own bid for power, asking parliament to amend the
constitution and make the president, rather than the prime minister, head of
the cabinet of ministers.
Parliament rejected Mr Kuchma's offer to resign, thus implicitly turning
down Mr Kravchuk's bid to remove the post of prime minister altogether. But
at the same time, the parliament failed to grant Mr Kuchma the additional
powers he was seeking. The result is that parliament writes the laws, the
prime minister is responsible for running the nuts and bolts of the economy
and the president, who has weak decree-making authority, is overall head of
state.
On May 21, after rejecting both the prime minister's and the president's
requests, parliament offered a vivid demonstration of why this patch-work
political structure is ill-equipped to resolve Ukraine's looming economic
crisis. In response to increases in Russian fuel prices, Ukraine has no
alternative but to raise domestic prices.
But fearing a public outcry, parliament refused to vote for a price rise and
asked the prime minister to authorise price increases. Mr Kuchma refused,
insisting that parliament, having denied him extraordinary power over the
economy, faces the consequences of its decision. President Kravchuk dodged
the issue altogether.
The final outcome: parliament voted to raise the average pension and the
minimum wage but took no decision to raise prices.
One possibility when parliament reconvenes today is that Mr Kuchma will make
a second request for extra powers. But Mr Kuchma has neither the will nor
the savvy to outsmart his political opponents.
A more likely option is that Mr Kravchuk will make a second bid for expanded
authority. Opposition politicians fear that Mr Kravchuk, who has promised to
use additional powers to push through market reforms, will do the opposite
if he wins.
The third possibility, that Ukraine's ex-communist dominated parliament will
again reject both the prime minister's and the president's requests, could
be the most dangerous.

THE lower degree of regulation in Britain's labour market has not given the
country any noticeable competitive edge over other European countries,
according to a survey published today by the Institute for Personnel
Management.
It says: 'There seems to be little correlation between legal regulation and
the attraction of and movement towards flexibility.' The study, based on
research from the Price Waterhouse Cranfield Project, found that employers
across western Europe are increasingly introducing temporary and fixed-term
contracts for workers. There has also been an increase in shift or weekend
working, overtime and sub-contracting as companies move away from the 9 am
to 5 pm, five-day week.

FT  01 JUN 93 / German managers come out on top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH managers think they are the best in Europe but this opinion is not
shared by their continental European competitors, according to a survey of
Europe's smaller companies, published today.
German managers and their companies are the most highly regarded by their
European competitors, though they are modest about their own achievements,
the survey showed. Researchers from Cranfield School of Management
questioned - on behalf of 3i, Britain's largest venture capital company -
just over 1,000 managers of companies employing up to 500 people.
Italian, British and Spanish managers think more highly of themselves than
does the rest of Europe, with the British convinced they are the best.
In the overall European ranking, French managers and their companies were
rated most highly, after the Germans, then the British, the Italians and,
last, the Spanish.
European managers were asked to rank themselves and their foreign
competitors on 12 characteristics. These included competence, reliability,
trustworthiness, humour, and ability to get on with others. Companies were
assessed on aspects such as market and product focus, customer service,
financial viability, and attention to law and ethics.
The researchers then compared how managers rated themselves and their
companies with how they were rated by foreign managers. The difference
between the two represents a measure of the prejudice with which nations
view others, the study said. The biggest discrepancy was between the way the
Italians viewed themselves and the opinion of foreign managers, but they
were closely followed by the British.
British managers were given poor ratings for efficiency, hard work and their
ability to get on with others. The Germans had a modest view of their
strengths and a realistic view of their weaknesses. The French were
considered to be competent but lacking in humour.
The lessons to be drawn from the survey were that companies must communicate
very carefully with overseas customers to overcome the attitudes uncovered.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Accounting rules 'will have legal status'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW accounting standards being developed by the Accounting Standards
Board have the force of law, according to a decision to be published by the
board this week.
The decision - a legal opinion by Ms Mary Arden, a senior barrister
specialising in commercial matters who was recently appointed a judge -
marks the first time the power of accounting standards-setters has been
explicitly granted legal standing in the UK.
The standards being issued by both the board and its 'urgent issues' task
force are likely to be recognised by the courts as authoritative, she says.
The application of accounting standards has until now been unclear because
they have rarely been tested in the courts. The board's predecessor, the
Accounting Standards Committee, was dissolved in 1990 because companies
rejected its authority and refused to abide by its rules, the statements of
standard accounting practice.
Ms Arden's opinion was written in April and is to be included in a chapter
of the board's statement of principles, the framework on which it is
building a wide range of new and controversial standards.
She says a new section, Number 256, inserted into the 1985 Companies Act,
gives authority to accounting standards-setting bodies, which have been
recognised in the 1989 Companies Act.
The acts reinforce the principle that accounts should give 'a true and fair
view' of a company's state of affairs.
Ms Arden emphasises that the true and fair principle is a 'dynamic concept .
. . subject to continuous rebirth' but says the courts will interpret it
using evidence of the practices and views of accountants.
This increasingly means considering the rules laid down by the Accounting
Standards Board, she says. It reflects the fact that, unlike its
predecessor, the board's membership and funding are drawn from the
government and companies, as well as from the accountancy profession.
Ms Arden cites the board's official foreword to accounting standards, which
claims that standards are drafted after extensive investigation and
consultation.
Even though the urgent issues task force - which acts quickly to fill gaps
in standards - is not recognised in law, she argues that it will also be
held in considerable standing by the courts.
Ms Arden cites in support of her opinion the one accounting standards case
tested in court. That was the 1987 Lloyd Cheyham v Littlejohn case, in which
the judge ruled standards of the Accounting Standards Committee were 'very
strong evidence as to what is the proper standard which should be adopted'.
Ms Arden's opinion is the first published decision on accounting standards
since one she wrote with Mr Leonard Hoffman - also now a judge - in 1984.

FT  01 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is normally time to get nervous after a stock market has risen by a third
in nine months. The Swiss market, though, still looks in peak condition. Not
only has the franc gained in attraction as investors have become
disillusioned with the US recovery and worried about the German recession.
For once, funds flowing out of Germany are going not to Luxembourg, but to
Switzerland, which, thanks to its rejection of the European Economic Area in
last December's referendum, is seen as outside the reach of European
regulation.
Though the domestic economy remains weak, the outlook for earnings is
reasonably strong. The international character of Swiss business will help
if the US recovery gathers strength again and the dollar strengthens; the
relatively defensive characteristic of its stock market will compensate if
it does not.
Banks stand to gain from further reductions in interest rates over the
course of the year. Arguably the food sector is vulnerable to disillusion
with brands and pharmaceuticals to US health reform. But Nestle has proved
resilient so far. Among pharmaceuticals Roche and Sandoz, in particular,
have a strong product pipeline. Consensus forecasts for earnings growth of
around 20 per cent this year and 17 per cent next imply a prospective
multiple of around 13 this year and 11 for 1994. The market looks to have
been undervalued before rather than overvalued now.

FT  01 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Mercury Communications
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury is shortly to launch its 'one-2-one' mobile phone service to
consumers within the M25. Its restricted geographical coverage means that
few existing mobile phone users are likely to move over in the early stages.
But its lower call charges may well attract a new market of London-based
domestic and small business users. To hook these customers, however, mobile
handsets will have to be competitively priced and call quality will have to
be acceptable to customers used to crystal-clear land lines.
Even if one-2-one does find a solid market, it will cost Mercury dearly in
the first few years. Heavy capital expenditure will be needed to expand the
network throughout the south-east, and Mercury is having to subsidise the
price of the new-technology handsets by around Pounds 150 a time. So
attracting 200,000 subscribers in its first two years could cost Mercury
Pounds 30m. Yet a large base of subscribers will be vital: the one-2-one
network will cost more than twice that of a conventional cellular system to
establish, while call charges will be lower.
One-2-one's advantage is that it gives Mercury another front in the war to
attack BT's customer base. That counts because rolling out cable television
is slow and Mercury has almost reached saturation within the City of London.
AT&amp;T also wants to attack the City. Mercury will have to spend more on
marketing to attract lower-value customers elsewhere. With Vodafone also
close to launching a new cellular service, telecoms competition is beginning
to warm up.

FT  01 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: UK regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock exchange appears close to breaking the deadlock on the vexed issue
of disclosure for market makers. An article in last week's Stock Exchange
Quarterly prepares the ground for a relaxation of the existing disclosure
rule on large transactions, which requires publication within 90 minutes. If
recent history repeats itself, though, the text could yet serve as the basis
for a submission to the Office of Fair Trading. Three years after the OFT's
last intervention on the matter, the exchange is still trapped between
dissatisfied marketmakers and regulators under pressure to get tough on
investor protection.
Marketmakers argue that the existing rule leaves them open to spoiling
tactics from rival firms, since 90 minutes is not long enough to find buyers
for a large block of shares.
Yet institutional investors have few complaints about liquidity in the
London market. Very large transactions are frequent, with the marketmaker
given notice to line up customers on the other side of the trade before a
deal is struck. That gets round the problem of publication.
The danger is that more marketmakers will quit London if trading profits do
not improve. Liquidity might then become a problem after all. Looser
publication rules might help by generating more big, profitable
transactions. But it is hard to believe the impact would be great.
Besides, disclosure requirements can hardly be relaxed every time market
participants start losing money. The fundamental problem remains too much
capital chasing too little business. That should not be tackled by tinkering
with marketmakers' privileges at the expense of transparency.

FT  01 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Zeneca's birth pangs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Zeneca starts life as an independent company amid an unhealthy degree of
uncertainty. The grey market share price suggests the company is treading a
fine line between the success and failure of its Pounds 1.3bn rights issue.
Since most investment institutions have been either unwilling or unable to
deal in the grey market, Friday's 632p unofficial closing price is by no
means a full picture of the balance of supply and demand. The share price
might recover as the big guns join in. By the same token, though, those with
a vested interest in the success of the deal will have found the grey market
easily led.
Pricing Zeneca is not made any easier by the wide range of profits forecasts
at large in the City. BZW and Warburg, among the lead advisers to the deal,
estimate 1993 profits of Pounds 567m and Pounds 654m respectively. Some
range of forecasts might be expected, not least because the performance of
Zeneca's agrochemicals business turns on the weather. But such a wide
divergence of opinion is surprising. The main comfort is that the rights
issue was successfully underwritten at 600p. That suggests at least a
grudging consensus among the large UK institutions.
With sentiment towards the pharmaceutical sector fragile, though, the
underwriters are exposed to a large degree of risk between now and June 21,
when the rights issue closes. A hostile pronouncement from President
Clinton's healthcare team, for example, could yet upset the apple cart. If
the issue proves a success it will be in spite of, rather than because of,
the company's sense of timing.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Stock exchange urged to shorten settlement period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange should abolish its traditional account period and
move quickly to settling share trades on a rolling basis, a Bank of England
sponsored committee is planning to recommend.
Initially, the exchange may move to settling share bargains 10 days after
they are struck, but that might shorten quickly to seven days, then five,
the committee believes.
The committee, headed by Mr Pen Kent, associate director at the Bank of
England, was formed after the collapse in March of the stock exchange's
proposed Taurus paperless settlement system.
The taskforce has been asked to find a 'quick and cheap' solution to
modernising London's cumbersome settlements system and report to the Bank by
the end of June. Under the account system, all share transactions that take
place over a two-week period are settled on a single day a week later. The
committee is said to have asked the stock exchange to review how to adapt
its Talisman settlements system to rolling settlement. A full move to
rolling settlement is unlikely for 12 months. Once that is in place, though,
the committee will recommend that settlement periods rapidly be brought
down.
Also, the committee is said to be considering whether shortening the
settlement period would require London to establish a central depository for
share certificates similar to those used in other leading markets.
Committee members are said to have examined the German Kassenverein, the
US's Depository Trust Company and the Euroclear system used to settle
international bond transactions, and decided that none meets London's needs
sufficiently.
The committee is studying commercial clearing and settlements systems, such
as those provided by Reuters or Thomson Financial Services, to see whether
those 'off-the-peg' systems could be adapted. 'The problem is that none of
these has a built-in custodial and central registrar capacity,' one
committee member said.
Lloyds Bank, the UK's largest central registrar of share certificates, is
said to have proposed itself as the supplier of a registration system to
interact with any commercial system selected.
Meanwhile, there are signs that trying to satisfy competing commercial
interests of City firms remains a stumbling block. Committee members have
agreed that the interests of users, rather than of service providers such as
registrars, should prevail. However, marketmakers - firms which agree to buy
and sell shares in specific companies under all conditions - are said to be
displeased that the settlements period is not contracting more quickly.
Private client stockbrokers, who are also represented on the committee, are
said to be unhappy about plans to contract the settlement period much
further.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Sharp rise in job fears among professionals and managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEAR OF unemployment among professional and managerial employees has
increased sharply during the past few weeks, according to the second of a
monthly series of Mori surveys published exclusively in the Financial Times
today.
Four out of 10 of people in social groups A and B now say they are worried
that they might lose their jobs within the next 12 months. In April, only 28
per cent of ABs said they feared losing their jobs.
Overall, 43 per cent of workers in Britain are worried that they might lose
their jobs during the year, compared with 41 per cent last month. As well as
the marked loss of confidence among those in professional and managerial
jobs, there was also a significant increase in fear of job loss among
part-time workers and employees with mortgages.
Workers appear to have become more anxious about losing their jobs in spite
of unexpected falls in unemployment in each of the past three months.
In April, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit dropped by
1,400 to 2.9m, or 10.5 per cent of the workforce.
Mr David Martin, a director of Industrial Relations Services, the
independent pay and conditions group which commissioned the survey, said the
latest results of the IRS/Mori index showed that 'fear of redundancy and job
loss remains a potent threat to confidence and therefore to the reality of
sustained economic recovery'.
The 41 per cent of ABs who this month said they were 'very or fairly
concerned' about the possibility of becoming unemployed during the next 12
months compares with the 47 per cent of skilled manual and craft workers who
fear unemployment.
The figures for social groups other than ABs have changed little since the
survey was last conducted. However, among part-time workers - 80 per cent of
whom are women - 41 per cent now say they are very or fairly concerned about
job loss, compared with 33 per cent last month. Among mortgage payers, 40
per cent were very or fairly concerned last month and 45 per cent this
month.
Social group A takes in professionals such as doctors, solicitors and
architects, senior civil servants and senior business executives and
managers. Group B includes bank managers, university lecturers, middle
managers in business and heads of local government departments. The toll
taken by the recession of service-sector jobs, plus companies thinning out
levels of management, have heightened anxieties among ABs.
The survey shows a correlation between levels of general economic optimism
and strength of concern about individual job loss. However, it is impossible
to tell whether individuals are depressed about their personal prospects
because they are pessimistic about the economy, or whether their views on
the economy follow fears for their jobs.
Mori interviewed 982 adults aged 18 and over in full-time or part-time work,
face to face in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points
throughout Britain on May 20-24. Data were weighted to match the profile of
the population.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Personal View: Why the chancellor must act tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RUPERT DARWALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the last election, Mr John Major said Britain had never been in a
better position to borrow. Even if it was true then, it is no longer the
case. Although the budget Red Book, projects a run of large but declining
PSBRs, these all represent additions to the existing stock of debt. With
nominal interest rates some two points higher than the growth of nominal
GDP, debt service costs will rise, as a proportion of GDP, with debt
interest costs tending to rise exponentially.
This means the costs of stabilising the debt to GDP ratio rise with each
passing year. Last year debt interest cost Pounds 17.5bn and is projected to
rise to Pounds 29bn in 1997-98. Stabilisation of the debt ratio requires a
primary surplus - that is before debt interest - sufficient to pay the real
interest on the debt. On current plans, this would require a fiscal
adjustment in four years' time roughly equivalent to raising the basic rate
of income tax from 25 per cent to 30 per cent.
Rising debt service costs have an impact on public spending and the control
of inflation. The growth of debt servicing costs puts pressure on other
spending programmes, which have been growing very rapidly. Over the last
three years, public spending rose by 13 per cent in real terms whilst the
economy contracted. It is sometimes forgotten that public spending is a cost
on the wealth creating part of the economy, funded by taxes and borrowing,
which is deferred taxation. Sooner or later increased taxes are passed
through in the form of higher costs, reducing competitiveness. A case is
made that capital spending, particularly on infrastructure, is different as
it yields a return. But in the best cases, the returns are low, albeit long
term.
Cutting public spending is difficult, particularly if so much is ring fenced
by the manifesto, a document which is becoming the most expensive suicide
note in political history. As the case of Belgium or Italy shows, it is easy
to run up debt, but difficult to reduce it and requires high tax rates to
service it. The risk is that the fiscal options will have been closed off
for a decade, during which time the main task of fiscal policy will be an
unremitting effort to turn the deficit into a primary surplus.
An increasing national debt also makes the operation of monetary policy and
the control of inflation more difficult. Unlike in the 1970s, inflation will
not erode the real value of debt significantly without the re-imposition of
exchange controls. If inflationary worries resurface, bondholders would
switch their holdings to investments where they can maintain positive real
returns. As a result, nominal gilt yields will rise. It is thus vital for
the government that inflationary expectations remain low. So far the rise in
debt service costs has been partially offset by falling yields. But this
could be quickly reversed.
With a current account deficit as well as the large fiscal deficit, there is
a risk that investors will become nervous about the UK economy returning to
a sustainable balance within a realistic period. Such fears could lead to a
run on sterling, placing the government in an awkward position - to raise
interest rates to offset the loosening in monetary policy, so putting the
recovery at risk, or instead letting sterling fall, boosting nominal
competitiveness but risking any inflationary consequences. Political
weakness at such a time would increase the likelihood of a wrong choice.
The UK's political culture makes it extraordinarily difficult to have a
sensible debate on these central issues. Two weeks ago, Michael Portillo
made a speech reviewing the issues and stating his preference for action on
public spending. What unfolded was a typical Whitehall story; a leak about
prescription charges, probably from the Department of Health, made the
speech headline news and the media were off to hunt-the-manifesto-pledge.
Too often economic issues are written about in a narrow tactical context
such as the relative power of one minister against another.
This is very different from Germany, facing its own fiscal crisis caused by
unification. There the debate is being conducted in terms of growth versus
distribution - spending cuts versus tax increases. In the UK we have not got
to first base. In this respect, one of the world's oldest democracies has
some growing up to do. Mr Clarke's appointment as Chancellor might help to
change this. If he confronts the fiscal deficit and explains the options,
his authority would be enhanced, as happened to Paul Keating, who, as
Australian finance minister in 1987 took tough measures to cut the deficit.
If, and only if, Mr Clarke can cut public spending as ruthlessly will he be
well placed to earn the leadership of his party.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's next steps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE signs are that Mr John Major's re-shuffle of his Cabinet has failed to
free him from factional strife inside his party. There is talk that the
prime minister may well face a leadership challenge in the course of 1994.
Given the wounds of the Newbury by-election and the likelihood that
Christchurch will inflict a further gash, there is cause for prime
ministerial anxiety. Perhaps there is no escape from this dizzying descent
into political ineffectiveness. Mr Major, a man of unsure political
identity, was chosen because his colleagues wanted no more of Mrs Thatcher,
but did not know what they wanted instead. Normally, parties in identity
crisis recuperate in opposition. That the Conservatives are not doing so is
a fearsome indictment of the Labour party.
The continuing feebleness of the opposition is one of several reasons why Mr
Major need not feel entirely gloomy. Bigger ones are the economic recovery
and fact that parliamentary warfare over Maastricht is as good as over. Last
week's timid re-shuffle might yet add a fourth, if the new team can help
define a post-Thatcher conservative project to unite all but the most
embittered Europhobes inside the party.
In his interview with the FT last week, Mr Major displayed his strengths and
his weakness. His strong points include a doggedness of purpose and personal
charm, once considered a decisive electoral asset. He has also dealt with
the debris Mrs Thatcher left behind: the poll tax, soaring inflation,
recession and chaos inside her own party on Europe. Even his responsibility
for Britain's unedifying tangle with the exchange rate mechanism of the
European monetary system cannot obscure the achievement. Of the weaknesses,
one, the slimness of Mr Major's majority in the House of Commons, is without
remedy. A second, the government's reputation for competence, is closely
linked to the first; a government which speaks loudly and carries a small
stick is apt to look foolish. On coal, education and penal policy, Mr Major
and his ministers have appeared by turns vainglorious, penitent and
incompetent. Even last week, recrimination surrounded the launch of policies
for transport and science, suggesting a government which might have
difficulty organising a sing-song at a Welsh drinking party. If he cannot
run a competent government, Mr Major will not deserve to go on governing.
The vision thing
But there is a third weakness which lies at the heart of his difficulties.
In the interview, he was asked where, in a Cabinet of consolidators on one
side and radicals on the other, he stands himself. In rejecting such labels,
he said: 'When I see something that I believe is wrong, I will want to
change it. Where I see something that operates broadly with the grain of the
British instinct, I won't want to change it.'
As an appeal to a national temperament which dislikes ideologues, this is
fine, but it is not the basis for a political platform, on which others can
build; it lacks, in President Bush's words, the vision thing. A prime
minister has to be able to set out the political principles against which
choices must be made. If he cannot, those who wish to support him will lack
a framework for so doing, and his opponents will see him as so much chaff.
What might a new Conservative vision involve and how could it bear on the
two great questions in British politics: the economy and Europe? Here is a
suggestion: the government will seek to return as much power as possible to
its citizens.
It can do so in a number of ways: by restraining the level of taxation, so
that individuals have maximum discretion over spending; by giving the public
more information, better right of redress and effective, open and
accountable government at the local, national and European level. In other
words, Mr Major would turn the tide on the centralised state which Mrs
Thatcher used to attack deep ills. He would do so while building on the
foundations of Thatcherism - a liberal, open economy exposed to the maximum
competitive pressure; a corporate sector freed from excessive taxation and
damagingly powerful trade unions; a commitment to low inflation and prudent
public finances, including a determination to contain the public sector at
around 40 per cent of GDP. This year, driven partly by the recession, the
figure will exceed 45.5 per cent, at a time when revenues represent only 37
per cent of GDP.
Timorous step
It is clear that Mr Major is instinctively attracted by much of this, but
his actions, such as the citizen's charter, have been inadequate. He heads a
government machine which prefers governing in the dark, where Whitehall
knows best and the Treasury knows best of all; never mind that this gave
Britain the poll tax, boom and bust, the ERM, the pits debacle and the
confrontation over school tests.
It is not true that nothing can be done. The panel of advisers at the
Treasury is a timorous step in the right direction, but what the UK really
needs is an independent central bank, accountable for achieving a specific
inflation target, and a council of economic advisers capable of carrying
independent weight in the pay-setting debate.
Whether or not the Bank of England is made independent, fiscal policy has to
be tightened. If not, an appreciating exchange rate may again be used as the
main instrument for securing low inflation, thus again tending to
destabilise incentives for the production of tradeable goods and services.
This implies a firm attack on public expenditure, which in turn calls for
the political boldness to target benefits on those who most need them,
rather than re-cycling middle-classes taxes as middle-class subsidies. Where
services are efficiently provided by public-sector agencies, individuals who
can afford to should be asked to pay, and they should be able to pay
directly for a premium level of service. Obvious targets are subsidised
home-ownership and free higher education for all, but the scale of the
financial problem demands that the principle also be applied in social
security, pensions and the health service.
There is a connection between public finances and better governance. In the
first place, big changes to the welfare state require consent, and consent
requires debate. Also, the excellent principle of the purchaser-provider
splits in public services demands more effective mechanisms to develop
competition among providers and to make the purchasers (for example, health
authorities) accountable. Whitehall cannot be the sole conduit for this
process, nor can Whitehall's ugly quango offspring. A start must also be
made in restoring fiscal autonomy to local authorities, which today depend
upon central government grants for 85 per cent of their income.
Poor watchdogs
Pluralism in governance is healthy because it places power and
responsibility at the right level and because it encourages diversity. The
government recognises this in the EC context, where Mr Major wants the
community to take a hard and realistic look at the role of the commission,
the European Parliament and the council of ministers which, jointly and
severally, fall well short of acceptable standards of openness and
accountability. This debate, however, cannot avoid examining the role of
national parliaments, which have been poor watchdogs of the EC thus far;
perhaps Britain's House of Lords could be made democratic and given such a
role.
Here then, is an agenda for Mr Major. In it, he champions individual
responsibility and opportunity and attacks monopoly power and overmighty
institutions. He constrains the state, but makes it more democratic, more
economically productive. Perhaps he even unites his party and looks like a
winner again.

Whilst Gillian Shephard may have been a pedestrian and ineffective Secretary
of State for Employment, she will be remembered for one small achievement.
She once said that she would not have succeeded in her job until someone in
Eastenders, the TV soap opera, wanted to get a National Vocational
Qualification (NVQ), her department's skill-based award.
Cue to last Thursday night's episode - just hours after the Cabinet
reshuffle - when an Eastenders' star is asked if he has any NVQ's.
Unfortunately, the bemused star, like most of the nation, does not know what
a NVQ is, and is told it means 'I'm better qualified to be unemployed'.
Perhaps, Mrs Shephard will have better luck in getting her message across in
her new job.
It might be a bit of a demotion, but there is a touch of originality about
the choice of a Shephard to run the Ministry of Agriculture.

Mary Arden, the QC who was recently made a judge, seems suddenly to have
changed her title. As a senior legal counsel, she was always referred to as
Miss. Now on the bench, she has become a Mrs. Confusingly, she is married,
but has always retained her maiden name as a trade name.
Apparently judges cannot be referred to as Miss, the joke being that they
are all married - at least to the law.

Unlike most of Norman Lamont's inner team, one person to survive the Cabinet
reshuffle with his reputation enhanced is William Hague, the chancellor's
parliamentary bag carrier, who took over Sir Leon Brittan's parliamentary
seat when the latter left for Brussels.
Hague, 32, who was Lamont's parliamentary private secretary throughout his
time at No 11, has taken his first tentative step up the ministerial ladder
as parliamentary under-secretary of state at Social Security. He had been
tipped for promotion before, but was obviously thought too valuable as
Lamont's ambassador among the backbenchers to be moved until now.
His new post means that he follows in the footsteps of both Major and
Michael Portillo. Like them, he has survived glowing praise from Margaret
Thatcher: his party conference speech back in 1977 urging the Tories to roll
back the frontiers of the state, led her to hail him as 'possibly another
young Pitt'. Indeed, young Hague is so keen to get down to work that
Observer hears that he has had to interrupt his conquest of Britain's
coast-to-coast walk this week. Shame on him.

Towns in the American west change their names at the drop of a cowboy hat.
Early in the century, two Utah towns were so keen to win a philanthropist's
library that one called itself after him, Bicknell, with the other assuming
his wife's maiden name, Blanding. And 40 years back, Hot Springs in New
Mexico took the shilling of a hit radio show and became Truth or

Now the obscure hamlet of Ismay has followed the same opportunistic path,
renaming itself for America's most famous football player. Welcome to Joe,

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is nothing sacred? When a pillar of the establishment, like Lord Erroll of
Hale, attacks Who's Who, the 145-year-old dictionary of people who are
thought to matter in Britain, then the prime minister's vision of a
classless society may not be as far away as sometimes imagined.
Lord Erroll, who was president of the Board of Trade when Harold Macmillan
was running the country in the early 1960s, accuses the 2,000 page reference
book of being 'too fat and too heavy' and says that he has no idea of how
people are selected for inclusion. Hear, hear.
In a letter to The Times yesterday, he says that the self-important tome
needs stricter editorial control, citing the example of romantic novelist
Dame Barbara Cartland who has a 200 line entry all to herself, whilst former
US president Ronald Reagan merits just 12 lines. There are plenty of other
examples of the quirkiness of a reference book which is regarded by many as
the establishment bible. The late Robert Maxwell, for instance, had a 50
line entry whereas Sir Owen Green of BTR has just seven lines. Lord King's
entry is more than twice as long as that of his heroine - Lady Thatcher.
Lord Erroll (25 lines) is not the first to sound a rebellious note. The
Economist, the FT's sister publication, once described Who's Who as
Britain's second-most-secret institution noting that its name is not even
listed in the telephone directory.
Surely, now that Stella Rimington has been named as boss of MI5, the country
can be permitted to know who chairs the Who's Who selection board?

FT  01 JUN 93 / In search of the private landlord: The call for small
investors and institutions to return to home renting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST everyone with an interest in the UK housing market now agrees on one
thing: there is a pressing need to revive the private rented sector to
increase housing choice and encourage mobility of labour.
Politicians from all parties, developers, lenders, economists, housing
analysts - even Shelter, the campaign for the homeless founded in 1963 to
campaign against slum landlords - are part of this consensus.
Last month, they were joined by the prime minister who, for the first time,
held out the prospect of measures to encourage private landlords to increase
their involvement in the housing market. The Downing Street policy unit is
involved in a secret inter-departmental examination of housing policy,
reviewing options on renting, and on housing benefit and the right to buy.
Certainly, there is scope for increasing the share of the market taken up by
private rental. It fell from 90 per cent of housing in 1900 to below 7.5 per
cent by 1990 - one of the lowest levels in Europe.
There are signs that the apparently inexorable decline in private rentals
has been halted. Last year, members of the Association of Residential
Letting Agents (Arla) reported an average increase in private lettings of 13
per cent, according to a survey from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the
social research organisation.
But this appears to reflect nothing more than a temporary reaction to the
depressed housing market. The Rowntree survey found that 18 per cent of
properties managed by Arla members were owned by people who were unable or
unwilling to sell their homes in the current property slump. Another 40 per
cent were owned by 'temporarily absent landlords', some of whom might have
sold their homes in a more buoyant housing market.
'When the property market picks up, the likelihood is that many of these
reluctant landlords will take the opportunity to sell up,' says Mr Richard
Best, director of the Rowntree Foundation.
This pessimism is widely shared by those in the private rental sector. They
see the main impediment to a revival of private rentals in the yield gap: at
current rent levels, the return on investment in private rented homes is
well below what investors earn elsewhere.
The Rowntree survey found that returns on private rentals varied between 6.1
per cent and 7.2 per cent net of management and maintenance costs. Agents
believe this return would need to rise above 10 per cent to attract new
investment into private renting.
Above all else, private landlords want tax incentives. They point to the
success of the Business Expansion Scheme, which has attracted more than
Pounds 1.2bn of new investment into the private rented sector, by offering
small investors tax relief over five years.
But the BES is due to be abolished at the end of the year. Advocates of a
'son of BES', such as Mr Best, say new incentives are needed to attract
long-term investment from institutions, rather than costly tax relief for
small investors.
It is an argument that appeals to Sir George Young, the housing minister,
who believes Britain's institutions should be persuaded to invest in private
rented homes.
'Investments in bricks and mortar, responsibly managed and with rents
underpinned by housing benefit, should be an attractive part of any
long-term institutional portfolio,' he says.
The Environment Department is in discussion with institutional investors
over what they see as obstacles to returning to the residential property
market. Sir George recently suggested a new form of intermediary, such as
the investment trust, through which they could invest in rented property
without ownership and management responsibilities.
However, the main obstacle to any significant investment incentives for
private landlords lies in the Treasury. Already frantically searching for
ways to cut public spending, the Treasury is aghast at the suggestion of a
'son of BES', pointing out that fiscal policy is being changed to focus tax
incentives on investment in enterprises.
It would also not be cheap: the cost to the Exchequer of building just
20,000 homes under the BES was more than Pounds 400m. 'We would be talking
about billions of pounds,' one minister says, 'subsidies of several
thousands of pounds for each house. There must be a better way to use the
money.'
An alternative to investment subsidies would be to boost the returns from
private renting by sheltering them from tax. Making rental income tax-free
would almost certainly bridge the yield gap at current rent levels,
according to the Rowntree study. However, it would be expensive if the
concession were extended to existing landlords: income from unfurnished
property alone topped Pounds 1.7bn in 1989-90.
Lifting capital gains tax from private rented property would be cheaper  -
perhaps a quarter of the Pounds 1.1bn yield of CGT comes from gains on
property.
However, even modest sums of this sort are hard to countenance when the
government is looking at such unpopular measures as charging pensioners for
prescriptions.
And many Tory MPs feel that tinkering with the tax system is not the answer.
'I don't believe that tax measures are the right way to deal with this,'
says Mr Robert Jones, the Tory chairman of the cross-party environment
committee. 'We have to create a society where it is worth building houses
for rent.'
'Institutional investors want certainty,' adds another MP. 'They want to
know that tax arrangements won't change for, say, 10 years.'
Such Tories are too tactful, or embarrassed, to concede that the the way in
which high profile pledges on taxes were broken in this year's Budget will
not have increased investor confidence in politicians' long-term plans.
If tax incentives are out of the question, could the pattern of housing
subsidies be altered to help private landlords? For example, phasing out
mortgage interest tax relief might make private renting more attractive than
owner-occupation for some people.
Those within the Conservative party who advocate the abolition of mortgage
interest tax relief do so in whispers, since they see no prospect that the
government will renege on the election manifesto promise to retain it.
However, the reduction in the rate of tax relief from 25 to 20 per cent in
this year's Budget has so far passed without outcry. Thought of further cuts
may become politic in future, particularly if rising house prices threaten a
return to the boom/bust cycle of recent decades.
An alternative approach would be to extend to the private rented sector the
subsidies which now help housing associations keep rents down. This is an
appealing option for Conservative MPs, who fear that the Pounds 2bn a year
of government grants available to associations through the Housing
Corporation are crowding the private sector out of the market.
Sir Paul Beresford, an officer of the Tory backbench housing committee,
believes that developers should be allowed to compete for housing grants
against associations. Though developers would, on the whole, not be
interested in managing estates, that task could be handed over to private
sector management companies.
This solution would also be attractive to backbenchers, concerned that
associations have become too monolithic and unaccountable.
However, Sir George Young told the environment committee in April that
giving grants to the private sector would raise similar problems of
accountability for public money. And, if rents charged by the private sector
were higher than those charged by the housing associations, this could boost
further the fast-growing bill for housing benefit which the Social Security
Department is anxious to curb.
Reconciling the differing interests of departments could prove the biggest
obstacle to agreement over the form of help for the private rented sector.
As one minister candidly admits, there is little coherence in the
government's housing policy. If coherence is to be achieved, it will have to
be imposed by Mr Major and his high-level review.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Visions of Europe: A pressing case for protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAUDE IMBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hamstrung in its actions in the former Yugoslavia, enfeebled by the rising
tide of unemployment, Europe is suffering a breakdown. The temptation for
national go-it-alone solutions is sweeping all before it. Maastricht has
become synonymous with defeat. We have lurched from Euroscepticism to
Europessimism. Eurocollapse stares us in the face.
This depression could wash away our sole barrier against decline. To stand
firm, the Community needs a new strategy suited to a new era.
We need a common defence against the apathy and stagnation all around. We
must sound the bell of alarm. Menace is on the march. The danger is no
longer military, orchestrated by the Kremlin. Instead, it is insidious,
economic in nature, and on a world scale. Faced with the task of seeking
salvation, the 12 need to find a new method of defending themselves - the
jobs, living standards and social systems in which we take pride. We need a
'New Deal' for Europe.
We are not, thank God, starting from nothing. The single European market
forged by the zealous bureaucratic machine of Brussels has taken 36 years to
get off the ground. Decisions are made at a distance from the electorate,
and the functionaries of the European Commission have felt the people's
anger. But at last the Common Market really exists. The Maastricht treaty,
though caught in the doldrums, is still afloat.
The Danes have swallowed their previous rejection; John Major hopes British
ratification is in the bag. Would-be members are jostling at the gates. The
fever of nationalism has run high, yet the Maastricht treaty - tattered,
vilified, ill-loved - has survived. The 12 have always advanced in crab
fashion; now is not the time to bury ourselves in the sand. The ragged army
of Europe will not again march in step unless it finds fresh objectives.
To do this, I suggest we abandon the absolutism of free trade. This was the
doctrine established in our most glorious period of economic growth, when
the coolies of Asia were restricted to pulling rickshaws. These times have
passed; the coolies now sit at computer screens.
I must make one point clear. I do not want to turn our backs on competition
and free trade. I want simply to limit our continent's vulnerability.
Protectionism on a national level is evidently condemned to end in
catastrophe. By contrast, a Europe-wide system of economic defence would
have every chance of success.
A common market with 350m inhabitants is large enough to guarantee
competition and innovation at its heart. We can all see the drawbacks of
globalisation of commerce. It brutally concentrates the production of rich
countries in the least labour intensive industries. It ruins employment. And
it destroys small and medium-sized businesses, submerged by countries which
offer their workforces no social protection and pay them wages 20 or 30
times lower than our levels.
There is an inexorable move to whittle down all the advantages enjoyed by
developed countries - high wages, social protection, reasonable working
hours. The tendency is exacerbated by rapid growth of under-employed
populations in the third world.
My conclusion is, therefore, that the 12 extend to other sectors the system
of Community preference already in place in agriculture. If the
effectiveness of tariff measures is threatened by exchange rate
manipulations, we should not fear to bring in quotas on a selective and
temporary basis, following the line of Japan and the US.
This does not correspond to the vision of the British. But, as far as Europe
is concerned, Britain does not lead - it follows. France and Germany,
putting all complexes aside, should continue to show the way - as a means of
saving Europe, and of saving themselves.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Letter: Restoration of Lloyd's good name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J HAMILTON STUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lloyd's meeting at the Albert Hall on May 25 merely confirmed that they
have a wonderfully simple method for survival:
Fail to regulate the market so that, to date, 90 per cent of recent
horrendous losses fall (via the LMX spiral etc) on only 30 per cent of
Names.
Make long overdue reforms so the lucky 70 per cent, and any corporate
capital enticed in, can make profits of up to 25 per cent or more in future.
Abandon the 30 per cent of innocent Names, who had trusted Lloyd's, to their
fate, with only very modest offers of compensation.
There is, however, a very simple solution to this gross inequity - do what
any other organisation would do and, via bonds, borrow against future
profits. The Business Plan has, however, turned this available option down,
in spite of the benefits which would accrue: abandonment of litigation,
retention of many Names and, most important of all, restoration of Lloyd's
good name.
Those who wish to profit from the future should not do so on the bodies of
the terminally wounded.

<TEXT>
The ordinary British man and woman no longer believes that dreadful Johnny
Foreigner lurks menacingly on the quayside of Calais. We really are a lot
more sophisticated than that. When The Sun recently offered its readers the
chance to sail to France for Pounds 1, an estimated 400,000 took up the
offer. No Europhobia there.
What Sun readers - one in six of the UK population - want from Europe is
simple: an open, free and liberal trading area within which we can create
wealth and jobs, make our own laws, retain our own culture and run our own
lives.
We welcome the freedom to travel, to work, to compete on level terms, to
attract investment by offering working conditions which suit our people.
We want to be able to decide how much fish we can take from our own waters
and which crops our farmers can grow. Most of all we want the other members
of this supposed partnership to obey the rules as scrupulously as we do.
The more contentious issues are those that Sun readers do not want. They do
not want to be dictated to by an unelected European Commission, which is run
by expatriate civil servants detached from domestic reality, and backed up
by an unelected, politicised European Court.
The issue is not whether sausages should be pink or cucumbers should be
straight. It is about the sovereignty of a British parliament to act on
behalf of a British electorate which can choose every five years, to kick
out the whole darned lot if it so wishes.
Sun readers have no desire for a common currency. They want a pound, just as
the French want a franc and the Germans want a D-Mark. Britons see no need
for an exchange rate mechanism that locks us to the currencies of countries
which, quite properly, put their interests before those of their
competitors.
Sun readers don't want political union in a Federal States of Europe. We
want to be British, not because we have a blinkered John Bull mentality, but
because we want to maintain our own traditions and values. Putting it
crudely, the British have nothing in common with the Greeks, just as the
Portuguese have nothing in common with the Danes.
When Ted Heath talked us into joining Europe 20 years ago, it was sold as
the Common Market. It was a place to sell our wares, not our souls. Slowly
our eyes are opening to the reality that the architects of the European
dream have a more sinister plan than we were led to believe. That is why The
Sun has derided Jacques Delors with front-page headlines like: 'Up Yours,
Delors]' That is why the Maastricht treaty fills us with suspicion, no
matter how much Mr Major protests its innocence and even irrelevance.
Britain has seen the way Europe twists the rules to suit itself. We know
about the Pounds 4bn fraud within the Common Agricultural Policy. We've seen
French farmers burn our lamb then drive off in tractors bought with
subsidies from the British taxpayers. We've seen our fish destroyed, our
apple crops crushed. Petty complaints in the scheme of world affairs, maybe,
but ones which come from the heart.
Twice this century, Britain has gone to war to bring peace to Europe. Among
our partners we detect few indications of a willingness to stand up and
fight for a cause that is just. We wish to retain our Nato and transatlantic
links that have stood us in such good stead. Can we trust the likes of the
Belgians, for example, who refused to supply ammunition for the Gulf War? We
won't have our foreign policy dictated by them or our armed services
answering to a Ruritanian defence union which would be more interested in
ducking the flak than fighting for a principle.
One final issue shines like a beacon. What Sun readers want most of all is
for their voices to be heard. They have been denied a referendum on
Maastricht for one good reason - politicians know that, despite support from
the three main parties, it would be defeated by we reckon at least 65-55 per
cent. So politicians should be warned. One day, Sun readers may get their
own back.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Letter: Contrary positions on energy expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW WARREN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The announcement by the World Bank at the Financial Times' Asian
Electricity conference ('Asia energy needs double', May 25) that it expects
Asia's energy consumption to double during this decade - with Dollars 500bn
being spent on new power generating capacity - coincides with your 'Power
Generation Equipment' supplement of May 25.
That supplement predicted a positive orgy for the power plant construction
industry, forecasting vast increases in construction around the world. To
quote at random: 'Power capacity additions in Asia are running at triple the
rate seen in the 1970s. China and Hong Kong will be adding 12-15 GW of new
power capacity every year for the rest of this decade - the equivalent of
Switzerland's entire installed power capacity.'
It is now precisely one year since the leaders of 150 nations gathered in
Rio for the Earth Summit. Each leader solemnly signed a commitment to seek
to stabilise the earth's climate, by ensuring a reduction in the amount of
carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere from energy consumption. Many of
those leaders came from precisely the same countries where such enormous
growth in energy demand is now being forecast so blithely.
It is not entirely clear to me how it is possible to endorse both positions.
Perhaps someone at the World Bank might care to try?

FT  01 JUN 93 / Visions of Europe: A basis for the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLF SCHMIDT-HOLTZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe is not yet a love story.
Neither for the Danes, nor for the British - for no-one. If anything, it is
an arranged marriage: love is declared, with due solemnity, in the set-piece
speeches of sanctimonious politicians.
For the people, on the other hand, Europe lacks contours. Complex and
indigestible, it has become a synonym for privileged bureaucrats, subsidised
farmers and the all-consuming desire for regulation down to the smallest
detail.
We see Europe as nothing but office complexes in Brussels and parliament
buildings in Strasbourg. We catch a glimpse of it, too, when heads of
governments run out of any other ideas for making visionary statements:
then, they turn to Europe. It is a wonderful and worthwhile objective, but
it can be misused.
When national governments blunder in the field of domestic politics, Europe,
they judge, is always to blame. Politicians see in Europe an always-flexible
tool, to be turned to any use that suits their momentary purpose.
Should we extend Europe to the east? Should we limit it just to the 'core'
countries? Should we try to establish a monetary union straight away?
All terribly important, to be sure. But, first of all, we must make sure
that Europe has its feet firmly on the ground. There has to be genuine
political co-operation in all relevant areas, including defence and foreign
policy. Europe has to be something more than simply a collusion of interests
between the merchants and the money-changers.
In its failures over Bosnia, Europe has presented a picture of disaster. We
must not and cannot allow this to happen again.
From a political point of view, Europe has not yet acquired morality; it
certainly has no countenance. For the moment at least, it has no strength.
Europe is suffering from a dramatic crisis of leadership: it risks losing
its backbone, in the same way that, in individual nations, shortcomings at
the top - in government, in big companies and in trade unions - are becoming
increasingly apparent.
We are, however, trapped by reality: for we must see that there is no
alternative to Europe. We are condemned to want it, condemned to assist in
its construction. No-one can believe that conflicts of the sort that we
witness in the former Yugoslavia cannot be played out elsewhere, in the
heart of Europe.
Not just in the Balkans, but, in truth, anywhere between Trieste and
Glasgow, war is possible.
People's yearning for orientation, their wish to make sense of and identify
with their circumstances and their environment, can lead, in troubled times,
to nationalism and radicalism.
In Europe, we have not yet overcome the rule of armed force. The dissolution
of the old power blocs of east and west makes it all the more vital that
Europe should be both strong and free from political and economic shocks.
Certainly, we need hard currencies; but even more, we need a definition of
what Europe is, demonstrable to its people and recognisable for the world
outside.
Some believe they do not need Europe; such people have already lost the
battle. Yet only illusionists believe they can have Europe and yet somehow
avoid argument and irritation in the years to come.
The people of Europe have no choice but to get their act together.
The Maastricht treaty provides a basis for this; it may be a bad one, but,
to make a start, it is sufficient.
Over time, the treaty may be seen as no longer reflecting the interests of
the members of the Community. If this happens, there is a way out: the
treaty will simply have to be changed]

FT  01 JUN 93 / Letter: Priority in former Yugoslavia is to impose sanctions
on Croatia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES JENKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Much commentary on Bosnia-Hercegovina and the former Yugoslavia focuses
on mistakes that may have been made in the past. There is little point in
this. However, there is a lot of point in trying to avoid mistakes in the
future.
At present there are two priorities. The most immediate one should be the
imposition of sanctions on Croatia. The behaviour of the single party
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) regime towards Bosnia-Hercegovina is, at the
present juncture, notably worse than that of the Socialist Party Serbian
regime, in that: (a) the aggression of the Herceg-Bosnian authorities
towards the Moslems is directed by the local branch of the HDZ, which is
organically linked to Zagreb; Mr Karadzic's Serbian Democratic Party is not
so linked to the Serbian Socialist Party; (b) the Serbian regime is at least
apparently making an effort to impose sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs.
This is not to suggest that there is any room to let up on sanctions on
Belgrade before it has genuinely isolated the Bosnian Serbs, but
international policy must be consistent and even-handed if it is to earn
respect. Moreover, most Moslems have already been ethnically cleansed from
Serb occupied areas, while on the contrary the Croat controlled areas, and
Croatia itself, include hundreds of thousands of Moslem refugees. Croatia's
collusion in the aggression and the cynical misinterpretation of the
Vance-Owen plan by the Croat Hercegovinans thus puts hundreds of thousands
of lives at risk. The West may feel that it has to work with Croatia to help
it cope with its refugees, but if they are not safe in Croatia, they will
inevitably escape in ever larger numbers, however unwelcome they are made to
feel. Even the most narrow and mean-minded western self interest would thus
justify a tougher stance towards Croatia.
Croatia is more susceptible than Serbia to being made an international
pariah, because its catholicism makes it feel that it should be a part of
western Europe. However, it is all too clear that the Croatian regime does
not react to diplomatic pressure on its own, if not backed up by the kind of
sanctions which would make it clear that Croat behaviour is unacceptable. If
sanctions are not imposed now, Croatia may allow itself to be dragged too
far into a deal to carve up Bosnia-Hercegovina with the Bosnian Serbs, ever
to be able to extricate itself.
The second priority is to reinforce existing UN forces in protecting safe
havens, to extend them to Moslem populations in Herceg-Bosnia, and to make
it clear that air attacks will be launched on any artillery endangering the
civilians and UN troops in the safe havens.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Letter: Opportunity for electorate to vote for Europe they
want
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTYN BOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Without being 'provocatively unconventional' allow me to complete Ian
Davidson's perceptive analysis of the implications of the Maastricht Treaty
('No more Maastrichts', May 24).
For all its faults, the treaty marks a considerable step forward in the
process of European integration, not solely by virtue of the policies
brought within its remit but also by virtue of new procedures it introduces.
Not the least of these are new powers given to the European parliament.
The co-decision procedure (in UK parlance often referred to as 'negative
assent') and the extension of the co-operation procedure beyond measures
strictly necessary for completing the Single Market are the two most
important examples. There is also the enhanced power of the parliament to
appoint special committees of inquiry and to empower an ombudsman to
investigate maladministration. Last, but not least, there is the new power
to endorse the appointment of the next Commission in January 1995. This vote
will be the more important as it will express the views of the majority that
emerges from the June 1994 European elections.
Ian Davidson argues for 'broader acquiescence' among the electorate to
legitimise the process of integration. Closer co-operation between the
European parliament and the parliaments of the 12 Member States - as
recommended in the Commons foreign affairs committee's recent report,
'Europe after Maastricht' - is one way. Elections next year are another
opportunity for voters to express their opinions about what sort of Europe
they want. Consent of the governed is expressed through national and
European parliaments.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The posters are obscurely proclaiming Juliet 4 Romeo, and there are some
ominous programme notes about the role of women. Do not be perturbed,
however; the English Shakespeare Company's Romeo and Juliet, sponsored by
IBM, turns out to be full of fun, not at all distorted and owes nothing to
West Side Story. It is one of the most enjoyable that I have seen. Freshness
abounds.
Michael Bognadov's direction works by an accumulation of small touches. For
examples, Julia Dearden's Nurse is young, attractive and very noticeably
Irish, which adds a playful element to a part sometimes played by a woman
too old. John Dougall's Mercutio is slightly Scottish with a fondness for
the national drink as well as the Italian wine. Friar John, who has barely a
couple of lines, seems to be Welsh.
Christopher Saul's Friar Lawrence is firmly Oxford English, but also young.
He rides an old-fashioned black lady's bicycle with a carrier basket in
front and oils the chain himself. The only villain in the piece is Colin
Farrell's Capulet whose English is pronouncedly north country and who thinks
he can tell his daughter what to do.
Peter Theiss's Tybalt is a tall, swaggering figure in purple trousers; the
novelty is that he has a blonde at his side to show off to - she smokes his
cheroot while he is handling his sword.
Such innovations continue. The fight scene is a wonderful mixture of
umbrellas, swords, punches and kicks, with a pause for a drink, but nothing
shocking. When Juliet wants to prevent Romeo from leaving at dawn, she hides
one of his boots under the pillow so that he has to touch her to retrieve
it. There is an unobtrusive media presence on the morning that Paris is
supposed to claim his bride. And when the Montagues and the Capulets are
finally reconciled, a press photographer quietly takes pictures.
The production is very simple. The ball scene is not spectacular, nor the
tomb scene at the end. Bognadov dispenses with the traditional balcony and
merely has Romeo on a perfectly safe pair of ladders while Juliet stands on
a table.
Unusually for our times, the sexual attraction between the lovers is not
explicitly played up. They embrace, of course, but their rapport could be
just as much cerebral as physical.
Capulet is the odd man out. Not only does he sound as if he made money out
of the industrial revolution; he is a bully and is none too gracious to his
wife, let alone Juliet. Yet even he joins in the remorse at the end.
For this is a production about basically nice people. There is not much
passion, but there is a lot of entertainment. The use of the torches in a
darkened theatre at the finish as the families of descend into the tomb is a
flash of theatrical brilliance. Equally clever is is the dropping of much of
the final scene where Friar Lawrence explains what has happened to an
audience that already knows.
Joe Dixon's Romeo and Joanna Roth's Juliet will go down as quiet lovers.
They have the compensation of knowing that they are part of a production
that provides great pleasure and does not overdo the melodrama. Maybe
playing up the fun is the right way to do it.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts: Il Pirata at St Etienne - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Etienne, a bustling city of medium size and no great visual distinction
about 30 miles south-west of Lyons, has developed for itself an enviable
reputation for fostering the arts. In musical terms, the hub of activity is
the Centre de Creation Lyrique, Musicale et Choregraphique - 25 years old, a
lively place whose activities have attracted a degree of attention and
interest disproportionate to the city's size and the centre's age.
Massenet, born in St Etienne, figures as the Centre's patron saint: the
biennial Massenet Festival, only a few years old, has already engendered
wave-making Massenet re-discoveries and recordings. The seasonal programming
of St Etienne opera reflects a similar vigour in artistic policy, with
interesting rarities dotted amidst the more conventional fare.
The choice of Bellini's Pirata (1827) to round out the current season was
typical: a work loved by Bellini devotees as a landmark in the development
of Italian Romantic opera, but still not entirely assured of its place in
the repertory. Callas, who inspired a famous 1950s Scala revival, left
unrivalled recordings, studio and 'private', of the heroine Imogene's long
final number, whose dreamy F major cantilena followed by stormy F minor
cabaletta can stand as one of the great confluence-points of bel canto vocal
writing and high-keyed dramatic situation.
As a break from all the ceremonies, celebrations and raging controversies of
the new Lyons Opera House (whose opening performances I reviewed last
weekend), a trip to St Etienne for the Sunday-afternoon Pirata matinee was
just the thing. The two theatres, the brand-new Lyons one and the 1960s-ish
St Etienne arts complex, could hardly be more different. Comfortless 1990s
high-tech glamour versus plain decoration, populist comfort and a theatre
accessibly wide in layout: on grounds of user-friendliness the smaller Midi
city wins every contest.
The Bellini performance, with two specialists - the tenor Rockwell Blake in
the title role, the soprano Lucia Aliberti as Imogene - at the head of the
cast-list, was carefully if sometimes too cautiously conducted by the St
Etienne musical director Patrick Fournillier (whose growing reputation as a
Massenite will next season be tested in the new Welsh National production of
Cendrillon).
Blake's tone may sometimes strike the ear unpleasingly, but his style and
presence (even in spite of panto-pirate get-up) are so cultivated and
convinced that one soon learns to tolerate passing drynesses of sound.
Aliberti, a technically ill-finished Covent Garden Lucia and Violetta not
long ago, has developed some way since then: the shadow of Callas still
falls heavy over her vocal manner and utterance, but no longer in a way to
suggest only immature mimicry.
Unfortunately, however, a very large fly was trapped in the afternoon's
ointment of bel canto pleasure: a production heavily burdened by the French
vogue for deconstructing operatic narrative - which now mostly seems to mean
reducing it to a rubbish-heap of modern-opera cliches. I wrote last weekend
of the new Lyons Tales of Hoffmann, removed to a mad-house; in St Etienne,
what went under the name of Il pirata was a time-travelling melange of
send-up Romantic opera and violent mad-house incident, with the hints of
concentration-camp guards and doctors to spice up various scenes.
In both shows, poverty of producer's inspiration got itself dressed up as
high-fashion experiment. But the question thus raised seems to me a rather
trickier one: at what point in modern-opera staging does representation of
human frailty and physical handicap become opportunistic, even salacious? It
would, of course, be both improper and, indeed, impossible to prescribe
precise boundaries of acceptable taste; nevertheless, both these productions
seemed to me to be worryingly out for kicks.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts: To the garden born - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to personal creativity I am sure that the majority of the
English respond to landscape design and the art of gardening much more than
they do to fine art or architecture. The English are very good at gardening
and, if this year's Chelsea flower show was anything to go by, they are
getting better at it all the time. But gardening is one thing; it is not at
all the same as garden design. Are the English today any good at garden
landscape?
Garden architecture was something easily comprehended by the Edwardians,
like Sir Edwin Lutyens in his partnership with Gertrude Jekyll. They
understood the links between the site and the house and the unifying
creativity of gardening. Today, in a world where everyone is a gardener, it
is fair to ask - is anyone a designer?
At Chelsea the Royal Horticultural Society opens its umbrella to shelter
that strange English phenomenon, 'the gardening world', which includes
amateur lady designers, professional plantsmen and highly qualified
horticulturalists. There is always a smattering of scientists and modicum of
municipalities with dendrologists and flower arrangers lurking between the
tent pegs. Much as I admire what is under the canvas of the giant marquee,
it is the series of small gardens outside that concern me, as examples of
the best of the garden designers' art.
I was struck by two distinctive but related facts at Chelsea this year.
Firstly, it is OK to be wild. To scatter the wild flower seeds liberally
wherever possible appears de rigueur, with meadows replacing lawns and
nature ever creeping closer to the house. Secondly, it is very much OK to be
picturesque - in your garden planning and in your planting. Colours are
softening, scent is back to attract the bees and butterflies, and there is
much less effort by growers to produce exotic blue roses or striped
daffodils. It is sophisticated, as always, to be simple.
There were several examples of this school of thought. The very best was the
most beautiful creation designed by Arabella Lennox-Boyd for her sponsors,
The Daily Telegraph. She brought young woodland to Chelsea in the form of a
grove of birches gathered around a stream. There is an island in the stream
and on it stands a ruined and weathered stone tower. The woodland is planted
with gunnera and arum lilies, but these relatively exotic plants grow from
the naturalised planting of periwinkle, Solomon's Seal and cranesbills.
There is a pleasing atmosphere of age and neglect: you are not certain what
has happened; has the wood encroached upon a garden, or has a garden spread
casually into the wood? There is wisteria and philadelphus almost reverting
to the wild. Arabella Lennox-Boyd understands that it is possible to create
a microcosm of enhanced nature as a garden.
It is nature that shows us how to design a garden, and we have to understand
the harmony that is possible between man and nature. I like the quotation
from the Sir George Sitwell, who spent his life enhancing nature: 'As the
years pass by and no rude hand disturbs the traces of her presence, nature
becomes more daring.' If nature was allowed to grow gently over the remains
of a Chelsea flower show, what a wonderful garden would be created]
The other garden I liked at Chelsea was a great contrast to Mrs
Lennox-Boyd's romantic wood. The Evening Standard commissioned a very young
designer, Daniel Pearson, to design a 'contemporary London garden'. He also
shares the current wish to bring wildness into the garden design equation.
He achieves this by stylising nature. There is a raised circle of grass and
buttercups around a small fountain. The flat roof of the house is planted
with grass and wild flowers, and the outdoor table has been planted with a
tablecloth of wild thyme. Pearson has a wonderful colour sense, using a
palette of blue and purple plants with grey slate for the paths. But the
idea of using mosaics as part of his decorative scheme has not worked: the
quality of their designs is inadequate and is overwhelmed by the sheer skill
and subtlety of Mr Pearson's plantings.
The idea of art imitating nature was also demonstrated at Chelsea by the
recreation of a part of the 1870 Pulham Rock gardens from the Rothschild's
Waddesdon Manor estate in Buckinghamshire. These remarkable Victorian
gardens with cliffs of artificial stone (an invention of Mr Pulham) and
waterfalls are being restored at Waddesdon by Julian and Isabel Bannerman,
who have brought a fragment of their work to Chelsea with the help of
Clifton Landscape and Design. Again nature triumphs, although the whole
thing is man made.
There was one other garden designer who takes nature as her theme. Julie
Toll brought sand dunes and the seaside to Chelsea with a sandy coastal
garden planted with all the appropriate wild flowers. Her natural scheme
again had the effect of making the more elaborate and cultivated gardens
look almost vulgar.
Good design is often about a return to the sources and Chelsea this year
offered several examples of designers who understand this principle. Great
English gardeners and landscape designers like Capability Brown and Humphry
Repton understood that nature is the source and inspiration. Man's
intervention has to be in harmony. This message has reached Chelsea - may it
spread to all garden centres.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts: Balanchine celebrated - Clement Crisp hails the New
York City Ballet season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Balanchine died in April 1983. Ten years on, his New York City Ballet
is mounting a Balanchine Celebration which will show no less than 73 of his
creations in an eight-week season. The scale of the enterprise, no less than
the importance of the ballets on view, is tremendous. Many of these works
are the bed-rock of the company; a few - because Balanchine replaced or
discarded pieces without qualm - have been rescued from the memories of
early casts after the passage of years. Balanchine's oeuvre consisted of
more than 400 dance-works; this season is both a retrospective and an
affirmation of identity by his heirs.
A decision was made that the festival's repertory should be shown
chronologically. The effect is stimulating. The ballets may be viewed as a
chain of artistic experience (and marvellous craftsmanship) which links past
and present. The range, the vitality, the unfailing felicity of Balanchine's
output - genius as technical expertise; inspiration as practicality - can
still take one's breath away, and at every performance still do. In six
performances during four days I saw 16 works made between 1946 and 1955. In
them Balanchine did everything with steps, from clothing music in plotless
dance (Concerto Barocco) to telling stories (La Sonnambula); from tickling
the palate with the happiest bravura (Minkus pas de trois) to evoking the
darkly numinous in Ivesiana and reshaping myth in Orpheus. In his recension
of Swan Lake he renewed the past; in Four Temperaments he made the classic
dance new for our time. And in everything he hymned the power of classicism
to ennoble human ability.
The significance of this season for the New York public is clear. As with
the recent Matisse show, they are given an illuminating survey of a great
master's work. Balanchine is unassailably the dominant choreographer of this
century. His working life in America - an exact half-century - made classic
ballet an American art, and he gave the danse d'ecole its truest and most
influential form for our time, developed logically from the Imperial Russian
traditions in which he had been reared. Marius Petipa's career in St.
Petersburg was the culmination and summation of 19th century ballet.
Balanchine's work in New York is a no less grand and definitive achievement
for us. Invited to America in 1933 by Lincoln Kirstein, and sustained in
everything thereafter by Kirstein's massive gifts and his determination that
classic ballet should have an American identity, Balanchine naturalised the
academic dance through a school, a company, and a repertory that dominates
the history of ballet.
And Balanchine still astonishes us - not just by the power of his genius,
but with the prodigality and ease of his inventiveness. (Like Saint-Saens,
he created without apparent effort - 'as easily as an apple-tree produces
apples'). A former member of his company told me how, in two months during
the winter of 1957/8, Balanchine was working on four ballets at the same
time, moving from studio to studio during the day, choreographing Agon (a
masterpiece of ballet in our century), Square Dance, Gounod Symphony and
Stars and Stripes, works as different in manner as they are in score (from
Stravinsky to Sousa, by way of Gounod, Vivaldi and Corelli). All are still
in performance.
The 16 ballets I saw showed Balanchine at the time he was building a
repertory to sustain his dancers and his audience as his company acquired a
permanent home at the City Centre in 1948. There were two happy
restorations. Bourree Fantasque is a loving response to Chabrier music, apt
in wit as in sentiment, and it was marvellously danced by Darci Kistler and
Damian Woetzel, Kyra Nichols and Erlends Zieminch. Haieff Divertimento
(named for its composer, Alexei Haieff) was a delicate piece that was long
thought lost. Carefully re-studied, it returns to the stage as a touching
view of youthful emotion, and is as gently delightful as it was in 1950 when
NYCB brought it to London on the company's first and memorably exciting
visit.
Major works - Concerto Barocco, Scotch Symphony, Ivesiana, Western Symphony,
the second act of Nutcracker - were well done, while Four Temperaments
remains, after 46 years, a work so prescient, so bold, that it is still
vastly more modern than the European flash-dance of today. Certain ballets
were unwisely cast. Orpheus lacked any focus because of the inexperience of
Nilas Martins in its title role; La Sonnambula and La Valse suffered from
unsuitable central performance, though in the former, Peter Boal caught
exactly the sudden fever of emotion that will destroy its poet hero.
A group of delicious small pieces - Balanchine's lollipops - were fetchingly
done. The Minkus pas de trois (the old trio from Paquita which Balanchine
made more difficult, pour encourager les autres) found Damian Woetzel happy
to dazzle us with diamond-cut beats and turns. The Sylvia pas de deux, the
iridescent Valse Fantaisie, its dancers skimming like dragonflies, looked as
delightful as ever. There were, though, two artists who dominated these
performances: Kyra Nichols and Darci Kistler. Kistler's stage identity is
youthfully radiant, grand. In Nutcracker she produced lustrous dancing,
touched with majesty. In Swan Lake her Odette was superb in scale; in
Concerto Barocco she inhabited the music, while in Bourree Fantasque's first
movement she and Damian Woetzel flirted wittily with the dance and with each
other.
Kyra Nichols is a classic ballerina of rarest distinction. She dances with
an absolute ease, entire denial of self, a musicality and an authority that
seem wholly natural and wholly convincing. Her roles acquire thereby a
simplicity that seems inevitable. Her style is generous, choreographic
beauty revealed through a dedication to the movement itself. Watching her,
you wonder why other ballerinas cannot be as true; and you know that Kyra
Nichols' genius lies in just this miraculous truth. Magisterial her art
certainly is, but also innocent, because so pure. She danced Scotch Symphony
with such sweetness, and such gentle dignity, that I longed to see her as
Bournonville's sylphide. In Swan Lake, which is Balanchine's fantasy on
themes by Ivanov, her account of Odette was marvellous in its grandeur of
scale as in its tragic dignity. And I do not know another dancer today whose
pas de bourree - that cascade of little steps that the old ballerinas said
should look like a string of perfectly matched pearls - is so exquisite or
so expressive.
From the company there came dancing strong, assured, and, for the most part,
exhilarating in dynamics as in sense of purpose. This celebration is very
important: through it, New York City Ballet examines and re-affirms its
glorious Balanchinian identity. And we rejoice.
The Balanchine Celebration continues at the State Theatre, New York, until
June 27. Leading benefactors are the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund
for Lincoln Center, and The Brown Foundation Inc

Occasionally a programme catches the public imagination even before it goes
out, and interest balloons in a disproportionate way. Often the subject is
connected, albeit remotely, with sex as is the case today with Giving The
Empire A Lift.
This half-hour programme on ITV (7.30pm) depicts a typical day at Rigby &amp;
Peller, the London corsetiere which makes brassieres for the Queen among
others. We are promised the confessions and fetishes of the company's
clients and a first-time fitting for a woman who discovers that, for years,
like many others, she has been buying bras that don't really fit.
Before that in BBC1's sequence of repeats, Wildlife 100 at 7pm shows the
memorable programme 'Twentieth Century Fox' which, in 1981 when most of us
were unaware of such things, showed the habits of urban foxes. Assignment
(7.45pm BBC 2) explores 'The Galician Connection': the route now taken by
Colombia's cocaine producers to ship drugs in to Europe via Galicia in
north-west Spain.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Cambodia poll row raises tension: Khmer Rouge guerrillas
renew killings amid election wrangling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION increased in Cambodia yesterday, after the government urged the
United Nations to stop announcing results of last week's election because of
'irregularities' and after Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked UN forces.
With nearly half the ballot papers counted, the communist government's
Cambodian People's Party and Funcinpec, the royalist opposition party, each
had about 40 per cent of the vote, according to the UN Transitional
Authority in Cambodia (Untac).
A balance between the CPP and Funcinpec is regarded as an ideal outcome by
most countries behind the 1991 Paris peace accord, which paved the way for
the UN-organised election.
Neither would be able to dictate the constitution because it must be
approved by a two-thirds majority in the new 120-member assembly, and the
two parties might even have to form a coalition government after the
constitution is set up. 'Cambodians have voted for national reconciliation,'
said a European diplomat.
But the CPP is unhappy about its failure to make a stronger showing in the
election. Mr Sok An, CPP spokesman, announced that the party and the
government had asked Untac to postpone the proclamation of results - to
which many Cambodians are listening avidly on Untac radio.
Mr Sok An and another government official who raised the matter yesterday
with Mr Reginald Austin, Untac election chief, were said by one Untac
official to be looking 'very worried and jumpy'. Mr Sok An said there had
been a number of irregularities, including Untac polling officers trying to
influence voting and reports of broken ballot-box seals.
Some seals have been broken in transit on Cambodia's rough roads, but Untac
insists no one has interfered with the ballot-boxes. Untac last night
rejected the CPP's request and said the announcement of results would
continue.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who signed and then rejected the 1991 peace accord
and made vain attempts to dissuade Cambodians from voting, appear to be
stepping up their military operations, Untac officials say.
A Uruguayan UN soldier was killed and three Uruguayan and Polish
peacekeepers were injured yesterday when suspected Khmer Rouge gunmen
ambushed two Untac vehicles in Kompong Cham province.
On Sunday night, 60 Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked and ransacked a market
in Kampot province and twice directed their fire at a French UN military
position, Untac said. Two Cambodians were reported killed. Both the French
in Kampot and the ambushed peackeepers in Kompong Cham fired back at their
attackers.
Untac announced at the weekend that Bangladeshi UN positions in northern
Cambodia had been shelled and that four civilians had been killed in Kampot
province in a grenade attack directed at ethnic Vietnamese playing cards in
a marketplace.
UN forces are due to remain in Cambodia for another three months. By then a
new government should be in place. In the meantime, Untac is on the alert
and its armoured cars patrol the streets of Phnom Penh at night.
A philosophical Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of Untac, responded to a question
about the future by quoting Mr Yogi Berra, the US baseball great. 'It ain't
over till it's over,' he said.

FT  01 JUN 93 / German managers come out on top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH managers think they are the best in Europe but this opinion is not
shared by their continental European competitors, according to a survey of
Europe's smaller companies, published today.
German managers and their companies are the most highly regarded by their
European competitors, though they are modest about their own achievements,
the survey showed. Researchers from Cranfield School of Management
questioned - on behalf of 3i, Britain's largest venture capital company -
just over 1,000 managers of companies employing up to 500 people.
Italian, British and Spanish managers think more highly of themselves than
does the rest of Europe, with the British convinced they are the best.
In the overall European ranking, French managers and their companies were
rated most highly, after the Germans, then the British, the Italians and,
last, the Spanish.
European managers were asked to rank themselves and their foreign
competitors on 12 characteristics. These included competence, reliability,
trustworthiness, humour, and ability to get on with others. Companies were
assessed on aspects such as market and product focus, customer service,
financial viability, and attention to law, ethics and the environment.

FT  01 JUN 93 / The FT Interview: Tough talk scores savage hits - Jose Mara
Aznar, leader of Spain's Partido Popular, talks to Peter Bruce and Martin
Wolf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 40 years of age, Jose Mara Aznar makes Felipe Gonzalez - still, after
John Major, the second youngest leader in the European Community - seem
stale and old. But cold and untainted youth is what Spaniards seem to
prefer. By next Monday, Mr Aznar may be forming a government.
He himself takes his victory in Sunday's general election for granted. 'The
only thing that is going to happen on June 6,' he says in a typically
clipped sentence. 'is that there will be a change in government and this
change will demonstrate that our democracy has matured.'
Political prospects are rather more interesting than that. As he admits, 'we
don't have much tradition of democratic function, so any change of
government in Spain might be more complicated'. Victory for Mr Aznar would,
in fact, mark the first time that power in Spain has passed peacefully from
left to right.
Leader of the conservative opposition Partido Popular since 1990, Mr Aznar
is a tax inspector by profession and, judged by his performance in this
campaign and the past three years of parliament, a political Rottweiler by
nature. There is nothing subtle or witty about the way he has attacked the
record of Prime Minister Gonzalez and his Socialist party in the past three
weeks. He has been insulting and rude, and is winning because of it.
The founder of the PP, Mr Manuel Fraga - one of the few Spanish politicians
to thrive both under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco and as a
democrat - plucked Mr Aznar from relative obscurity as premier of the
autonomous region of Castilla y Leon to be the PP's candidate in the 1989
elections. Conscious that his own Francoist past made it impossible for the
PP to win under his leadership, Mr Fraga had tried to find a young successor
before and had failed.
Mr Aznar was Mr Fraga's second choice. But his performance has justified his
patron's judgment. His savaging of Mr Gonzalez, almost a mythical figure in
Spain after 11 years in power, in a television debate last week was a shock
not only to the prime minister, but to the country. Spaniards love winners,
but they also love to see them torn down. Mr Gonzalez has been gravely
wounded.
Quiet and polite in private, Mr Aznar sticks to broad principles, avoiding
controversial policy prescriptions. 'The first duty of my government will be
to remake Spain,' he says, without revealing how, or even, why. A few days
later he tells a TV audience that 'I don't want to change everything. I want
to keep the good things that have been done.'
He is frustratingly vague. The suspicion is that this is because he has no
clear ideas, though it may also be because his best chance of winning is to
exploit the Socialists' disarray. After so many years gnawing away at the
same pole, it is falling over almost without warning. He does not know, he
says, exactly what he will do if he wins enough seats to form a government.
'We are going to do what the French did and do an inventory, an audit, of
the situation in which we find ourselves and then we will take action,' he
says. But 'we will keep the people informed - you have to tell Spaniards the
truth'.
Will he tell them the truth if he finds he has to raise taxes and not cut
them, as he is promising in his campaign?
'I want a recovery policy that does not depend on increasing fiscal pressure
on people, but I am prepared to make a big austerity effort and to save.'
But what if, as he and his colleagues have been charging, the economy and
particularly public finances are in much worse shape than the present
government's figures show?
If, instead of a 5 1/2 per cent public deficit we find a 9 per cent deficit,
we will have to tell the people and take action accordingly. But I can't say
now.'
With one eye on his role model, Mr Edouard Balladur in France, Mr Aznar says
he will try very hard to whittle down the size of Spain's public sector,
especially state holdings in industry. 'We are going to do two things;
first, draw up, internally, a complete list of privatisations and, second,
put in place transparent mechanisms to make privatisation possible.
'Our country needs to free up resources, first just to improve efficiency
but also to try, if possible, to reduce our public debt and our deficit,' he
said. 'I do not believe in public sector business and I am determined to
trigger a major reorganisation of public sector industry.'
Privatisation is one area where PP and Socialist policy diverges markedly.
The other is over a strike law, which the Socialist government wanted to
introduce, but which was sunk by the more left-wing party machine.
Dismissing charges that the PP is little more than a mouthpiece for big
business as 'idiotic', Mr Aznar says that 'Spain needs a strike law. I would
really like to be able to find a framework for a strike law that would be
above modification by whichever party was in power.'
To do that, though, he will need to talk to the unions. 'What is important
in any relationship with the unions is trust,' he says. 'We could not
possibly do any worse than the government and, anyway, historically in
Spain, centre-right governments have had a better dialogue with the unions
than the centre-left.'
Mr Aznar's tough campaigning tone can seem a front. Occasionally he will
even catch himself on the verge of saying something nice about the country,
before remembering he is in the middle of an election.
On foreign policy, he insists he has no hankerings for Francoist
isolationism and fully endorses the 'historic objective' of Spain to be in
Europe. But the government's 'enthusiasm' for all things European is not, he
argues, a substitute for domestic economic strength. If Spain is to be in
the first economic rank of Europe, it must be made more economically
competitive.
Spain, he asserts, is isolated now. 'What do you think isolates us from
Europe?' he asks. 'What isolates us from Europe are 3,300,000 unemployed
people, a public deficit of at least 5 1/2 per cent of gross domestic
product, the destruction of our industrial fabric. Everything else is just
words. The man responsible for this is Felipe Gonzalez. What this country
needs is a leader who shows his face to the frightened people hiding under
their tables. Mr Gonzalez is himself hiding away and would not dare show his
face.'
Mr Aznar sticks to discretion on all points. Does he, for example, differ
from Mr Gonzalez in enthusiasm for the Maastricht treaty. Not at all, he
answers, though he is more open to the idea of speedy enlargement than the
present prime minister. 'Europe is much more than just a market. It would be
logical to include the former Efta countries in the EC at once, but it would
be sad if enlargement led to any loss of the sense of union among EC
members.'
Where he is more cautious than Mr Gonzalez is on the EC's Social Charter.
'The objectives of the EC's planned social dimension are one thing. They are
satisfactory. But the possibilities of their application in Spain are
limited in the current circumstances.'
For now, his energies are focused on winning the election. If he is to
become prime minister, he will have to form a coalition with the Catalan and
Basque regional parties. Mr Aznar argues that this would not be a problem.
'They are conservatives, as we are,' he points out, 'and will do business
with whichever of us and the Socialists has the most votes'.
Yet they might wish to note Mr Aznar's authoritarian tendencies. Asked why
he has not yet named a finance minister, given that he felt he was going to
win anyway, he replies, amid guffaws, that it will not matter who his
finance minister is because whoever it is 'will do whatever I tell him to
do'. Future colleagues have been warned.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Smartest policy for Republicans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is going through a rough patch. But Republicans
are naive if they expect an easy presidential victory in 1996. The business
cycle favours the Democrats. So does the fall of communism, which has
removed an external threat that once served to unite right-wingers. Worse,
after the drift of the Bush years, the conservative movement lacks
definition. Instead of presenting a clear alternative to Clintonism, a
jumble of factions - ranging from born-again Christians to patrician
traditionalists and crypto-protectionists - are vying for influence.
If conservatives are to win political power, in the legislative as well as
executive branch, they need a new unifying vision. Yet after the political
gyrations of recent decades, it might seem that every possible 'ism' has
been tried, usually with disappointing results. In fact, there is one
philosophy that has never been consistently advocated - classical
19th-century liberalism. For some reason, politicians who advocate
laissez-faire economic policies usually favour conservative social policies.
Social liberals, on the other hand, nearly always advocate interventionist
economic policies.
The pattern is perfectly illustrated by Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.
President Reagan cut taxes and deregulated the economy but tightened
anti-abortion laws. President Clinton fights for gay rights yet wants to
raise tax rates and increase government intervention in the economy. There
is no mileage in Republicans attempting to outflank Democrats as economic
regulators. But suppose they favoured freedom in all spheres, social as well
as economic? Might this not be a winning combination?
A book* edited by Mr David Boaz and Mr Edward Crane of the Cato Institute, a
Washington think-tank, makes a strong case for precisely this combination of
policies. Cato scholars are usually regarded as card-carrying conservatives.
But Boaz and Crane chaff at the label, on the grounds that they are keener
on radical reform than almost anybody else, certainly than Democrats. They
would call themselves 'liberals', had American left-wingers not expropriated
that title. Since 'classical liberal' sounds rather backward-looking, they
have settled on 'market liberal' as shorthand for their political
philosophy.
'Market liberals have a cosmopolitan, inclusive vision for society. We
reject the bashing of gays, Japan, rich people and immigrants that
contemporary liberals and conservatives seem to think addresses society's
problems,' they write. The doctrine ought to be acceptable to a broad swathe
of Americans, they claim, because it represents a return to the principles
that guided the nation's founding fathers: personal freedom, limited
government, free markets and the rule of law. What could be more American or
more traditional than that?
The book, however, is not without shortcomings. One danger is that
mainstream readers will be put off by the sheer radicalism of its specific
policy proposals. Mr Boaz, for example, would tackle inner city problems by
abolishing most welfare payments, legalising hard drugs and breaking up
public-sector educational monopolies. These are logically defensible
positions but pretty hard for any politician to defend.
There is little discussion of the broader obstacles preventing governments
from pursuing policies that are consistently liberal in the 19th century
sense. Boaz and Crane assume that the typical human being is a free spirit
looking for fresh challenges. But what if most people are risk averse and
keen on a relatively easy life? The essence of market liberalism is that
government should stand back and allow individuals to make a success or
failure of their lives. Crucial to this philosophy is the belief that people
should be allowed to fail. But the modern state largely exists to prevent or
limit people's ability to fail by providing pensions, healthcare, housing
and numerous other services. The evidence suggests these welfare cushions
are extremely popular.
Another obstacle is the modern world's deep commitment to social justice.
The most powerful objection to the prescriptions of true market liberals -
be they cutting marginal tax rates, scrapping minimum-wage laws or making
schools compete for pupils - is that they are 'unfair'. In the short run,
some individuals would gain at the expense of others; in the longer run the
gap between different income groups might widen. To make electoral progress,
market liberals have got to bring about a fundamental shift in popular
conceptions of fairness, for example by persuading people to stop worrying
about gaps in relative incomes.
This seems more possible in the US than in most of Europe. Indeed, at least
one possible presidential contender in 1996, Mr William Weld, the highly
regarded Republican governor of Massachusetts, is publicly associated with
the socially progressive/economically tough approach championed by Boaz and
Crane. A tax-cutting defender of gay rights, he even cites Friedrich Hayek,
the late Austrian economist, as one of his intellectual heroes. If Mr Weld
sticks to his principles and remains popular, he may come to represent the
future for the Republican party.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Revolution reconsidered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By any prudent rule of thumb, revolutions are usually best avoided. They may
be exciting at the time, they may be inspiring later, but they are liable to
do much more harm than good. That's what my granny always said, so it must
be right.
History mostly backs her up. The French revolution was a national and
international calamity, and it is still not certain that France and Europe
have quite got over it. The Russian revolution was a direct descendant of
the French revolution, and no one is in any doubt of the scale of that
disaster, from which the Russians have yet to recover. Then there was the
Chinese cultural revolution. All in all, my granny's case seems pretty
conclusive.
And yet there are circumstances where what is needed is a total reform of
the whole system. Systems are by definition incapable of reforming
themselves from within; so if total reform is to take place at all, it must
be comprehensive, radical, and very fast - in short, a revolution. The
critical question, if the condemnation of history and my granny is to be
avoided, is whether such a revolution can be carried out without violence.
There are two places where this question may apply: Italy and Russia. In
Italy the conditions for transforming the corrupt political system have been
created from outside by the magistrates, who are keeping up the pressure by
arresting politicians and businessmen. But it is hard to shut out the idea
that last week's murderous car bomb in Florence may be an awful omen of just
how much may be at stake.
General system failure is much more comprehensive in Russia than in Italy.
But outsiders are perplexed to make sense of what is going on, because all
economists, east and west, and all governments, east and west, conspire to
tell us that the main issue at stake is economic reform.
That economic reform is a problem of enormous importance is not of course in
dispute. But there can be no doubt that by far the biggest issue is
political reform. Everyone knows the Russians are not doing too well on the
economic reform; but they cannot get the economics right because they are
not getting the politics right.
Ever since the Berlin wall came down, economic experts from east and west
have been arguing fiercely about the best way to make the transition from a
command to a market economy. 'Revolutionaries' said it should be fast and
radical; reformers said it should be slow and careful.
In theory, the revolutionaries have sold their case to the Moscow
government; in practice, the results so far have been pretty terrible, with
falling production, runaway money supply and rocketing inflation.
Critics say this seriously undermines the case for shock therapy. But Anders
Aslund from Sweden, who is a leading expert on Soviet and east European
economies, and also one of the leading advocates of shock therapy, thinks
there is a different explanation.
'The most conspicuously misunderstood part of the process of systemic change
in Russia', he says in a new report *, 'is the role of democratisation. . .
. In order to pursue any kind of change of economic system, or even run a
state, certain powers are required. . . . The best means for this purpose
was democratization.
'The key problem is that Russia has only had properly democratic
presidential elections. . . . Thus, stalled democratization is in fact the
major source of the economic failures to date.'
The Aslund analysis makes clear that the situation is much worse than a
simple stand-off between President Boris Yeltsin and a conservative
parliament, which thus prevents economic reform. On the contrary, the
tension between them is itself creating massive inflation and generating
systemic corruption and theft on a heroic scale.
First, the parliament demands inflationary expansion of bank credits to keep
state enterprises afloat. Second, the vast gap between inflation and
interest rates gives those with borrowing power (that is, the former
communist establishment) a great incentive to speculate in commodities.
Third, the remaining price controls on energy, raw materials and metals,
holding them well below world prices, create another a large incentive to
speculate, smuggle and steal.
'To judge from conversations with well-informed businessmen and government
officials', says Aslund, '10 to 20 per cent of the oil and at least
one-third of the metals exported from Russia in 1992 were smuggled out of
the country. Naturally the revenues from these sales stayed in bank accounts
abroad.' He estimates this capital flight at 'billions' of dollars.
Some people deplore the low level of foreign investment, especially in the
oil industry, which they explain by generally chaotic trading conditions.
But there is a more important reason - oil smugglers have no incentive to
accept foreign partners, who would stop their game.
Aslund's conclusion is that Russia still needs economic shock therapy. But
the prequisite for any strategy must be rapid democratization, because that
is the only way to break the power of the old nomenklatura.
The French revolution started with a debate on the bankrupt finances of the
state. The revolutionaries responded by issuing paper money on a vast and
rising scale. They tried to deal with the resulting inflation by price
controls. The consequence was famine. This led in turn to the terror.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets Bundesbank caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUNDESBANK council mem-bers have been hawkish in recent days about the
prospect for more German interest rate cuts, and that theme is likely to
continue this week, writes James Blitz.
There are now few expectations of the Bundesbank easing official rates at
its council meeting on Thursday.
Given the recent jump in M3 money supply growth, stubborn cost-of-living
inflation and the deterioration in public sector finances, the Bundesbank is
likely to be very cautious about its rate-cutting policy over the next few
weeks.
The release of indicators of west Germany's real economy in the next few
days should show signs of weakness in both industrial output and
manufacturing new orders - and this is likely to raise new questions about
how long the Bundesbank can keep monetary policy as tight as it currently
is.
However, Ms Ruth Lea of Mitsubishi Bank in London believes it is possible
that the rate of decline is now slowing down as Germany's export industries
are helped by growth in the US and by signs of green shoots in the UK.
Sterling weakened sharply in the wake of the cabinet reshuffle in the UK
last week, and dealers will be watching for any continuation of this trend.
Although the pound's weakness was mainly due to flows into the D-Mark, a
dealer said 'the rudderless feel' in UK economic policy meant that sterling
was being tossed around amid the turbulence in European currencies.
As ever, the non-farm payroll report in the US, due out on Friday, will be a
key indicator of the direction of the US economy and the dollar.
James Capel, based in London, is expecting a net rise of 115,000 in May's
headline figure.

FT  01 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Canada and Brazil gain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TORONTO managed to end on a firm note after a lacklustre, featureless
session kept drab by the closure of US markets, for the Memorial Day
holiday, and also most European bourses, for Whitsun.
The TSE 300 index put on 16.2 at 3,882.7 and rises outscored declines by 388
to 305 after volume of 37.3m shares. There were no significant changes among
the sub-groups, with 11 higher and three lower.
SAO PAULO rose 2.5 per cent initially, assisted by demand from mutual funds
squaring positions ahead of the end of the account. The market slipped back
later to leave a 1.4 per cent net gain, the Bovespa index closing 513 ahead
at 35,406. Investors continued to focus on talks being held between Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the economy minister, and political leaders on
ways to cut the budget.

FT  01 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan marks time awaiting Fiat
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST bourses were shut for the Whitsun holiday, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN, which had only just absorbed Friday's disappointing results from
Montedison, awaited Fiat's 1992 figures, which were expected after the close
of business.
While most forecasts were for Fiat to announce a cut in its dividend for
1992 - estimates varied between a reduction of L80 and L150 from the 1991
dividend of L230 - some analysts commented that anything worse was likely to
lead to overall selling in the market today.
Fiat ordinary shares were L20 higher at L5,880, before slipping to L5,750 on
the kerb. The savings and privileged shares fell respectively by 2.5 per
cent and 3.6 per cent.
The Comit index ended 0.46 easier at 538.99. Montedison was fixed L25 lower
at L1,105 as a 30 per cent rise in first-quarter turnover helped to offset
the negative impact of a 1992 loss of L1,244bn.
Meanwhile, Ferruzzi, the holding group of Montedison, picked up L13 to
L1,076: it had reported a loss of L1,519bn after Friday's close.
Some brokers noted that investors had taken account of the conglomerate's
decision to seek outside shareholders in an effort to reduce debt.
Other gainers on the day included Stet, up L16 to L3,092, and Sip, ahead L20
at L1,976. Generali rose L80 to L36,780 but Olivetti lost L33 to L1,327.
In the banking sector, Credito Italiano advanced L59 to L2,974 and Banca
Commerciale Italiana put on L90 at L5,621.
MADRID's general index fell 1.58 to 257.19, one week before the June 6
general election. In London, Mr David Roche, global strategist at Morgan
Stanley, was inclined to believe that the fortunes of the Partido Populare,
rivalling the socialist incumbent led by Mr Felipe Gonzales, were looking up
ahead of last night's televised debates between the party leaders.
Looking at a number of post-election scenarios last Friday, Mr Roche said an
outright victory by the PP could lead to a push for growth, the float of the
peseta outside the ERM and a dramatic reduction in interest rates.
HELSINKI was quiet and the Hex index slipped 2.5 to 1,211.4 as turnover
dropped to FM97.8m from Friday's FM173.7m.
Some brokers observed that investors were awaiting interim reports, which
start to be published from tomorrow.
TEL AVIV's Mishtanim index retreated 2.45, or 1.2 per cent, to 203.34
following last week's gains, particularly in the banking sector.

FT  01 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): New highs on Pacific Rim
as Nikkei declines
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES over a higher yen and corporate insolvency troubled investors, and
share prices declined by 1.4 per cent on futures-linked arbitrage selling,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average surrendered 291.34 to 20,552.35, after opening at the
day's high of 20,829.54 and recording a low of 20,516.82 in the final hour
of trading. Dealers said the index remained vulnerable to arbitrage-related
selling ahead of the June futures settlements on June 11.
Trading remained quiet owing to the lack of foreign participants as most
stock and foreign exchange markets in the US and leading European countries
were closed yesterday. Volume totalled 350m shares, against Friday's 552m.
Falls led advances by 728 to 317, with 141 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated for the first time in
five trading days, losing 18.22 to 1,636.60.
Reports early in the session that Hanix Industry, a construction machinery
manufacturer listed on the over-the-counter market, had filed for court
protection prompted light selling. The Japan Securities Dealers Association
suspended trading in Hanix.
Teikoku Data Bank, a private credit company, said the group's total debt
amounted to some Y170bn. While traders said the news affected sentiment
during the day, they do not expect the effects to last.
Some exporters were out of favour due to the higher yen. Nissan Motor fell
Y19 to Y746, Honda Motor Y30 to Y1,330 and Fujitsu Y15 to Y755.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shed Y12,000 to Y965,000. Nippon Steel lost
Y4 to Y400 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y4 to Y713.
Banks were also lower on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y50
to Y2,880 and Mitsubishi Bank relinquished Y30 to Y2,740.
Shintom, an audio and video equipment manufacturer, moved ahead Y16 to Y756
on weekend reports that it would shut down all of its domestic plants and
shift production to south-east Asia.
Meanwhile, individual investors sought quick profits in speculative
favourites. Clarion rose Y23 to Y630 and Morinaga Milk advanced Y15 to Y720.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 206.54 to 22,906.22 in volume of 15.1m
shares. The index lost ground for the first time in seven trading days on
profit-taking amid low volumes.
Roundup
PROFIT-TAKING pulled Hong Kong and Singapore lower, and Kuala Lumpur was
closed for a holiday, but there was plenty of movement elsewhere.
SEOUL closed sharply higher in brisk trading, the composite index reaching
its best level since August 1991 as buying interest spread to highly
capitalised shares.
The composite index climbed 13.56 to 752.31 as turnover reached Won928.1bn,
compared to Won575.4bn during Saturday's half-day session.
The day's strongest performers were financial issues, including banks and
securities houses.
Boram Bank appreciated Won600, the day's limit, to Won12,900, while Koram
Bank advanced the same amount to Won13,400. The shares were supported by
market rumours of capital increases.
Securities houses, meanwhile, gained between Won200 to Won400 per share on
active buying by institutions.
Among large-capitalisation manufacturers, Daewoo Electronics rose to the
day's ceiling, ending Won600 higher at Won15,200, and Gold Star gained
Won500 at Won16,100.
JAKARTA also hit a 1993 peak, the JKSE index adding 4.48 at 341.85 on
bullish foreign and domestic sentiment. Indah Kiat jumped Rp200 to Rp1,700
in heavy volume on speculation about higher first-quarter earnings.
BANGKOK saw bank shares sold as foreigners reduced their weightings in the
sector. The SET index ended 10.32 lower at 825.71 in turnover of Bt1.87bn.
The banking sector index fell 1.8 per cent. Bangkok Bank slipped Bt3 to
Bt119, Thai Farmers Bt2 to Bt82.50 and Siam Commercial Bt2 to Bt126.
AUSTRALIA was notable for some interest in gold exploration issues, although
most of the gold mining sector declined and the broader market fell.
Hopes of an interest rate cut were dashed by a wider than expected current
account deficit for April, and the All Ordinaries index closed 23.0 lower at
1,737.4.
A decline in the bullion price from Dollars 381.50 to Dollars 379.25 an
ounce left the gold shares index 52.4 down at 1,946.5.
However, Central Norseman Gold jumped 24 cents, or 42 per cent, to 81 cents
after announcing that exploration drilling indicated gold intersections
throughout quartz layers .
HONG KONG fell back as investors took profits after a strong performance
last week. The Hang Seng index slipped 25.72 to 7,372.19 in thin turnover of
HKDollars 4.42bn.
NEW ZEALAND weakened across the board as the NZSE-40 index lost 12.65 to
1,637.51. TAIWAN reflected a similar situation as the weighted index fell
27.47 to 4,267.90.
MANILA was led down by the continued sell-off of Manila Electric 'A' shares
on worries about the national power sit-uation, the composite index giving
up a further 8.69 to 1,588.76.
BOMBAY rose on short-covering, the BSE index finishing nearly 37 higher at a
preliminary 2,202.

FT  01 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Istanbul pauses after record-breaking
performance - Robust economic growth and planned share issues provide the
incentive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Istanbul stock exchange has been outperforming other emerging markets
for much of 1993. Continued robust economic growth, coupled with signs that
companies are preparing to float new stock, has pushed the market to new
heights.
With just 146 companies listed, the index closed 3.4 per cent up on Friday
at 8,375, the last day of trading before a week-long holiday. In the IFC
index of emerging markets, Turkey is the clear leader, showing a gain of 79
per cent in dollar terms since the start of the year.
However, following Mr Suleyman Demirel's election as president earlier this
month, after the death in April of President Turgut Ozal, and with the
centre-right True Path party (DYP) due to choose a new leader to head the
coalition government at a special congress on June 13, brokers anticipate a
spate of profit-taking before the market settles at new levels.
On the economic front, one worry is inflation: after hitting 4.4 per cent in
April, the monthly figure is expected to rise further in May to between 6
and 7 per cent after a series of price increases in government-controlled
monopolies of petrol, tea and aluminium. External support for the Turkish
reform effort has also been dampened by the decision of Standard &amp; Poor's,
the credit agency, to downgrade Turkey's rating to BBB minus.
For all that, figures on industrial production suggest that the economy will
equal, if not better, last year's 5.9 per cent growth rate, higher than any
other country in the OECD. Moreover, interest rates have come down,
encouraging new investment and helping to reduce the high levels of
liquidity suffered by the banking sector.
In a further sign of market confidence, the government's privatisation
agency, the Public Participation Administration, which handles state sales
to the public, has been offloading stock. Brokers confirm that the PPA has
been a seller of Tofas, the Fiat local car assembly company, 22 per cent of
which is due to be sold by public offering later this year.
The PPA was also a seller of Netas, the telephone equipment manufacturer now
51 per cent-owned by Northern Telecom, of Canada. The PPA was taking
advantage of increased public demand for the stock, which is currently
trading at around twice the issue price when the PPA floated a 20 per cent
stake in March.
Output of both cars and cement, two of the favoured sectors, continues to
grow. Otosan, the local Ford collaboration producing a range of commercial
vehicles, reported production up sharply in April - a good indicator of
general economic activity. Cement companies such as those at Mardin and
Adana, in Turkey's south east, are attracting interest in anticipation of
construction demand on both the new Birecik dam and the irrigation network
for the vast south-east Anatolian Project.
Brokers report some profit-taking in Ege, the beer stock, currently on a p/e
ratio of 22 times earnings compared with a market average of 7 times.
What is more encouraging is that, at last, brokers discern a pick-up in the
pace of new issues, vital if the market is to sustain these heights. For
example, Aktas, an electricity utility in Istanbul, has recently announced
plans to float stock, while the local Lee Cooper subsidiary is also
considering an initial public offering.
With interest rates falling, government paper, hitherto the main attraction
for investors, has lost some of its allure, and banks, the largest buyers,
are switching into equities. Such was the lack of interest that last week's
Treasury bill auction was cancelled.
The new portfolio strategy has been driven by legislative changes,
encouraging banks and trading houses to switch funds into equities. Under
the reforms, introduced last December, long term investment funds, with at
least 25 per cent of their portfolio in equities, will only have to pay a 10
per cent withholding tax.
For companies setting up new funds, investment income is tax deductible.
Koc, Turkey's largest company involved in car assembly with Fiat, and the
dominant player in consumer electronics and retail gas markets, has launched
three new funds, each with a portfolio of TL500bn (Dollars 49m).
Brokers estimate that TL10,000bn is currently under fund management by
various institutions in Turkey. If just a quarter of that is attracted to
the stock exchange, the effect could be dramatic.

FT  01 JUN 93 / US Money and Credit: Dollar slides amid inflation jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DATES June 11 and June 15 are emerging as key tests of the US credit
markets, whose jitters over inflation have been exacerbated by a continued
slide in the dollar over the past week.
The two dates will see the release of the May producer and consumer prices
indices respectively and the markets are anxiously waiting to see whether
the statistics will continue the upturn in inflation which characterised the
first four months of the year.
There is a widespread belief on Wall Street that a really poor consumer
price index report, a rise of 0.4 per cent or more, would trigger the first
tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in four years, though
few analysts expect the figures to be anywhere near so bad.
Yet such a move would risk undermining what remains a very subdued US
economic recovery, as underlined last Friday by revised first-quarter GDP
figures, showing a rise of just nine tenths of 1 per cent, half the 1.8 per
cent originally estimated.
One television report last Thursday, based on apparent leaks from the Fed,
suggested that at the May 18 meeting of its policy-making Open Market
Committee the bank voted nearly unanimously to bias its policy towards
tightening credit conditions.
There may, however, be an element of artful politics in all this. The Fed
could have leaked news of its inflationary vigilance to calm the markets and
thus obviate the need to actually tighten.
But Wall Street's nervousness stems also from factors which are beyond the
central bank's control. One is the persistent rise in the price of gold,
which many regard as a harbinger of inflation.
Another is the decline of the dollar, which last week sank to a new low
against the Japanese yen, despite heavy Fed intervention in the money
markets, amid the persistent belief among traders that the Clinton
administration wants to ameliorate America's trade deficit with a cheap
dollar.
The government denies this, but the currency's slide has nonetheless
unsettled the credit markets. This is partly because it reduces the
attraction of dollar denominated investments and partly because it tends to
stoke inflation.
A third element of concern is the fate of the White House's tax-raising,
deficit-reducing budget package, which acted as a positive force on the
credit markets in the first few months of the year. But that was before the
Clinton administration demonstrated difficulty in getting its programmes
through even a Democratic-dominated Congress.
The budget package was approved by the House of Representatives late on
Thursday night, but with barely a vote to spare. It faces an even tougher
ride in the Senate, where conservative Democrats object to key features of
the plan, notably its energy taxes.
All these factors combined to create a volatile market last week, with a
substantial flattening of the yield curve. The short end of the market was
worst hit, with the yield on the new two-year Treasury note jumping from
4.17 per cent at auction last Tuesday to 4.24 per cent at Friday's close.
The long end of the market actually rallied on the week, partly due to
technical factors, but also to the signals of Fed inflationary vigilance,
with the benchmark 30-year issue ending the week with a yield of 6.98 per
cent, down from 7.04 per cent seven days earlier.
But for all the market's jitters, a much more positive spin can be put on
current conditions. The slow growth of the economy suggests the inflationary
bubble of the past few months cannot be sustained, while the Senate's
passage of a compromise Clinton package could do much for market sentiment.
Mr Henry Kaufman, the economic consultant whose opinions swayed the markets
back in the early 1980s, even stuck his neck out last week and predicted the
Fed would ease credit conditions again, possibly in July, amid sluggish
growth and subsiding inflation.

FT  01 JUN 93 / UK Gilts: Mood brightens in wake of auction success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK'S auction marked the switch to a more bullish view of the UK gilt
market.
The difference in sentiment compared with the sombre mood surrounding
April's auction was characterised in this way by Mr Chris Anthony, economist
at UBS: 'Last time, the economic data was strong, the pound was not doing
very well and there had been a downgrade of expectations on interest rates.'
Each of those factors looked different on Wednesday, although Thursday's
Cabinet reshuffle caused the pound to stumble.
On the economic front, the stream of relentlessly good news which increased
fears of inflation a few weeks ago has diminished. Last Friday's
announcement of a fall in the headline inflation rate to a mere 1.3 per cent
confirmed a more sanguine view, for this year at least.
Encouraging figures on unit labour costs and slower earnings growth have
also been seized on as the mood has veered towards optimism.
Even before Mr Kenneth Clarke became chancellor, sparking off speculation
about an interest rate cut, economists were saying pessimism on that front
had been overdone.
Forecasts that the base rate would come down from 6 per cent to 5 1/2 or 5
per cent by the end of the year remained common among both gilt-edged market
makers and fixed-income fund managers.
The theory is that signs of a faltering economic recovery plus lower
continental interest rates will allow a cut in the UK later this summer,
without undermining the pound.
Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at Greenwell Montagu, said speculation about a
rate cut 'fits in with the debate about funding. It will benefit the short
end of the curve and there is also speculation that the next issue will be
in the three to four-year area'.
Falling yields at the shorter end will steepen the yield curve, which is
seen as necessary to facilitate funding of the Pounds 50bn public sector
borrowing requirement.
Some economists believe this process will also involve an increase in yields
at the longer end to make issues in that area sufficiently attractive to
investors.
One economist forecast that yields on 20-year stock might have to rise from
the current level of about 8.5 per cent to 8.75 - 9 per cent.
He predicted that concerns about the pick-up in inflation would coincide
later this year with funding fatigue, bringing most pressure to bear at the
long end.
But views about that end of the market vary considerably, reflecting
divergent schools of thought on the inflation outlook.
One fixed income fund manager said the longer end looked attractive 'because
we are sanguine about inflation'. The forecast he was working to was 2.5 to
2.75 per cent for this year and less than 4 per cent - the ceiling on the
government's target - in 1994.
Views on whether or not that ceiling will be breached distinguish the 'oh
no, here we go again' school of inflation pessimists (or realists as they
would see themselves historically) from the 'it will be different this time'
optimists.
In terms of the attractiveness of gilts over the next few weeks, there is
more consensus and it tends to be positive.
An important part of this is the foreign interest being shown in the market,
one of the factors behind the auction's success.
Mr Chris Dillow, economist at Nomura, said the attractions to overseas
investors included the relatively weak currency, especially against the yen,
and the yield spread over other large bond markets.
In the 10-year benchmark area the yield spread over German bunds has
increased from less than 100 basis points in early April to more than 120.
The improvement in value compared with the French OAT is even more striking.
The difference has soared from less than 20 basis points in mid-February to
well over 80.
As Mr George Magnus, economist at SG Warburg, said last week, 'the big down
move from mid-March to a few days ago has been completed'.
The question is how long will the new upbeat mood last?

FT  01 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: High-yielding European markets attract
attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE again, the high-yielding European government bond markets are
attracting dealers and investors who expect bond yields in countries such as
Italy, Spain and Sweden to decline gradually towards the levels seen in
Germany.
Spain and Italy were the top-performing government bond markets in May in
local currency terms, with returns of 5.18 per cent and 2.86 per cent
respectively, according to Kemper Investment Management, which monitors the
performance of a wide range of bond markets.
By contrast, Germany showed a return of 0.08 per cent, with only Japan
(-0.37 per cent) and the US (-0.41 per cent) turning in a worse performance
for the month in local currency terms.
The Spanish bond market benefited from the peseta's devaluation within the
European exchange rate mechanism and the subsequent interest rate cuts.
But high-yielding markets in general were spurred on by the expectation that
Denmark would ratify the Maastricht treaty when it held its second
referendum on May 18 - an assumption which in the event turned out to be
correct.
Bond market participants noted widespread switching out of German bunds into
the high-yielding bond markets before the Danish referendum as investors
hoped to gain from a rally in these markets.
Even though there has been some profit-taking, many economists remain
optimistic about the prospect for the high-yielding bond markets and
continue to recommend switching out of Germany and into the Spanish and
Italian markets.
'There's a lot of confusion about what the Bundesbank is up to at the
moment,' says Mr Mark Brett, economist with BZW. 'People are revising their
growth forecasts for Germany downwards, yet the Bundesbank is dragging its
heels over cutting interest rates because the money supply data is still
poor.'
Mr Nigel Rendell, economist at James Capel, believes the Bundesbank has cut
interest rates too fast, adding that the recent cuts 'are not justified by
the economic fundamentals'. The uncertainty over Germany is encouraging many
investors to look to the high-yielding European markets instead.
'The best value is still in the high-yielding markets,' says Mr Malcolm
Butler, economist at UBS, pointing to Italy and Sweden.
Mr Butler says that for risk-averse investors, the main part of their
portfolio will probably consist of the hard-core currencies because he
believes that Germany is unlikely to weaken further. But he urges less
risk-averse investors to buy the high-yielding markets because of the
likelihood that yield spreads over Germany are set to narrow.
Even though the peseta saw a sell-off last week and could still suffer ahead
of the Spanish general election on June 6, economists point out the bond
market is likely to be buoyed by hopes of aggressive interest rate cuts.
'We think the peseta will suffer more in the run-up to the election . . .
but bondholders need not panic. An even lower peseta accompanied by lower
money rates are just pre-requisites for a sustained bond rally,' according
to SG Warburg Securities.
Mr Kermit Schoenholtz, director of Economic and Market Analysis at Salomon
Brothers, recommends that investors concentrate on the short and
intermediate maturities rather than long-dated bonds.
'Interest rates will be coming down in most of continental Europe - in
Italy, Sweden, Spain and Denmark - so the short and intermediate sector of
the yield curve is more attractive,' he says. 'A great deal of convergence
has already occurred, and we expect to see short-term rates coming lower and
staying lower.'

FT  01 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Shorter settlement period finds favour
with firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROBOND market is preparing to move from a standard settlement period
of seven days to one of two or three days for most trades. This followed a
proposal by the board of the International Securities Market Association at
its annual meeting on Friday in Copenhagen which found support among member
firms of the Eurobond market's trade association.
Mr John Dowsett, deputy chairman of ISMA's market practices committee, said
the switch will not pose technological problems, since the settlement date
on trades had never been automated.
This is because in practice there is considerable variation in the time
taken to settle Eurobonds. Many London-based houses already settle a large
proportion of trades in two days, to tie in with the standard settlement
period for many domestic government markets, money market instruments and
foreign exchange transactions.
The changeover is expected to generate savings for banks and securities
houses and clearing houses. With shorter settlement banks will need to hold
less capital in order to meet regulatory requirements.
Shorter settlement will help reduce the level of systemic risk (the risk
that the inability of one institution to meet its obligations when due will
cause other institutions to fail) counterparty risk and market risk (by
reducing the period of exposure to the client and the market).
The number of failed trades should fall. According to ISMA members, some
clients do not instruct the clearing systems until one or two days before
settlement is due, so that any discrepancies do not come to light until the
settlement date.
'With all my years in the business I have yet to make money from a trade
dispute,' Mr Dowsett said.
The only obvious losers will be the individual retail investors who like to
hold physical certificates. These investors were once the bedrock of the
Eurobond market, but the process of institutionalisation in the past 10
years means that this type of investor, commonly referred to in the market
as 'the Belgian dentist', is now a dwindling force for most banks and
securities houses.
The pattern of investment in Switzerland, where many individual investors
once bought small amounts of Eurobonds, has changed dramatically.
In the past few years, most large Swiss banks have split their retail and
institutional placement more strictly and are now channelling investors with
relatively small amounts of savings into collective investments.
The reason is simple: as bid/offer spreads in the Eurobond market declined,
large banks and trading houses became unwilling to deal in small sizes.
Only in Belgium and Luxembourg does pure retail business still represent a
substantial portion of the market. However, representatives of Belgian banks
at the ISMA meeting were placated by assurances that they would still be
able to settle trades with retail investors on a seven-day basis.
ISMA will now set up a taskforce to address the issue, consisting of
regulators, fund managers, global custodians, and the two Eurobond clearing
houses, Euroclear and Cedel, as well as ISMA representatives.
The changeover could be as much as three years away, but 'a realistic
timescale should allow implementation by January 1995,' said Mr Dowsett, who
presented the proposal to ISMA member firms at the meeting.
Before Friday's meeting, Mr John Langton, ISMA's chief executive, had
warned: 'I believe that the change to shorter settlement periods will take
place. Domestic markets are already moving to shorter cycles and I am
convinced that if we do not drive the change in the international markets
ourselves, then we will be driven by forces we are unable to influence.'
Also at the ISMA meeting, the ISMA board announced a joint venture with the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange (ASE), in the form of a new link between the two
markets.
A mutual line facility will allow direct confirmation of trades via TRAX,
ISMA's trade-matching system, and access to bid-offer prices from the
interdealer broker (IDB) in Amsterdam, which quotes prices in the market.
In addition, the ASE will promote the use of Trax in The Netherlands for
cross-border transactions. 'Because the (Dutch) market is such a liberal
one, without restrictions on movement of capital into or out of the country,
it makes an ideal environment for cross-border trading,' said Mr Roy
Lambert, managing director of ISMA.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Risk and Reward: A model approach to underwriting fees in
rights issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE risks in underwriting positions justify the fees charged to companies in
rights offerings? Surely, with underwriting fees immutably fixed at 2 per
cent of the capital raised, regardless of the quality of the issuer,
something must be out of line.
Certainly, the Office of Fair Trading has mused over this point. Last year,
it announced an inquiry into underwriting fees and has still come to no firm
conclusions.
However, it has asked Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School to
update a 1980 study into the profits earned by underwriters in rights
offerings.
Swiss Bank Corporation, meanwhile, says it has a technique for evaluating
the risks in an underwriting position which can more clearly demonstrate
where the pricing must be.
The model uses a derivatives approach to understanding a rights offering and
breaks the deal down into a series of put and call options.
Mr Brian Keelan, executive director at SBC, says that in a rights offering,
underwriters are simply selling companies a put option - the option to put
the shares to them at a given price - and issuing a call option to other
investors to call for the shares at a set price.
By studying the historic volatility in a given company's share price, it is
possible to determine whether or not the 2 per cent underwriting fee is
generous for the risk accepted or too stingy. Such analysis, which relies on
a Black Scholes model, is used to evaluate the pricing of other equity
options.
It was just such an approach that led SBC to make its controversial
intervention in an offering of enhanced scrip dividends by BAT, an offering
which had been designed by Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Those dividends, designed to help BAT cut its bill for advance corporation
tax, gave investors the choice of a cash payout or a payout in new shares
having a value 50 per cent above the cash option.
And for those who did not wish to keep the extra shares, BZW offered to buy
them, with no transaction costs, at 5 per cent below the market price
determined by the average of three days closing prices.
But SBC, using its derivative model, said it found 5 per cent far too
generous to the underwriter and realised it could still do the deal
profitably by repurchasing the shares at only a 2 per cent discount.
SBC said it used the technique to evaluate a rights offering by Trafalgar
House last February and concluded the pricing offered was generous. SBC had
earlier used an options model to help its client, Hong Kong Land, build a
stake in Trafalgar House so it had already researched the historic
volatility in the company's share price.
An SBC official said that at the time of the offering, put and call options
on TH traded on the London Traded Options Market suggested a volatility of
70 per cent, meaning the price could rise or fall 70 per cent in a year. But
using its own proprietary data base, SBC concluded the volatility was
actually much lower, thus, the options were probably priced too high.
The TH rights offering, a two-for-one deal, gave new shares at 60p each
against a pre-rights offering price of 78p, a discount of 24 per cent. The
price of the put option to TH is effectively the 2 per cent underwriting
fee. An SBC official, citing the London Business School's own options data
base, shows that the volatility by that measure is a much more modest 40 per
cent. And at that rate, a price of .012 per cent would have been sufficient
to cover the risk in that underwriting.
SBC's analysis of the differences in rights offerings may be purely
academic. There is no suggestion underwriters have either the incentive or
the muscle to begin to compete with each other on underwriting fees.
For one thing, the institutional shareholders who sub-underwrite the deals
are unlikely ever to agree to it. But certainly, the maturation of the
equity derivatives market could help to call into question the whole issue
of the valuation of rights offerings.

Banco de Fomento

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Central Hispano (BCH), the Spanish bank, is to acquire full ownership
of Banco de Fomento in which it has a 66 per cent shareholding, with a view
to disposing of the subsidiary bank's 165-branch network, writes Tom Burns
in Madrid.
BCH, which will be employing equity from its own treasury stock for the
takeover, will be offering one of its shares for every two of Fomento in an
acquisition representing Pta10.3bn (Dollars 82m).
Brokers recommended the bid, noting that BCH paid a dividend of Pta210 per
share last year, against Fomento's Pta90 per share payout.
BCH said that following the takeover it would put aside Fomento's cash flow,
which stood at Pta5.9bn last year, for pension funds and reserves. In 1992
Fomento's coverage of non-performing loans stood at 70.5 per cent, down from
84.4 per cent the year before.
Analysts saw BCH's decision to strengthen Fomento's balance sheet as
heralding a disposal of the bank network.

FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: IRI chief to take charge of Stet
telecoms unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michele Tedeschi, mana-ging director of Italy's IRI state holding
company, is to become managing director of its Stet telecommunications
subsidiary in a surprise transfer.
The change reinforces signs that IRI, which reported a 1992 loss of L4,809bn
(Dollars 3.27bn) and faces group debts of about L73,000bn, will be whittled
down while Stet and Finmeccanica, its two biggest subsidiaries, gain weight.
Both companies are already stock market listed and are set to be
progressively privatised.
It also confirms that Mr Romano Prodi, IRI's chairman until 1989, who was
reappointed last month will now take full control of running the group.
Under a 1992 restructuring which marked Mr Tedeschi's promotion to managing
director, the chairman was relegated to a largely representational role
while the managing director was given mainstream management
responsibilities.
Mr Prodi did not indicate any desire to change matters after his
re-appointment and seemed content with the role of IRI's 'ambassador' to the
business and finance community. However, under yesterday's changes, he will
assume Mr Tedeschi's powers as soon as the latter is transfered later this
week.
Mr Tedeschi, who has started reshaping IRI, faces the task of restructuring
Stet, which controls Italy's state-owned telecoms activities. The sector,
split between seven companies, is due to be rationalised by the end of 1995.
The process, likely to meet stiff management and political resistance, is an
important step in the government's privatisation plans, with the eventual
single utility, tentatively called Telecom Italia, one of the most
attractive privatisation candidates.
Mr Tedeschi's move will also create ructions within the highly-politicised
Stet group, where there are two managing directors, both of whom will be
reassigned.
Mr Biagio Agnes was yesterday reconfirmed as Stet's chairman, but he will
also see his role diminished.

FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: First-quarter recovery at
Skandia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDIA, one of Sweden's two leading insurers, showed a strong recovery in
the first quarter, as it posted a SKr700m (Dollars 95m) operating profit
compared with a SKr300m loss in the same period of 1992.
The result, which includes unrealised changes in asset values, was struck
after premium income rose to SKr11.7bn from SKr9.6bn, largely because of
increased life insurance business.
The figures were provided by Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia chief executive, at
the group's annual general meeting.
The group's net asset value is estimated to have risen to SKr12.6bn from
SKr11.4bn at the year-end, thanks to rising share and bond prices and
exchange rate movements. It saw a 20 per cent fall in net asset value last
year which prompted the company to suspend its dividend for the first time
in its history.
Skandia said its position is also being strengthened by its decision to
reduce non-life reinsurance operations, which should help boost its solvency
margin to 65 per cent by the year-end, compared with 51 per cent at the end
of 1992.

FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Japan's long-term credit banks
fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's three long-term credit banks reported an average 44.6 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits for the year ended in March. The weakest of the trio,
Nippon Credit Bank, suffered a 60 per cent plunge in profits, partly due to
a restructuring of finance company affiliates.
As with most other Japanese banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and NCB reported a sharp rise in operating
profits as falling interest rates created a favourable spread. But those
earnings were eroded by fresh provisions for non-performing loans.
For the first time, the banks provided individual totals for their bad loans
 -Y543bn (Dollars 4.9bn) at IBJ, Y715bn at LTCB and Y592bn at NCB, where
assets shrunk 5.5 per cent during the period. The bank is still overhauling
three financial affiliates, whose problem loans are estimated to be about 20
per cent of outstanding loans.
The country's seven trust banks face problems with property-related loans
from their trust account, and reported an average fall of 26.7 per cent in
pre-tax profits.
They also capitalised on favourable interest rate trends, with operating
profits leaping by as much as 108 per cent at Chuo Trust and Banking.
Mitsui Trust and Banking reported a more modest 7.6 per cent increase in
operating profit, while Mitsubishi Trust and Banking recorded a 47.19 per
cent increase. Net interest revenue rose by 130 per cent at Yasuda Trust and
by 21 per cent at Sumitomo Trust.
The trust banks' profit reports would have been less flattering if not for
afavourable change in accounting regulations late last year by the Ministry
of Finance. In previous years, trust banks were only allowed to report
interest already received on loans from their trust account.
However, for the period just ended, they were able to report delayed
payments from troubled clients, as long as they were not more than six
months overdue. The banks announced their individual non-performing loans,
ranging from Y73.1bn at Nippon Trust Bank to Y561.8bn at Mitsubishi Trust,
though these figures tell only part of the story.
Mitsubishi Trust is one of the stronger trust banks, and the Japanese
definition of non-performing loans gives banks much flexibility in
calculating their totals. As long as one payment has been made in the past
six months, the loan is not necessarily bad.
The banks' capital adequacy ratios are also a poor guide to their health, as
even the shakiest of the trust and long-term credit banks was well above the
8 per cent threshold, as defined by the Bank for International Settlements.

FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Shares in Moksel suspended due
to fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Moksel, the large German meat-processing company, were suspended
last week shortly before the Bavaria-based group announced it had been the
victim of a DM100m (Dollars 62m) fraud in a company bought last year.
Moksel said on Friday it had discovered 'major irregularities' in the
accounts of Salomon, a meat company with sales of DM500-DM600m bought last
year, as well as evidence of 'dishonest acts'.
The fraud appeared to have been perpetrated over a period of years before
the acquisition, and Moksel said a total of around DM100m appeared to have
gone missing.
Moksel said it would be in the best interests of the company if it paid no
dividend for 1992. The plan had been to pay DM11 per share. It said that
beyond this it did not expect the fraud to have any other financial
repercussions.
Moksel's sales last year fell from DM4.02bn in 1991 to DM3.7bn despite
several acquisitions. The drop reflected changing demand from eastern
Germany.

<TEXT>
CSR, the Australian building products, sugar and aluminium group, yesterday
announced an rise of 20 per cent in net profit to ADollars 211.2m (USDollars
148.3m) for the year to end-March, on revenue up 9 per cent to ADollars
4.3bn.
The group said higher sugar prices and an improvement in productivity
outweighed the effects of low aluminium prices and patchy economic recovery
in its main markets in Australia and the US.
Its sugar mills made substantially higher profits because of a record sugar
cane crop and higher world prices.
The timber products division returned to profit after two years of losses.
These gains were partly offset by lower prices and profit margins in
Australia for some building products.
However, the bottom line was boosted by a net abnormal profit of ADollars
20m, mainly due to a restatement of provisions against income tax
liabilities, resulting in net profit after abnormals of ADollars 231.3m.
This was in sharp contrast to 1991-1992, when a change in accounting
standards forced the group to write down the value of assets by ADollars
560m, resulting in a loss after abnormals of ADollars 385.3m.
The final dividend was lifted from 10 to 12 cents, fully franked, making 22
cents for the year, against 20 cents.

ASKO, one of Germany's biggest retailers, returned to profit in the first
six months of this year and took steps to reduce borrowings.
For the six months ended March, after-tax profits totalled DM255m (Dollars
159m), Mr Klaus Wiegandt, chief executive, told the annual meeting.
This compares with a net loss of DM468m in the nine months to the end of
September and a profit of just DM6m in 1991 - there are no directly
comparable figures because of a change to the year-end.
Mr Wiegandt also said the group had raised nearly DM900m this year by
selling more than 1m shares in AVA, another retailer with a stock-market
listing in which Asko used to have a large stake. The disposal reduces
Asko's holding in AVA to 7 per cent.
The sale has helped cut group debt by DM1.9bn in the first half year. Mr
Wiegandt said it would be possible to pay off another DM500m of debt in the
current half, in line with plans to reduce borrowings from about DM4.7bn at
the end of March to about DM2bn by the end of the year.
Asko's return to profit reflects the absence of the provisions and
write-offs on investments which led to large losses last year. It is in the
middle of a rationalisation programme designed to deal with the consequences
of a spate of acquisitions in the late 1980s.
Turnover for the six months was DM10.58bn, down from the DM10.74bn in the
October 1991 to March 1992 period - but after adjusting for changes to sales
area, turnover rose by 1.7 per cent.
Mr Wiegandt said the group could expect turnover for the full year to be
more than DM20bn.
Asko is controlled by the Swiss-based Metro group, part of the retail empire
owned by the reclusive Mr Otto Beisheim.

<TEXT>
TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and industrial group, fell heavily into the
red in the first four months after being hit by depressed metals prices and
losses from associated companies.
It made a loss of SKr427m (Dollars 58m) after financial items, compared with
SKr187m profit in the same 1992 period, as operating income slipped to
SKr7.80bn from SKr7.95bn.
The group warned it would suffer another 'severe deficit' in 1993, after
last year's SKr1.56bn loss, because of weak business conditions and its US
dollar hedging.
'The first four months were characterised by record low metal prices and
continued decline in the building market,' the company said. Business
conditions in Sweden and Europe remained weak, while the US market had not
shown any sign of an upturn.
The result was aggravated by a SKr121m loss from associated companies,
against a SKr134m profit last year, while exchange gains at SKr7m were
SKr215m less than a year ago. There was a loss after depreciation of SKr13m,
against a SKr103m profit in 1992.

following institutional pressure, has returned to the discount business with
the purchase of Parker and Franks, the loss-making hardware toys, and gift
store chain. It went into receivership on May 12.
Mr Green paid 'a substantial cash sum' - reported to be Pounds 3.3m - for
Parker and Franks, which last year made sales of Pounds 30m. He has taken 54

FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Statistical reports circulate
under great secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Every summer for the past 21 years, bundles of documents stacked a foot high
have circulated under conditions of great secrecy around City financial
institutions.
More than 200 banks, brokerages and consultants in London pay upwards of
Pounds 30,000 for these detailed statistical reports and consulting advice
to back them up.
While the anuual Extel ratings of analysts - the industry's own assessment
of its peers - circulate freely around the City, the companies are far more
coy about revealing these findings to their competitors or the Press.
The money spent does not give them carte blanche to use the findings. They
sign a confidentiality agreement and agree that they are renting rather than
buying the reports.
The company responsible is Greenwich Associates, a US consulting and market
research business based in Greenwich, Connecticut. Each year it comes to
London and other big financial centres around the world to conduct
interviews with institutions and canvass their views on how they are
serviced.
'This is the bible,' says one senior figure in a large City securities
house, tapping one of the reports, which is firmly closed. 'It is very hard
to run a firm without it. It is invaluable if you know how to understand the
figures. Luckily not many of our competitors do.'

FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: SE probes into enhanced scrip
pay-out underwriting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK Exchange's market practices committee is to meet today to consider
whether underwriters of enhanced scrip dividend schemes should have limits
placed on their ability to trade the shares of the company whose pay-outs
they are underwriting.
This stems from a controversial move by Swiss Bank Corporation to undercut
the price offered for shares in a financing scheme for insurance and tobacco
conglomerate BAT, originally designed and underwritten by Barclays de Zoete
Wedd. The Stock Exchange and BAT were both asked to investigate a drop in
BAT's share price which, some market makers suggested, had occurred at a
time when it worked to SBC's advantage.
There was no evidence whatever that SBC manipulated the market price for the
shares. SBC attributed the drop to remarks by BAT's chairman, Sir Patrick
Sheehy, on the trading outlook and on news of increased competition in the
key US tobacco market.
Yet, some City officials have suggested that limitations be placed on the
ability of underwriters of such schemes to make markets in the shares during
certain periods. Also, there have been suggestions that the Stock Exchange
should have the right to alter the underwriting price for enhanced scrip
dividends if it feels it is appropriate.
Enhanced scrip dividends have been used by several companies, including BAT,
to cut its bill for advance corporation tax.
BAT and other issuers of enhanced scrip dividends offered shareholders the
option to earn a dividend paid in additional shares but worth 50 per cent
more than the cash payout. Those investors who wanted cash could raise it by
selling the additional shares to BZW, without dealing costs, at a five per
cent discount to the market price.
In the case of BAT, SBC announced it would buy the shares at a discount of
only two per cent, effectively ensuring that investors would sell their
shares to it.
But on the first day of the three-day pricing period, BAT's shares fell from
851p to 825p and averaged 833p over the three day pricing period, meaning
SBC had to pay investors significantly less for their extra shares than it
might have had to.

FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Less commissions on UK equities
 -There is growing concentration in a smaller number of brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL commissions paid by British institutional investors buying UK equities
dropped 15 per cent to Pounds 254m in the year to March 1993, according to a
confidential market research study conducted by US-based Greenwich
Associates.
The study, which was released to subscribers last week and based on
interviews conducted earlier this year, shows a growing concentration of
equity business in a small number of brokers.
Just three or four brokers dominate the market by control of commissions and
on a range of assessment measures for effectiveness.
The number of institutions buying equities fell from 235 in 1992 to 229 in
1993. That compares with 225 in 1991, when commissions generated totalled
Pounds 245m.
Of the 229 institutions, 48 per cent were each generating commissions for
brokers of under Pounds 500,000 and a further 12 per cent of below Pounds 1m
each. A further 23 per cent had business in the range Pounds 1m-Pounds 2.5m,
and the remaining 14 per cent were of over Pounds 2.5m.
Of the Pounds 254m in commissions dispersed by the institutions, 62 per cent
was concentrated in those spending over Pounds 2.5m, and a further 21 per
cent for those up to Pounds 1m, leaving just 17 per cent below this level.
Most business was concentrated in the hands of five leading firms. Across
all institutions, one-fifth of their business was placed with a single lead
firm, and 71 per cent with just five firms.
Among the 54 institutions generating over Pounds 1m in equity commissions,
16 per cent went to their lead firm and 63 per cent to the top five firms -
up from 58 per cent last year.
The most important factor in allocating commissions, at 59 per cent, was
research. A further 24 per cent was determined by trading coverage and
liquidity, 8 per cent from soft commission services and 2 per cent from
equity derivatives.
Portfolio managers were ranked most important in determining allocations,
accounting for 79 per cent among all institutions and 63 per cent for large
institutions. Analysts accounted for 9 per cent and 6 per cent respectively;
and traders 5 per cent and 10 per cent.
Among the top 15 brokers, Warburg was used most frequently by institutions
for buying shares, followed by Smith New Court and James Capel.
The pattern changes when looking only at the top five brokers each
institution used for share purchases, which dominate so much of the market.
That makes James Capel the dominant firm, with 78 per cent of institutions
using it as one of the top five, followed by NatWest at 72 per cent and
Warburg at 70 per cent.
These same firms also had the greatest share when institutions ranked their
top three firms for penetration: at 61 per cent for Capel, 51 per cent for
NatWest and 48 per cent for Warburg.
Among the dominant brokers used by the largest institutions, performance
varies widely based on different detailed criteria.
For research capability, NatWest receives the highest rating at 75 per cent,
followed by Capel at 72 per cent, and Warburg, BZW and UBS jointly at 71 per
cent.
For sales service intensity - or frequency of calls by sales staff - NatWest
is top at 75 per cent, followed by 71 per cent at Capel and Kleinwort
Benson, and 70 per cent at UBS.
For effectiveness of analyst service, NatWest scores 79 per cent, and
Warburg and Capel 72 per cent. Capel scores highest for the frequency of
contact from research analysts, at 63 per cent, followed by NatWest at 59
per cent and Warburg at 46 per cent.
But judged by the effectiveness of visits and calls, NatWest rates highest
at 63 per cent and Capel at 52 per cent. The next, at just 33 per cent, is
Warburg.
Best-written reports were from NatWest, at 63 per cent, followed by Capel
and Warburg, both at 54 per cent. NatWest provided the most creative
research at 51 per cent, followed by Capel 35 per cent and both Smith New
Court and Warburg 33 per cent.
For the quality of macro-research, all the scores are much lower. For
portfolio strategy, NatWest is highest at 45 per cent, with Smith New Court
second at 35 per cent followed by UBS at 34 per cent.

FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Wall St float plan for BP
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum is planning a Wall Street flotation for its Purina Mills
animal feeds arm if it is unable to sell the US business to a trade buyer at
an acceptable price.
BP has filed an initial application with the Securities and Exchange
Commission which could lead to a flotation to raise about Dollars 215m
(Pounds 139m). As well as the proceeds of the flotation BP would also
receive Dollars 115m in debt repayments.
Purina Mills is part of BP's nutrition business, which was put up for sale
last year, when BP said it was to concentrate on its oil and gas businesses.
At that time analysts said they expected the sale of the nutrition
businesses to raise between Dollars 750m and Dollars 900m. As well as
Purina, BP's other animal feeds businesses in Europe are still up for sale.
Last week BP announced the sale of its consumer products division for Pounds
250m to a management buy-out organised by Legal &amp; General.

FT  01 JUN 93 / BAe may sell business jets to Raytheon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace is in advanced negotiations to sell its corporate jet
activities to Raytheon, the US company that makes Beechcraft small and
business aircraft.
Although BAe yesterday described the talks as 'speculation', the UK
aerospace group has already attempted to sell control of its business jet
operations to Raytheon last year.
After the original deal collapsed last September, BAe announced it intended
to hold on to its business jet division whose headquarters were transferred
from the UK to Little Rock, Arkansas, a leading centre for executive jets.
However, Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, also said last year the
company no longer regarded its business aircraft operations as a core
activity. It has also continued seeking a buyer for its business jet
division and negotiations with Raytheon and its Beechcraft subsidiary are
understood to have been gathering steam in recent weeks.
BAe's business aircraft activities are estimated to be worth around Pounds
200m to Pounds 250m, according to City of London analysts. A sale would
provide BAe with valuable cash at a time of extensive restructuring.
The sale of the business aircraft activities would also reflect the general
trend of consolidation in the corporate aircraft sector which has seen a
number of deals in the last 12 months including the take over of Cessna by
Textron of the US and of Learjet by Bombardier of Canada.
BAe's corporate jet business would also provide Raytheon's Beechcraft
subsidiary with a good fit since Beechcraft is in the lower end of the
market and BAe's operations would enable it to expand its business in the
medium-range corporate jet market.
BAe manufactures the 125/800 and the 125/1000 medium-size business jets.
This has been a successful activity for the UK company for the past 30
years. But the 125 family of aircraft now requires heavy investment to renew
its product line and BAe no longer considers this a strategic option in its
recovery programme.
Instead, BAe is refocusing its aerospace operations around its military
aircraft activities and its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus
airliner programme.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Fiat cuts dividend heavily as profits fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's biggest private company, yesterday bowed to the pressures of a
depressed car market and heavy investment spending by slashing its dividend
by more than half to L100 for ordinary shares and L130 for non-voting
savings stock.
The heavy cut, for the second year in succession, was accompanied by news
that net profits at Fiat Auto, the group's mainstream car subsidiary, fell
to just L16bn (Pounds 7.02m) last year from L415bn in 1991.
Group net profits in 1992, buoyed by Fiat's profitable non-industrial
activities and extraordinary earnings from asset sales, dropped by more than
half to L551bn after minority interests from L1,114bn in 1991. Turnover rose
by about 4.6 per cent to L59,106bn.
In spite of the pressure on earnings, which shows little sign of improving
this year, Fiat appears intent on pursuing its ambitious investment plans,
which pushed net group indebtedness to L3,849bn last December from L270bn
the previous year. The company confirmed its L40,000bn investment programmed
for 1992-95 and revealed that investment and R&amp;D spending in 1992, mostly on
developing new models and plant, rose to L8,526bn from L6,683bn,
representing 14.4 per cent of sales.
The poor figures, which were widely expected, have not been matched by any
acceleration of the plans to bring forward a change of guard at the group.
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, and Mr Cesare Romiti, managing director, have
both indicated recently that they do not intend to step down before the June
1994 annual meeting.
A year ago Fiat cut its dividend by 38 per cent from L370 per ordinary share
to L260. Its message of continuity in the face of adversity in the car
market has been further tested this year. Fiat's share of the domestic car
market it once dominated has continued to edge down and is now hovering at
little over 43 per cent. Matters have worsened in recent months as Italian
demand for new cars has belatedly reflected the downturns seen elsewhere in
Europe. April new car sales figures showed a fall of 28.4 per cent.
Fiat does not appear to have benefited greatly from the lira's fall. Car
importers have maintained market share in Italy.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Boots fights City sentiment with numbers: Neil Buckley, Guy
de Jonquieres and Paul Abrahams examine a mystery illness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY, GUY DE JONQUIERES and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, once seen as one of the safest stocks on the market, is searching for
a remedy for its ailing share price. Since January, its shares have been
among the weakest in the FTSE-100, underperforming the market by almost 25
per cent.
The cure may be elusive, as on the surface the patient seems as healthy,
under Sir James Blyth its chief executive since 1987, as ever. The chemists,
retailing and pharmaceuticals group is expected to report on Thursday a 14
per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 359.5m to Pounds 410m in the
year to March. However, that may not be enough to dispel City nerves. 'It is
very much a battle between the actual numbers and market sentiment,' said Mr
John Richards, stores analyst at NatWest Securities.
The problem is that much of the profits rise will come from Boots The
Chemists, the best-performing division in the group and provider of almost
60 per cent of its operating profits. The City is worried that future profit
growth at BTC may be limited.
Boots' prices have come under fire recently. First, Superdrug, the discount
chain owned by Kingfisher, launched sharp discounts on fragrances, sun-care
products and condoms. Then last week, the Mergers and Monopolies Commission
was highly critical of Boots pricing on contact lens solutions. Unless Boots
can strike some counterblows in the public relations battle, sales and
margins could be under threat.
BTC is the UK's eighth-biggest retailer, with sales of Pounds 2.47bn last
year. Profits have increased almost threefold from Pounds 101m in 1988 to a
forecast Pounds 285m in the year to March. Much of the improvement has come
from a doubling of margins in the same period to almost 10 per cent. That
has been achieved thanks to increased sales of high-margin products such as
food and own-label goods; a weeding out of less profitable lines; and the
introduction of sophisticated technology.
But anecdotal evidence, supported by last week's MMC report on contact lens
solutions, also suggests Boots uses its buying power mercilessly to screw
rock-bottom prices out of its suppliers. Yet critics say its selling prices
are only competitive because its dominance enables it to set the levels in
an otherwise fragmented market, and that it does not pass its efficiency
savings on to the consumer.
Whatever the reality behind Superdrug's claims to be cheaper, its successful
public relations campaign has reinforced customers' impressions that BTC's
prices are too high - as Boots' own research has shown. Price cuts initiated
by Superdrug are often followed by the big superstore operators such as
Sainsbury and Tesco, which have started to compete with Boots on its
traditional home territory - over-the-counter medicines and personal care
products. Boots seems to have acknowledged the threat by agreeing to set up
small outlets within Sainsbury stores from this July on a trial basis.
Any pressure on BTC's profits could have serious implications, as the
performance of the rest of the group is less than inspiring - especially
those divisions acquired in the Pounds 900m takeover of Ward White in 1989.
The retail division is forecast to cut overall losses from Pounds 5.3m to
about Pounds 3.5m, but still contains two problem cases.
Do It All, the DIY joint venture formed in 1990 when Boot's Payless chain
merged with WH Smith's Do It All, is forecast to drop from a small profit
last year to a loss of Pounds 12m-Pounds 14m.
The venture has found it difficult to be number three in the market (after
B&amp;Q and Texas Homecare), saddled with some old stores in poor locations.
Moreover, it started up just as the housing market slumped, and a series of
price-cutting wars between DIY retailers saw margins collapse. Both Boots
and WH Smith say they are committed to turning Do It All around, by
developing its brand identity and offering better service and information to
customers. But some critics still say they would do better closing the
business.
Children's World, the edge-of-town childrenswear and toy chain, is expected
to cut losses from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 4m-Pounds 6m, but after five years
is not close to profit. 'One of the few ways Boots could redeem its
reputation is to get the axe out, and Children's World would be a prime
candidate,' suggested one analyst.
Other retailing businesses are not doing so badly. Halfords, its car parts
and bicycle retail chain, is expected to show its first full-year profit of
about Pounds 3m, from a Pounds 10.5m loss last year. It is reaping the
benefits from a shake-up of its accounting system and management, the
application of Boots retailing skills and systems, and a revamp of its car
service centres. Boots Opticians is another bright spot, with trading
profits likely to rise to Pounds 6.5m from Pounds 5.5m.
The outlook is similarly mixed for the other main weapon in Boots's armoury,
its pharmaceuticals division, which is expected to show a fall in trading
profits from Pounds 120.8m to Pounds 110m.
Boots is a minnow in the rapidly-consolidating drugs industry and there are
doubts whether the division is large enough to discover and then develop
innovative compounds on the global basis necessary to ensure a reasonable
return on R&amp;D investment.
High hopes were pinned on last year's launch of Manoplax, a treatment for
congestive heart failure, nicknamed Mananaplax by the City because of the
time it took to bring to market.
But a study released earlier this year suggested that at certain doses
patients suffered higher mortality rates than on placebo. This means that
even if Manoplax is tolerated at lower doses, the company will have big
difficulties convincing specialists of its utility. Lehman Brothers, the US
brokers, downgraded projected sales for 1995 from Dollars 100m (Pounds
64.9m) to Dollars 75m. They had previously expected sales to reach Dollars
250m towards the end of the decade. Some analysts speculate Manoplax could
be withdrawn.
'Fundamentally, Boots is still a strong business,' concluded one analyst
last week. 'The trouble is there's lots of meat for the bears to chew on.'

FT  01 JUN 93 / Japanese steel groups predict return to red in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE steel companies expect to slip into loss again this year, a decade
after they launched restructuring and diversification programmes intended to
strengthen the industry in the face of falling steel demand.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel maker, reported a 71.2 per cent
plunge to Y28.9bn (Pounds 170m) in pre-tax profit for year ended in March,
and forecast a first-half loss of Y5bn this year. It is hoping an eventual
economic recovery will produce a full-year profit of about Y20bn.
Other leading makers, including Kawasaki Steel, Kobe Steel, and Sumitomo
Metal Industries, also predicted first-half losses of about Y5bn, but
suggested a change in economic conditions in the second half would return
them to the black.
NKK would have reported a loss last year but for a Y17.4bn gain on sales of
securities holdings. Pre-tax profit fell 89 per cent to Y4.1bn, while net
profit plunged 99 per cent to Y255m. It expects a first-half pre-tax loss of
Y15bn this year.
Pre-tax profits at Kobe were down 69.6 per cent, at Kawasaki by 82.5 per
cent and Sumitomo Metal by 86.9 per cent. Each of the companies is
attempting to cut costs and reduce staff after much heralded diversification
programmes failed to add to profitability during another downturn in demand.
Crude steel production at Nippon Steel was down almost 10 per cent to 25,320
tons and would have fallen further had import orders from China not tripled
during the year.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Economics Notebook: Europe adapts to a dragging German
anchor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke's recent announcement that he favours delaying sterling's
re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism may turn out to have been
well timed as well as politically expedient.
For while attention in Britain was concentrated last week on the final days
of Mr Norman Lamont's chancellorship and his replacement by Mr Clarke,
tensions were again beginning to appear in the European Monetary System.
True, the European Community's monetary committee and the EC central bank
governors' committee papered over the cracks in the system in two separate
reports commissioned by the special meeting of EC heads of government in
Birmingham last autumn.
But in Copenhagen, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank president,
declared that currency co-operation in the system had 'collapsed'.
For a day or two, it seemed that speculators were limbering up to force
Spain into yet another devaluation.
Within the group of core countries, interest rate changes were under way
that could have significant effects on how the system works.
At the beginning of last week, the Banque de France cut its interest rates
for the seventh time in six weeks and, in the process, brought its
intervention rate down to 7.5 per cent, and so below its German equivalent,
the Bundesbank's 'repo' rate. The money markets' response was to quote
French three months money rates of 7.44 per cent, slightly below the German
7.5 per cent level.
Although the French three months rate later moved back above its German
equivalent, there was a sense in European financial circles that last week
marked a watershed. Last Monday, four ERM countries - France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Ireland - had three months money rates below German levels.
But while some hailed this event as proof that the tensions in the inner
core of ERM currencies had dissolved, others began to fear new instability,
should the role of the D-Mark as ERM anchor be called into question.
The D-mark's anchor role came about by accident rather than design. It
reflects the fact that the D-Mark is the preferred European currency for
investors wanting to switch out of dollars or Japanese yen. It is the
world's second largest reserve currency. Perhaps most important, the D-Mark
has never been devalued in the EMS.
That four narrow band countries could have market interest rates below
German levels showed how concerned international investors are becoming
about the outlook for the German currency. Relatively high inflation,
mounting government deficits, weak government in Bonn and the unresolved
problems of integrating eastern Germany with western Germany underline how
far the fundamentals relating to the D-mark have changed since the late
1980s.
However, it would be wrong to suggest that recent developments have
triggered alarm in the core countries' central banks.
Germany is not alone in having economic problems: indeed of the core
countries only Luxembourg at present qualifies for European economic and
monetary union under the convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht
Treaty.
German bankers point out that there are not that many attractive
alternatives for investors in the D-mark. When it comes to operating the
ERM, some currencies - such as the Belgian franc or Danish krone - are
simply too illiquid to act as primary means of intervention. Nor has the
French franc any track record as the system's anchor.
Certainly, the Banque de France is not writing off the D-mark as the ERM's
key currency, although officials suggest that it will be less dominating
than before.
The Bundesbank is taking the view that it is quite acceptable for interest
rates in other ERM countries to go below those of Germany providing the
margin is not too great. Such moves can readily be explained by differences
in the business cycle.
On the other hand, German officials admit that the world has changed since
unification. No longer is the D-mark underpinned by a large current account
surplus and a small and manageable budget deficit.
The Bundesbank is having to look over its shoulder at the foreign investors
who hold D-marks. It is also having to think what might happen if the
problems associated with the absorption of eastern Germany mean that Germany
cannot resume its former role as the EC's leader in price stability.
The Bundesbank seems to be drawing two conclusions, one of which may please
both Mr Clarke and the Tory right wing and another which will please
neither.
A plus for the UK is that the Bundesbank is unlikely to give its support to
any move for the ERM core group to press ahead with a partial monetary union
in such a state of uncertainty.
Frankfurt feels that the pressure for a core country union is easing in any
case. There are some signs that the new French government might be rather
less enthusiastic about Emu than its predecessor. A union of the core
countries would be difficult to reconcile with the Maastricht Treaty.
Moreover, the large fiscal deficits that are a feature of most core
countries will make it impossible for them to meet the Maastricht
convergence criteria by the treaty's union deadlines of 1997 and difficult
by 1999.
A less palatable conclusion is that the Bundesbank will be even more
cautious about lowering interest rates in spite of Germany's worsening
recession.
Last week, three of Germany's regional central bank chiefs warned against
early interest rate cuts, mainly because of the threat that rapid money
supply growth poses for inflation.
But the Bundesbank also believes that it cannot risk alienating foreign
holders of D-marks by dramatic interest rate reductions with the D-mark
anchor seeming to drag.
With the recession gathering pace in Britain's key continental markets, that
is the kind of news that Mr Kenneth Clarke and other EC finance ministers
can do without.

For the Wellcome Foundation a laboratory at Dartford, Kent, will be
refurbished in a Pounds 2.7m contract running from June to May 1994.
The award of these contracts brings new gains for the south east regional
office to some Pounds 18.5m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seeboard is adding to its complement of non-executive directors with the
appointment of Peter Dean, deputy chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Jim Ellis, chief executive, says that as well as lowering the average age of
the board - Dean is 53 years old and two of the five non-executives are over
65 - the new recruit will have a valuable input on all MMC-related matters
in the future.
In another area of the business, industry regulator Offer has already warned
it may refer the two privatised power generators, National Power and
PowerGen, to the MMC.
Dean was known to Seeboard because its non-executive chairman Sir Keith
Stuart is chairman of Associated British Ports where Dean is on the board.
A freelance business consultant, he has been a member of the MMC since 1982
and deputy chairman since 1990.
He was on the board of RTZ from 1974 to 1985, having joined the company as a
solicitor in 1966.
Among other current appointments, Dean lists his directorship of Liberty
Life Assurance Company and chairmanship of Highgate Counselling Centre.

FT  01 JUN 93 / People: Barclays' high-flyer moves offshore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays has moved one of its young high-flyers into the growing private
banking operation, making Catherine McDowell, previously head of investor
relations, its first director specifically responsible for offshore banking.
Based in the Mayfair headquarters of the private banking division, she joins
its management board headed by Michael Tomalin, managing director.
Private banking is increasingly in vogue with UK high street banks as a way
of increasing income without tying up large amounts of capital.
John Church, another director within the private bank, says that the
offshore centres - including Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, and
Gibraltar - represent a 'very substantial part' of the division's overall
operations.
While traditionally strongest on the trust and fiduciary side, Barclays is
now keen to offer an integrated service from banking through to investment
management. McDowell has responsibilities for service and product
development in addition to her geographic beat.
Joining Barclays Bank International as a graduate trainee in 1978, McDowell,
just 35, has gathered considerable experience around the group. In 1984 she
moved to New York where she worked in the treasury division before being
seconded to BZW Securities, also on Wall Street, marketing to US pension
funds and other institutional investors.
Since 1991 she has been head of investor relations, traditionally a job for
the bank's fast-track executives. Her watch however has been a particularly
challenging one - a period during which the bank has been hit by a series of
bad loans and been the subject of intense scrutiny from its institutional
shareholders over senior management succession.

FT  01 JUN 93 / People: Yeoman changes guard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Berry, the younger son of Lord Hartwell, has added the chairmanship
of Yeoman Investment Trust to his portfolio of other directorships. He
succeeds Maurice Baring the long-time chairman of Yeoman, no relation of the
banking family, who has turned 70. At the same time, Lord Gowrie joins the
trust as a non-executive director.
Berry says he is wary of the City's tendency towards overspecialisation.
What he is looking for in Gowrie, currently chairman of Sotheby's Europe and
tipped as a possible future chairman of the Arts Council, is 'a basic level
of wisdom'. Asked whether he had employed headhunters in the search, Berry
replies:'I have a perfectly good head myself'.
The fund is a split capital trust, currently capitalised at Pounds 75m.
Previously independent, Abbey Life recently won the management contract,
although it was not instrumental in the Gowrie appointment.
Despite its origins as the Java Investment &amp; Loan Company, Yeoman does not
invest overseas - 'it's difficult enough knowing what is going on next door'
says Berry, who is fond of the slogan 'elephants don't gallop' in support of
his preference for taking large stakes in small companies and adopting a
long-term view.
Berry, an old Etonian as is Gowrie, has had a varied career. He caught the
headlines briefly when helping his family fight off, unsuccessfully, Conrad
Black's bid for control of the Daily Telegraph.
He has also had a long-running interest in the Manchester Ship Canal
Company, where he was chairman for a spell until ousted in a bid in 1987 by
northern developer John Whittaker.
In addition, he ran and owned Harrap's publishers for 13 years, selling in
1988. It was during this period he met Ian Maxwell, with whom he remains a
friend; he even contributed Pounds 125,000 towards bail for Robert Maxwell's
elder son.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: European road research development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE TECHNOLOGY has started work on a Europe-wide research
project to develop a cementitious overlay for repairing flexible road
pavements.
The Ecu3.06m (Pounds 2.38m) project is aimed at combating the growing
problem of rutting in asphalt pavements caused by increasing axle loads,
higher tyre pressures and growing traffic volume. Known as NEWPAVE, the
research will be of interest to all European countries who currently devote
a substantial amount of their transport budgets to road maintenance.
The European Commission's Brite-EuRam programme is providing 50 per cent of
the project's funds with the rest coming from a consortium made up of seven
organisations.
Besides THT, the consortium consists of the UK's Transport Research
Laboratory, two Danish companies, Aalborg Portland A/S and Dansk Beton
Teknik A/S, the Danish Road Institute, the Technical University of Denmark
and the National Civil Engineering Laboratory of Portugal.
The overlay material being developed by NEWPAVE will be used both as a
wearing course and strengthening for flexible road pavements.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading football club
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION has won a Pounds 5m design and build contract to
redevelop the south stand at West Ham United Football Club in east London.
With the football season drawn to a close and West Ham promoted to the
Premier League, Wimpey has started work at Upton Park to upgrade the ground.
Rebuilding the south stand will nearly double the seating capacity of the
stadium creating an additional 7,650 seats.
The steel-framed, two-tier stand will be topped with a 36 metre wide roof
which will be supported by a 73 metre goal post lattice beam running the
length of the stand. As the roof is only propped by columns at each end of
the stand, spectators will have an unobstructed view of the pitch.
The profile of the lower tier follows a parabolic shape which also maximises
the crowd's view of a match.
Situated between the two levels, Wimpey is building 19 executive boxes with
full catering facilities for up to 200 people. Facilities include club
offices and a lounge for the use of supporters. Wimpey's design team is AD
Consultants as architect and Jan Bobrowski as structural engineer.

<DATELINE>
   RESULTS DUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, the retailing and pharmaceutical group, hopes final results out on
Thursday will dispel City worries about its prospects, provoked by recent
price battles with Superdrug. Boots shares have underperformed the stores
sector by 25 per cent since January.
Pre-tax profits are forecast to increase by up to 14 per cent, from Pounds
359.5m to between Pounds 400m and Pounds 410m. The market expects most of
the improvement to come from Boots the Chemist, where operating profits are
likely to be up almost Pounds 40m at Pounds 285m.
Several large property companies recently raised new funds to lower gearing,
so the question over MEPC's interim results on Thursday is whether the UK's
second largest will follow suit.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits of around Pounds 47m for the half-year to
March, compared with Pounds 58.6m a year ago, reflecting a decline in
capitalised interest as the development programme comes to an end.
Recovery in the US remains uneven and the market will be watching the tone
of Siebe's statement on activity over the pond where it is heavily exposed.
The statement is due out with final results tomorrow.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 181m, against Pounds
169.6m a year ago. They are looking for a small drop in gearing at 69 per
cent for the six months to September through cash-flow.
Today, Westland, the helicopter group, is expected to announce half-year
results with pre-tax profits of around Pounds 11.5m, 10 to 11 per cent up on
the previous period.
This quiet improvement reflects slack production work on new helicopters,
and while upgrade orders have helped fill the delivery gap, the group's
aerospace division shows the effects of the cyclical downturn in the civil
aircraft sector.
The company is expected to hold its interim dividend, with a possible
increase on the 1.25p paid at the same stage last year.
On Friday, Dunhill, the luxury branded goods company, is expected to
announce pre-tax profits for the year to March down at about Pounds 72.2m
compared with Pounds 76m a year ago.
The market will be scrutinising the company's interest receipts, expected to
show the recent cuts in UK base rates. The company is expected to raise its
dividend to 8.1p compared with 7.7p in the previous period.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Economics: Unemployment data expected to show gloomy state
of Europe's labour market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE problem of high unemployment will be taxing the minds of ministers from
the world's leading industrial nations this week, as a string of poor
unemployment data is expected in Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and the
US.
The European figures are likely to confirm the gloomy state of the
continent's labour market, while in the US the markets will be nervously
watching non-farm payroll figures at the end of the week.
The OECD has already announced that unemployment will be one of the issues
dominating the ministerial meeting in Paris on Wednesday and Thursday. In
their discussions, ministers from over 20 countries will focus on promoting
sustainable economic growth, but with the emphasis on the current bad
employment situation, particularly within the European Community.
There will also be discussions on trade as world recession has prompted
countries to become more protectionist. The release of industrial output
figures in Germany this week will come as a timely reminder of the
sluggishness of world growth.
The output figures are forecast to show that economic activity in west
Germany is being depressed by high interest rates even though these are
gradually being eased by the Bundesbank. Some economists are suggesting,
however, that the rate of economic decline in Germany is slowing as
Germany's export industries are helped by continuing growth in the US and
signs of recovery in the UK.
In the US, May non-farm payrolls are expected to show fairly healthy rise.
Economists believe most of the jobs growth will have come from the service
sector. The unemployment rate should remain unchanged at 7 per cent.
The following are the week's other economic highlights and events. Figures
in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International,
the financial information company.
Yesterday: Europe, most markets closed. Canada, March real GDP (up 0.3 per
cent on month). Japan, April industrial production (down 2.6 per cent),
shipments, construction orders, housing starts (up 5.6 per cent on year),

Today: France, Franco-German summit with Mitterrand and Balladur both
representing France. US, May NAPM index (50.4 per cent); April personal
income (up 0.2 per cent), construction spending (up 0.9 per cent); Johnson
Redbook week ended May 29. Japan, March leading diffusion index, coincident
index; May wholesale prices index - second 10 days. Australia, Q4 gross
national expenditure (up 0.5 per cent on quarter), Q4 GDP (up 0.5 per cent
on quarter); Reserve Bank of Australia monthly board meeting. Singapore,
markets closed.
Tomorrow: France, OECD council meets at ministerial level. Meeting lasts
until Thursday. UK, May official reserves (up Pounds 100m), M0 (down 0.7 per
cent on month, up 3.7 per cent on year). Germany, Bundesbank makes address
to German Banks. US, April leading indicator (up 0.3 per cent), new home
sales (650,000). Canada, May Help Wanted Index (89).
Thursday: Germany, Bundesbank council meeting in Frankfurt, Q1 GDP - west
(down 1.5 per cent). US, initial claims week ended May 29 (340,000); state
benefits week ended May 22; money supply data for week ended May 24. Canada,
May foreign reserves. Japan, April current account, trade balance, foreign
bond investment.
Friday: Germany, May unemployment - west (up 40,000), vacancies (down
3,000), short time work - east (down 15,000), unemployment - east (down
22,000); April employment - west (down 50,000). Spain, May official reserves

During the week: Germany, April industrial production (down 0.5 per cent on

FT  01 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Negotiating the barriers
 -Charles Batchelor continues a series answering questions on the European
single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Growing Business Page's Single Market Q&amp;A series is intended to allow
readers to raise issues prompted by the formal launch of the single European
market on January 1 1993
In theory the barriers have come down in Europe but in practice doing
business across borders can be complex and time consuming.
FINDING COMPATIBLE QUALIFICATIONS
Q: We are consulting civil and structural engineers engaged in several
design projects in Germany. In order to obtain the necessary building permit
approval we have been using a local German consultant to sign our design
documentation. However, if we could establish that the various engineering
qualifications were compatible within the EC then we would not need to
employ the middle-man and would be more cost efficient.
What is the relationship between the German Dipl. Ing. degree qualifications
and the British Chartered Engineer status?
A: The German Dipl. Ing. is an academic qualification obtained after at
least three years of study. In Britain, the title of Chartered Engineer is
gained on the successful completion of a degree (accredited by a nominated
institution of the Engineering Council), as well as two years training and
two years relevant experience.
To obtain building permit approval in Germany a British engineer would have
to prove a theoretical qualification - at least three years of study and at
least two years of practice in the required field. The engineer would then
apply to the regional Architektenkammer (chamber of architects) which would
verify documentation and include the engineer on the official list of
architects.
Once on the architects list the engineer should be able to obtain approvals
from the Bauordnungs amt (office for building regulations).
Each German Land has its own building regulations, so British engineers must
apply to the chamber of architects in the Land where they want to work.
However, once an engineer has been recognised in one Land there should be no
problem in obtaining recognition in another.
Freedom to work anywhere in the EC is one of the basic rights laid down by
the Treaty of Rome. The first general directive (89/48/EEC) on the freedom
of establishment of professionals was adopted in 1989. It applies to any
profession regulated in some way by the state and for which at least three
years full-time education and training at university or equivalent level is
required. Among professions covered are lawyers, accountants, teachers,
engineers and physiotherapists.
COMPENSATION FOR RELOCATION
Q: Is there any EC legislation governing the allocation of monetary
compensation to staff as part of a relocation package. I am an American
national, the head office of my company is in Holland and I will be moving
from the Far East to Austria.
A: No EC legislation has been proposed in this area. In the situation
outlined it is probable that the Dutch parent company has general employment
policy guidelines in line with EC employment law. However, those guidelines
would have to conform to Austrian labour law. Austria is not a member of the
Community.
GUIDE FOR WINE IMPORTERS
Q: I wish to import wine from France. Is there a reference book containing
the names and addresses of growers/negotiants in France? What are the VAT
implications on the purchase and export of wine for commercial purposes?
Does a current list of wholesale wines exist?
A: A reference book titled Grappe lists the producers/negotiants by
wine-growing region and covers all of France. This appears to be the most
complete publication of its type and is published by Vininfo at 30 Quai des
Chartrons, 33000 Bordeaux, at a cost of FFr680 (Pounds 80). Vininfo also
offers the information in computerised form, charged at FFr1.40 per address.
French VAT is payable at time of purchase in France if the producer is not
registered for VAT in the UK. Otherwise, VAT is payable on importation into
the UK.
There does not appear to be a centralised list of current wholesale prices
covering all French wines. However, the Bordeaux vineyard publishes an
annual list of average prices per barrel for each wine-growing region. In
addition, the Burgundy/Macon vineyard compiles a list of wholesale prices
for different vintages. For these lists contact: Conseil Interprofessionnel
des Vins de Bordeaux, 1 Cours du XXX Juillet, 33075 Bordeaux. Tel: 56 00 22
66. Fax: 56 00 22 77. Comite Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bourgogne/Macon,
Maison de la Saone et Loire, 389 Ave. du Mal de Lattre de Tassigny, 71000
Macon. Tel: 85 38 20 15.
General information on the labelling, bottling, packaging and documentation
of wine imported into the UK is available from the Wine and Spirit
Association of Great Britain at 1 Queen Street Place, London EC4R 1XX. Tel:
071 248 5377.
PENSIONS POSE PORTABILITY PROBLEM
Q: I am looking for clarification of the position of someone with a UK
company pension who wishes to work in another EC member state.
Is it possible to take out a pension in one member state while working
elsewhere in the Community? It seems strange that the funds paid in by
individuals to pension schemes can be used by pension companies and invested
across the Community while the individuals providing these funds do not have
the same freedom.
A: No, it is not possible to maintain a pension taken out in one member
state if you move permanently to work in another.
This continuation of pension contributions is not prevented by EC
legislation but by national legislation. For example, UK tax law states
that, unless you are taxable in the UK on your earnings, pension
contributions are disallowed. However, if you maintain your taxable status
and residency in the UK then you can continue to contribute. This refers to
both company and private pensions.
Although there is a movement towards finding a solution to the restrictions
you mention, there has been very little development in terms of
harmonisation and the portability of pension schemes throughout the
Community. This is mainly because of the diversity of pensions schemes that
exist in the member states and as a result national legislation prevails.
If you are moving permanently to one of the member states, it might be
possible to arrange for a transfer of your UK pension rights to a scheme set
up by your new employer. However, this would depend on the structure of your
existing pension scheme. The same applies to private pension schemes. It is
only possible to transfer your pension if a complementary system exists in
the country you move to.
If, however, you are posted temporarily by your employers to work in another
member state it is possible to remain in the UK company pension scheme for
up to 10 years.
If you move abroad permanently and you are no longer paying UK income tax
nor earning as a resident of the UK, the simplest course of action would be
to allow your UK company scheme to continue to grow tax free. A number of UK
pension providers offer off-shore pension plans to expatriates.
In the UK there are no restrictions on the investment of pension funds
within the Community. However, restrictions of this kind of operation do
exist in other member states. A draft directive on the investment of pension
funds across the Community is currently being considered by an EC Council
working party.
SEEKING INFORMATION ON SOURCES OF FUNDING
Q: We are looking for information on EC sources of funding for companies for
research and development programmes, training and business development.
A: There is such a wide range of EC programmes in these areas that it is
best to refer to one of the detailed publications available.
A Guide to the European Community Grants and Loans, compiled by Tony Reid,
Eurofi PLC, Guildgate House, Pelican Lane, Newbury, Berkshire, RG13 INK.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Liberal Democrats unveil
six-point plan - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats last week unveiled a six-point programme to back small
businesses.
The programme calls for a government subsidy for bank loans to small and
medium-sized manufacturing companies; grants for innovative small businesses
in high-technology areas; and government subsidy for private-sector regional
venture capital funds which back start-ups. It also urges the banks and
government support agencies to offer equity finance, for a study of the use
of mutal guarantee schemes by groups of businesses and for a statutory right
to interest on unpaid debts.

exporters - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The clamour surrounding 1992 and the opening of the single European market
has died down, but export initiatives are being launched by a growing number
of business support organisations.
The East London Small Business Centre*, an enterprise agency, has
established an export service for businesses in Tower Hamlets, following the
success of eight local firms at a menswear fashion fair in Paris. The centre
will create a database of products that could be exported by local firms,
many in the clothing industry.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): BSI guidance for small
firms - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses which want to register for the BS5750 quality assurance
standard are to be given extra help by the British Standards Institution.
BSI will produce a new guide to applying for BS5750 designed specially for
small firms. It will also consider giving additional guidance to companies
purchasing from small businesses. Some small firms have complained that
purchasers have misunderstood the nature of the standard and insist wrongly
on all their suppliers being registered to BS5750.
BSI will analyse the cost of registering to the standard, evaluate the role
of accreditation in ensuring the quality of the certification organisations
and advise on safeguards small firms may need to seek in using external
consultants.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Differing views of
financial statements - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half of the directors of small companies appear to be unaware they
are responsible for preparing their company's annual financial statements.
Forty three per cent think it is the responsibility of their auditors, while
3 per cent believe it is the job of the shareholders, a survey* of 200
directors by accountants Baker Tilly showed.
From September, auditors' reports will be required to include a statement
explicitly recognising directors' responsibility for the accounts.
The survey, of companies with turnover up to Pounds 2.8m, was prompted by
the government's proposal to remove the audit requirement for companies with
sales of less than Pounds 37,600.
Most of the directors questioned favoured abolishing the audit requirement
for companies of a similar size to their own, but wanted it replaced with a
simpler 'compilation report'. The most popular turnover threshold for an
audit - chosen by 34 per cent of respondents - was Pounds 350,000. the
present limit for the cash accounting for VAT.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Protest blocks Scots harbours
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN yesterday block-aded Tarbert harbour on the west coast of Scotland
in protest at government restrictions on how much time they can spend at
sea.
More than 200 yachts waiting to take part in a race were trapped during the
protest, which also blocked harbours at Kyle of Lochalsh and Oban.
Fishermen say they face ruin if they are forced to comply with conservation
laws which they say restrict fishing time, in some cases, to just 80 days a
year.
Sir Hector Monro, Scottish fisheries minister, defended the restrictions as
forming part of a 'balanced package' to conserve fish stocks and guarantee
the long-term future of the industry.
'The allocation of days at sea are provisional and the intention is to give
fishermen as many days to fish as they had in 1991,' he said.
If they needed more days they should apply for them, he said, adding: 'We
have to take scientific advice on stocks, in the interests of the industry.'
Mr John Henderson, skipper of one of the boats blockading the port at Kyle
of Lochalsh, said he knew of no fishermen who agreed with the legislation.
He said: 'We see this as an evil law, on a par with the legislation that
created the Highland Clearances. I don't think the government have thought
it through and it isn't going to help conservation - it's going to put
fishermen out of business.'
Mrs Winnie Ewing, Scottish National party Euro MP for the Highlands and
Islands, said Mr John Gummer and Mr David Currie, former agriculture and
fisheries ministers, had left a legacy of 'chaos' in the fishing industry.
She said Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new agriculture minister, should
introduce a properly funded decommissioning scheme.
She added: 'It is obvious that the industry is never going to accept the
ridiculous days-at-sea legislation.'

FT  01 JUN 93 / Commercial leases caught between flaws: How the business
property market might be reformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE wake of controversy over new powers for residential leaseholders, the
government is turning its attention to commercial leaseholders.
Last week the Department of the Environment published a consultation paper
in response to 'concerns about the operations of commercial property
leases'.
Tenants have attacked leases lasting for 25 years, with upward-only rent
reviews. They say they are inflationary and inflexible, and the system for
agreeing rent charges has forced up their costs when they are fighting for
survival.
The paper was welcomed by the Property Market Reform Group, a lobbying
organisation, which said: 'It opens up the whole issue of the commercial
leasehold system and its outdated and inflexible practices. We are hopeful
that a better system will come out of it.'
The topics under scrutiny are:
Upward-only rent reviews. These clauses, which became standard in commercial
leases in the mid 1970s, can lock tenants into paying rents well above the
market rate. Critics argue that they are inflationary, they expose tenants
to unreasonable risk and they lead to more insolvencies.
Defenders say the clause balances the risk between tenants and landlords and
its abolition could cause a steep fall in capital values.
Reforms could include measures such as the prohibition of upward-only review
clauses. Other measures, such as allowing rents to move downwards, subject
to a floor set by the initial rent, may be considered.
Confidentiality clauses. These are used to keep rent agreements secret, so
that concessions granted to one tenant are not quoted against the landlord
in another negotiation.
Critics say that such clauses distort the market and can lead to rents being
set higher than they would be otherwise.
Supporters say that as the law does not prohibit confidentiality clauses
generally, it would be unreasonable to ban them in the property market.
Moreover, many property experts say that in practice these clauses have
little impact on the market.
The options available to the government include banning confidentiality
clauses and requiring the details of leases to be registered at the Land
Registry.
Dispute resolution procedures. Disputes about rent reviews are generally
resolved by the appointment of a third party.
Some critics say that the system acts against their interests because the
third parties - generally surveyors appointed by the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors - are too closely involved in the property market.
The dispute system is also criticised as being too slow and too costly.
Supporters of the existing system deny that arbitrators show bias, saying
that if they did they would be exposed to claims for professional
negligence. They say that the costs of the existing system may well be lower
than they would be if a new body were introduced.
The department believes there are three options: to take no action; to
introduce regulations to control the content of rent-review clauses; and to
allow disputed rent reviews to be referred to a government-appointed
tribunal.
A reasonable degree of support is likely to be received for some of these
options. The institution believes 'a fresh look at confidentiality clauses
is long overdue'.
But, in general, government intervention in commercial leases is likely to
be resisted. Most landlords say that the existing system reflects freely
negotiated contracts. They say that the market is adjusting of its own
accord - few tenants are now prepared to sign 25-year leases with
upward-only rent reviews.
Landlords fear that any attempt to favour tenants at their expense will
deter investors and reduce the property available to rent. Parallels are
drawn with the decline of the rented housing sector following legislation
supporting tenants' rights.
The existing system helps underpin the value of commercial property.
Changing leases could lead to further difficulties for banks and financial
institutions which have suffered from falling lease values.
Indeed, ministers' comments on the subject suggest they will be cautious
about legislation. They have already said that no legislation will affect
existing contracts - unlike measures in the residential sector in which
existing leaseholders are being given new rights to buy.
There may be an unwillingness on the part of the government to interfere in
freely negotiated contracts. Mr Tony Baldry, junior housing minister,
recently stressed that distortions invariably resulted from statutory
control. 'The terms of a private contract . . . are entirely a matter for
negotiation,' he said.
Another reason for caution on the part of the government is that it has
already proposed legislation which could have an important impact on the
relationship between landlord and tenant.
Changes to the law of privity of contract, announced at the end of March,
will limit a tenant's responsibility for paying rent throughout the duration
of a lease. As a result, it is likely to reduce the security of a building's
income and the value of a landlord's investment.
The government may be forced to balance the risk of inflicting further
damage on the property industry against the opportunity to reform a system
which has demonstrated severe flaws in recent years.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Raising cash from the wreck of BCCI: Sources to be tapped by
liquidators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS WERE last week offered a faint glimmer of hope for repayments from
the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was closed by
regulators in July 1991.
At an angry creditors' meeting, Mr Christopher Morris, a partner with
accountants Touche Ross and one of the liquidators to BCCI under English
law, offered the prospect of a dividend some time next year.
He said creditors could expect to receive 15p in the pound next year if the
liquidators' proposals were successfully endorsed. He stuck to a
'conservative' estimate of a total dividend of 30p to 40p in the pound 'some
years' in the future.
Several obstacles still need to be overcome and additional assets to be
recovered.
Any dividend will come from four principal sources:
Contributions from the majority shareholder. The liquidators have negotiated
an agreement with the government of Abu Dhabi, which owns 77 per cent of
BCCI. That could lead to payments of between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars
2.2bn, permitting a dividend next year. Much of this money could already
have been released but is dependent on ratification by the Luxembourg courts
following an objection by three BCCI creditors.
They want a larger contribution or the right to sue Abu Dhabi - which would
be sacrificed under the agreement. The court is reconvening in a few weeks
to consider the matter further.
Asset recoveries from BCCI. The liquidators have so far realised just 4.5
per cent of the stated Dollars 14bn in assets of the bank in July 1991. They
are continuing to maintain some loans made by the bank, and estimate they
will be able to realise a further 6.7 per cent.
They are still charging commercial rates on outstanding loans but are not
applying bank charges against depositors. Interest will be paid until the
date BCCI passed into liquidation, January 3 1992.
Legal action. Writs have been issued in London for more than Dollars 8bn by
the liquidators against Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney - now part of
Ernst &amp; Young - as auditors to BCCI, and for Dollars 10.5bn in the US
against the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin
Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer.
Last week the liquidators also issued a writ against the Bank of England on
behalf of depositors for allegedly failing in its role as regulator. There
may be other writs to come.
Investigations. Teams of accountants are still tracing unspecified sums of
money removed from the bank over many years into a complicated network of
offshore trusts and secretive bank accounts. But the recoveries will
probably be small. Much of the outstanding money shown in BCCI's books
appears to have been squandered through bad loans or was falsely reported
and never existed.
In addition, some creditors have already been able to take advantage of
deposit protection schemes in their own jurisdictions - such as the English
creditors, who are offered 75 per cent of the value of their deposits up to
Pounds 15,000.
But that presents some problems. Those who used the equivalent scheme in the
Isle of Man, for instance, have handed all their powers to the island's
financial supervision commission. This makes it difficult for them to sue
the commission if they decide it failed as a regulator.
More generally, creditors will be keeping an eye on the results later this
month of the ballot to choose five from the 23 candidates to sit on the
formal BCCI creditors' committee. This group will oversee the work of the
liquidators and advise them on future actions - including further writs -
while monitoring the fees, which so far run to more than Dollars 133m
(Pounds 85m).

FT  01 JUN 93 / Power station may be sold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NUCLEAR Electric, the state-owned nuclear power generator, is preparing to
put the disused Bankside power station in Southwark, south London, on the
market, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The building is more likely to be demolished than converted, although the
Tate Gallery has considered housing a gallery in it.
The 6m cu ft brick structure was built on an 8 1/2 acre Thames-side site in
1957. It was recently given a certificate of immunity from listing and its
future depends on the planning brief to be negotiated with the local
authority.
The building was one of the assets given to Nuclear Electric when it was
created. The company has paid Pounds 2.5m for the removal of asbestos, with
which it was contaminated.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Plans for social fund under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES BY the European Commission to broaden the remit of the European Social
Fund will reduce the amount of money spent on training the long-term
unemployed, the government says.
The Department of Employment is opposed to the proposal, which would affect
the distribution of the Pounds 250m a year received by the UK for the
unemployed.
Brussels wants to reform objectives three and four of the social fund,
devoted to training the young, the long-term unemployed, women with
disabilities and women returning to the labour market.
It wants its funding to provide added value to labour-market measures rather
than to provide a subsidy to national unemployment schemes. And it wants to
direct money to the retraining needs of industries in decline or change.
The aim is to reskill workers before they become unemployed and smooth their
transition into alternative employment - a move seen by the UK government as
a disguised industrial policy.
The department said in a consultation document issued to bodies including
local authorities and training and enterprise councils that the government
was opposed to the new objective four - which was 'to facilitate the
adaptation of workers to industrial change and to changes in production
systems.'
This was unlikely to yield good value for money, as in the UK about two
thirds of the unemployed left the unemployment register within six months,
it said.

FT  01 JUN 93 / EC rule on work hours angers Hunt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, the new employment secretary, yesterday attacked the European
Community's directive to introduce a maximum 48-hour working week as
'unnecessary and bureaucratic'.
A meeting of EC employment and social affairs ministers in Luxembourg today
is expected to approve it.
Britain will abstain in the vote over the 48-hour directive. It has already
secured an opt-out of its provisions for the next 10 years - unlike its EC
partners which have three years to implement it.
Approval does not require a unanimous vote by the EC ministers, which means
Britain will be unable to block approval of the directive. But Mr Hunt's
public attack on the proposal after only four days in his new job suggests
his arrival at the department will bring no change to the British
government's generally hostile attitude to much of the EC's social
programme.
Although described as being on the left of the Conservative party, Mr Hunt
shares the conviction of his party's right wing that EC directives such as
the one on a 48-hour working week are a burden on the European labour market
that threatens competitiveness.
He said yesterday on the BBC's Today programme: 'Forcing employers and
employees throughout Europe to restrict their working hours is the sort of
unnecessary regulation which is going to result in a loss of world markets.'
Mr Hunt said he hoped his EC colleagues would 'allow common sense to
prevail' and concentrate on solving Europe's unemployment crisis - 17m are
jobless.
Britain is also likely to find itself isolated today in Luxembourg over a
directive to introduce mandatory consultative works councils in large
pan-European companies.
Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, expressed
support for the 48-hour directive.
He said: 'Our route to success must lie through high skills and high
productivity. These will only come through the higher standards of social
protection limits, such as working hours and worker involvement in
decision-making. Europe cannot compete by driving standards down but only by
raising them.'
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said: 'If Tory arguments were
right the British, with the poorest employment laws, would be the most
prosperous in Europe, have the fewest out of work and the best balance of
trade.
'In fact, our standard of living has fallen to eighth position in the EC
tables, our real jobless total is the highest in the EC and we have the EC's
worst trade deficit with the rest of the world.'

FT  01 JUN 93 / Lib Dems suggest early end to mortgage tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN END TO mortgage-interest tax relief for home buyers in the future is
envisaged in a housing policy paper published by the Liberal Democrats
yesterday.
The document makes it clear, however, that the tax break would continue for
all those who currently receive it. For everyone else it would be replaced
by a new benefit - housing cost relief - which would be available both to
home owners and to tenants on the basis of need.
While the party's policy is that mortgage-interest relief should simply be
allowed to wither over 10 to 25 years, the paper also floats the option of
phasing it out over five years, to release the money saved for other
projects.
In particular, it suggests that the immediate end to mortgage-interest tax
relief could save Pounds 5.2bn in the first year, which could be used to cut
the basic rate of income tax or to build new homes.
Government help for people who have fallen behind with mortgage payments or
who have mortgages above the current value of their homes is also proposed
as an alternative use for the savings.
One of the aims of the policies in the paper is to end the bias towards home
ownership and to allow people the opportunity to move between rented
property and owner-occupation in either direction.
The Conservatives share the objective of reviving the private rented sector
but the question of mortgage-interest relief is so politically contentious
that Tory campaigners believe the paper will provide them with valuable
material to use against the Liberal Democrats.
The paper also proposes:
A reformed and more generous housing benefit system.
Greater accountability for housing associations by separating the monitoring
and financial roles of the housing corporation.
The introduction of 'partnership housing' to bridge the gap between normal
housing association rents and the private rented sector.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Kalms backs ethics studies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STANLEY KALMS, the chairman of high-street electrical goods retailer
Dixons, has donated money for the promotion of ethics to another two
academic institutions.
One beneficiary is the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, which will
consider how to apply Jewish beliefs to the modern world.
Mr Kalms would not specify the amount, but said: 'It is an open-ended
commitment.'
The donation follows his announcement last month that he had given money to
the University of North London - formerly the Polytechnic of North London -
to help fund a readership in business ethics and strategic management.
The university said that his contribution, from the Stanley Kalms
Foundation, will amount to about Pounds 10,000 a year for three years.
Last July he made a donation of Pounds 1m from Dixons to the London Business
School for a chair in business ethics and social responsibility.
There are already two other related academic posts in the UK: the DBM chair
in corporate governance at Leeds University and the Co-Operative Bank chair
of corporate responsibility at Manchester University.
Mr Kalms originally offered the money to the economics department at the
London School of Economics, which he said declined the offer, saying that
such a subject properly belonged in the philosophy department.
There has been some concern about the way in which the interviews for the
chair at the London Business School have been conducted, with little
advertising, no job description and long delays before unsuccessful
candidates were notified.
But Mr Andrew Likierman, a professor who sits on the appointment committee,
said yesterday: 'I am very very happy to defend everything about this
appointment. Everything has been above-board.'

FT  01 JUN 93 / Leftwing stalwart in seamen's union: Obituary of Jim Slater
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JIM SLATER CBE, general secretary of the National Union of Seamen from 1974
to 1986, has died aged 69.
Denounced in 1966 by Labour prime minister Harold Wilson as 'one of the
tightly knit group of politically motivated men' behind the damaging
seamen's strike of that year, he played a leading part in his union's reform
movement, which ousted the rightwing old guard in the early 1970s.
An earthy Socialist from Tyneside, he did much to improve seamen's pay and
conditions and relax tough disciplines on board ship.
A stalwart of the left faction on the TUC general council, he was an
opponent of nuclear power - and of the 1982 Falklands war - and a doughty
fighter for the miners in their 1984-85 strike.
Elected to the union's executive in 1964, he became a full-time official six
years later and assistant secretary in 1970 before being elected
general-secretary in 1974. In 1986 he was compelled to retire as a result of
a power play.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Number of Lloyd's agencies 'to fall sharply'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of agencies at Lloyd's of London is set to fall sharply as new
corporate investors demand much higher standards of advice and service, a
new report has concluded.
Mr Oliver Laughton-Scott, director of De Lisle Jessup Scott, the insurance
consultancy which prepared the report, said: 'This is Lloyd's big bang.'
Lloyd's announced at the end of April that it hoped to attract incorporated
capital by the start of next year as part of its new business plan. It is
preparing a rulebook which will outline the terms on which 'incorporated
Names' - which will trade on the basis of limited liability - can
participate.
The report suggests that the number of members' agencies - which handle the
affairs of the individual Names who provide the market's capital - at the
market could eventually fall to as low as eight. Seventy members' agents
traded at Lloyd's last year, compared with 83 in 1991.
The report suggests corporate investors will demand rigorous information
about the market when they choose which of the market's 200 or more
syndicates to support.
Members' agents and Lloyd's advisers will need to be big enough to bear the
costs of providing necessary analytical and advisory services and maintain a
broad spread of investors. 'The requirement for a higher standard of
analysis is likely to put smaller members' agents under increasing
pressure,' the report says.
It suggests that agencies which combine members' and managing agent
functions - where they both look after the Names who provide the market's
capital and manage syndicates - will find it increasingly difficult to
survive. The number of so-called 'combined agencies' fell from 37 in 1991 to
32 last year.
Pointing to the ability of combined agencies to sustain their own syndicates
by channelling capital towards them, the report says new corporate investors
'will be more alert to the inherent conflicts of interest' and 'are likely
to require firmer safeguards'.
Additionally, members' agents which are part of combined agencies may find
access to detailed information from rival managing agents more difficult
than independent members' agents, it says.
The report is sceptical of Lloyd's ability to ration capacity available to
new investors through an auction or bidding system.
'The proposed auction system will require investors to bid for participation
without being able to guarantee participation on specific syndicates. This
will prove unacceptable to potential investors,' the report says.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Retail sales set to confirm 'brittle' upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL SALES figures for May are likely to show a rise and 'there is no
doubt that a recovery is under way', according to a survey of purchasing
intentions published today. But economic recovery is still 'brittle and
gradual', says the report by Verdict Research, the economic research group.
The Verdict report for April accurately anticipated the slump shown by the
that month's retail spending figures. That was the first month-on-month
decline this year, exposing the fragility of the recovery.
However, Verdict says in the past year 'there is a reasonably clear trend'
of improvement in spending plans, which have 'picked up markedly in the past
three months'.
The monthly survey of 2,000 consumers' spending plans for the next six
months shows that more intend to buy a car, electrical appliances and men's
clothes than was the case in April. However, it warns that 'consumers'
attitudes to buying cars have tended to be a little volatile'. Plans for
house buying have been steady for four months, it says.
The increases in spending intentions were particularly marked in the north
and south of the country, but spending plans in the Midlands were reined
back. Almost all of last month's increase came from 35-to-54-year-olds.
The official May retail sales figures will be released within the next three
weeks.
Looking further ahead, a separate report by Staniland Hall Associates, the
economic forecasters, warns that consumer spending will rise by less in 1994
than in 1993. It saysthe rise in constant prices will be about 2 per cent
this year but only 1.3 per cent next year.
The report supports the Verdict survey's findings that consumer confidence
rose in May, and that householders' intentions to move are broadly steady.
But the intensifying squeeze on pay, the prospect of a rise in inflation and
the tax increases that will take effect in 1994 will cause spending to
flatten out in the second half of this year, the Staniland Hall survey says.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Nadir defends Mates in growing row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, has stepped into an embarrassing
political row over his connections with Mr Michael Mates, a middle-ranking
minister.
Mr Nadir defended the minister's conduct, saying that his help had been
'much appreciated by me in my fight for justice'.
Mr Mates yesterday sought to quell the growing political row by saying he
had no idea that the former chairman of the collapsed Polly Peck empire was
planning to jump bail. But Labour gave notice that it intended to pursue the
matter.
MPs believe that Mr Nadir sought help from a number of other politicians,
including his constituency MP, Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage
Secretary, but there is no suggestion that any apart from Mr Mates
responded.
Mr Mates, a minister in the Northern Ireland office and MP for East
Hampshire, said in a statement yesterday that he had been advised it was
proper for him to pursue matters raised by a constituent who was one of Mr
Nadir's advisers, even after he became a minister last year.
As for a watch that Mr Mates had given Mr Nadir after the businessman's own
had been taken by solicitors for trustees in bankruptcy, Mr Mates said it
was 'intended and accepted as a light-hearted gesture'.
Mr Mates emphasised that he had not known of Mr Nadir's plan to break the
terms of his bail and leave the UK for Cyprus, and added that it was an
action of which he strongly disapproved.
Explaining why he had acted as he did, Mr Mates said: 'Some months after I
had been appointed to the government further matters were brought to my
notice which seemed again to merit examination.
'Having obtained advice that it was still proper for me to do so, I again
met the attorney-general. There followed further exchanges of
correspondence, all of which took place well before Mr Nadir left the
country.'
Mr Nadir, speaking from Cyprus, said that Mr Mates had acted after being
asked by one of his constituents to refer 'certain wrongdoings of the
Serious Fraud Office and others to the attorney-general'.
Mr Nadir said: 'I thank God that there are people in Britain who are
prepared to see justice prevail, in particular Mr Michael Mates MP.'
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, insisted that Mr John Major
should look into the minister's actions.
He also questioned Mr Mates's judgment in giving Mr Nadir the watch.
This view appeared to be endorsed by Mrs Betsy Wilson, Mr Mates's
constituency chairman. She said: 'Perhaps with hindsight it was not very
sensible. Obviously it has not done him, the party or his future much good.'

FT  01 JUN 93 / Price advantages are slipping away: Exporters fear the
recession in Europe is cutting into gains made from a weak pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, KEVIN DONE, DANIEL GREEN, PAUL ABRAHAMS, ANDREW
BAXTER and PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH industrialists are warning that the full potential for an export-led
recovery in the UK is starting to be undermined by the widespread recession
affecting European markets.
Last year's devaluation of sterling has already provided a sharp boost to UK
exports outside the European Community, government statistics show. But in
spite of evidence of strengthening sales for many companies in continental
Europe - an area that accounts for one-third of UK exports - there are fears
that export growth is starting to be hit by weakening demand.
Some UK companies are managing to achieve larger market shares because of
increased competitiveness, although they warn that any further appreciation
of sterling could remove the price advantage for British products. Other
businesses say higher sales are being accompanied by lower selling prices
and smaller margins.
Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said:
'There are clouds on the horizon. The prospects for exports to Europe are
now suffering a severe squeeze as the main European economies fall into
recession.'
Nine months after sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism
businesses believe improved competitiveness is being increasingly offset by
poor trading conditions.
The sharp fall in sales of new vehicles in continental Europe, for example,
is hitting exports by UK car producers such as Ford and General Motors'
subsidiary Vauxhall.
The impact on the overall UK car export effort will be softened, however, by
the rapid increase of UK production by the three Japanese carmakers Nissan,
Honda and Toyota. All three producers are aiming to export about three
quarters of their UK car output.
The UK operations of GM and Ford are more exposed to falling European sales
as they have recently started exporting a significant share of their output.
In spite of improved UK demand, Vauxhall's UK assembly plants have
introduced short-time working in the face of the steep decline in European
demand. But with UK plants providing the lower cost base, the deeper cuts
are more likely in Europe.
Ford, which last year exported more than half of the output from its
Dagenham, Essex plant, is becoming increasingly concerned that the fall in
new car sales in Germany, France, Italy and Spain will hit UK production.
Rover believes that the devaluation of sterling has given it a strong
competitive advantage in continental Europe this year and that gains in
market share will cushion the fall in the overall European market.
Mr Richard Robson, managing director of Fermec Holdings, the construction
equipment manufacturer that exports to Europe, says that on balance his
business has gained from recent events. 'If the gain is 100, the offset is
about 70, which comes equally from the weakness in Continental markets,
particularly France and Germany, and from the higher cost of imported
components from Denmark and Germany.'
Mr Malcolm Taylor, managing director of Bridgeport Machines, one of the UK's
largest machine tool makers, said devaluation and the internal problems of
the German machine tool industry handed his company 'a tremendous
advantage'.
He added: 'Our German sales had grown significantly over the past three
years and it was becoming our best European market. The problem is that
nobody there is buying machine tools now.'
The chemicals sector reports the same experience. Mr Richard Freeman, chief
economist at Imperial Chemical Industries, said: 'The slowdown in demand,
particularly in Germany, has been partly offset by the benefits of
devaluation. But weak demand is having the effect of undermining prices in
all the basic chemicals. Exports are getting through but not in the
quantities they ought to be.'
Textile and clothing exporters to Europe report that recession is already
outweighing the benefits of price competitiveness.
Mr Ronald Miller, chairman of Dawson International, the luxury knitwear
manufacturer, reported a 20 per cent fall in sales in France in spite of a
distinct price edge from devaluation. The company has managed to raise sales
in Germany but at the expense of margins.
Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, Britain's largest textile
manufacturer, said European profits were likely to be lower this year, with
the climate in Germany and France 'very difficult'.
Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer through which Britain's clothing
manufacturers export almost Pounds 150m-worth of goods to Europe, said heavy
competition for sales was forcing price cuts - of up to 30 per cent in
Holland, for example.
For the UK-based spirit companies profit margins are under pressure as
consumer spending dips across Europe. Grand Metropolitan's growth in Europe
has slowed since last autumn in the face of recession in important markets
such as Spain, France and Germany.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman of T&amp;N, the UK automotive components groups, echoed
many industrialists in calling for a period of exchange-rate stability so
that gains in market share could be consolidated.
He said: 'Our German competitors are losing money and still they are cutting
prices to compete with us. The Germans are fighting a big rearguard action.
In this situation it would be a shame if the pound were to harden against
the D-Mark because that could stop the build-up of orders.'
The CBI said that for the moment its members were not unhappy about the
value of the pound. But if it went much higher industry would again be
banging on the Treasury's door demanding action.

FT  01 JUN 93 / TUC to act over pay bias against union members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADES Union Congress plans to complain to the International Labour
Organisation about a controversial amendment in the government's new labour
legislation allowing employers to discriminate against trade unionists by
denying them wage rises if they refuse to sign personal contracts.
Mr Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, has written to Mr David Hunt,
the new employment secretary, pointing out that 'the amendment, if it passes
into law, would clearly be a violation of ILO convention 98 on the right to
organise and collective bargaining.
'I sincerely hope the government will abandon the amendment,' Mr Willis
says. If not, the TUC will lodge a formal complaint with the ILO, which has
already found that Britain has breached conventions it signed on good labour
practices nine times since 1979.
The TUC argues that ILO convention 98 - ratified by Britain in 1949 -
upholds the general principle that no person should be prejudiced in
employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union
activities.
The TUC has already complained to the ILO over two other parts of the Trade
Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill. Those cover the abolition of the
wages councils - ending legal protection for the low-paid - and the removal
of the statutory duty on the conciliation service Acas to promote collective
bargaining.
The TUC is lobbying some Conservative backbenchers in the hope that they may
oppose the amendment, which has concerned some Tory peers. But union leaders
believe the Commons will pass the measure and that it will come into force
later this summer.

SIR John Davis, former chief executive, chairman and president of the Rank
Organisation, died last week, aged 86.
His astute investment in the copying machine company Xerox meant that Rank
Xerox became one of the UK's most successful conglomerates.
He became managing director of the Rank Organisation in 1948, controlling
more than 500 cinemas in Britain.
He drove the group to diversify at a time of British cinematic decline into
a wide range of other leisure and technical businesses, forming Rank Xerox
in 1956.
Photocopying eventually came to account for more than 40 per cent of the
group's turnover.

Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'The way to improve

Asked whether the doctors weren't playing God, Baroness Cumberlege said:

FT  01 JUN 93 / Barristers urge extension of fixed fees in legal-aid cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BAR HAS proposed that the system of paying barristers fixed fees for
criminal legal-aid cases in Crown Courts should be extended in order to cut
administrative costs and speed payments.
This proposal from the barristers' body could undermine the legal
profession's campaign against plans to introduce standard fees for criminal
legal-aid work in magistrates' courts. The Law Society, the solicitors'
body, has - with the support of the Bar - applied for a judicial review the
decision to introduce such fees.
In a submission to the Lord Chancellor's department the Bar proposes that
barristers in criminal cases lasting up to 10 days be paid a base fee of
Pounds 250, plus a daily fee of Pounds 160.
The base fee would be adjusted to reflect the seriousness of the offence,
the number of defendants represented, the length of the trial and whether
the barrister was a QC.
Standard fees for criminal legal-aid work in the Crown Courts were
introduced in the early 1980s and apply to about 85 per cent of such work.
The Bar believes its support for standard fees in the Crown Court does not
undermine efforts to stop Lord Mackay introducing standard fees in
magistrates' courts.
The magistrates' court scheme involves a standard case fee irrespective of
the work done on it by lawyers, whereas the Bar's proposals for the Crown
Court allow variations in fees for each case.
The Law Society argues that Lord Mackay's magistrates' court proposals will
result in overpaying lawyers in some cases and underpaying them in others,
and could lead to some lawyers cutting corners.
Meanwhile the introduction of formalised plea bargaining in England and
Wales is opposed by Justice, the all-party law reform pressure group, in a
report published today.
Plea bargaining, where defendants agree to plead guilty in exchange for a
lesser sentence, is expected to be recommended by the royal commission on
criminal justice which is due to report next month.
The government and prosecution authorities see it as the best means of
improving the efficiency of the criminal justice system.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, and Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of
public prosecutions, believe that encouraging defendants to plead guilty at
an early stage could reduce the number of 'cracked trials' - trials which
are aborted when the defendant changes his plea to guilty at the last
minute.
Mr George Staple, director of the Serious Fraud Office, sees plea bargaining
as the best solution to long fraud cases. Judges and barristers are also
overwhelmingly in favour.
Justice says, however, that poor administrative case management and the
absence of effective pre-trial procedures is the main cause of cracked
trials. 'Administrative problems need administrative and management
solutions rather than changes in the substantive law,' it says.
Although it is already accepted that guilty pleas generally lead to
reductions in sentences, Justice is concerned that formalised plea
bargaining could result in some innocent people pleading guilty.
'It could rapidly lead to a system which becomes accustomed to looking for
guilt and which penalises those who opt for jury trial,' the report says.
It could also lead to inaccurate and unfair sentences as judges would be
asked to give indications of sentence without having all the facts.
Justice calls for better liaison between prosecution and defence and
effective pre-trial reviews, earlier withdrawal of weak cases by the Crown
Prosecution Service, a more open system of sentence discounts, guidelines
for cases in which discounts are appropriate and a sentencing commission to
ensure consistency.

The report, by management consultants Price Waterhouse, will be presented to
the council on Thursday. Its findings are likely to be made public the
following day.
The study is part of the government's attempts to bring greater efficiency
to the public sector through its market-testing programme, which looks into
ways the non-core activities of quangos can be hived off to the private
sector.
In the case of the Arts Council, which last year received Pounds 225m of
government money to distribute in support of the arts, the report is
believed to have considered how efficiently it has served the 10 regional
arts boards. Its grant is to be cut by Pounds 5m this year.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Low wage costs 'fail to draw foreign investment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S LOW labour costs are not attracting investment by foreign
industrial companies, says a study published today by the Trades Union
Congress.
The TUC points out that the share of foreign-owned companies in UK
manufacturing employment fell during most of the 1980s and by 1989 had
recovered only to its 1981 level of 15 per cent.
It says: 'Foreign direct investment, a measure of financial flows which
includes takeovers, increased between 1985 and 1989 but more than half of
this took the form of takeovers of existing assets rather than new
investment.'
It points out that inward direct investment has fallen sharply from 3.4 per
cent of gross domestic product in 1989 to 1.8 per cent last year.
Since 1985 the net outward investment flow has 'amounted to a loss' of more
than Pounds 36bn at 1992 prices - equivalent to more than a year's
industrial investment in plant and machinery.
The TUC also argues that Britain has lower wage rates than its main
industrialised trading rivals but the country's competitiveness remains weak
because of poor productivity due to the lack of skills and training, and a
low level of technological investment.
According to the TUC's figures for 1991, wages remain lower in Britain than
the US, Germany, France and Italy but productivity remains even lower.
The TUC says that Britain is in no position to compete on labour costs with
low-wage economies such as Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore but
'nor is it yet in a position to compete with other industrialised countries
on skills, productivity and innovation'.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Mates tries to calm Nadir-link row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Mates, a middle-ranking minister, yesterday sought to quell the
political row about his connection with the fugitive businessman Mr Asil
Nadir. He made clear that he had no idea that the former chairman of the
collapsed Polly Peck empire was planning to leave the UK.
Mr Nadir also defended the minister's conduct, saying that his help had been
'much appreciated by me in my fight for justice'.
Labour gave notice that it intended to pursue the matter further.
Mr Mates, a minister in the Northern Ireland office and MP for East
Hampshire, said in a statement that he had been advised that it was proper
for him to pursue matters raised by a constituent who was one of Mr Nadir's
advisers, even after he became a minister last year.
As for the watch that Mr Mates had given Mr Nadir after the businessman's
own had been taken by solicitors for trustees in bankruptcy, Mr Mates said
it had been 'intended and accepted as a light-hearted gesture'.
Mr Mates emphasised that he had not known of Mr Nadir's plan to break the
terms of his bail and leave the UK for Cyprus, and added that it was an
action of which he strongly disapproved.
Explaining why he had acted as he did, Mr Mates said: 'Some months after I
had been appointed to the government further matters were brought to my
notice which seemed again to merit examination.
'Having obtained advice that it was still proper for me to do so, I again
met the attorney-general. There followed further exchanges of
correspondence, all of which took place well before Mr Nadir left the
country.'
Mr Nadir, speaking from Cyprus, said that Mr Mates had acted after being
asked by one of his constituents to refer 'certain wrongdoings of the
Serious Fraud Office and others to the attorney-general'.
Mr Nadir said: 'I thank God that there are people in Britain who are
prepared to see justice prevail, in particular Mr Michael Mates MP.'
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, insisted that Mr John Major
should look into the minister's actions.
He added: 'I have asked Mr Major to find out why Mr Mates took up this case.
MPs do not normally take up cases of those who are not their constituents
unless there are compelling reasons.'
He also questioned Mr Mates' judgment in giving Mr Nadir the watch, even as
a joke by the minister.
This view appeared to be endorsed by Mrs Betsy Wilson, Mr Mates'
constituency chairman.
She said: 'Perhaps with hindsight it was not very sensible. Obviously it has
not done him, the party or his future much good.'

FT  01 JUN 93 / Australian dollar slips as deficit raises fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN dollar yesterday fell to levels last seen during the 'banana
republic' crisis of 1986 as financial markets responded to a
worse-than-expected current account deficit for April.
The government said the deficit contracted to ADollars 1.7bn (Pounds 760m),
from a restated ADollars 1.9bn in March, mainly because of a 7 per cent fall
in the value of imports and a 2 per cent increase in exports.
However, the deficit was significantly higher than market forecasts of
between ADollars 700m and ADollars 1.3bn, contributing to fears that
Australia's sluggish economic recovery may be unsustainable.
The Australian dollar closed 1.5 cents lower at 67.68 US cents in Sydney, in
spite of intervention by the Reserve Bank, and dealers said downward
pressure was likely to resume when markets re-open today.
The currency also fell to fresh lows against the Japanese yen for the fourth
consecutive day, reaching a trough of Y72.44 before closing at Y72.60 from
Y74.10 on Friday.
The Reserve Bank's trade weighted index fell from 50.5 to 49.4, down 13 per
cent since May 1992, and just 0.1 points above the record low of 49.3 in
1986.
The 1986 low followed a warning by Mr Paul Keating, the then federal
treasurer, that Australia was heading for a 'banana republic' debt crisis
unless it solved its chronic current account problems.
Mr Ralph Willis, finance minister, said yesterday the cumulative current
account deficit for the year to the end of June was 'broadly in line' with
the government's budget forecast of ADollars 15bn.
Economists said the April figures were out of line with weak domestic
activity, suggesting that Australia had made little headway in reducing
imports, while the sluggish world economy had slowed export growth.
A further batch of figures due today is expected to confirm that Australian
gross domestic product is growing at about 2.5 per cent a year, in line with
official fore-casts.
Growth of at least 3 per cent a year would be required to achieve the
government's main economic aim of reducing unemployment from the current
level of just under 11 per cent.
However, the bad current account news and the weakness of the currency
suggest that the Reserve Bank will be reluctant to use monetary policy to
encourage faster economic growth.
Fiscal policy is also constrained by market worries about the growing budget
deficit, which is likely to exceed ADollars 16bn in the year to the end of
June, compared to ADollars 12bn in 1991-92.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Patten ditches June deadline for HK talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, is preparing to ditch his June
deadline for the completion of Anglo-Chinese talks about the colony's
political future after advice that more time will be needed to assess
China's willingness to strike a deal.
The Hong Kong government is expected to abandon formally its hope that an
agreement be reached before the summer after the fifth round of talks which
are due to be held in Beijing from June 14 to June 16. The earliest a full
agreement could be achieved is September or October.
Hong Kong government officials said that the fourth round of talks, which
ended in the Chinese capital on the weekend, produced no initiatives from
the Chinese side.
However they said it was clear that Beijing had moved from talking about the
principles on which the talks would be based to the substance of the
electoral arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 elections.
One described the talks as 'hard pounding', but the prevailing view of the
negotiating team was that China intended to make a deal.
Mr Patten's preparedness to let the talks run longer than first planned is
bound to be met with accusations from liberal politicians that he is backing
away from his plans for political reform. These seek to broaden
participation in Hong Kong's politics and have been hotly contested by
China.
The governor also runs the risk that Beijing will interpret the abandonment
of the deadline as a sign of weakness. China is likely to try to split his
reform bill and attempt to deal with issues relating to the colony's 1994
polls before considering the 1995 polls.
Hong Kong officials insist this will not be done and that Mr Patten is
prepared to abandon negotiations if it becomes apparent China has no
interest in reaching an agreement.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Tokyo and Beijing renew security talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN and China have agreed to exchanges of military officials to discuss
regional security issues for the first time since 1989, when Tokyo halted
defence exchanges after the crushing of the Chinese democracy movement.
Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, said in Tokyo his government
supports the resumption of bilateral and multilateral discussions of
regional security issues, but does not yet want to establish a 'fixed
framework' to resolve regional disputes.
Japanese officials see the restart of military exchanges as an opportunity
to engage Beijing in foreign policy debate and to put gentle pressure on
China to limit military spending, which has risen sharply in recent years to
upgrade the technological capability of the People's Liberation Army.
Mr Qian, who returns to China today after a four-day visit, said Japan and
the US should not put too much pressure on North Korea to rescind its
decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treat. He suggested
that 'dialogue' will be more useful than sanctions in resolving the issue.
Japanese officials yesterday complained to Mr Qian about repeated attacks on
Japanese fishing boats in the East China Sea, some of them apparently
apparently carried out by the Chinese equivalent of the coastguard and
others by modern day pirates.
The Chinese foreign minister complimented Japan on its participation in the
UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, but warned that Beijing is still
concerned about the deployment of Japanese military personnel abroad and
Tokyo should think carefully before making new commitments of troops.
Mr Kabun Muto, Japan's foreign minister, was apparently relatively blunt in
his discussions with Mr Qian, raising the issue of Hong Kong's 'openness',
which few Japanese officials have wanted to discuss in bilateral meetings
for fear of offending Beijing. He also suggested that China stop nuclear
testing, halt the export of weapons to nations which the developed world
deems as hostile, and control its worsening air pollution, which has led to
acid rain in Japan.
Mr Qian said nuclear testing will continue, though the number of tests will
be limited to as few as is necessary to maintain China's preparedness.

JAPANESE authorities have put off providing the European Commission with
information on the government's recent procurement record despite persistent
requests, a Commission official said yesterday.
The Commission has given Japan a list of 20 product sectors where it would
like to see greater Japanese government procurement from EC companies in the
light of its Y10,700bn (Pounds 64bn) economic stimulus package announced
last summer. The sectors include motor vehicles, telecommunications,
computers, transport equipment and aerospace equipment.
'We don't want to just hear that there has been a new stimulus package, like
a fireworks festival, without knowing what the result is,' a Commission
official said. 'We are asking the Japanese authorities to reveal (that)
information,' the official said. 'Otherwise it becomes void of meaning.'
In January Japan reluctantly agreed to an EC proposal to monitor EC-Japan
trade to analyse the factors affecting the comparative performance of EC
products on the Japanese market. The aim was to conduct a joint analysis of
EC companies' performance in Japanese markets to determine what problems
they faced and what could be done to deal with those problems.
The EC proposal came amid mounting concern about Japan's growing trade
surplus with the EC which increased 14 per cent in 1992 to a record Dollars
31.2bn and was at first hailed as a more rigorous EC approach to trade with
Japan.
Although the Commission has taken pains to stress that the analysis was to
be a co-operative effort, the business of an EC-Japan working group was
hampered from the start by disputes over the proper statistics to use to
monitor trade between the two sides.
At high-level consultations which followed in April, Mr Horst Krenzler,
director-general for external economic relations at the EC Commission, made
clear the EC expects substantial progress in the analysis, including the
effects ot the economic stimulation package on imports, by the time of the
EC-Japan summit in July. An official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
responsible for European matters, denied that the failure to provide
information was deliberate. 'We are aware that the EC is interested in such
information but we have not been asked officially to provide information on
specific government purchases,' he said.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Japan output fall points to frail economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S economy is bumping along the uneven bottom of the downturn which
started about two years ago, according to official figures published
yesterday. These showed that industrial production fell in April, reversing
gains in the previous two months.
Industrial output fell by 2.2 per cent in April from the month before, after
rising in both March and February. Those gains had encouraged some Tokyo
politicans and economists to predict the economy was starting to recover.
The fall in production in April - combined with weak housing starts, which
rose by 1.1 per cent from April last year, and the impact of the
strengthened yen on export industries - suggest the economy remains frail.
However, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry expects industrial
production will start to recover from the autumn, largely because industry
is finally making sustained progress in reducing its inventories of unsold
products,
In spite of the fall in production, inventories of unsold products fell in
April by 1.7 per cent from the month before - to stand 4.9 per cent lower
than April 1992.
It was the fifth consecutive month in which inventories had declined.
Housing starts weakened considerably from March, when they rose by 9.3 per
cent, possibly influenced by the end of the financial year.
April starts on houses by private individuals fell by 2 per cent from the
previous month. Houses being built with loans from the private sector fell
by 11.6 per cent, in part because home buyers expect mortgage rates to rise
following the recent increase in the long-term prime lending rates of the
long-term credit banks.
Meanwhile, the Japan foreign trade council predicted that Japan's
merchandise trade surplus for the year to next April would rise by 17.6 per
cent from the previous year to Dollars 130bn (Pounds 83bn).
Exports would rise by 6.9 per cent to Dollars 368bn, while imports would
increase by only 1.9 per cent to Dollars 237.5bn.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Illusory gains of Britain's 'competitive devaluation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM the sheltered environment of the British Home Office, chancellor
Kenneth Clarke must step into the real world. Managing the government's
current exchange rate and fiscal policies in the face of the harsh financial
markets and the UK's irritated European partners leaves little room for the
robust approach. Mr Clarke may find it politic to join the rest of his
colleagues in biting his lip when Britain's partners boo and hiss.
The ostensible cause of the present continental hostility towards the UK is
the accumulating evidence that British economic growth has revived,
following sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last
September. Meanwhile, the rest of northern Europe slips towards recession.
With economic cycles so out of line, the British government argues that
re-entry into the ERM would be foolish. But even if Britain's
Euro-enthusiastic chancellor wanted to bring sterling back into the ERM, it
is uncertain that re-entry would soothe the wounds.
More likely, the UK would be accused of trying to 'lock-in' a lower exchange
rate, at the expense of its European partners. For the UK, along with Spain
and Italy, stands charged with using last September's difficulties to gain
an advantage through 'beggar-thy-neighbour' devaluations. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer,
the Danish central bank chief, said last week that monetary co-operation in
Europe had broken down because devaluing currencies had been allowed to
'win' an unjustified advantage.
Mr Hoffmeyer is not the first person to make this charge. Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, said recently that monetary union was
needed to 'put an end to competitive devaluations.' Mr Jacques Delors, the
European Commission president, also worries that the Single Market would not
survive if Europe were hit by further 'competitive devaluations'.
The UK, Spain and Italy have indeed seen an improvement in the price
competitiveness of their exports within Europe since last summer, as the
charts show. Against a trade-weighted basket of European currencies and
adjusted for relative inflation rates, the Spanish peseta and the Italian
lira have both depreciated by 14 per cent since last August. The UK real
exchange rate initially fell by 13 per cent, but sterling's subsequent
relative strength has reduced the gains in export competitiveness, within
Europe, to 7 per cent.
The accusation of competitive devaluation does not seem fair. The
implication that Spain, Italy or the UK deliberately chose to devalue does
not fit the facts. Politicians in all three countries staked their
credibility on defending the ERM parities; some, notably Mr Norman Lamont,
have suffered for their failure. Since all three countries have suffered
rising trade deficits in recent years, it seems wrong to argue that these
devaluations increased competitive advantage. They were rather about
removing the competitive disadvantage of over-valued real exchange rates.
In the case of the UK, the charge is empirically incorrect. Since the
beginning of 1987, when the hardened ERM emerged, Spanish competitiveness
has improved by 7 per cent, while Italian competitiveness has improved by 11
per cent. But UK competitiveness has declined by 9 per cent, as the chart
shows. The UK's gains since last summer do not compensate for the loss of
competitiveness during sterling's appreciation between 1987 and 1988 and the
UK's relatively high inflation between the end of 1989 and 1992.
The charge that the British government engineered a competitive devaluation
looks weak. The risk for the rest of Europe is not that the UK is going to
'lock-in' at too competitive a rate. The danger for continental Europe is
rather that the combination of Britain's trade and fiscal deficits with a
bombastic chancellor may send sterling spiralling down again, unless
sterling rejoins the ERM soon. A better strategy for northern Europe would
be to stop complaining and start wooing.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Go-ahead from India for ABB's locomotive deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government has approved, after more than five years of argument,
a controversial Dollars 190m contract to import high-technology electric
locomotives from Asea Brown Boveri, the European engineering combine.
The deal has faced intense opposition from supporters of India's large
domestic raliway engineering industry, who argued the country should build
its own locomotives with the minimum of overseas help. Critics also said
that India, a poor country, could not afford state-of-the art technology.
But the cabinet of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, on Friday
approved a contract for the import of 30 locomotives, and for the transfer
of technology which would enable Indian factories to produce many more such
machines over the coming decade.
India first invited bids for the contract in 1987, but it was not until
March 1992 that it decided to grant the contract to ABB, rather than three
other international bidders.
The deal's opponents were helped when the issue went before the Railway
Convention Committee, a government advisory panel, last autumn.
The panel said it would be better for India to develop its own cheaper
techology, adding that ABB's locomotives, powered by a newly-developed
alternating current motor controlled by microchips, would be much more
expensive than an upgraded version of India's existing electric locomotives,
run on traditional direct current motors.
However, the cabinet has accepted ABB's argument that its machines will be
cheaper and easier to run in the long term.
Ministers may also have been swayed by concern that India, now opening its
economy wider to foreigners, should not be seen turning its back on a
foreign company already committed more than most to India. ABB's Indian
affiliate employs more than 4,000.

<TEXT>
EFFORTS to appoint an independent board of governors for the state-owned
South African Broadcasting Corporation foundered last night, the African
National Congress having rejected board appointments announced earlier in
the day by President FW de Klerk.
He met Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, yesterday to discuss the
appointments, but the ANC later accused Mr de Klerk of 'gross interference'
in the selection, saying the independence of the board had been compromised.
The ANC called on new board members, including the chairman-designate, Prof
Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, to refuse their appointments, a call which many
will find difficult to refuse.
Mr Pallo Jordan, ANC information director, defended the ANC action by
arguing that Mr de Klerk had violated the process agreed with the ANC for
appointing board members - choice based on recommendations by an
independent, multi-racial panel of jurists.
The panel's first two lists were rejected by the president, including its
choice of chairman, Prof Njabulo Ndebele of the radical University of the
Western Cape. Mr de Klerk complained that the high political profile of some
nominees violated agreed criteria.
'By his unilateral action President de Klerk has undermined a cardinal
principle that underpinned this entire process - that it be free of
government or political party influence. This calls into question the SABC's
future independence,' the ANC stated.
Mr de Klerk also rejected left-wing nominees such Mr Jakes Gerwel, radical
rector of the University of the Western Cape, left-wing journalists Mr
Moeletsi Mbeki and Mr Khaba Mkhize, and Mr Allister Sparks, former Rand
Daily Mail editor
The row will complicate the choosing of a board to ensure the impartiality
of the SABC in the run-up to the country's first multi-racial elections, due
by April next. Constitutional negotiators plan to announce an election date
on Thursday, though there are signs a delay to the announcement.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S leading business association, Fedecamaras, has warned that
delays by the Congress in choosing a new interim president have caused a
power vacuum and a spate of national confusion.
The crisis developed after May 21, when the chairman of the Venezuelan
senate, Senator Octavio Lepage was sworn in as acting president of
Venezuela, in place of President Carlos Andres Perez who was suspended from
office to face corruption charges.
The governing Democratic Action (AD) party and opposition groups have not
yet agreed on a replacement for Mr Lepage to complete Mr Perez's term, which
is to expire next February.
At the weekend, the ruling party suffered a defeat in two gubernatorial
elections. In the eastern state of Sucre, the candidate for the socialist
party MAS, Mr Ramon Martnez, beat the AD contender, Mr Gaston Navarro. In
the western state of Barinas, unofficial returns gave a narrow win to the
candidate of the main opposition Christian democratic Copei party, Mr
Gerhard Cartay, over Mr Rafael Rosales of AD.
The results mean that opposition parties have now wrested control of most
state governorships away from the ruling party. Of the 22 governorships,
Copei holds 11, while AD has eight.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Perot attacks Nafta over 'threat to jobs': Prince of the pie
charts returns to the screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROSS PEROT, independent presidential candidate in the US last year, this
weekend accused the Clinton administration of using taxpayers' dollars to
promote the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Texan billionaire warned Americans that the pact with Canada and Mexico
would jeopardise their jobs.
In a paid television 'info-mercial', he made his case against Nafta with the
sort of pie charts and graphs he wielded during the presidential campaign,
and with film of Mexican slums.
Greedy factory owners would move south of the border to take advantage of a
minimum wage of 58 US cents (37 pence) an hour, Mr Perot said. The loss of
US jobs would make it impossible to balance the US budget.
'If you and I sit here complacently, it will create the giant sucking sound
I've been talking about,' he said of the job flight to Mexico. He urged
voters to write 'Nafta yes' or 'Nafta no' on a piece of paper and send it to
their Congressmen, the White House and him.
Mr Perot excoriated the 'lobbyists in the employ of foreign governments',
who he said had written the agreement. He signed off the half-hour broadcast
somewhat awkwardly, concluding, 'I love you'.
Supplements to the Nafta, signed last year for the US by the Bush
administration, are being negotiated by Washington, Ottawa and Mexico City.
After that, the accord would need approval by the US Congress.
The Clinton administration had sought, even before the Perot appearance, to
limit the damage with a show for the press - billed as 'a serious in-depth
discussion' - by three members of the cabinet. Although they came prepared
with their own visuals, to argue that jobs would be lost with or without a
Nafta, they inexplicably kept cameras out of the briefing room.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, used his graph to demonstrate how
exports to Mexico had soared in 1986-92, creating 425,000 relatively
well-paid US jobs in the process. Handling the popular Mr Perot gingerly, Mr
Kantor said the unpredictable billionaire had been 'misled' about the threat
of job losses. The Nafta would enhance the prospects of small and medium US
businesses which cannot penetrate Mexico's tariff walls.
'Opponents of this agreement are looking at the future through a rear-view
mirror,' he said.
When the presentation was taken up by Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the
council of economic advisers, the focus shifted from the impact of the Nafta
to the outcome if it were not to be enacted. Mexico's liberalisation 'could
easily be derailed', and many of the new jobs created could be lost, she
said. 'There's a great cost to not going forward.'
Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, said: 'Long term, America cannot compete
on the basis of low wages. The only way we can build up the American economy
is through a very different strategy premised on education, training,
infrastructure and resources in the private sector, to continue to invest in
America.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS for a new and powerful world trade body in place of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be taken out of the Uruguay Round of
global trade talks and 'greened', the World Wide Fund for Nature says today.
The Swiss-based environmental group has timed its latest shot across Gatt's
bows for the opening of the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris tomorrow, when
trade issues and completion of the Uruguay Round will top the agenda.
WWF says the current proposal for a multilateral trade organisation is not
compatible with the goal of sustainable development set out at the Earth
Summit last year. It says the MTO should recognise 'the need to set limits
on trade in order to adequately protect the environment'.
Arguing that the creation of the MTO has been 'unacceptably secretive', WWF
also wants the MTO draft opened for public consultation rather than decided
by trade negotiators behind closed doors.
Environmental groups, especially in the US, have been campaigning vigorously
against the MTO, which would subsume Gatt and proposed sister bodies on
intellectual property, such as patents and copyright, and trade in services.
They argue that the MTO would institutionalise the primacy of free trade
over environmental protection and make it easier to challenge high national
standards on environmental protection as unfair trade barriers.
These charges are denied by governments taking part in the round but the
campaign has reinforced fears that the MTO proposal could threaten US
Congressional approval of the Uruguay Round package of trade liberalising
measures.
The environmentalists' hand has also been strengthened by the more explicit
environmental protection language in the North American Free Trade Agreement
by the US, Mexico and Canada.
WWF proposals for reforming the MTO include making environmental protection
and eradication of poverty explicit objectives, giving non-governmental
organisations rights of consultation and enabling them to make submissions
to trade disputes investigations, aa well as establishment of a trade and
sustainable development council within the MTO.

THE BANK of Israel said yesterday that economic growth could slow down in
the country because of the end of a house building boom, Reuter reports from
Jerusalem.
It also urged the government to accelerate the sale of public companies,
increase competition and reform the labour market.
A government building drive to house an influx of immigrants from the former
Soviet Union had boosted the economy for two years but the fillip was over,
said the central bank said in its 1992 report.
It said gross domestic product rose 6.6 per cent (revised from 6.4 per cent)
in 1992, compared with 6.2 per cent (revised from 5.9 per cent) in 1991.
Exports had displaced housing as the key growth factor, rising 14.4 per cent
in 1992.
But the report said this was, in part, compensation for a decline of 1.5 per
cent in 1991 exports, prompted by the Gulf War when activity was slowed by
Iraqi Scud missile attacks.
Unemployment, which the central bank called the government's main economic
problem, rose to 11.2 per cent in 1992, from 10.6 per cent in 1991.
Inflation was in single digits for the first time in 23 years - 9.4 per cent
compared with 18 per cent in 1991.
'Not enough was done this year in the area of privatisation, increasing
competition and making the labour market more flexible,' the 350-page report
said, echoing charges in January by Mr Haim Stoessel, Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange chairman, that the government had missed an opportunity by not
selling more companies in 1992.
The sale of shares in three state companies raised 1.1bn shekels (Pounds
256m) in a year when the general stock market index rose by nearly 74 per
cent on doubled volume.
'There was room for increasing competition in the communications, public
transport and banking branches. 'In the banking area, (there is a need for
reform) that will increase competition, while reducing potential conflicts
and maintaining banking stability,' the report said.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, has reshuffled the cabinet to
quell a government crisis which, he said, could have disrupted the Middle
East peace talks.
Mr Rabin, convincing ministers in his Labour party to cede portfolios to the
leftist Meretz bloc on Sunday, ended the crisis that had begun last month
when the ultra-religious Shas party demanded he remove Ms Shulamit Aloni,
outspoken education minister.

PRESIDENT FW de Klerk yesterday announced the appointment of the first
independent board of governors for the state-owned South African
Broadcasting Corporation, for decades the mouthpiece of the ruling National
party.
The new 25-member board, chosen on recommendations by an independent
multi-racial panel of jurists, is to be chaired by Professor Frederick van
Zyl Slabbert, a respected academic and former liberal politician.
The board is charged with ensuring the impartiality of the SABC before the
country's first multi-racial elections, due by April next. Constitutional
negotiators plan to announce an election date on Thursday.
Yesterday, Mr de Klerk met Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National
Congress, to discuss the board appointments before the final announcement.
This underlined increasing co-operation by the government and the ANC on
such issues of state.
The new board includes Mr Christo Viljoen, the outgoing chairman, Prof
Pieter Potgieter, Dutch Reformed Church moderator, Mr Enos Mabuza, a black
businessman, and Ms Brigalia Bam, an official of the ANC-aligned South
African Council of Churches.
They were chosen on recommendations by an independent panel accepted by
political parties across the range. The panel held public hearings to screen
candidates short-listed from 400 nominations.
Controversy arose after the president had rejected the panel's first
recommendations, which included left-wing nominees with a high political
profile, such as Mr Jakes Gerwel, radical rector of the University of the
Western Cape, left-wing journalists Mr Moeletsi Mbeki and Mr Khaba Mkhize,
and Mr Allister Sparks, a former Rand Daily Mail editor.
Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela also discussed progress at the constitutional
talks, due to end on Thursday with announcement of a package including an
election date and the outline of an interim constitution.

PRESIDENT Lech Walesa yesterday told Poles the country's market reforms must
not stop 'half way' and he was ready, should the need arise, to place
himself at the head of the 'movement of reforms'. The president dissolved
parliament last week ahead of new elections in September.
The TV speech came after Mr Walesa had signalled continuing support for Ms
Hanna Suchocka, the outgoing prime minister and her cabinet by vetoing
planned pension rises which threatened to destroy this year's budgetary
targets.
The increases which were approved recently by parliament and would have
added 21,000bn zlotys (Pounds 800m) to this year's 81,000bn zlotys budget
deficit or the 5 per cent of GDP agreed at the beginning of the year with
the IMF.
The unpopular decision follows a no-confidence motion in the week. This led
Mr Walesa to dissolve parliament, leaving the government with a caretaker
role until the elections.
Yesterday Mr Walesa also announced he would approve an election law which
will eliminate from the next parliament parties which fail to win 5 per cent
of the vote.

<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday appealed to the United
Nations to step in and protect the besieged town of Gorazde, which has come
under heavy attack from Serbs.
At the same time, Italy condemned the 'brutal' killing of three Italian
civilian drivers with an international food convoy in central Bosnia.
Gorazde, an enclave of 60,000 people encircled by Serb forces, is one of six
predominantly Moslem towns already declared 'safe areas' by the UN.
But Bosnian Serbs appear to be taking advantage of the international
community's delay in implementing the Washington accord on 'safe areas' by
stepping up attacks on key areas in eastern Bosnia still under Moslem
control.
Bosnian radio said 11 people were killed and 34 injured in artillery attacks
on Gorazde, where the local population of 35,000 has been nearly doubled by
an influx of refugees from nearby areas. There was also fighting in Brcko in
north-east Bosnia, as Serb forces resumed efforts to broaden a corridor
linking Serbia with Serb-held areas in east and west Bosnia.
UN military officials in Vitez disclosed that three Italian civilian drivers
were killed by gunmen wearing Bosnian Army uniforms in central Bosnia on
Saturday.
They said five Italians delivering food were halted by 30 armed men and a
woman on the road between Novi Travnik and Gornji Vakuf. The gunmen pulled
all five Italians from their vehicles, robbed them and led them away on
foot.
The officials quoted the two survivors, who were found yesterday, as saying
that two of the gunmen then fired at their feet from behind. As the Italians
ran, the gunmen fired again, killing three of them.
The Yugoslav federal parliament last night voted President Dobrica Cosic out
of office. Mr Cosic was toppled by hardline Serb nationalists.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is pressing the Group of Seven industrialised
countries to set up a multi-billion dollar fund to assist the non-Russian
former Soviet republics - and has pledged that it will start the fund with
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from its own scarce foreign resources.
The plan, being debated within the International Monetary Fund and between
senior officials of the G7 states, would be designed to stimulate trade
bwtween these countries and specially between them and Russia - dominant
market and raw materials supplier in the former Soviet Union.
Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, the executive director for Russia at the IMF, said
in an interview that 'This fund will be designed to stop the total
disintegration of states - like Moldova, Armenia and Georgia - as well as to
stimulate trade between all the former Soviet republics including the Baltic
states. We should act to see to it that there is not a total disintegration,
as in Yugoslavia.'
Mr Kagalovsky said that over the past year, Russia had given hundreds of
millions of roubles in credit to the former Soviet states - the bulk of it
in 'hidden subsidies' which took the form of subsidised energy and other
products sold at prices often fraction of world levels.
This fund, which Mr Kagalovsky said had been approved by Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, would be a way of exercising
'conditionality' on the other former USSR states - rewarding their efforts
to co-operate and trade with each other. Mr Kagalovsky said he expected the
issue would be discussed at the G7 simmit in Tokyo in July and it may be
decided there.
The continuing pulling apart of the former Soviet republics is now causing
increasing concern in Moscow as the effects of severance of links between
industrial partners components becomes more serious.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has urged the greater integration
of the Commonwealth of Independent States which unites all of the former
Soviet republics except the Baltic countries, Georgia and Azerbaijan - but
so far without noticeable effect.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Belgrade's price: 205% a month inflation: Kerin Hope
assesses the consequences of a year of UN sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGRADE cab-drivers have no objection to changing a 5m Yugoslav dinar note,
now that a 10-minute ride through sparse traffic in the city centre costs a
million dinars.
A year after UN economic sanctions were imposed against Serbia and
Montenegro, their most tangible effect is hyper-inflation on a scale not
seen in Europe since the aftermath of the Second World War.
According to official figures, the monthly inflation rate reached 205.4 per
cent in May, compared with 114.4 per cent in April. After a 56 per cent
decline in real wages over the past year, the average monthly salary in
Serbia is equivalent to just Dollars 20.
'The government blames speculators for the explosion in inflation, but it is
itself responsible: it is furiously printing money to cover the budget
deficit and to keep basic state enterprises going,' says Prof Tomislav
Popovic, director of the Belgrade Institute of Economic Sciences.
More than 1m workers, about 40 per cent of the Serbian workforce, who were
laid off by closures of factories hit by sanctions, are still being paid 80
per cent of their salary, although there are complaints that payments are
several months late.
Soaring inflation has created a booming illegal foreign exchange market
around Belgrade. To bolster their dwindling reserves, some state banks
resort to sending employees into the street to buy hard currency for dinars
from black market dealers.
Many Serbian companies now exchange their cash flow into hard currency on a
daily basis to keep operating, says Mr Dragisa Petrovic, owner of Zi Strong,
a private savings bank.
'I started this business to conserve my capital after I had to stop
exporting because of sanctions. It could be much bigger, but I'm afraid the
government may soon clamp down on private credit institutions,' Mr Petrovic
says.
The impact of tighter sanctions, in force since late April, is clearly
reflected on the black market, where the rate against the D-mark has fallen
from 62,000 to 400,000 dinars.
It is now more difficult for Serbian companies to evade the embargo by using
false import and export documents purporting to come from Bosnia and
Croatia, which are both exempt from sanctions.
Moreover, the new ban on transit trade through the rump Yugoslavia has
closed a loophole by which goods from Greece or Bulgaria, apparently
destined for central Europe, wound up on the Serbian market.
About Dollars 1.5bn in Serbian and Montenegrin assets held abroad has been
frozen, with another Dollars 4bn in debts owed to Yugoslav companies abroad.
'The tighter sanctions are hitting the economy very hard. We are at the
point where even though sanctions don't apply to imports of medical
supplies, we don't have enough hard currency to buy what we need,' says Mr
Zoran Ilic, deputy minister for foreign trade.
Gross national product in Serbia and Montenegro is forecast to drop by about
30 per cent this year to around Dollars 8bn. This will mainly be due to a
drastic fall in industrial output, already down by 40 per cent in the first
five months of 1993.
However, only a small decline in agricultural output is expected, despite a
prolonged drought and shortages of fertiliser, which are blamed on the
sanctions. This year's wheat harvest will easily cover needs for the next
year, although sugar production will fall, according to government forecasts
So far, the embargo on oil sales to Serbia and Montenegro is proving more of
an inconvenience to car-owners than a disaster for manufacturing. With
electricity production largely covered by coal and hydropower, Serbia's own
oil output can be used to keep basic industries working.
'We haven't yet reached the point of total economic collapse. But at the
present rate of decline, we'll get there at some point in the next six
months, with people having to start selling their assets in order to buy
food,' Prof Popovic says.

BOSNIAN Serbs appeared to be taking advantage of the international
community's delay in implementing the Washington accord on Moslem 'safe
areas' by stepping up attacks on key areas in the east of the country still
under Moslem control.
The industrial town of Gorazde, the last Moslem stronghold in eastern
Bosnia, came under heavy attack.
Bosnian radio said 11 people were killed and 34 injured in artillery attacks
on Gorazde, where the population of 35,000 is thought to have doubled with
the arrival of refugees from nearby areas. Gorazde is one of six
UN-designated 'safe areas' for Moslems in Bosnia. But a UN convoy bringing
humanitarian aid was unable to reach the town on Sunday.
There was renewed fighting in the town of Brcko in northeast Bosnia as Serb
forces resumed their efforts to broaden a corridor linking Serbia with
Serb-held areas in eastern and western Bosnia. The Serbs have forced most
Moslems to evacuate the town.
Agencies reported that fighting that broke out in the southwest city of
Mostar between Bosnian Croats and Moslem-led government forces on Sunday
evening lasted into the night and small arms fire was still reported
yesterday morning. A senior UN refugee official yesterday accused Bosnian
Croat troops of launching an 'ethnic cleansing' campaign in Mostar and
expelling scores of Moslems daily.
Mr Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), said several elderly Moslems had been 'terrorised to death',
suffering heart attacks after Croat militiamen invaded their homes and
ordered them out.
'This is ethnic cleansing of up to 100 people a day and it has been picking
up in the past few days,' he told Reuters.
After heavy shelling on Sunday, in which 24 people were reported killed and
more than 170 wounded, Sarajevo was quiet yesterday.

FT  01 JUN 93 / The European Market: Headaches over VAT changes - Surprises
thrown up by the new regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXES may be one of life's great certainties but meddling with the tax
system can produce some unexpected results. The far-reaching changes to the
European Community's VAT regime introduced on January 1 are a case in point.
Second-hand car dealers in Belgium have seen much of their business move to
Luxembourg now that purchasers can bring back vehicles without paying
Belgian VAT. In Luxembourg VAT is levied on the dealer's mark-up; in Belgium
it is charged, at a higher rate, on the vehicle's original list price.
Similarly, marinas and boat repair yards around the EC's Mediterranean
coastline have seen business shift to Turkey, Malta and North Africa, as new
rules have closed a loophole exploited by wealthy yacht owners mooring their
yachts outside the country of registration.
No business engaged in cross-border trade within the EC has been unaffected
by the new tax rules, but some specialist sectors have been particularly
hard hit.
The previous system of inspecting shipments and collecting trade statistics
as the goods crossed borders has been done away with. Companies now file
details of shipments directly to their customs authorities.
Border delays and a mass of export documentation have also been removed. But
in their place has come a system which many traders and accountants have
denounced as adding a new layer of complexity. The EC hopes in 1997 to move
to a system of levying VAT on the exporter, but until this can be achieved a
transitional system, with a host of exceptions to the rules, has been
brought in.
The new system has succeeded in reducing border delays. Journey times have
fallen throughout the EC, according to the UK's Institute of Freight
Forwarders.
But the demands placed on companies' computer and data-collection systems by
the need to collect their own trade data have imposed severe strains. UK
Customs say they have obtained the January returns from 77 per cent of those
businesses required to file the more detailed monthly statistics, just above
their target of 75 per cent.
However, accountants and business organisations such as the CBI suspect this
has only been achieved by companies devoting considerable resources to
collecting the data manually.
Problems have also arisen in a range of important areas, some quite
unexpected. These include:
Repair. A UK company which repairs a piece of machinery for, say, a French
customer must, under the new tax regime, charge VAT. The VAT is reclaimable
but only after a long delay and UK repairers fear they will lose business,
says Mr Alan Buckett of accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn.
Modified rules are now being prepared which would allow businesses to
short-circuit this difficulty.
Commodities. Oil and metal traders found that, for the first time, their
transactions had become liable to VAT. Since stocks in store in tanks or
warehouses often change hands dozens of times - without actually moving
anywhere - deals were creating dozens of invoices each with a corresponding
VAT liability. Although the VAT was reclaimable, once again, it took time,
imposed a heavy administrative burden and had serious cash flow
implications.
The London Metal Exchange spent several months negotiating with the VAT
authorities in each member state to overcome this problem. Agreement has
been reached with most countries, with the exception of France, the LME
said.
Similar problems have faced the oil trade and London's International
Petroleum Exchange. Three or four-country trade. Special rules have been
brought in to help companies in one country buying goods from another
country and selling on to a third, so-called 'triangular trade'. But if two
middlemen are involved and there are four steps in the sales chain,
complications have emerged, says Mr John Arnold of accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand. The middlemen are finding they have to register for VAT purposes,
which can be costly and time-consuming, and pay VAT.
Processing. Definitions differ around the community - as they do for repair
 -which gives an advantage to companies in certain countries. In addition,
problems have arisen for companies which, instead of returning the processed
raw materials to the original supplier, sell it on to a third party. This is
forcing companies to register needlessly for VAT. Distance sales. Mail order
companies and newspaper, magazine and book publishers selling more than
Ecu35,000 (Pounds 27,230) (or Ecu100,000 in some countries) to private
individuals in any country must register for VAT in that country and pay VAT
at the local rate. Registration imposes a high cost relative to the value of
the goods they are supplying.
UK Customs says companies are better off under the new VAT regime. Many have
yet to be convinced.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Italy plans to give banks wider role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Italy is to seek changes in legislation to permit banks to
invest directly in non-financial concerns.
The announcement was made yesterday by Mr Antonio Fazio, the new governor of
the Bank of Italy, presenting the central bank's annual report.
The changes could have important ramifications for the Ciampi government's
privatisation programme, allowing the banks to take stakes in the L30,000bn
(Pounds 13.1bn) sell-off planned over the next three years.
Mr Fazio avoided spelling out details of the proposal or the extent to which
state-controlled banks, which account for nearly two thirds of the banking
system, should become involved.
He merely said: 'The limits on the size of shareholding in a given company
will be defined on the basis of the bank's assets, its structure, results
and management.'
He was also careful to point out that the banks 'must not act as
shareholders of last resort nor convert debts into shares in companies
making chornic losses.'
It was not clear whether the move represented a genuine attempt to expand
the role of Italian banks or the provision of a safety net for government
sell-offs.
At a time of recession with limited prospective buyers, a small stock
exchange and the public's savings heavily geared towards buying high
yielding/low tax treasury bills, the Italian banks are among the few
institutions with the resources to help out.
Mr Fazio took over as governor on May 4 after designation of Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi as prime minister. Under Mr Ciampi, the governor's annual
speech had become the most important occasion on which the Bank of Italy
judged the state of the economy and government policy.
With Mr Ciampi as prime minister, Mr Fazio's strictures against government
efforts to reduce the public sector deficit were low key.
He contented himself with saying it was vital that the 1993 public sector
deficit of L155,000bn had to be reduced in absolute terms in 1994 and
succeeding years.
He pledged to work to help reduce the real cost of money which remained well
above the EC norm.
He predicted growth in 1993 would 'not be above the already modest levels of
1992' when the economy grew 0.8 per cent.
He said a surge in exports as a result of the lira's devaluation could
provide a launch-pad for higher growth but inflation had to be held down. He
declined to predict an end of year figure for inflation, currently running
at 4 per cent annually.
In a brief reference to the economic effects of the corruption scandals, Mr
Fazio said bribes and contract rigging had swollen public spending.
'The ending of these practices in the short term could act as a break on
economic activity; but very quickly a more open market system will benefit
us all.'
A significant part of Mr Fazio's statement was taken up by a defence of the
Bank of Italy's commitment to fixed exchange rates within the European
Monetary System and the handling of the EC currency crisis in September.
Between mid-June and mid-September 1992, Italy lost Dollars 48bn in
reserves.
The bank has suggested no date for re-joining the ERM but Mr Fazio yesterday
appeared to share the commitment of his predecessor for closer monetary
union: 'Rather than changing the rules of the EMS, it is a question of
having full co-operation on their proper implementation.'

FT  01 JUN 93 / OECD ready for rush to discuss growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago, hardly any top-level ministers showed up.
This year, officials organising the two-day annual ministerial meeting of
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which
starts tomorrow in Paris, are wondering how to handle the crush of finance,
trade and foreign ministers planning to attend.
The interest in this week's meeting reflects mounting international concern
about weak global growth, rising unemployment and protectionism.
The US delegation is expected to be headed by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury
secretary, Mr Mickey Kantor, the special trade representative, Ms Laura
Tyson, head of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, Mr Lawrence
Summers, the Treasury undersecretary responsible for international affairs,
and Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary.
Following last Friday's disclosure of weak first quarter US economic growth,
European observers fear that the US will renew pressure on its trading
partners for more expansionary economic policies and trade enhancing
measures, while making clear that Washington will not hesitate to retaliate
against what it perceives to be unfair trading practices.
It is an approach that has provoked alarm among America's allies on several
occasions since President Bill Clinton moved into the White House. If
repeated this week, it would set the scene for a difficult meeting.
In the run up to this week's talks, the OECD secretariat has become
increasingly gloomy about slow global growth.
But it feels that as long as most countries are running large budget
deficits there is little scope for any to adopt a more expansionary fiscal
policy.
A possible exception is Japan, but its ministers will say that they
announced a large fiscal expansion programme earlier this year and should be
left to implement it.
On the other hand, European diplomats recognise the pressures that an uneven
and seemingly jobless recovery are putting on the US administration.
Unemployment will feature large in this week's talks. Ministers will be
presented with the interim conclusions of a two-year study commissioned from
the OECD last year into the industrialised world's jobless problem.
It is stronger on analysis than prescription, offering no magic solutions
while drawing some bleak conclusions.
Europe's job creation record appears to be especially poor, with the net
increase in jobs since the early 1970s having been produced entirely by the
civil service. Europe also has a very high level of long-term unemployed,
with about half the region's jobless without work for more than a year.
These facts could trigger a vigorous debate about the barriers to employment
in Europe and especially those which prevent young people taking low-paid
jobs.
While opponents of 'poverty wages' argue that these create and perpetuate
social problems, the OECD itself is sympathetic to the idea of the young
gaining work experience even if the pay is low.
The problems of rising unemployment in the industrialised world will cast a
shadow over discussion of the OECD's area's relations with non-member
countries.
The delegates will have to reconcile their professed belief in free trade
with the fact that non-OECD countries have been gaining markets from the
industrialised world.
The OECD secretariat is also keen for ministers to consider the implications
for member economies of technological change, especially in the related
fields of communications and computers.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Spanish Elections: Gonzalez in late bid to snatch lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Felipe Gonzalez, the embattled Spanish prime minister, last night began a
late comeback ahead of the June 6 general elections, with a spirited
performance in a final television debate with his conservative challenger,
Mr Jose Mara Aznar, leader of the Partido Popular (PP).
Accusing his opponent of doing little more than 'solemnising the obvious'
for repeatedly insisting that Spain needed to creat more jobs, Mr Gonzalez,
for the first time, may have damaged Mr Aznar by playing successfully on his
vagueness.
Not once did Mr Aznar, constantly goaded by the prime minister, detail any
policy plans should the PP win next Sunday. Mr Gonzalez also used the debate
to reveal a drop of 40,000 people in the number of unemployed.
The debate, which experts assume will have been decisive in moving, one way
or the other, the support of up to 6m undecided voters, 20 per cent of the
electorate, was ill-tempered.
Mr Gonzalez accused Mr Aznar of falsely denying having accused him of being
an international 'nuisance' when he was fighting for more European funds for
Spain at the EC summit in Edinburgh last year.
Mr Aznar accused the prime minister of lying by suggesting that PP tax
policies would reduce pensions. He tried unsuccessfully to unsettle Mr
Gonzalez throughout the debate by laughing at him.
Nevertheless, Mr Gonzalez did not badly dent Mr Aznar, whose party is
running ahead of the Socialists in opinion polls.
What he did was remove the doubts about his desire to win a fourth term in
office, which his weak performance in the first TV debate a week ago had
raised.
Nevertheless, with just five days to go before the election, Mr Gonzalez and
the Socialists will have to come a long way from behind.
Even the most favourable of opinion polls, published at the weekend and
yesterday by the daily newspaper El Pas, shows the PP leading the Socialists
by 34.8 per cent of the vote to 34.5 per cent.
El Pas found that the Socialists, in power in Spain since 1982, had lost
support in all of Spain's 52 voting districts or provinces.
The poll suggested the PP would reverse Socialist victories in 1989 in the
autonomous regions (which each include one or more province) of Valencia,
Aragon, Madrid, Castilla la Mancha, the Canaries, the Balearics and Murcia.
The Socialists would hold their majorities only in Andalucia and Extremadura
in the poor south, where the government nurtures its support through a
subsidy it pays to farmworkers between harvests.
The threat to Mr Gonzalez is that, within each province, very small shifts
can produce dramatic results in the number of seats each party wins.
Spain's proportional representation system does not let voters choose names
from all the lists of candidates presented by parties. Only one party can be
voted for.
That is important because, while the PP is clearly taking a lead over the
Socialists as the most popular party, voters still prefer many Socialist
leaders over the untried faces in the PP. Mr Gonzalez holds a big lead over
Mr Aznar in personal polls.
The undecided vote has never been so high so close to polling day in any
previous election in Spain.

FT  01 JUN 93 / German plea for calm on arson
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KLAUS Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, appealed for calm yesterday as
protests continued over the arson attack that killed five Turks in Solingen,
near Cologne, at the weekend.
Police have arrested a 16-year-old right-wing youth on suspicion of murder
and arson, but said they were continuing their investigations.
The arson attack sparked off a violent protest by 3,000 demonstrators,
mostly Turks, who rampaged through Solingen until early yesterday.
Protesters smashed windows and looted shops. Motorways between Cologne and
Bonn were blocked and 17 demonstrators were arrested.
Skirmishes continued in Solingen late yesterday, as well as in Hamburg and
elsewhere in Germany. About 200 Turkish and German demonstrators blocked a
motorway in Hamburg last night, causing long traffic jams, but there was no
violence.
Reacting to the troubles, President Richard Weizsacker warned that
'Germany's social peace should not be allowed to be jeopardised by one blind
arsonist'.
The killing of three girls and two women is the worst racist attack since
November, when a Turkish woman and two small children were burned to death
in the northern town of Molnn.
The latest attack is likely to bring the German government under renewed
pressure to take firm action against right-wing groups and relax its
stringent citizenship laws.
Mr Alexander von Stahl, the federal prosecutor, said Saturday's attack
suggested 'racist and therefore right-wing terrorist motives.'
Senior officials in Turkey called for greater protection for the 1.8m-strong
Turkish community in Germany.
But Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, said: 'It's not only up to the
police to be watchful. It is a task for all of society.'
The liberal Free Democratic Party and opposition Social Democratic Party
said the 6.5m foreigners living in Germany would be more secure if they
could have dual citizenship.
But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling Christian Democratic Union, and
particularly the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union, is opposed to
amending citizenship laws that date back to 1913.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Major seeks to unite Tories in aftermath of reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEDROCK Conservative values will be reaffirmed by Mr John Major this week,
as the prime minister seeks to dispel the sour aftermath of last week's
reshuffle and to focus the party on an agenda that will unite it.
Mr Major's efforts to reassert his authority after Mr Norman Lamont's
departure from the Treasury have so far been hampered by public divisions
among Tory MPs about whether there should be tax increases in the November
budget, and whether the reshuffle should have been more extensive.
Officers of the Tory backbench finance committee are to seek an early
meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to discuss how he will
approach his task of reining in public borrowing.
The prime minister's speech to the national Conservative women's conference
at the end of this week is seen as an opportunity to restore the party's
fortunes by concentrating on policies such as widening ownership, extending
individual freedoms and lightening the burdens that government imposes on
business.
The need to find an approach that the entire party can support has been
highlighted during the weekend by the sensitivities about how the balance
between left and right in the new cabinet will work in practice.
Senior party managers will spend this week judging how the reshuffle has
been received in the constituencies and take that into account in deciding
when to hold the Christchurch by-election.
Although no decision has been reached, Tory strategists appear since the
reshuffle to have leaned towards mid-July rather than the autumn for the
contest, where the Conservatives are defending a 23,000 majority.
But fresh sniping at Mr Major himself helped to put the government on the
defensive.
Downing Street dismissed as not worth comment the call by Lord Rees-Mogg, a
former editor of The Times, for Mr Major to resign. It also sought to play
down criticism by Lord Lawson, the former chancellor.
Writing in the London Business School's latest international economic
outlook, Lord Lawson said the government made a mistake in joining the
European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990 at a central rate of DM2.95
to the pound without obtaining Bundesbank support. Britain joined the ERM
when Mr Major was chancellor.
He also said the credibility of the ERM and European exchange rate stability
could only be restored if the Maastricht treaty and its plan for a single
European currency were abandoned.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, defended Mr Major, highlighting the
prime minister's role in winning the general election for the Conservatives,
and emphasising that the return of sterling into the ERM was 'not on the
agenda'.
Mr Hunt's comments follow his remarks over the weekend about the
desirability of stable exchange rates, and underline the delicate balance
which ministers are keen to strike over economic policy in particular.
As part of that balance, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, will serve
on the main economic cabinet committees.
Some rightwingers suggest, however, that the combination of Mr Clarke, Mr
Hunt, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, leaves the government's
economic strategy firmly in the hands of the 'interventionists'.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Brussels backs UK decision to leave ERM: Chancellor is
warned he must take tough measures on deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN was right to withdraw from the European exchange rate mechanism,
says a confidential paper from the European Commission to be presented to
senior officials from central banks and finance ministries today.
Brussels warns, however, that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, may
need to take tough measures to curb the country's budget deficit. It
suggests that tax rises and/or spending cuts may have to be more severe than
planned at present.
The Commission's assessment, which is likely to arouse protest from
Britain's EC partners, is to be discussed by the EC's secretive monetary
commission.
The meeting is due to discuss the UK's programme to make its economy ready
for economic and monetary union by the end of this decade, should parliament
approve such a step.
The Commission's paper suggests that Britain can more easily rebalance its
fiscal and monetary policies outside the ERM. It also suggests that getting
the right balance might be more difficult if the Bank of England were
independent of the Treasury.
However, some European officials fear the Commission has gone too far in an
attempt to appease Mr John Major's embattled government while the Maastricht
treaty is still unratified by Britain.
They find it extremely odd that the Commission should appear to cast doubt
on the benefits of Britain's membership of the ERM. The paper points out
that the UK has made little progress towards making the Bank of England
independent.
But its central finding that the present relationship between Bank and
Treasury should help UK policy makers push through necessary changes is
likely to be disputed in Germany, France, Spain, Belgium or the Netherlands.
These are all countries that either have independent central banks or are
planning to introduce independence.
While the Commission warns that the UK might have to tighten fiscal policy
more than planned, it says the method of doing so should be left to the UK
government. Under the principle of 'subsidiarity', as much decision-making
as possible should be left with national and regional authorities, so Mr
Clarke would have the difficult choice of whether to raise taxes or cut
public spending.
The paper discusses the UK's latest plan for bringing the economy back into
balance, which is understood to repeat the measures announced in Mr Norman
Lamont's last Budget in March. It also outlines the government's medium-term
financial strategy for reducing the public-sector borrowing requirement from
about 8 per cent of gross domestic product in the present financial year to
3.75 per cent by 1997-98.
The document's bias towards fiscal tightness might encourage some to infer
that the commission would like to see lower British interest rates to
stimulate investment and growth.
While the paper in general is likely to meet with approval among the UK
monetary authorities, neither the Treasury nor the Bank of England is in any
mood to reduce interest rates.
Elsewhere in the EC, there is sufficient disenchantment with UK policy for
the paper to cause a row.
Only last week, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank president,
angrily declared that currency co-operation in Europe had 'collapsed' and
implicitly criticised Britain, Italy and Spain for having engaged in the
competitive devaluation of their currencies since the ERM crisis last
September.
It is also not so long since Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president,
was castigating Britain for 'social dumping'. The devalued pound and the
UK's refusal to agree to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty were
viewed in the Commission as a deliberate move by the UK government to lure
investment and employment from Britain's EC partners.
Although there are signs of warmer relations between France and Britain
since Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right coalition took office, France's
economic establishment remains critical of UK policies since sterling left
the ERM.
Some French officials point out that Britain has not been able to reap the
same benefits as France, where continued ERM membership has delivered lower
long-term interest rates than is the case in the UK. Others make no secret
of their concern about Britain's increased competitiveness on the depressed
export markets of continental Europe.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Clinton to compromise over budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's deficit reduction package is now expected to pass
the US Senate under a compromise plan involving a smaller tax rise and
larger spending cuts.
Passage of the budget bill will help Mr Clinton's efforts to put his
presidency back on track after recent upheavals.
In an effort to reassert himself politically, the president yesterday braved
a hostile demonstration by war veterans when he spoke at a Memorial Day
ceremony at the Vietnam war monument in Washington. With boos sounding all
around him, Mr Clinton said America must 'regain control of its destiny' and
of its economy. 'Let us keep the American dream alive,' he said.
Earlier, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance
committee, said the Clinton administration would agree to a
deficit-reduction compromise that might mean cuts in Medicare, the
government's healthcare programme for the elderly.
Senator David Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat who had joined with Republicans to
oppose a proposed energy tax, said the chances had improved 'by about 100
per cent that we're going to be able to work out an agreement'. The senator
is another key member of the finance committee, through which the
legislation will pass. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, said if
the president agreed to 'eliminate some of the spending, eliminate some of
the taxes and find some new spending cuts, then it might attract some
Republicans'.
However, he predicted that the president would alter his proposals enough to
get sufficient Democrat votes for passage without having to appeal to
Republicans for support. Those in Washington public life welcomed the news
that Mr Clinton was bringing on to his senior staff Mr David Gergen, a
Republican, in order to stem a series of White House mishaps.
In his Memorial Day address Mr Clinton called for a healing of the divisions
in American society, obliquely referring to protesters' complaints that he
did not 'belong' at the Vietnam memorial because he had avoided the draft.
It was, he said, 'a day to put aside differences  - a day to reflect on what
unites us'.
Mr Clinton was the first president to speak at the memorial. Although one
poll said 67 per cent of Americans approved of the gesture, protesters held
up signs reading 'For Shame' and 'Hypocrite'.
Mr Gergen, a columnist and television commentator appointed at the weekend
as White House communications director, advised presidents Ford and Reagan,
and served the latter when he had his greatest victories in Congress.
Senator Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who has frequently been at odds with
the president, said the appointment was 'one of the best moves I've seen him
make in a long time'.

FT  01 JUN 93 / Buses may run on rail tracks after privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME companies preparing to bid for rail franchises after the privatisation
of British Rail are drawing up plans to concrete over the tracks and run
buses instead of trains.
The controversial idea is likely to add to fears that the government's plans
for privatising the railways, due to start in April next year, will lead to
the loss of parts of the network.
One company - Selab Holdings, a Jersey-based shipping and stevedoring
company - has held talks with the Department of Transport about taking over
two routes: the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line running out of London's
Fenchurch Street station, and the Chiltern line from London Marylebone to
Aylesbury, Bucks.
If it wins the franchises to operate the lines, it plans to convert them
into guided busways - concrete roads with guide rails at the sides which
allow specially built buses to travel at high speeds without needing to be
steered by the driver.
The Department of Transport confirmed that it had held talks with Selab. It
also acknowledged that it had discussed rail conversion schemes with other
potential franchisers, but would not identify them.
'Nothing is ruled out,' the department said. 'The intention is that the
passenger services should be franchised out as rail services, not on the
basis that they would be replaced by something else, but it will be up to
the franchising director to consider bids when they are presented to him.'
Guided buses are a new form of public transport intended to combine the
flexibility of buses with the speed and safety of rail. Buses are driven on
conventional roads to pick up and set down passengers at each end of the
journey, but use the concrete tracks for the high-speed part of the journey
in between.
Systems have been introduced in Adelaide, Australia, and Essen, Germany. The
privately owned Badgerline bus group has proposed setting up a network in
Bristol.
Mr Roger Bale, Selab's owner, said he had chosen the London, Tilbury &amp;
Southend line and Chiltern line because they were relatively self-contained
parts of the railway so conversion would not interfere with other rail
traffic.
Buses would pick up passengers from residential areas in the suburbs and
switch to the guided busways for the run into central London, where they
would switch back to ordinary roads for a circuit around the city.
Mr Bale said busways provided higher capacity than railways because they did
not require signalling and could run more often. 'The aim is to make the
journey more convenient and less costly, which in the end will make profit
for the operator and attract more clients.'

JAPAN'S biggest car manufacturers came under severe pressure last year as

Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker, reported parent pre-tax losses of
Y26.3bn (Dollars 239.1m) for the year ended March, compared with profits of
Y87.8bn previously.
The company recorded its first ever net loss, at Y15.1bn, compared with a
profit of Y54.2bn. Non-consolidated sales fell 8.7 per cent to Y3,896bn. The
dividend is being halved to Y7 a share.
Nissan blamed difficult trading on the steep decline in domestic demand for
vehicles and the sharp appreciation of the yen.
Last year domestic sales fall 17 per cent in unit terms and 18 per cent in
value. Export sales, on the other hand, were up 4.2 per cent, largely as a
result of an increase in sales of parts and components for overseas
production.
On a consolidated basis, sales were down 3.4 per cent to Y6,198bn, leading
to pre-tax losses of Y108bn and net losses of Y56bn. There was a Y45bn
write-off in Australia.
In the current year, Nissan is projecting domestic vehicle sales of 1.2m
units and overseas sales of 76,000 units.
As a result, sales are expected to rise to Y4,000bn this year. Nissan is
looking to break even both at the pre-tax and net-profits level.
Pre-tax losses of Y40bn in the first half are expected to be reversed in the
second half as a result of an improved trading climate and Y150bn in
additional revenues stemming from higher prices and streamlining.
The outlook from Mazda, Japan's fifth largest carmaker, is less optimistic.
Mazda yesterday warned it would not be profitable this year following a
steep fall in profits in 1992.
The company saw a 5 per cent decline in non-consolidated sales to Y2,191bn,
while pre-tax profits plunged 68 per cent to Y6.2bn. Net profits were 71 per
cent down to Y2.6bn.
Mazda, which is 24.5 per cent owned by Ford of the US, said it was also
under pressure from high depreciation costs.
Total factory unit sales declined 11 per cent for passenger cars and 22 per
cent for commercial vehicles.
The biggest setback came in the domestic market where unit sales were 16 per
cent down, compared with a 7 per cent decline in overseas markets.
Mazda's performance was disappointing even given the overall weakness of the
Japanese car market last year, which declined 7.4 per cent in unit terms,
according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.
Mitsubishi Motors reported a 8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, to
Y46.6bn, in spite of a 2.4 per cent increase in sales to Y2,615.9bn.
While Mitsubishi saw a 67 per cent increase in sales of passenger cars, it
suffered a 20 per cent fall in sales of mini-cars and double-digit declines
in sales of trucks.
The company forecasts a 1 per cent increase in volumes this year, a slight
increase in sales to Y2,630bn, and an increase to Y48.5bn in pre-tax
profits.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Markets: Omens for Zeneca investors - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO THERE it is: Britain's industrial bellwether has split itself in two.
From Tuesday investors will be able choose between ICI chemicals and Zeneca,
the bioscience company hewn from the industrial giant which is starting life
with a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue. ICI shareholders should get their Zeneca
share certificates the week after next, and have until June 21 to decide
whether to take up their rights.
If the demerger opens a new chapter in Britain's industrial history, the
story so far has not been a happy one. As the chart shows, ICI peaked
against the All-Share index in 1975, since when it has consistently failed
to perform. That might explain shareholders overwhelming willingness to back
the split at yesterday's extraordinary general meeting.
Whether radical surgery can reverse ICI's long history of underperformance
remains an open question. At first sight there is little reason for
optimism: both ICI chemicals and Zeneca will arguably lack critical mass as
independent companies. The chemicals side has relied on pharmaceuticals to
provide cash for investment in new plant and equipment. It will have to
stand alone. The rights issue will virtually clear the decks of debt on both
sides of the business, but that could equally have been achieved by a
unified ICI.
The company - or rather companies - respond that the split will give them a
clearer management focus. Their argument is that ICI was simply too big and
bureaucratic to manage. The demerger will give both sides the chance to
sacrifice some sacred cows.
That might sound a rather vague justification for an exercise which has cost
Pounds 75m in advisers fees and new stationery. Not to mention the thousands
of hours of management time which could have been productively spent running
the business. But there are happy precedents, notably the demerger of
Courtaulds' textile business in 1990. In both cases an established chemicals
company spun-off a whole line of business in the interests of 'management
focus'.
If ICI and Zeneca shares perform as well as Courtaulds since demerger,
investors might yet conclude that their money has been well spent. The
chemicals side of Courtaulds has decisively outperformed the market since
1990, in spite the cyclical effects on its sector of the deepest industrial
recession for 50 years. The demerged Courtaulds Textiles has done even
better.
There are crucial differences. The Courtaulds split was on a smaller scale:
the two sides of the old company now have a market capitalisation of only
Pounds 2.5bn, against almost Pounds 9bn for a unified ICI.
ICI is also in a more capital-intensive end of the chemical business than
Courtaulds. Without the cash generated by pharmaceuticals, it is far from
clear that ICI has an independent future in bulk petrochemicals, for
example.
The counter-argument is that ICI would be well out of this crowded end of
the chemicals business, and the demerger might give Ronnie Hampel, its chief
executive, an opportunity to make such a break with the past.
Besides, ICI shorn of Zeneca is hardly a minnow, being the world's sixth
largest chemical company ranked by sales. With a recovery in the world
economy just around the corner and management prepared to wage war on costs,
the optimists expect ICI chemicals to flourish. If the shares start official
trading on Tuesday at around 610p, though, a large part of the anticipated
earnings recovery will already be in the price.
Zeneca, meanwhile, starts life as an independent company at a time of deep
uncertainty for the pharmaceuticals industry. Governments' efforts to get to
grips with healthcare costs are resulting in new controls on drugs prices,
notably in the US. The rights issue price of 600p - far lower than ICI
envisaged when the demerger plan was hatched last year - should take such
risks into account. A safe gross yield of 5.7 per cent is certainly
comforting. With the drugs industry so out of favour with institutional
investors, though, a windfall profit looks unlikely.

FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Paribas confident of continued
recovery
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARIBAS, the big French investment banking group which clawed its way back
to a profit last year, expects to continue to recover in 1993.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, told a shareholders' meeting the group should
'continue its progress' this year. He also identified the first signs of
recovery in the property sector, noting a slight improvement in the housing
market, although commercial property remained depressed.
The precarious state of the property sector forced Paribas, and other French
banks, to make big provisions last year. Mr Levy-Lang said providing there
was no further deterioration, the group's property writedowns would probably
be lower in 1993 than in 1992. It made total provisions of FFr7.8bn (Dollars
1.42bn) last year.
Banque Paribas, the investment bank, had performed 'satisfactorily' so far
this year, Mr Levy-Lang said. The steady reduction in French interest rates
had alleviated the pressure on its trading activities.
By contrast, Compagnie Bancaire, the specialist financing business, had been
'heavily affected by the crisis in the property market and small business
sector', he said. Its savings activities fared well, although demand for
credit had been 'mediocre'.
Credit du Nord, the retail banking network, was affected by the sluggish
economic environment.

FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: NEC battered by downturn in PC
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics group battered by the sharp fall in corporate
and consumer demand in Japan, reports its first group loss in nearly two
decades.
The downturn in the domestic computer market, stagnant sales of
semiconductors, high depreciation costs, and severe difficulties in its home
electronics business resulted in a Y37.7bn (Dollars 342.72m) consolidated
loss for NEC.
The loss came as sales fell 7 per cent to Y3,514bn. At the net after-tax
level, NEC consolidated losses totalled Y45.1bn.
Parent company results were better, largely because the results of its
troubled home electronics business are excluded. A substantial proportion of
semiconductor business is also excluded.
Pre-tax profits for the parent company were down 77.3 per cent to Y18.1bn,
on sales that declined 6 per cent to Y2,869bn.
NEC, which is the largest manufacturer of personal computers (PCs) in Japan,
came under severe pressure last year as corporate investment in the country
was stagnant and computer sales suffered under fierce competition from
foreign companies.
NEC was hit by a sharp fall in PC demand late in the year, following the
introduction of lower-priced US PCs into Japan. PCs account for nearly 30
per cent of NEC's computer sales: their sales fell about 7 per cent.
Electronic devices, such as semiconductors, were also down about 7 per cent,
while telecommunications sales dropped 5 per cent.
However, the company expects PC sales volumes to rise 10 per cent this year,
to 1.4m units. At the same time, the Japanese semiconductor market is
forecast to rise 3 per cent, compared with a 10 per cent fall last year.
The company has taken cost-cutting measures, including a reduction in
capital investment from Y190bn in fiscal 1992 to Y140bn this year. It
expects results to recover substantially in 1993-94.
Forecasts are for a 6 per cent rise in parent sales, to Y3,030bn, with
pre-tax profits emerging at Y50bn. Consolidated sales of Y3,700bn are
expected with net profits of Y10bn.
At Mitsubishi Electric, the decline in the semiconductor market and weak
demand for consumer electronic products is blamed for a 5 per cent fall in
parent sales, to Y2,494bn. Pre-tax profits were 47 per cent down to Y32.3bn.
Mitsubishi expects non-consolidated sales in the current year to improve to
Y2,510bn, and pre-tax profits to increase to Y35bn.

FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Headline to acquire Hodder &amp; Stoughton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEADLINE Book Publishing, the fast growing British publishing group, has
agreed to buy Hodder &amp; Stoughton, the general and educational publisher.
The deal, which will be announced formally next week, will make Headline,
founded by Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson in 1986, the second largest British
independent publisher after Macmillan.
The acquisition will represent an enormous step forward for Headline, which
specialises in popular commercial publishing. The company is taking over a
privately owned publisher much larger than itself.
Headline had a turnover of Pounds 15.7m in the year to December 1992 with
pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.05m, a rise of 68 per cent.
Hodder &amp; Stoughton, which publishes both fiction and non-fiction in hardback
and mass market paperbacks through Coronet, New English Library and Sceptre,
had lower margins. In the year to June 1992 the company had a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 1.05m on a turnover of Pounds 55m.
In the six months to December, however, earning levels increased with
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.76m on sales of Pounds 30.7m.
On Tuesday Headline asked for its shares to be suspended at 290p because
negotiations on a substantial acquisition were at an advanced stage.
In fact, the deal with the family-owned Hodder &amp; Stoughton has already been
agreed, and the final legal details are being worked out pending the
announcement.
Neither Mr Hely Hutchinson of Headline nor Mr Philip Attenborough, chief
executive of Hodder &amp; Stoughton, were available for comment.
It is not clear whether Headline plans to integrate its large acquisition,
with implications for jobs, or to run it as a stand alone enterprise.
Hodder &amp; Stoughton has had a difficult time in recent years. In 1990, for
example, the company increased sales by 4 per cent to more than Pounds 60m
but the pre-tax profit was only Pounds 850,000.
The company also lost one of its most popular and profitable authors,
Jeffrey Archer.
Current Hodder titles include Elizabeth Longford's The Future of the
Monarchy and Morgan, the new biography of the novelist EM Forster. The
company is also about to publish a new Le Carre novel.
Headline, which last year bought Bookpoint, a book distributor, has shown
steady growth in turnover, pre-tax profits and earnings per share over the
past five years.
Pre-tax profits have grown from Pounds 104,000 in 1988 to their current
Pounds 2.03m, while earnings per share have risen from 1.8p in 1988 to 11.9p
last year. Headline has tended to discover and develop its own authors
rather than paying large advances to established writers.
One of its best known authors is, perhaps, Ellis Peters.

FT  29 MAY 93 / City faces rise in terror premiums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to press Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurer, to
increase terrorism insurance rates in spite of opposition from the insurance
industry and businesses.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that new rates would be
introduced on Pool Re policies sold after July 1. As a result some
businesses in London could face premium increases of between 200 per cent
and 300 per cent. Some smaller businesses outside London could benefit from
rate reductions.
The new rates will be based on recommendations of consulting actuaries Bacon
&amp; Woodrow's review, presented to Pool Re earlier this week.
The Association of British Insurers said this week that further increases in
rates would lead many businesses to cancel terrorism cover.
It confirmed that Mr Ian Rushton, the ABI chairman, had told the DTI late
yesterday that the board members of Pool Re would 'find themselves in a
difficult if not impossible position' accepting the increase without having
seen or discussed it in advance.
Yesterday Mr John Pollard, policy adviser to the Confederation of British
Industry's company affairs directorate, said rates were already too high and
called for an urgent meeting with the DTI.
Mr Pollard said rises of up to 300 per cent 'would place an intolerable
burden on hundreds of firms, particularly those in the City of London'.
'Rates are not normally increased in the middle of the insurance year, based
on one incident,' he added, referring to last month's bomb in Bishopsgate in
the City.
The British Insurance and Investment Brokers Association also issued a
strong warning against any mid-term increase in rates. Ms Ruth Rooley, its
director, said increases would further damage the City as an international
finance centre by frightening companies away.
To change the insurance rating for a new scheme in mid-term would be
virtually unprecedented during the past 20 years, she said.
The take-up of the new terrorism policies has been less than hoped, and Pool
Re's funds will be exhausted by claims after last month's Bishopsgate bomb,
which are expected to total more than Pounds 400m.
Pool Re meets all claims until its funds are exhausted.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Your CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax (CGT) allowances for assets sold in April.
To use it, multiply the original cost of the asset for the figure shown for
the month in which you bought it.
If you subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale, the balance will
be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 5,000 in June 1984 and sold them
in April 1993 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the June
1984 figure of 1.576 gives a total of Pounds 7,880.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of
Pounds 5,120, which is below the 1992-93 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If
you realised no other gains during the year, the profits should be tax-free.
If you sell shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
figure. The RPI in April was 140.6.

<TEXT>
A general lack of interest in trading ahead of the long weekend as both UK
bonds and Wall Street declined brought one of the poorest days in recent
months in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo.
Nowhere was the absence of both institutional and independent dealers more
evident than in traded options sector which saw one of its lowest daily
turnovers this year. Total volume was a mere 12,119 contracts against
Thursday's 26,402 lots, of which 6,284 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100
volume. Hanson was the most active among the stock options with a day's
total of 906 lots, followed by British Airways at 769. Other active stock
options included SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo.
In stock index futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index drifted
lower for most of the trading session with its premium to the cash market
eroded.
June finished at 2,839, a fall of 23 and at a discount to the underlying
cash market. volume was thin reaching only 6,377 by the official close.

FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Argentina sets terms for YPF
share flotation

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA hopes to raise a maximum of Dollars 2.5bn with the sale of 35 per
cent of its national oil company YPF, scheduled for July 8 on local and
international equity markets, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said
yesterday.
Mr Cavallo said he plans to offer a minimum of 110m and a maximum of 126m
shares out of a total 353m shares, at a price between Dollars 17 and Dollars
20 each. The government would thus raise about Dollars 1.87bn-Dollars
2.52bn. The final price, which is being constructed through the book
building method, is to be announced closer to the planned flotation date.
But Mr Cavallo said he expects YPF shares to be priced at about 10 times
earnings.
A further 24 per cent of the company will be reserved for the holders of
government debt consolidation bonds, mainly old age pensioners. They would
either be able to swap their bonds - valued at market price plus a 15 per
cent premium - for cash raised through the flotation, or convert their bonds
at par for YPF equity on condition of holding their YPF stock for a minimum
of 12 months.
The federal government will hold 20 per cent of the company, provincial
governments 11 per cent and employees 10 per cent. Mr Cavallo said that
YPF's statutes would contain anti-takeover clauses discouraging a single
investor from taking more than 15 per cent of the company.

<TEXT>
THE Canadian administrator to Olympia &amp; York Developments, the financially
beleaguered Canadian developer, said the US Trustee has appointed Cyrus
Vance as the mediator to intercede between the administrator and the
creditors to O&amp;Y's US unit, agencies report from New York.
The appointment was made under this week's order by US Bankruptcy Court
Judge James Garrity. The mediator, called an 'examiner,' is charged with
working with the various parties to reach an agreement on an independent
board for the US unit, Olympia &amp; York Cos. (USA).
On May 24, Judge Garrity denied a motion by Citicorp, parent company of New
York's largest bank, to appoint a 'responsible officer' to run O&amp;Y's US
unit.
Citicorp and other unsecured creditors of the unit had wanted Mr John
Zucotti, president of the US offshoot,named as responsible officer as the
O&amp;Y subsidiary seeks to restructure its debt.
O&amp;Y (USA), an insolvent real estate concern, is attempting to restructure
Dollars 5.3bn of debt.
A spokeswoman for the administrator said Mr Vance is with the New York law
firm of Simpson Thatcher. Mr Vance also recently worked on negotiating a
peace agreement in war-torn Bosnia, in the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Vance served as US secretary of state under President Carter from 1977 to
1980. He then returned to his law practice at Simpson Thatcher &amp; Bartlett.

FT  29 MAY 93 / DTI lends ASB top hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board is to recruit a senior official from the
Department of Trade and Industry to help it make accounts easier to
understand, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Michael Butcher, head of accounting and audit policy at the DTI, is to
join the board on secondment for at least a year from August.
He will help to make draft standards issued by the board less wordy and
technical.
He will also start work on a two-three year project producing guidelines on
the inclusion of a statement in annual accounts to clarify financial
information to non-professionals.
Mr David Tweedie, head of the board, has long said he wants to make accounts
more understandable. But critics have accused the ASB of producing standards
that are highly technical and increasingly difficult for non-professional
investors to use.
Mr Butcher will become secretary to the board but there will be no change to
its number of staff.
The appointment has been driven partly by demands on the time of Sir Ron
Dearing, chairman of the financial reporting council, the board's parent
body, in his role as School Curriculum and Assessment Authority chairman.

FT  29 MAY 93 / CBI seeks talks on insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry has called for an urgent meeting with
the Department of Trade and Industry following reports this week that many
City businesses could face steep rises in the cost of terrorism insurance.
The call comes after protests from the Association of British Insurers about
possible increases of up to 300 per cent in premium rates following last
month's Bishopsgate bomb.
Mr John Pollard, policy adviser to the CBI's company affairs directorate,
said rises 'would place an intolerable burden on hundreds of firms,
particularly those in the City of London'.
He added: 'Rates are not normally increased in the middle of the insurance
year, based on one incident.'
The British Insurance and Investment Brokers Association also gave a strong
warning. Ms Ruth Rooley, its director, said increases would further damage
the City of London as an international finance centre by frightening
companies away.
'To change the insurance rating for a new scheme in mid-term would be
virtually unprecedented in the past 20 years,' she added.

<TEXT>
The Icelandic government has been urged to make a drastic cut in the
country's cod quota in 1993-94, although this could deepen a severe
recession, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
The state-run marine research institute says next season's cod catch should
be limited to 150,000 tons because of declining stocks. In the current
season, which ends on June 30, about 230,000 tons of cod are expected to be
caught, compared with a quota of 205,000 tons. If implemented, the cut could
reduce Iceland's gross domestic product by 3 per cent next year, because cod
accounts for 30 per cent of the country's exports.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Why should the rich have all the fun? -
Hawks &amp; Handsaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE always liked the rich. I have met thousands of them, I suppose, and
have always found them far more interesting, charming, witty, attractive and
intelligent than poor people.
Poor people are not interesting. Their views are plain-textured, their lives
monochromatic. They do not drive Aston Martins or collect Venetian glass or
holiday in Barbados or know anything about the gold price, so how can they
avoid the choking dust of dullness that settles, inevitably, upon a life
without money?
More of the poor in a minute. Dull they may be, but they do not go away. The
other reason I like rich people is that their stories and experiences are
much livelier than poor people's stories. Here is an example. I found it
this week in a book, Horsetrader, by Patrick Robinson, an account of Robert
Sangster's exploits as a racehorse owner. Sangster is rich, intelligent,
interesting.
One night Sangster and his wife Sue and an Irish friend of Sangster's, Billy
McDonald, a bloodstock agent from Ballynahinch, were on the beach outside
Sangster's house in Barbados, gazing at the distant lights of Michael
Smurfit's yacht. Suddenly, McDonald announced that he was fed up with all
this vodka. 'Dat bloddy boat of Smurfit's is packed with Chateau Petrus,' he
shouted, 'and I'm going out there to get a decent bottle.'
Upon which he plunged into the sea and began swimming, inexpertly, towards
the yacht. Slowly, McDonald's sounds grew fainter until, on the velvety
Barbadian air, came a waterlogged Irish roar: 'Oi'm bloddy drownin'. Fock
it]'
At once, Sangster's wife whipped off her skirt, knifed into the water and
swam strongly to the Irishman's resue. She got him on his back, grabbed his
hair, told him that if he wriggled, belched or spoke she would abandon him,
and dragged him 200 yards back to the beach, depositing him, poleaxed with
exhaustion, upon the sand.
'I'd say he owes you,' Sangster told his wife. 'None of us could have done
that. Shame about the Petrus.'
Nice story. I wish that poor people had such stories to tell. If I had three
wishes, I would wish that most rich people were somewhat poorer, that many
poor people were not so poor, and that some poor people were greatly richer.
I had better explain. I am not a professor, but if you ask me we seem to be
living through a period, in the western democracies, of political decadence
and moribundity. Things are badly skew-whiff. I am not talking about humdrum
recessions. Get rid of one and along comes another. I am talking about the
distortions and inequities that disfigure our economies - specifically, the
crudeness of our distribution of benefits between the haves and have-nots.
Take the US, an extremely decadent society that has lessons for us all.
According to an analysis by Neil Howe and Phillip Longman in The Atlantic
magazine some time ago: 'When we add together all the tax expenditures and
all the direct outlays for which we have data . . . an unambiguous picture
emerges. On average, households with incomes under Dollars 10,000 collected
a total of Dollars 5,690 in benefits (in 1991). On average, households with
incomes over Dollars 100,000 collected Dollars 9,280. In terms of total
fiscal cost . . . the aggregate amounts received by the non-needy in 1991
were staggering.'
Whatever one's vision of the future, they said - whether it was a negative
income tax or a 15 per cent flat rate; green cars running on hydrogen or
mag-lev trains humming between cities - to get something new, one must give
up something old. 'A society that cannot find the resources to pay for
60-cent tuberculosis vaccinations for 10-year-olds must ask itself why it is
offering subsidised health care and housing to millionaires.'
Shuffling government ministers around is low-grade sport compared with the
shuffling of resources between the haves and have-nots, where progress will
be slow. To ginger things up - to provide more people with stories - I
would, at random, sequester the fortunes of one deceased multi-millionaire
in seven and divide the spoils between 15 poor people.
They could spend it how they liked. Aston Martins. Crates of Petrus. Homes
in Barbados. Tickets to Royal Ascot. Elocution lessons. Founding businesses.
Why should the rich have all the best stories?

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: To Paradise in the limousine lane - Private
View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE SAT on the bishop's well-trimmed lawn discussing camels and needles while
the birds trilled away in the evening sun.
The three English counties which make up the Anglican diocese of Oxford
contain more rich people than any other part of Europe, said the bishop,
adding sadly: 'We see very few of these people in church.'
Perhaps they would come to church if the Church told them more plainly what
their obligations were, I said.
'Well, I mean, that may be so. Maybe we have failed in some way.'
Richard Harries, bishop of Oxford, is a decent sort, a product of Wellington
College, Sandhurst and Cambridge. He is a well-dressed, good-looking
theologian who has defended the nuclear deterrent and attacked the Church of
England's investment policy. His latest book is called Is There a Gospel for
the Rich?. Reviewers found it scholarly, but bland.
Is it harder for the rich to get to heaven? Or was Jesus exaggerating?
'Yes, it's certainly hard. Even allowing for what they call Oriental
hyperbole, Jesus clearly thought it was difficult and I think there is a
difficulty, yes.'
What is the difficulty?
'First of all, wealth can lead to complacency and self-satisfaction. I take
it that at the heart of healthy religion is a sense of gratitude, as
Wordsworth once said. Secondly, I think that wealth can cocoon one from the
harsh reality in which so many people live their lives. The classic parable
of course is the one of Dives and Lazarus.'
Wealth and possessions could become a psychological trap, he continued,
which was why the poor were often more generous than the rich. He recounted
the story of a fellow-bishop whose parishioner, an heiress, kept complaining
of financial hardship and reducing her covenant to the church.
'He realised it was a spiritual problem and brought it home to her that she
was in the grip of her money. He persuaded her to give away a very
substantial amount in order to find some inner liberation - and it really
worked.'
During the 1980s it became fashionable for some churchmen, encouraged by
Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher and her adviser Brian (now Lord) Griffiths, to
quote the more tolerant Judaic tradition in order to 'affirm' capitalist
wealth-creation for Christians. Why, they argued, should bankers and bond
traders not feel members of God's elect?
The bishop takes a similar line.
'In the Old Testament it is quite clear that God's purpose is that human
society should prosper . . . the corn, the wine, the oil. It's interesting
that Jewish people have a rather less complex and less tortured attitude to
wealth. They regard it as a good thing and many of them are extraordinarily
generous.'
Yes, I said, because they have strict rules about giving it away.
'They do. Jewish people will say it's good to make money, and it's even
better to give a lot away.'
But Jesus didn't say that.
'No. Jesus brought in all these complicating features like 'blessed are the
poor' or 'blessed are the poor in spirit'. All I'm saying is that we need to
take Jesus' sayings against the background of the Old Testament. I mean, he
was a Jew, and of his time.'
I thought the bishop was going to say we should take Jesus' sayings against
the background of modern mixed-economy capitalism. I asked him whether the
fashion for 'affirming' wealth-creators had not muddied the church's
teaching.
'The church still has a lot to do to underline the importance of business.
It still has very negative view.'
But why should the church need to underline the importance of business in
the first place?
'Because we all depend on business one way or another; the whole of society
does. Secondly, many Christian people are working in the financial and
commercial worlds and unless they can see their vocation as having some kind
of legitimacy what on earth are they doing there?'
You can choose not to be in the City making a dubious turn, I said.
'Some people are drawn to the financial sector. If it is necessary to the
working of a modern economy it may be that people find a perfectly proper
legitimate vocation in that field.'
The church's ban on usury was due to a misreading of scripture, he added.
'Originally it was a ban on loading the poor with debt. This is vitally
relevant today in relation to Third World debt. It doesn't apply in a modern
market economy, where there is lending between financial equals.
'My worry from the church's point of view is that so many people are
schizophrenic. They confine their values to the domestic sphere and personal
relationships. They get into the world of work and are not sure how to feel
about it.'
In short, Richard Harries says you can be poor in spirit if you cannot bear
to be poor in fact. 'People should open up their moral bankruptcy, their
spiritual need.'
So they can still drive a Rolls-Royce?
'Well . . . ' He hunted for an answer. 'They can begin to grasp what the
gospel is about even driving a Rolls-Royce. As they begin to imbibe the
gospel more deeply, they come to question a very great deal of their
lifestyle and perhaps their political commitments.
'I mean,' he added cheerfully, 'there's nothing wrong with a Rolls-Royce. It
is an extremely finely-made car and I don't think Jesus was opposed to
quality. Jesus liked well-made things.'
He quoted the story of Zacchaeus the tax-collector who had volunteered to
repay those he had defrauded and had given away half his assets. 'If then
Zacchaeus had kept his Rolls-Royce I do not see Jesus blaming him', the
bishop said.
But he told another rich man to sell all, give to the poor and follow him, I
said. That seems pretty explicit.
'Certainly some people feel they are directly addressed by that and they
become monks and nuns . . .'
You mean it's not an obligation?
'I feel all Christian people should quite properly be troubled by that
statement. How does it impinge upon us? What does it really mean today? And
the answer I give is a kind of inner spiritual poverty. But I go on to say
it does mean some real solidarity with people who are powerless and
vulnerable in the world.'
Why are you afraid to say that everyone should make the supreme sacrifice,
or get as close as they can to it?
'I'm not saying we shouldn't get close to it. We do believe we ought to give
away a percentage of our money: the Bible teaches a tenth - and that does
not include taxes.
'That in itself is a salutary discipline. The Church of England is only just
beginning to wake up to this. We've lived on inherited endowments so long:
the fact that the Church is short of money is forcing us to look again at
our Christian commitment.'
Do you give money away?
'I try to, yes. I try to practise the Christian discipline of the tithing.'
(The bishop is paid about Pounds 23,000 a year in addition to his rent-free
house and expenses).
What do you do when you meet beggars on the street?
'I don't believe in giving to most of the people one meets because most of
them are . . . alcoholics and so on. No, I try to give through covenants -
not to beggars because I don't think they should be encouraged to be there.
It's better to support projects.'
After giving his tithe, the rich man's next step should be to make sure the
rest of his wealth was constructively employed, perhaps in creative
risk-taking, 'not hoarded for comfort and aggrandisement.'
Which rules out the Rolls-Royce, I said.
'Not necessarily. I am less interested whether a person has one Rolls-Royce
or two than what they are doing overall with their life.'
Why won't you say a Rolls-Royce is just not on for a good Christian?
'What we haven't touched on is the political issues. Suppose you have
somebody with a Rolls-Royce but whose life is dedicated to good causes and
who works in order to better the lot of poor people in this country and
abroad.' (Was he thinking of the Princess Royal?). 'I'd far rather have that
kind of person than one who rode around in a second-hand car and did nothing
else.
'One of the great jumps that wealthy people have to take is to recognise
that although they themselves may benefit from certain political and
economic policies they may have not only to vote but also work for other
policies.'
So millionaires should vote Labour, by and large?
'Millionaires should always test every policy by the question: what will the
effect of this be upon the poorest and most vulnerable members of society?
The point about the rich is that they have power, they have influence, they
can get things done. That's what matters. Wealth really is secondary to
power. So I'm concerned with how they are using their power and influence.'
Is the answer to the question on your book's front cover Yes or No?
'The short answer must be Yes. There is a gospel for the rich.'
What does it mean to say that?
'The word 'gospel' means good news. There is good news for the rich.'
And the good news is they can get through the eye of the needle?
'The good news must be that there is God, that there is a wise and loving
power behind this universe . . .'
Surely that's good news for everybody.
'But the rich also need to hear this good news, because a lot of the
teaching of the gospel seems to be rather bad news for the rich, doesn't it?
So there is a spiritual message, but there is also a very great challenge. I
don't think you can hear the good news without hearing the challenge.'
If he took up the challenge, I observed, a rich man might well get to heaven
faster than a poor one.
'Well, getting to heaven depends on the grace of God, not on one's own
merits. But I entirely agree that you do have opportunities for doing good
which may not be open to other people.
'My position, which would be sharply differentiated from a number of other
Christians', does have an inescapable political dimension. My worry is the
pietism which accepts the status quo.'
By stressing the political obligations of the rich, the bishop of Oxford
puts himself at odds with Conservatives who say the church should keep its
nose out of social policy. I asked him: was that why you didn't get to
Canterbury?
'I didn't want to get to Canterbury,' he laughed, almost convincingly.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: The art of keeping up appearances - Wealth
is determined more by image than reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAIM ATTALLAH is wealthy. He must be. He is managing director of Asprey,
jeweller to the vieux riche. He supports out of his own pocket various
worthy but financially challenged ventures such as Quartet Publishing, and
The Literary Review.
But when, many years ago, Attallah arrived in Britain as a near-penniless
Palestinian, few would have given much for his attaining wealth and
influence. Then, even more than now, the English financial establishment was
a closed community.
But young Naim knew what to do. With his few pounds he hired a Rolls-Royce
to take him around the City of London. People were impressed. A Palestinian
driven in a Rolls-Royce was clearly a man of substance: who knew what Arab
connections he might have?
Attallah has never looked back. Of course, he could not have succeeded by
surface charm alone. By all accounts he has a brilliant head for figures,
the sort of man who can make a killing on the foreign exchanges without
recourse to a calculator.
But his story illustrates a point that has become more potent over the
years: that our understanding of wealth is determined more by appearances
than reality. In the old days it was not so. A man was wealthy if he had
land, thousands of acres of it. It was probably inherited. At any rate it
was not borrowed. If anything it was lent to tenants and others less
fortunate.
But now anyone of vigour, by careful wooing of banks with a strange urge to
gamble, can acquire almost overnight the trappings of old money. Of course,
the bankers know that those Landseers, those grouse moors, are theirs. But
the public sees the borrower as the source of wealth and it is in the banks'
interest not to shatter the image.
These illusions of wealth have been greatly aided by the sudden
proliferation of magazines purporting to list the wealthiest businessmen,
with their supposititious net worth neatly printed - usually it is a nice
round number - next to their shiny happy faces.
The most famous in Britain is carried out by Philip Beresford, for the
Sunday Times Magazine. Last year's list had the additional information,
culled from US sources, that the Reichmanns were the fifth richest family in
the world, alongside the Saudi royal family.
When the list was published, it was already painfully clear to the
Reichmanns' myriad bankers that the Canadian property dealers' net worth was
substantial only as a negative quantity. They were that great invention of
20th century financial engineering, minus billionaires.
In the previous year's list, Captain Robert Maxwell was up there near the
very top, at a time when, as we now know, his fortune had totally collapsed.
Subsequently, with disarming honesty, Philip Beresford wrote in the Sunday
Times: 'We didn't take Mr Maxwell's debts into account.' This was rather
like assessing the pros and cons of Britain's membership of the European
exchange rate mechanism without taking into account unemployment.
But one must sympathise with the compilers of such lists. It is far easier
to see a man's assets than his debts; indeed, the indebted rely on this
little secret. Only the most rash and egotistical actually admit it, as
Australia's Alan Bond did in the late 1980s when he stated: 'A man's wealth
is measured by how much he can borrow.'
But even with those who are genuinely rich, the attempt to express their
wealth in a single number is fatuous. Money is only a measurement of value,
and value is akin to mercury, an elusive, volatile substance which makes us
look foolish when we try to capture it. It measures us, rather than the
other way round.
J Paul Getty understood this. Indeed, he sprang to public prominence in 1957
only because he was named as the richest man in the world in the very first
such list, compiled by Fortune magazine. According to one of Getty's
biographers: 'When he heard about the Fortune article Getty told his
brother-in-law, Ware Lynch: 'I don't know how much money I have. I don't
know how they would know'.'
Exactly. It is the mystery of value. Ask any expert. Ask Attallah.
Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Markets: Clinton's close shave saves face all round - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRESIDENT Clinton scored a rare triumph on Capitol Hill this week
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
his deficit reduction programme squeaked through the House of
Representatives on Thursday night - and Wall Street, whatever its own
political views on the new administration's economic policies, breathed a
sigh of relief.
Although the recent troubles that have afflicted Clinton - including the
embarrassing episode of the expensive haircut on Air Force One, and the
fiasco over the changes at the White House travel office - have mostly been
ignored by the financial markets, the suggestion that the president's first
Budget might be rejected by Congress genuinely unnerved investors.
Again, this was not necessarily a reflection of their enthusiasm for
Clinton's economic proposals, but more a pragmatic realisation that a big
defeat for the president so early in his term could be devastating
politically.
Whether they are Democrats or Republicans, the financial markets like their
presidents to have a firm grip on economic policy. Concern about the
situation at the White House reached the point this week where one leading
newspaper questioned whether the country was about to be lumbered with
another failed presidency.
Thus, the news that Clinton's tax-raising, deficit-reduction plan had passed
(but only just) its first big hurdle in Congress reassured investors.
Although the vote came too late to affect trading, bond and stock prices had
risen on Wednesday and Thursday in anticipation that the House would vote in
favour.
The bond market, in particular, drew comfort from the late revival in
Clinton's fortunes for, only a week earlier, it had seemed a very distinct
possibility that the vote would go against him.
This worried Treasury investors who felt that the president's proposals,
despite their flaws, were - at the very least - the first meaningful attempt
by any recent government to tackle the huge federal deficit. If Clinton had
been defeated in the House, fixed-income investors believed that they would
have faced years of rising deficits and interest rates, too.
The stock markets, although less enamoured of the specific policies in the
plan - the big tax increases the government proposes to levy on wealthier
individuals and most corporations are especially unpopular among equity
investors - took their cue from the bond market.
The decline in the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to below 7 per cent
buoyed stocks, lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average to two consecutive
record highs: 3,540.16 on Wednesday and 3,554.83 on Thursday.
The fact that the Dow promptly turned tail yesterday (by mid-morning it was
down about 20 points) did not suggest that the markets suddenly had reversed
their position on the president's plan. It just proved that dealers and
investors still like to buy on the rumour and sell on the fact. Or, perhaps,
the markets simply were preparing for the next battle - the vote in the
Senate, which political pundits predict will be a tougher task for the
president and his congressional allies.
The drama of the vote in the House at least diverted investors' attention
away from the still-thorny question of whether the Federal Reserve is
preparing to raise interest rates to curb inflation. Several reports this
week suggested that the Fed's open market committee, which meets in
Washington every six weeks to review monetary policy, voted unanimously at
its meeting 10 days ago to shift the emphasis of policy towards a tightening
of domestic credit conditions.
Although the reports unsettled fixed-income prices at the short end of the
Treasury market, they were ignored by investors in stocks and long-term
government securities. The reason probably was that if there is a consensus
in the financial markets about the economic outlook, it is that growth will
remain sluggish and inflation weak for the rest of the year.
Yesterday's downward revision in estimates of first-quarter gross domestic
product growth - from a previously reported 1.8 per cent to a new estimate
of 0.9 per cent - confirmed that the economic recovery has been anything but
robust so far this year. There are still plenty of economists who believe
that if the Fed does make a move on monetary policy soon, it is more likely
to cut interest rates rather than raise them.
No less of a name than Henry Kaufman - the former Salomon Brothers'
economist who earned fame and fortune in the 1980s successfully predicting
the course of interest rates and bond prices, and who now runs his own Wall
Street consultancy - forecast this week that the Fed will ease policy this
summer to boost the faltering economy.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Markets: Clarke must seek some elbow room - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If you come to a fork in the road, take it' - Yogi Berra, legendary
American baseball manager.
ALL THE signs are that investors in the London market are in a dither.
According to some stockbrokers - and it might be wishful thinking - the
FT-SE 100 is about to break out of the increasingly narrow range in which it
has traded.
Consensus in the City about the direction of this move is, however, elusive.
Those seeking guidance should therefore heed another Berra aphorism - 'You
can observe a lot just by watching'.
The case for shares rising above their recent ceiling of about 2880 rests
heavily on the new chancellor finding a considerable degree of elbow room.
Although sterling wobbled following Lamont's removal, bulls say the currency
is strong enough to allow the incoming Kenneth Clarke scope to cut base
rates from 6 per cent by a further percentage point.
To prevent an interest rate reduction from weakening sterling unduly,
however, Clarke would have to show he is prepared to cut public spending and
set a policy framework to keep it down. No-one in the equity markets
underestimates how difficult it would be to deliver this.
But the bull case has also received strong support from an unlikely quarter
 -the property sector. After being one of the hardest hit sectors during the
recession, the last month has seen shares racing ahead as investors start to
rebuild portfolios in expectation of more demand for quality properties.
Further bull support can be gleaned from the turbulent derivatives market.
Short sellers have been visible for some time in anticipation of a fall in
the Footsie. But some market makers and holders of put options appear to be
getting nervous the longer the index does not fall. Closing short positions
could give a fillip to the market.
So what could push the FT-SE 100 below the recent 2790 floor of its trading
range? The bear case can be summed up simply - the market has fully
responded to the economic recovery coming through. As one equity strategist
said this week, 'Professional fund managers have bought the market and don't
want a lot more of it.'
Institutions appear to have decided how much to put in the market but are in
two minds which stocks to pick. This shows up in some sharp moves in
individual stocks, a pattern that emerged in New York last year when the
American economy was in a similar shape to the UK's now.
London is also keeping one eye on the European economies, heading into
rather than out of recession, and another on New York that has almost daily
hit new heights.
It was noticeable that Wall Street's 24 point fall by London's close
yesterday helped push the FT-SE index down 15 points to a close at 2840.7,
up 28.5 on the week.
Then there are questions marks about the pace of domestic economic recovery.
Whatever the government is saying, there is a growing sense that it is
slowing. Joe Dwyer, Wimpey chief executive, this week, appeared to underline
this point in calling for a more expansionary economic policy.
If recovery is not as strong as previously thought, some sectors of the
market are looking frothy - share price multiples would appear to be running
ahead of reported earnings growth. Since the start of the year, for example,
the multiple on the FT Small Cap index, has risen from 21 times historic
earnings to over 30 times.
Smaller companies were heavily exposed to the UK recession and greatly
underperformed in the last two years. But even so these are are demanding
ratings which discount a considerable degree of recovery.
What is more, after steadily outperforming the FT-SE 100, the FT-SE Mid 250
this week faltered and slipped, sending another warning that unrealistic
expectations of recovery may be built into prices.
The state of institutional liquidity offers little more comfort. True, the
government's gilt auctions continue to find willing buyers; and large rights
issues like this week's Pounds 199m call from Hammerson and last week's
Pounds 442m from British Airways were safely underwritten. No doubt
institutions also have kept something up their sleeves for BT3 in June and
the Zeneca rights issue.
But bankers said this week there were signs institutions are approaching the
point of exhausting their appetite to fund both the public sector and
private deficits.
It has to be said that neither the bull nor the bear argument is that
convincing. Nomura, the raging bull among stockbrokers, is therefore
confidently expecting the FT-SE 100 to end the year at 3500 while Warburgs,
among the more pessimistic brokers, think it will end closer to 2900.
Despite their differences, Nomura and Warburgs broadly agree the strategy
investors should adopt Investors, they say, should avoid cyclical recovery
stocks which in general have risen too high, and pick longer term growth
stocks in the pharmaceuticals, brewing and food retailing sectors.
One event that would inject some life into the London market would be an
injection of fresh cash. It could yet come from foreign investors. But the
source of fresh funds that has never failed to get the market excited - the
big cash takeover bid - seems increasingly less likely to appear.
This week, Brian McGowan, one of the architects of acquisitive growth at
Williams Holdings, the FT-SE conglomerate, resigned as chief executive. His
parting remark that takeovers are increasingly difficult and expensive
seemed to confirm that the age of the big bid is over. These things may go
in cycles; the day of the mega-bid will no doubt return. But it is a fork in
the road investors would have preferred to avoid.

Unit trust sales in April reached their highest level since the 1987 stock
market crash. Net sales were Pounds 955m, compared with Pounds 769m in
March, and Pounds 649m for the whole of 1992. Lower interest rates appear to
be persuading investors to opt for equity-based products, where yields are
roughly similar and there is the prospect of capital growth. A further
encouraging sign for the industry is that the number of unitholder accounts
has risen to 4.51m, from 4.35m at the end of 1992.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Markets: Is your insurer a good risk? - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW STRONG is your life insurance company? It is an immensely complicated
subject, but one which is important. If you are waiting 25 years for your
payout, you want to be sure that the company you choose is healthy enough to
survive for a quarter of a century.
The health of UK insurance companies is monitored by the Department of Trade
and Industry and there is a safety net in the form of the Policyholders
Protection Act, which provides for other insurance companies to stump up if
one company gets into trouble.
But these give only general reassurance to the average investor. Figures on
such arcane statistics as free asset ratios have been available through the
trade press, but these are difficult for the ordinary investor to interpret.
Hence the appeal of the recent reports from Standard &amp; Poor's, which
classify companies in three simple categories: good, adequate and
vulnerable.
S &amp; P's latest report described two companies - General Portfolio and the
Life Association of Scotland - as vulnerable. Under S &amp; P's definition, the
vulnerable category consists of 'insurers who appear to have vulnerable
financial strength, and may be highly exposed to adverse economic or
underwriting conditions.'
In both cases, the insurance companies have large parent groups: the
Dutch-based Internationale Nederlanden Group in the case of LAS; and the
Societe Generale du Group des Assurances Nationales, in the case of General
Portfolio. Indeed the French government has a controlling stake in GAN. Both
LAS and General Portfolio argued that S &amp; P had underplayed the support of
their parent companies.
A second factor is the nature of the business which the company does.
Financial strength is important to with profits policyholders, because of
the nature of the bonus system. Companies declare reversionary, or annual
bonuses, which once announced, cannot be taken away from policyholders. So
policyholders want to be sure that companies have sufficient funds to pay
those bonuses - and that a sudden stock market dip will not wipe out their
reserves.
But the returns to unit-linked policyholders rise and fall along with the
market. So the financial strength of a unit-linked company is less
important. Raymond Paul, LAS's appointed actuary, argues the report 'chooses
to ignore that LAS ceased writing traditional with profits business in July
of 1992. In our case therefore, the importance of the free asset ratio to
the financial solvency of the company is substantially diminished.'
Even if LAS was still selling with profits policies, one has to question
whether many people would be choosing the company, whatever the view of S &amp;
P. In the recent Money Management survey, LAS was bottom of the performance
tables over 10, 15 and 20 years for with profits payouts.
General Portfolio has never sold with profits policies. Its business is
divided between unit-linked, and guaranteed income bonds, where the
liability to investors is matched by gilts. So the company argues that the
free asset ratio is a pretty irrelevant figure (although it also says it has
improved since the date of S &amp; P's analysis.)
So it is arguable that the only people who should be concerned by the report
are LAS's existing with profits policyholders. If S &amp; P is right (which LAS
vigorously disputes), the financial strength of the company might reduce
their returns in the long run. But their options are limited. If investment
returns have been poor at LAS, surrender values are unlikely to be
attractive; nor will there be much clamour for LAS with profits policies in
the second hand market. An independent financial adviser should be able to
give more detailed guidance.

FT readers have already shown an interest in the New Issue Register, which
aims to give private investors better access to stock market flotations.
The idea is to compile a 'mailing list' of those willing to apply for new
issues. This will give stockbrokers an easy way of widening the shareholder
base of companies they bring to the market, plus a useful source of demand.
Many investors, unless they are the clients of the right stockbroker, have
to date missed out on the smaller new issues. These are normally arranged as
placings, rather than as offers for sale, which are open to all.
Although new issues are far from a licence to make money - remember the BP
offer of 1987 - they can present lucrative opportunities. The first
impression that a public company makes on the market can be all-important,
and the banks and brokers behind the issue will want to ensure the issue is
a success. They will accordingly set a modest price  - the ideal is that the
shares start trading at around a 10 per cent premium to the issue price.
Those who want to join the register will be asked to pay a membership fee of
Pounds 75, as soon as they are offered the chance to invest in an issue. The
Register hopes to put together its first deal by the end of June.
Provided investors do not assume that every new issue they are offered is a
bargain, the introduction of the Register seems a welcome initiative.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: When names can mislead - Doing the
Splits / Philip Coggan examines the record of the General Consolidated trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Consolidated investment trust is a classic example of how trusts'
names can give little clue to their functions. In fact, the trust has a UK
smaller company-oriented portfolio and a split capital structure. But its
name makes it sound like the faceless bureaucrat of the trust sector.
When founded in 1896, it was known as the New General Traction company and
aimed to invest in railway stocks. It stayed as a conventional investment
trust until 1988 when it decided to move to a split capital structure, with
the aim of eliminating the discount to net assets. That aim succeeded and it
has traded in a range of 2 per cent premium to 2 per cent discount ever
since.
The trust has been run for 25 years by Anthony Simonian and is now part of
the Moorgate stable, which includes Moorgate investment trust and Moorgate
Smaller Companies income trust. There is a small amount (Pounds 400,000) of
cumulative preference shares but the main three share classes are stepped
preference, income and capital.
The stepped preference shares are entitled to an annual increase of 7.5 per
cent in their income and asset backing, and to be repaid at 203p when the
trust is wound-up at the end of 1997. Their repayment value at May 26 was
145.3p and SG Warburg Securities says the shares, at 160p, are on a gross
redemption yield of 8.9 per cent.
The income shares receive all the revenue of the trust after the preference
and stepped preference shareholders have been paid. The asset value,
originally 50p in 1988, increases at 7.3 per cent a year to reach 100p at
wind-up date. As of May 26, the asset value per income share was 72.6p.
As the graph shows, however, General Consolidated has cut the dividend on
the income shares. Simonian explains: 'The problem with GCIT is that when we
split the trust, we didn't have to dramatically re-organise the portfolio.
We already had a high yield.'
'Where we went wrong is that we should have built in a fixed-interest and
convertible preference element to boost our income. Instead, we relied on
our liquidity, which was reasonably high at 7 to 10 per cent. That was fine
when we could earn 15 per cent on cash but, when interest rates fell, we
were faced with having to reduce the dividend.'
General Consolidated already had reduced the dividend on the income shares
by 10 per cent and plans another 10 per cent cut to 8.45p per income share
this year. 'It would be quite easy to paper over the cracks,' says Simonian,
'but it would have left the underlying problem.
'To maintain the dividend would have required a portfolio yield of 7 per
cent, which would have left little prospect for growth for the capital
shareholders. Instead, the portfolio yield has been cut to 5.5 per cent,
with around 10-12 per cent of the fund now in convertible preference
shares.'
Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities, welcomes the
move by General Consolidated. 'They are one of the few managers to have
taken into account that they're running a trust for more than one class of
shareholder. The decision to cut the portfolio yield was a bold and fair
statement.' He puts the income shares, at 108p, on a gross redemption yield
of 10.23 per cent, assuming 2.5 per cent growth in dividends.
The capital shares receive no income but all the assets of the trust after
the other classes of share have been repaid. As with other capital shares,
there are two asset values which can be quoted, and investors should be
aware that there is an important difference. If one takes the other classes
of share at their present repayment values, the assets per capital share are
222p; accordingly, the capital shares (127.5p on May 26) were at an apparent
discount of 43 per cent (this figure appears in the investment trust section
of the FT).
But investors should not assume the capital shares are a bargain. The asset
values of the stepped preference and the income shares are increasing
steadily year-by-year; the capital shares have to run fast just to keep up.
If you allow for the final repayment values of the other shares, the nav of
the capital shares on May 26 was just 79.8p. On that measure, the capital
shares are on a 60 per cent premium to asset value.
According to Moorgate, the capital shares require asset growth of 2.4 per
cent a year to repay the capital shares at the present price, and growth of
5.5 per cent a year to repay them at the higher nav of 222p. But Aaron says
the capital shares are attractive, given that a 7.5 per cent rise in the
trust's assets would offer investors a 21.5 per cent return.
Around 50 per cent of General Consolidated's portfolio is in smaller
companies, an 'overweight' position in the sector. This has not helped in
the past few years, but it could be a benefit now that the UK economy
finally appears to be recovering. Simonian says yield is one of the most
important criteria in stock selection. 'We are looking for stocks with above
average yields and above average growth prospects,' he adds.
The 10 largest investments in the portfolio include a mixture of smaller and
larger stocks. They are: Moorgate Investment Trust, GEC, Thorn EMI, Whessoe,
Hanson, Shell, Commercial Union, Prudential, Marks &amp; Spencer and API Group.
Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, says General
Consolidated is at the 'quality end of the split capital sector. We don't
think it's particularly badly structured and we quite like the management.'
Key facts
The trust had gross assets of Pounds 106.3m as of May 26, when the overall
package of shares stood at a slight discount to asset value. The manager's
fee is 0.44 per cent of gross assets less current liabilities per annum,
with a minimum of Pounds 375,000. The trust is due to be wound up at the end
of 1997.
Board
Sir Mark Thomson, the chairman of General Consolidated, is chairman of
Moorgate Investment Management as well. Other directors are: David Brazier,
a partner of stockbroker Cazenove; Nicolas McAndrew, chairman and managing
director of Murray Johnstone; Donald McFarlane, non-executive chairman of
Senior Engineering; Simonian; and Richard Westmacott, former chairman of
Hoare Govett Securities.
Savings scheme and Pep details
The minimum monthly scheme is Pounds 25, or a lump sum of Pounds 250. There
are no charges apart from government stamp duty.
The minimum investment into the personal equity plan is Pounds 1,000, or
Pounds 100 a month. There is an initial charge on the Pep of 2 per cent plus
VAT, and an annual charge of 1 per cent plus VAT.
Investors are allowed two free withdrawals a year, provided they keep the
minimum balance of Pounds 1,000. If they want to sell their holding
completely, they must pay the appropriate proportion of that year's annual
fee.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Lloyd's plan for change sends mixed
signals - Richard Lapper finds both plus and minus aspects in the insurance
market's attempt to put itself back on to a profitable path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEALTHY American investors and pension fund managers alike are falling over
each other to get a piece of action at Lloyd's of London - at least, that is
the impression some senior managers at the troubled insurance market like to
give following publication of its new business plan last month.
Certainly, Lloyd's should be a more attractive home for corporate capital if
 -and it remains a big if - the market's management is able to implement all
the plan's main recommendations.
Cost-cutting and an overhaul of management systems and structures should
improve profitability. In particular, an ambitious new re-insurance scheme
called NewCo is designed to seal off future investors from old US asbestosis
and pollution liabilities running into billions of pounds.
But what about the market's existing capital base - the 19,700 individual
Names - and should individual investors who have shunned Lloyd's begin to
reconsider their opposition?
First, the bad news. The plan contains little to cheer several thousand
Names hit so badly by losses that they have resigned already or are likely
to do so later this year.
Lloyd's is persisting with its efforts to negotiate an out-of-court
settlement to more than a dozen legal actions and announced this week that
Sir Jeremy Morse, the former chairman of Lloyds Bank, and Sir Michael Kerr,
a former high court judge, had agreed to oversee preliminary work.
But when Sir Michael and Sir Jeremy report in September, the odds are that
the amounts on offer - which will come mainly from the errors and omissions
insurance policies which cover agents against the cost of legal awards -
will not be enough to dissuade some of the worst-hit Names from going to
law.
The plan also has some recommendations that could worry Names wealthy enough
to continue, and the new re-insurance plan could prove to be costly for some
of them, too.
Before NewCo is established, Lloyd's will review the adequacy of reserves
set aside by syndicates over the years and, where deficiencies are
identified, Names could be asked for more cash. In many other respects,
however, the plan contains better news.
Names trading in 1993 are to be allowed to use part of their premium trust
fund - into which premiums are paid - to settle past losses or use as credit
for the annual solvency test, which measures the assets of Names against
their liabilities.
The credits or cash transferred from the trust funds will be limited to 5
per cent of Names' allocated premium limit in 1993.
With 1990 losses scheduled to reach between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 2.8bn
when Lloyd's reports its results in June, that could be an important
concession. An average Name underwriting Pounds 450,000 could, therefore,
set aside Pounds 22,500 from 1993 income to pay 1990 losses or meet solvency
shortfalls, for example.
'It doesn't help the worst-hurt Names but it is a clever solution for those
who are able to trade on,' says Robert Saunders, a Lloyd's adviser with
Smith &amp; Williamson, the private bank.
Looking further ahead, Lloyd's looks a much less risky investment than it
has been traditionally. Already, it has modified its traditional principle
of unlimited liability whereby Names are responsible for meeting all their
losses, even if it means selling their homes and personal possessions.
A scheme introduced last year means that the losses of all Names trading in
1993 are capped (at an amount equivalent to 80 per cent of premium limit
over a four-year period).
Above that limit, losses are met by Lloyd's as a whole although, if the
market were to fail, liability would return to the individual Names.
The business plan has modified these arrangements by allowing future Names
more flexibility in choosing exactly what balance of risk and reward they
want at Lloyd's.
Individual Names can continue to participate on the same basis as they do
now, placing 30 per cent of the amount of premium income they accept in any
given year as a deposit.
Names who want to place a more certain limit on any potential losses can
incorporate. But they would pay a higher deposit (50 per cent of the amount
they underwrite) and a higher entry fee (1.5 per cent of stamp capacity
rather than 0.6 per cent) than standard Names.
Since incorporated Names need a minimum capital of Pounds 1.5m, all but the
most wealthy would need to join with others to form limited liability
companies.
Alternatively, Names can reduce their risks by taking part in a greater
number of syndicates - spreading their risks through schemes known as
members' agency pooling arrangments (or Mapas).
In this way, Names would avoid very heavy exposure to individual syndicates
performing exceptionally badly.
Equally, though, 'Mapa-only' Names would miss out if a single syndicate
performed especially well. Mapa-only Names need deposit only 25 rather than
30 per cent of their premium income.
Very wealthy Names also have a new option. Those with liquid assets of at
least Pounds 500,000 and income above a specified level can trade as
high-liquidity Names, depositing only 20 per cent of their stamp capacity
with Lloyd's.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Bond funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE this week shows the 10 largest offshore sterling fixed interest
funds, taken from Finstat. These are funds which are recognised by the
Securities and Investments Board  - the chief regulator for the financial
services industry in the UK - and which have a three-year performance
record. UK investors can put money in similar funds onshore, but offshore
funds pay income gross.
The performance of the offshore funds listed appears to be higher than for
onshore bond funds over a similar period (last table published May 15), but
is bolstered by the re-investment of gross, rather than net, income and by
being quoted on an offer-to-offer basis.
Some funds have a single price but add an initial charge so that, if funds
were quoted on an offer-to-bid price, the single-priced funds would receive
an unfair advantage. Since initial charges are often around 5 per cent,
quoting on an offer-to-offer basis makes the performance figures look better
than the returns an investor would actually get.
The strategy adopted by many of the funds is 'total return,' to give
investors both growth and income. As its name suggests, John Govett's UK
High Income fund, with a yield of 9.1 per cent, aims to provide a high yield
 - although not at the expense of stability in its capital value, says
Govett's Simon Osborne.
Up to 25 per cent is invested in non-sterling bonds such as Spanish
government bonds (10 per cent), Italian government bonds and Mexican
short-term Treasury bonds. Around 10 per cent is in longer-term gilts and
the rest is in AA credit rated Eurosterling bonds  - those issued in
sterling by a government or corporate name (such as British Gas).
The fund with the lowest yield in this table  - Gartmore's Capital Strategy
fund  - is one of Gartmore's 24 umbrella funds. The aim of the sterling
fixed interest fund, according to manager Mark Rimmer, is to invest in 'high
quality bonds with minimal credit risk with an emphasis on capital growth.'
The emphasis on security is borne out by the fund's requirement that
investment in gilts does not fall below 50 per cent. At the moment, 55 per
cent is invested in gilts, 22 per cent in sovereign guaranteed bonds
(Eurobonds issued by foreign governments) and 20 per cent in corporate
names.
Rimmer believes offshore sterling bond funds are suited best to investors
who want both security and income. 'Sterling bonds still represent
reasonable value as inflation remains under control,' he says, 'but the
scope for large capital gains from gilts may be limited because the market
has rallied over the past few months.' He favours the 5-7 year end of the
gilts market where he anticipates total returns of around 10 per cent, while
the long-end faces the potential problem of oversupply.
Investors should note the charges, as well as yield and performance; there
is a wide difference. The initial charge on John Govett's fund is 5 per
cent, with a 1 per cent annual fee (minimum investment Pounds 2,000); the
initial charge is 3.5 per cent on Lloydstrust gilt fund with a 0.75 per cent
annual fee (minimum investment Pounds 5,000); but there is no initial charge
at Gartmore. annual fee is 1 per cent and the minimum investment is Dollars
25,000 or its sterling equivalent.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Three-way tenancy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I have joint assets of about Pounds 240,000, including a house
worth Pounds 130,000. We have one married son who owns his own home. What
would be the tax implications of creating a three-way tenancy in common,
with the parents each willing their third-share to the son?
In order to create such a tenancy, you and your wife would first have to
sever your joint tenancy (assuming that is how you own your house). Then,
each of you would have to give a one-sixth share of the house to your son.
These gifts would be potentially exempt transfers. Assuming the house is
worth Pounds 130,000, then the one-sixth shares would be valued at Pounds
21,667 before taking account of any discount.
The problem is that because your son is married and living away from your
home, the gift would be treated as a gift-with-reservation and would not be
efficient for inheritance tax purposes unless you were to pay him a market
rent for the use of his share of the property. The amount you have given
away would still be treated as being owned by you for IHT even though,
legally, you would have given up this share of the property.
It would, however, be possible to make the gifts by virtue of your
respective wills. Each gift would be covered by the nil rate band of Pounds
150,000 which is available to each of you, assuming that you have no
previous chargeable gifts. The gift-with-reservation rules do not apply to
gifts made at death.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Relief on payments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I TOOK voluntary early retirement from teaching four years ago and get a
pension. Since then, I have worked for employers and also as a self-employed
tutor. If I take out a personal pension plan and pay 30 per cent of my
earnings into it, am I entitled to income tax relief on these payments even
though I am already receiving the teacher's pension?
Before taking early retirement, I was paying an extra 1 per cent into the
teachers' superannuation fund to 'buy in' extra years of service for a
widow's pension. I would have paid this extra 1 per cent until age-65 if I
had continued teaching. On retirement, I paid a lump sum of Pounds
3,000-plus to cover the years which I am not now paying. Am I entitled to
income tax relief on this payment?
The amount of contributions you can pay to a personal pension policy depend
on your age and taxable earnings in the year in which you pay such
contributions, and are not affected by pensions in payment or pension rights
from earlier schemes.
With regard to the lump sum of Pounds 3,000 that you paid to the teachers'
scheme at retirement in order to complete the purchase of added years, our
understanding is that such lump sum payments (as opposed to annual
contributions that - together with your normal scheme contributions - did
not exceed 15 per cent of taxable earnings) would not be eligible for tax
relief.
To check the category into which your payment fell, and the amount of any
contributions that may be tax-deductible, you should write to the Teachers'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Wife can't be used as
tax puppet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE JUST bought Pounds 5,000 (nominal) of 14 per cent Treasury 1998-01 in
my wife's name. My question is: can I defer bondwashing? I bought the gilts
ex-dividend and propose to take the gross interest on November 22 1993 (when
my wife will not be liable for tax) and then sell cum dividend after April 5
1994 (when she will be liable), thus avoiding payment of tax on the second
lot of gross interest.
We are perturbed to see your use of phrases such as 'I have bought . . . in
my wife's name' and 'I propose to take the gross interest on November 22,'
which imply that you are using your wife as a mere puppet for transactions
aimed at avoiding tax and producing an indirect benefit for yourself.
You must have overlooked our repeated warnings about the wide-ranging
anti-avoidance legislation aimed at taxpayers who try to use their spouses'
names to reduce the incidence of tax on funds which will result eventually
(albeit indirectly) in a benefit to themselves.
It is essential that the interest be credited to an account in your wife's
sole name to which you have no access, and that the proceeds be credited
similarly to that account.
The investment decisions must be your wife's, although there is nothing to
stop her asking for your advice. What must not happen is that you make a
decision for her and simply tell her where to sign, and when. And she must
be free to spend the whole of the interest and proceeds just as she pleases.
Subject to all these caveats, the answer to both your questions is YES, on
the bare facts given in your letter.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these colummns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: More carrot than stick in BT3 sale -
Roland Rudd and Philip Coggan examine the inducements on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSPECTOR MOROSE, alias comedian Mel Smith, will soon be talking on
television about the incentives on offer to retail investors in the
government's sale of its remaining BT shares in July. Meanwhile, the
government's own inspectors - in the form of S G Warburg, global
co-ordinator of the offer - have already been offering institutions
inducements to buy existing BT shares.
Institutional shareholders which increase their BT holding before the close
of the offer will be rewarded with more new shares if, as expected, the
Pounds 5bn float is over-subscribed. Those that try to depress the share
price, by selling short the stock aggressively, will be penalised when the
new shares are allocated.
Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, says the bank has learnt from the
last government sale of BT shares when it was also the lead adviser. In
1991, Warburg warned big shareholders that it would take a very dim view of
any attempts to depress BT's share price.
This infuriated the institutions, which complained that the government was
trying to rig the market.
This time, Lord Cairns says he is offering the 'carrot approach' in place of
the stick which caused the fuss in the first place. Institutions still think
the government is rigging the market - but are much happier at the way
Warburg is going about it.
Irrespective of whether the market is being rigged, however, it can only be
good news for the small investor if the mechanism keeps BT's share price
buoyant.
The only concern for potential investors is that once the Treasury loses its
financial interest in BT, uncertainty about regulation is likely to
increase. The timing of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into
British Gas - due to arrive on ministers' desks just after the BT issue -
could not come at a worse time.
There is also the emergence of wider competition to BT's basic business. Tim
Hirst, analyst at Kleinwort Benson - one of the stockbrokers which declined
to take part in the sale when it was not asked to be a global manager - says
the potential impact has been underestimated. He expects cable operators
will be providing telephones to more than 2m residential and 550,000
business customers by 1997, compared with 150,000 today.
Hirst estimates this could cost BT Pounds 550m a year in lost line rental
and call volumes. That is only 4 per cent of its present revenues but, since
much of its network costs are fixed, there could be a painful impact on
profits.
Warburg's research on BT, published yesterday, dismisses such fears. James
Golob, telecommunications analyst, says: 'Although there will be new
competition . . . it does not appear to be on a scale that will materially
alter the rate of gain of market share from BT.'
Meanwhile, the government has widened the net of 'share shops' through which
investors can apply for the BT3 issue. Those who register with, and apply
through, a share shop can expect to receive greater preference when shares
are allocated than those who apply through the Share Information Office.
Some of the companies which have become share shops are offering further
incentives for investors who register for BT3 shares. Barclays is offering
to waive the Pounds 30-plus-VAT joining and subscription fees on its select
and single company personal equity plans. Those who register will also be
entitled to free membership for three months of the Barclayshare Portfolio
Administration Service or the Barclayshare Advisory Service. Lloyds bank is
offering a 'low-cost' postal share dealing service covering all shares on
the London Stock Exchange.
The Share Centre is providing a Pounds 3 Argos 'premier points' card,
allowing discounts off goods at Argos stores for successful applicants. It
is also offering a 24-hour telephone dealing service with a minimum
commission rate of Pounds 8. Details on 071-757-4000.

<TEXT>
TIMOTHY Dewhirst, executive chairman of the Dewhirst group, has sold 300,000
shares, 142,000 of them to a fellow director. He moved up from chief
executive in January and the shares have been performing strongly ever
since.
Although Dewhirst cut its dividend two years ago - for the first time ever -
this provided cash to make an acquisition in the women's wear business. It
helped, also, to balance the group's historic dependence on men's wear.
Results announced in April showed a remarkable surge in both profits and
earnings and brokers are forecasting further growth for 1994.
Directors of HTV, the Welsh tv company, bought heavily in anticipation of
success in last year's franchise competition. The shares performed strongly
after the result was announced but have struggled since. Now, though,
chairman Louis Sherwood has entered the market and bought a parcel - the
first purchase by a director this year.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Investors 'ignorant'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICHARD Youard, the investment ombudsman, has warned that savers still need
to be educated about the basic facts of investment life. Writing in his
annual report this week, he says: 'Investors often show unrealistic
expectations, confusion between different types of investment, and a general
lack of understanding of how markets work.'
Youard's job is to sort out disputes between clients and members of IMRO,
the investment management regulatory organisation, and he has the power to
make individual awards of up to Pounds 100,000. He can be contacted at
071-796 3065 or by writing to 6 Frederick's Place, London EC2R 8BT.
In his report, Youard also has criticism for the industry. He cites one
brochure for a personal equity plan which carried the slogan: 'The Easy Way
to Achieve Income and Growth - Free of Tax.'
Youard asks: 'Can we blame someone new to investment for thinking this Pep
brochure assured him of income and growth, easily? Time and again, we find
investors have been more affected by the lead-in than by the mass of fine
print which follows.'
Youard says there was a 50 per cent increase over the year in complaints
referred to him. But he feels this was due less to a deterioration in
industry standards than the recession and the extra publicity given by IMRO
to the ombudsman scheme.
Most complaints were about general investment advice, with Peps coming
second. Claims varied in size from Pounds 5 - an investor demanding interest
due on cash held within a Pep - to Pounds 350,000, a dispute on which Youard
decided he could not adjudicate.
The two highest claims paid were for Pounds 10,000. One related to an
investor getting wrong information about the number of warrants he could buy
and the other concerned the definition of a 'low risk' portfolio. In total,
the amount paid out after disputes was Pounds 40,700, down from Pounds
114,000 last year.
Many of the complaints concern alleged negligence by advisers but Youard
does find some encouraging signs.
He says: 'Two years ago, I complained about the number of bad or
non-existent fact-finds and of inadequate, if any, contemporaneous notes.
These are not simply a protection for the adviser but, more constructively,
an aid to efficient business.
'This year, the cases have shown, on the whole, satisfactory fact-finds and
useful contemporaneous notes.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: SIB faces battle to promote reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE average investor, the regulatory system must sound like alphabet
soup: SIB, SRO, SFA. The letters take on meaning only when investors find
they must turn to the regulatory system for redress in some way.
Let us say, for instance, that your financial adviser has been pocketing
your money instead of investing it in unit trusts as you had believed. Or
you were convinced to buy an investment contract which you believed allowed
instant access, only to find it does not. It is then that letters like SIB
become important.
SIB is the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory
watchdog; and last week its chairman, Andrew Large, said he would keep a
tighter rein on the self-regulating organisations (SROs) which, nominally,
it supervises. After a lengthy study of why the regulatory system failed to
prevent the theft of more than Pounds 440m from pension schemes controlled
by the late Robert Maxwell, Large concluded that SIB's decision to maintain
an arm's-length relationship with the SROs was a decisive factor.
This might not seem like much improvement in the quality of investor
protection. And indeed, it might not be. On the other hand, there are signs
that Large is prepared to force SROs to take measures which, occasionally,
counter the commercial interests of their members. This is a necessary first
step to improving the quality of investor protection, particularly for
retail investors who do not have the sophistication or muscle of large
institutions which can get redress more easily.
Signs of this new, tougher stance have emerged already. Last December, the
board of a proposed new super-SRO for retail financial services, to be known
as the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), was told it must improve
standards of investor protection significantly if it wants to get off the
ground. Among other things, it must tighten rules for selling - particularly
life insurance - by making the charging structure clearer and restricting
instances where people are sold inappropriate products.
While Large's criteria may sound like common sense, the SROs are under
considerable pressure from their members to resist. A case in point is last
week's response by the actuarial profession to proposals from the Office of
Fair Trading (OFT) on disclosure.
The OFT had urged that prospective customers be told of a policy's surrender
value in each year of its life before buying it.
While it is impossible for life insurers to know exactly what the surrender
value will be, they have a fair idea of expenses and can make some
projections.
The information can help consumers understand what will happen if they
cancel before maturity and could discourage them from buying policies unless
they are certain they can keep up premiums. But the actuaries, many of whom
work for life insurance companies, claim the OFT measures would only confuse
consumers and are urging the Treasury to reject them.
Meanwhile, the Life Insurance Association (LIA), an industry trade body, is
urging the adoption of a complaints procedure outside the scope of the new
PIA. Under the LIA proposals, consumers who fail to have complaints upheld
by the adjudicator risk being forced to bear the costs of the investigation.
Many people with complaints could back off if faced with having to pay the
bill.
Publicly, the SROs insist their prime mission is to protect the public
interest and claim they turn a sufficiently blind eye to the commercial
pleas of their members if the public is at risk. But consider, then, an
article which appeared last week in a trade journal catering to independent
financial advisers (IFAs).
In it, Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra - which regulates IFAs -
slams the OFT proposals and says they will make the insurance industry
uncompetitive. Jillings vows 'to fight alongside other bodies in opposing
some of the proposed nonsense (from the OFT).'
If that is the case, Large has his work cut out.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Who wants to be a millionaire? -
Many people, says Philip Coggan. But, short of inheritance or winning the
pools, there is no easy way / Seriously Rich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER MIND how to invest a million. What most people would like to know is:
how to get one. The prosaic answer is that most people become millionaires
by one of two routes. They either inherit the money, or they work hard to
build a business and create it.
For most individuals, accident of birth has denied them the first option and
the second seems like too much effort. This article is designed for those
who would like to make a million without stirring far from their armchairs.
There is no low-risk way of making a million, except to start with Pounds
900,000. All the following options assume the investor has modest savings.
Accordingly, the rules of risk and reward come forcefully into play. If you
want to make your million quickly, you have to risk losing your initial
investment and the chances are that you will do so.
There is precious little difference between some of the more 'serious'
options considered and those which involve straight gambling. None of them
should be considered unless the investor is willing to kiss goodbye to the
money. So, with tongue firmly in cheek, and fingers crossed, here are some
potential million-makers.
THE FAST WAY
Football Pools
The pools companies altered the scoring system recently to try to encourage
more jackpot winners. This year, Littlewoods says it has had five entrants
who scooped more than Pounds 1m, including two who won more than Pounds 2m.
That indicates the company might turn a dozen people a year into
millionaires. Littlewoods has around 7.5m coupons a week so, if you do the
pools every week, you have (very roughly) a 1/625,000 chance of becoming a
millionaire within a year.
Casino
If you went in with Pounds 100, and bet consistently on red on the roulette
wheel, you would need red to come up 10 times in a row for your initial
stake to multiply into Pounds 1,024,000. (Provided, of course, that house
limits, let alone your nerve, allowed you to bet Pounds 512,000 on the 10th
spin).
Ten consecutive reds might not seem too stiff a requirement. But since the
house wins on zeros, you have an 18 in 37 chance of winning each time, so
the chance of such a streak is the fraction 18/37 to the power 10, or around
1,346/1 against.
Warrants
A warrant gives the right to buy a security at a set price. It can normally
be purchased for a fraction of the price of the underlying security. Say
that the warrant gives the right to buy shares in Widget plc at 100p, and
the share price of Widget is 110p. The warrant should obviously be worth at
least 10p, and will be worth more the longer the time available for it to be
exercised.
Say the warrant costs 20p. If the share price increases to 500p, then a
Widget shareholder would almost have quintupled his money. But the
warrantholder will have seen the value of his holding increase from 20p to
400p, a 20-fold increase. If he had invested Pounds 50,000 to start with, he
could have made his million.
That is a fictional example. In his book, An ABC of Warrants, Professor John
Pick cites the warrants on shares in the Burton Group, which reached a low
of 0.5p in 1976 and a high of 312p in 1986. An investor with perfect timing
could have turned Pounds 1,600 into Pounds 1m over those 10 years. But
warrants can be dangerous investments. They pay no income and can expire
worthless. Fortunes were lost in the Japanese equity warrant market late in
the 1980s. As for the UK market, Pick cites how warrants in WPP, for
example, dropped from 134p to 4p within a year. And the chances of finding
another Burton are very small. Options
Options behave very like warrants, only on a shorter time scale. They grant
the right, but not the obligation, to buy a given commodity at a set price
within a set time. Options are available on a wide range of commodities such
as foreign currencies, gold or shares.
While options can be used for very conservative, insurance-type purposes,
budding investors will be attracted to them by their 'geared' nature. If the
commodity's price rises, the right option will rise in value at a
considerably faster rate; if the commodity's price falls, or even stays the
same, the wrong option will expire worthless.
There is one point about which investors should be very careful. If you buy
an option, at least you can only lose what you have put in. But if you
speculate in the market by selling an option, known as 'writing' in the
jargon, your potential losses are virtually infinite.
Penny shares.
Polly Peck was for a long time the pride and joy of penny share tipsters. If
you had invested Pounds 800 in the stock in 1980, it would have grown to
Pounds 1m by the end of the decade. But an investor would have seen his
million disappear quickly in the 1990s.
It is a mistake to assume that a share is cheap because its nominal price is
low; that, for instance, shares in Ratners at 40p are necessarily better
value than shares in Glaxo at Pounds 6. What matters are the profits and the
assets of the company concerned - and what proportion of those profits and
assets each share represents. If there were just two shares in Glaxo, each
would be a bargain at Pounds 1bn.
Where penny shares can be profitable is when they represent either 'shells'
 -companies with few assets which are transformed by a go-ahead entrepreneur
or recovery stories. But such success stories are hard to spot and this week
provided, in Speyhawk, a good example of a recovery stock that did not
recover. Add in the fact that dealing spreads tend to be very wide on penny
stocks, and the odds are loaded heavily against an investor picking another
Polly Peck.
All the above are high-risk ways of trying to make a million. What about
more conventional investments?
THE SLOW WAY
Equities
You can become a millionaire by investing in ordinary equities, but it could
take you a long time. Had you invested Pounds 10,000 in shares in 1945, BZW
figures show that you could have turned that into more than Pounds 1m by the
end of 1989. Mind you, your performance would have had to match the index
and you would have had to re-invest the net income. Nor do BZW's figures
allow for any dealing costs. Furthermore, someone with Pounds 10,000 in 1945
would have been very well off - that sum is the equivalent of Pounds 185,000
today.
Cash
If equities are slow, an investment in a building society deposit is the
real plodder's way of making a million. Assume you put Pounds 10,000 in a
deposit which earned 7.5 per cent net a year. It would take you 64 years to
become a millionaire. Even if you deposited Pounds 5,000 every year, and
earned the same return, it would take you 38 years to reach Pounds 1m.

BOOTS, the retailing and pharmaceutical group, hopes final results on
Thursday will dispel City worries about its prospects, provoked by recent
price battles with Superdrug. Boots shares have underperformed the stores
sector by 25 per cent since January. Pre-tax profits are forecast to
increase by up to 14 per cent, from Pounds 359.5m to between Pounds 400m and
Pounds 410m. The market expects most of the improvement to come from Boots
the Chemist, where operating profits are likely to be up almost Pounds 40m
at Pounds 285m.
Several large property companies recently raised new funds to lower gearing,
so the question over MEPC's interim results on Thursday is whether the UK's
second-largest will follow suit. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of around
Pounds 47m for the half-year to March, compared with Pounds 58.6m a year
ago, reflecting a decline in capitalised interest as the development
programme comes to an end.
Recovery in the US remains uneven and the market will be watching the tone
of Siebe's statement on activity over the pond, where it is exposed heavily.
The statement, and final results, are due on Wednesday. Analysts expect
pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 181m, against Pounds 169.6m a year ago.
They are looking for a small drop in gearing at 69 per cent for the six
months to September through cash-flow.
The Westland helicopter group is expected on Wednesday to announce half-year
results with pre-tax profits of around Pounds 11.5m, 10 to 11 per cent up on
the previous period. This quiet improvement reflects slack production work
on new helicopters and, while upgrade orders have helped to fill the
delivery gap, the group's aerospace division shows the effects of the
cyclical downturn in the civil aircraft sector. The company is expected to
hold its interim dividend, with a possible increase on the 1.25p paid at the
same stage last year.
Dunhill Holdings, the luxury branded goods company, is expected on Wednesday
to announce pre-tax profits for the year to March of about Pounds 72.2m
compared with Pounds 76m a year ago. The market will be scrutinising the
company's interest receipts, expected to show the recent cuts in UK base
rates. A dividend of 8.1p is expected, compared with 7.7p in the previous
period.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: So you've got Pounds 1m to invest .
. . - Scheherazade Daneshkhu explores the best ways to get the most for your
money / Seriously Rich
</HEADLINE>

IF YOU want to hang on to your Pounds 1m rather than simply spend it, where
should you invest it? The Weekend FT asked three private client stockbrokers
and an independent financial adviser for their views. The brief was to put
together a low to medium risk portfolio with the ability to draw a
reasonable income without jeopardising capital growth.
James Capel Investment Management
UK stocks are the clear favourite, with 62 per cent of the investment being
placed in the UK equity market. 'We believe there is scope for good returns
in the UK in the next year as earnings and profits come through,' says Simon
Corbett, head of UK private clients.
Risk is reduced through investment in large, good-quality companies such as
Bowater, BAA and Grand Metropolitan. Food and pharmaceuticals would also be
included. BTR and RTZ provide cyclical recovery potential, while Land
Securities and British Land are included to take advantage of recovery in
the property sector.
Of the utilities sector, British Gas, Severn Trent and East Midlands
Electricity should give growth and dividend increases. BT is regarded as
good value, with growth prospects in the telecoms sector. Prudential and
General Accident, the insurance companies, are selected for good yields and
HSBC for its growth prospects in the expanding Far East area.
Overseas holdings account for 21 per cent of the portfolio, with the US
having 7 per cent, Europe 4 per cent, Japan 2 per cent, the Pacific 6 per
cent, and emerging markets 2 per cent. The bond holding is in UK gilts (15
per cent) because of good yields and the lack of currency risk, and 2 per
cent of the portfolio is held in cash.
James Capel estimates the annual income from the portfolio at close to the
average market yield of 4.5 per cent, or Pounds 45,000 gross before charges.
For those wanting higher income, the exposure to gilts would be increased at
the expense of overseas markets.
Quilter Goodison
The UK market also underpins Quilter Goodison's portfolio, with 65 per cent
in UK equities, 20 per cent in overseas equities and 15 per cent in
fixed-interest securities to produce an average gross income of Pounds
40,000. 'In the short term, the UK market is concentrating on recovery
situations,' says Christopher Watkins, deputy chairman of the fund
management division.
'While they may have scope for further appreciation, in our view, this has
left many of the traditional growth stocks such as Glaxo and Unilever, and
others with high yields - for example, Bass, BATS, Argyll and Boots -
looking undervalued for the longer-term investor seeking good value.
'Utilities, banks and life assurance companies offer above-average yields
and good prospects for dividend increases.'
The overseas weighting is in managed funds. 'We are placing particular
emphasis on the Far East, Japan and emerging markets. In Europe, Italy and
Spain have their attractions following their devaluations but we would also
include France and Switzerland as having good long-term potential. In the
US, smaller companies are offering a satisfactory investment opportunity.'
Despite reservations about the size of the public sector borrowing
requirement, the fixed-interest element would be in gilts because of their
attractive real rate of return. 'Convertible stocks may be used to enhance
income if necessary, and overseas bonds where we perceive beneficial
currency changes,' says Watkins.
Cazenove Fund Management
There are two portfolios: one for the younger millionaire in his 30s, the
other for someone in his 50s. 'Our view is that equity returns in the
foreseeable future will, at least in the developed world, reflect the
prospects of low economic growth. Index-linked gilts offer an attractive
risk-free return as well as flexibility, and provide the sheet anchor of
both portfolios,' says Cazenove, which is aiming for preservation of capital
 -hence a relatively low annual income of Pounds 32,000 for the younger
millionaire and Pounds 35,000 for the older.
Both portfolios have a 40 per cent holding in UK equities but the younger
millionaire would have an additional 12.5 per cent invested in UK smaller
companies. He would hold 7.5 per cent in conventional investment trusts such
as Alliance, Scottish Eastern, Scottish Mortgage &amp; Trust, and Witan
Investment Company. One-quarter of the portfolio would be invested in
specialist overseas investment funds, with emphasis on the Far East and
emerging markets for growth. Index-linked gilts would account for 15 per
cent of the portfolio.
The older millionaire would hold 17.5 per cent of the portfolio in
index-linked gilts and 7.5 per cent in foreign bonds, for multi-currency
income and security at a time of low inflation. There would be no holding in
UK smaller companies. Conventional investment trusts would take 15 per cent
while 20 per cent would be in overseas investment funds, such as Cazenove's
own Pacific Portfolio fund.
Murray Noble
'Personal investors should move away from the traditional investment media
of UK, US, Japan and European blue chip shares because the risk reward ratio
no longer justifies their inclusion,' says this fee-based independent
financial adviser, which favours bonds over equities. It would also advise
switching out of sterling (because of its weakness) in favour of the franc
and mark.
Twenty per cent of the portfolio would be held in these currencies, offering
yields of over 7 per cent. Another 20 per cent would be put in index-linked
gilts and 40 per cent in European bonds. Murray Noble says German bonds are
particularly good value.
Only 10 per cent would be held in equities and this would be in emerging
markets (Latin American investment trust, Gartmore Emerging Pacific trust,
Turkey trust) because of the potential for growth. The final 10 per cent
would be placed in so-called 'angel funds' where private money is loaned to
established small businesses.
'There are a large number of businesses which have weathered the storm of
this UK recession and are in desperate need of funds,' says Murray Noble.
'Access to this capital is denied to them because of the shortcomings in the
UK financial system. In the US, angel funds plug this crucial gap, with
amazing results.'
An annual income of 4 per cent can be taken from the portfolio, but Murray
Noble says that drawing any more would jeopardise capital growth.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Money talks at Chelsea - Robin Lane Fox
takes a tyro with millions through the flower show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK, it has been the Chelsea flower show. I was all prepared for a
happy Monday among the plantpersons when the Weekend FT asked if I would
look at the show through the eyes of the very rich, in line with this
weekend's theme.
Fortunately, the paper arranged a ticket for one of its friends among the
recently rich. Gerry Next-Ratner is not yet a famous gardener, but he is a
king of bargain-basement shoppers who has turned his million into three
more. He wants to get into gardening, not least to maintain peace with the
lady in his life, so we met at the Chelsea Hospital entrance.
How could a millionaire resist the main tent on the Monday morning when
nobody else is supposed to be there except the press and their girlfriends?
Gerry certainly liked the tent: so much, in fact, that he interrupted a
group of judges and asked how he could hire it. He said it had the right
scale for the mid-summer frolic that he and his lady were giving near
Newbury on the evening after Wimbledon.
The members of the Floral B committee were surprised by the question. Gerry
was even more surprised by most of the flowers. It was probably a mistake to
start him off in Avenue G, the heartland of this year's civility, among the
soft colours of Four Seasons Nursery and the apparently artless arrangements
of Glebe Cottage.
Bargain-basement millionaires like quick results in quantity, and Gerry
first came alive among the newish Princess lilies which he recognised from
the florist outside his London office. He astonished Peter Smith of
Chanctonbury, in Sussex, by ordering half a borderful at Pounds 5 a plant.
I happened to remark that he would soon be rivalling Elton John, who is one
of the biggest buyers of the show lupins which the two brothers Woodfield
exhibit so handsomely at Chelsea. Gerry made straight for the stand and
ordered enough of the cream-flowered Deborah Woodfield and brick-red
Trooping the Colour to fill the rest of his border in one sweep. He was even
keener when he discovered that the brothers were avid FT followers who were
willing to swap tips as well as seed packets.
I felt I had to suggest that lupins and alstroemerias might look too
riotous. What is so wrong with a riot? Gerry answered. But if you think it
flashy, we can tone it down with a nice bit of foliage.
Not far from the lupins, we found Goldbrook Plants selling juicy hostas at a
size and price which makes a millionaire show off and order 100. When I
suggested that lady gardeners also like flowers with scent, he did a deal on
two dozen of the eleagnus Quicksilver (which Goldbrook had combined cleverly
with the hostas) and then added 20 of Notcutts' dusky lilac Congo because
the colour reminded him of a former girlfriend.
I felt I had to steer him towards David Austin and persuade him to buy up
remaining stocks of the pink-flowered FT Centenary rose because its flowers
are so much bigger than anyone else's. Before temptation flagged, we came to
rest at Blom's tulips. Every year, the Blom stand is bait for millionaires.
In their first year, but perhaps not their second, these highly expensive
tulips are certain to look their best. Gerry majored on the red and white
striped Marilyn, and then announced that he had covered every season except
autumn when he and his lady were, anyway, on Cap d'Antibes. Before I could
say Corydalis flexuoas, millionaire's restlessness had taken over. Gerry had
what he wanted and so the main tent had had it, too.
You remember, perhaps, the famous words of LB Johnson about the relative
merits of men inside the tent and men outside. At Chelsea, millionaires are
outside-the-tent people, not in. Outdoors in the sunlight, everything costs
several hundred times more.
I tried to convince Gerry that the prettiest planting and design was to be
found in this year's garden from the Daily Mirror, complete with its own
reflecting mirror and a scheme of pink, white and pale flowers from a
talented designer named John Plummer. But Gerry is not too keen on the
Mirror's politics, any more than on the new disease of outdoor gardens at
Chelsea for the 1990s. Gardens for children with learning disabilities turn
up among gardens to help the aged or gardens for people with breathing
problems. Gerry thought they were all ridiculously middle class:
horticultural correctness is not his scene.
By the main tent, he was put at ease by a timber-framed glass room with
green-grey paint and a wooden veranda. Every year, Amdega sells its
showpiece; this year, Gerry scooped the conservatory for a mere Pounds
30,000 with VAT, blinds and flooring as extras. On a crest of the wave, he
then made free with the stone garden statuary from Crowthers with planting
by Rosemary Verey.
Gerry's sights had now set themselves high. Down on the embankment, he had
caught the glint of gold in the sunlight, and it was only with great
difficulty that I dissuaded him from ordering an entire truckful of the
gold-coated pebbles and waterfalls crafted by Numoul with the help of
acrylic paint.
Further down the embankment, the competitive spirit re-surfaced. Harpers and
Queen had a huge garden of cliff-like appearance, planted beautifully with
white martagon lilies and some hybrid hellebores, which were stars of the
show. The hellebores came from the great collection of Helen Ballard near
Malvern, but her name meant much less to Gerry than the collection's new
buyer and the exhibit's backer, Lord Rothschild.
Gerry was most impressed that serious money can buy the best: he would have
been even more impressed if the exhibit's rocks had not turned out to be
made of polystyrene tinted to look like boulders. Actually, I thought they
were very clever and that their devisor, Rockscape Ltd, had found a way of
bringing a grotto within everyone's reach.
With a final flourish, Gerry spotted two enormous figures chiselled in solid
stone. What a Rothschild shows in polystyrene, a Next-Ratner orders in
granite: the antique salesperson explained that the figures were two of a
set of six, acquired recently for hard currency from the Lenin museum in
Prague.
Done, said Gerry, at a cool Pounds 29,000 and Pounds 24,000 respectively.
Millions move in a mysterious way; whatever did he want with two monoliths
of the Marxist past? 'Send them to my ex-wife,' he replied. 'She was always
ridiculously left wing until she divorced me and made off with half my
assets.'
Careful questioning of another group of judges convinced him that the
president's lunch was not open to purchase and was by invitation only.
Lovely morning, he commented, but a pity about all those fiddly little
flowers on tables inside the tent. He vanished before I could take him back
to the plantings which really matter.
Myself, I am an inside-the-tent person, but I now see why the Royal
Horticultural Society allows such staggeringly expensive extras to multiply
round the edges of the world's finest flower show. How else can millionaire
non-gardeners make up for the fact that they cannot possibly grow sweet
peas, orchids and old-fashioned roses like the ones that are grown by those
wonderfully human artists inside the tent each year?

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: In Mr Toad's slipstream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCITING cars are the ultimate present you can give yourself. For one thing,
they are relatively affordable compared with yachts or helicopters. And you
can justify the outlay by arguing that it is 'necessary' - after all, most
of us need to drive.
Motoring correspondents, most of whom show few signs of preferring to test
Metros rather than Maseratis, do point out increasingly that the 1993 family
saloon is of such a high standard that it compares favourably for
performance and reliability with the luxury car of a decade ago. Yet, in an
unbroken line from Mr Toad onwards, those with the cash or the position to
treat themselves do so.
'I'm totally in love with my Jaguar. I couldn't believe my luck when the
company agreed to give me one,' says Yve Newbold, company secretary to
Hanson. For a long time, Jaguars were off the list of Hanson-approved
vehicles. Newbold was fortunate to combine her own legendary persuasiveness
with the Ford-acquired company's improved quality standards.
'Although it's exotic to me, it's got to have a little bit of gravitas,' she
adds. 'I'd call it a racy, sensible car. It's not the top of the range or
flashy. I'd love one of the V-12s but it just would not be appropriate.'
Other City figures, just as in love with their vehicles, find them more
enjoyable as private pleasures. Amschel Rothschild, chief executive of
Rothschild Asset Management, is famed among clients and colleagues for his
passion towards his 1960s' BRM Formula One racing car. Yet very few have
seen the boss in action at the occasional club race or classic rally.
Possibly not quite the right degree of gravitas for the family image?
Passers-by could scarcely miss the eight-litre 1930 Sports Bentley of
investor and sportsman Graham Walker. He has owned a string of successful
racing yachts, all named Indulgence, and created the 1986 British challenge
for the America's Cup, besides being chairman of the newly-revived British
Pathe News.
'This is probably my favourite indulgence,' says Walker. Yet the Bentley is
very much a working car (although, for Monday-to-Friday chores around town,
he uses an Aston Martin). On one recent weekend, it took his daughter to her
wedding before leaving early on the Monday for the 1,200-mile drive to Italy
to compete in the Mille Miglia rally, a re-run of the classic road race.
Walker and his son Jago were kitted out for the trip in full helmets and
goggles. Handling this car, still capable of more than 130mph, on the
autoroute is not for the faint-hearted. 'We drove her down because, frankly,
the Bentley is far more reliable than any pick-up or truck we might have
hired from a garage,' says Walker, one of life's enthusiasts. 'You come back
from a trip like that with shoulders like Schwarzenegger.'
The chic and poised Newbold, a lawyer by training, has no desire for
incidental body-building when she drives but, like Walker, confesses to a
love of flamboyant, muscular cars that goes back many years. 'When I was
studying law, I drove a white MGB convertible around London with my four
kids scrunched in the back or sitting on the rolled-down top. Quite against
all the rules nowadays, of course, but I thought it was a blast and so did
they.'
Her progress in the lovely scarlet Jaguar is now more restrained.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Driver, make my day - The highway perils
faced by those who flaunt their wealth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOTOR CAR can be a great leveller. You might be a multi-millionaire
driving a muscle-bound bauble like the 215 mph (346 kph) Jaguar XJ-220. Or
you could be one of the long-term unemployed in a rusty Lada worth less than
the price of dinner for two in a good restaurant. In the eyes of the law,
however, you are equal.
Neither of you can exceed 81 mph (130 kph) legally anywhere in Europe except
on the less-crowded stretches of German autobahns. Even there, really high
speeds are frowned upon by the police and the insurance companies.
Should you be one of the seriously rich, therefore, pause for thought before
writing a cheque for a Pounds 415,000 Jaguar, Pounds 343,100 Bugatti EB110,
Pounds 177,600 Aston Martin Vantage or Pounds 161,563 Bentley Continental R.
Bear in mind that while a parcel delivery driver in an Astra diesel van
might get away with 95-100 mph (153-161 kph) on British motorways, your
Bentley or Bugatti, Aston Martin or Jaguar will stand out like sore thumb.
Don't forget, either, that pinching the seriously-rich owner of a car which
is travelling at 120 mph and costs more than he will earn in the next 10
years will make any police patrolman's day.
So, we have a problem. Having invested in a car that has been built
expensively to be driven safely at between two and three times the legal
speed limit, what do we do with it?
Take it to Germany? Well, yes; but, often, the only difference between very
fast driving on a British motorway and a German autobahn is that in the UK
you risk losing your licence and there you will not. Autobahn traffic can be
dense.
And do not run away with the idea that every driver keeps an eye open
permanently for high-speed overtakers and observes lane discipline
meticulously. They did years ago - but not any more.
The only way you can be sure of letting your 180 mph (290 kmh) speedster off
the leash without blue lights flashing is to join the 96 Club (telephone
071-584 9536 or fax 071-581 9429 for details). It rents racing circuits to
which members drive or trailer their super-cars and spend an agreeable day
wearing out tyres at Pounds 1,000 a set.
But what, you might ask, of the hardware of mega-money motoring? One's
thoughts turn instinctively to Rolls-Royce because, if any motor car
personifies conspicuous consumption, it is a Royce. (Never, please, a
Roller; that is like asking the butler the way to the toilet). A Rolls-Royce
Silver Spirit II just scrapes under the Pounds 100,000, key-in-hand price
barrier and a Bentley Brooklands (the marque's best buy, should you be
interested) is about Pounds 10,000 less.
The really smart Rolls-Royce product in which to be seen is the Bentley
Continental R (say, Pounds 163,000 on the road). Underneath its sleeker
coupe body, it is a Bentley Turbo R with a V8 engine of some antiquity, 6.75
litres capacity and undisclosed power ('sufficient' is all RR says, but it
must be around 320 bbp). The Continental R and Turbo R saloon leap away from
the peasantry at the lights and swoosh along very swiftly indeed in near
silence.
One would hardly call them an enthusiast's drive, but they combine
performance and sheer gravitas like nothing else.
For mood music, Rolls-Royce should deliver these jet-propelled Pullman
carriages with an endless supply of Elgar CDs.
A Rolls-Royce looks quite cheap against an Aston Martin Vantage (close to
Pounds 180,000 key-in-hand) which also draws its power from a large and
elderly V8. For a two-seater (a four-seater only if your passengers are
contortionists), it is wide and unreasonably heavy.
I find the V8 Aston Martins elephantine - but there is no denying they are
quick. A 186 mph (300 kph) maximum is claimed, although no one says where.
That archetypical rich man's sports car, the Ferrari 512 (12-cylinder,
five-litre, 422 horsepower boxer-motor) is as embarrassingly obese as an
Aston Martin on the road. On a private track, though, you see where the
money (say Pounds 127,000) has gone. As you hurtle into corners, you marvel
at its grippy nimbleness and forget about such aggravations as a gear lever
that grates every time you shift.
Ferrari claims 195 mph (314 kph) for the 512. I am sure it is right -
providing you gain access to the Nardo proving ground or buy 100 tickets for
the politzia ball before venturing on to a deserted autostrada at 4 am on a
summer day.
The latest monster supercar, the Bugatti EB110, boasts 12 cylinders and four
turbo-chargers. It puts 553 horsepower on the road through all four wheels
and is alleged to be good for 209 mph (336 kph). I have not tried it, but I
did drive three laps of the Salzburgerring circuit in a rather care-worn
Jaguar XJ-220 last summer.
This is a car in which I would not wish my worst enemy to find himself in a
long motorway tailback. The interior is cramped and one would steer it by
dead reckoning in town, although it looks rather beautiful and its Pounds
415,000 price tag says a lot about one's personal finances. Originally, it
was to have been a V12 with four-wheel drive. It appeared with a V6 engine
(which sounds like a cement mixer at low speeds) and two-wheel drive.
When Jaguar announced it was going to limit production of the XJ-220 to 350,
a lot of punters rushed to put down a Pounds 50,000 deposit. They expected
to sell-on their vehicles at a profit and the last thing many wanted was
actually to take delivery. Now, a row is in progress between Jaguar, which
insists on the contracts being completed, and the recession-hit punters, who
will not (for which one might read cannot) come up with the other Pounds
365,000.
If you expect your money to buy a high-tech as well as a high-class motor, a
V12-engined Mercedes-Benz 600SEL saloon, 600SEC coupe or 600SL convertible
is the car to go for. They are built like battleships but, despite their
considerable bulk and weight, handle like torpedo boats. In a 600SEL, you
are insulated from the outside world by double glazing. Four drop-down
vanity mirrors let your passengers apply the finishing touches en route to
the palace.
The SEC is much the same car although with only two doors; the SL is the
ultimate two-seat (well, just two-plus-two) convertible with a soft top.
Should you be careless enough to upturn one, a passenger-protecting roll bar
deploys in milliseconds.
The day of the ultra-costly, ultra-high performing car might well be drawing
to a close. For shortish journeys, a helicopter is much quicker than any car
and, for long journeys, a private jet will go further in two hours than a
Ferrari in 24. Besides which, neither chopper nor Learjet is ever likely to
suffer severe damage from a member of the lumpen proletariat armed with a
screwdriver.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Arts: Faith and guilt - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B. A. YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD of Faith was Radio 2's theme of the week, with a peak on
Wednesday, the Archbishop of Canterbury discussing the Church of England
with Jimmy Young. Radio 4, by contrast, featured Reasonable Doubt in this
week's 'You and Yours' slot. Radio 2 was more widely spread, for it covered
all kinds of religious singing, from Anglican hymns to music from Buddhist,
Hindu, Moslem and Sikh observances, with popular items like folk, pop and
congregational 'West Gallery' song. The Jamesons discussed women's
ordination - with a woman ordinand, of course.
Reasonable Doubt covered the actual commission of sin, or 'offences', as we
say now. We all worry about the number of cases in which guilty verdicts
have been overturned by matters like alleged police error; and presenter
Tasneed Siddiqi discussed such cases with witnesses, lawyers and police.
Each day last week, two cases were brought up where convicted prisoners
still insisted on their innocence. Michael Mansfield, QC, defender of the
Birmingham Six, said on Monday that there might be many dubious cases; but
on Thursday, Barbara Mills, Director of Public Prosecutions, spoke out for
the Crown Prosecution Service.
Next week Radio 3 will begin all Marlowe's plays, but the World Service beat
them to it this week with its own Doctor Faustus on Sunday. It was a very
short version, not even the 1604 edition; but that magical first act, the
spellbinding tragedy of the last, are among the most beautiful moments in
all English drama. We skipped the low comedy, though we attended an unruly
supper with the Pope. Donald Sumpter was a good Faustus, though a bit cool
in 'Was this the face that launched a thousand ships'; Carl Johnson was an
ironical Mephistopheles, properly pathetic in his regret at what he had
missed by following Lucifer; Norman Rodway had the great lines of the
Chorus. Hilary Norrish directed.
Radio 4's Kershaw in Cuba, on the last two Tuesdays, was not like Pilkington
in Kighizstan or Wilco in Spain; it gave the feeling that its original
target had been replaced by another, a better one as it happened, and I hope
Noah Richler, who produced, will not be cross with me for saying so. Andy
Kershaw is not the man you would naturally send for a political view of
today's Cuba, more for a social view, accent on music. Yet the programmes
dealt rather casually with music - there was an interesting talk with a
Finnish player in a Cuban group, and much Cuban-style music both in the
background and, less often, the foreground. What we had in fact was the
street-politics of Cubans under double restriction - the American embargo
and no more help from Russia.
It began in Miami, where Cuban exiles go. There were the successful, adapted
to American comforts; more interestingly, the committed, devoted to
rehearsing a counter-revolution. In Cuba, itself, we went first to Santiago,
where the state record company produces vinyl discs at about Pounds 1 a time
but you queue 20 minutes for a coffee. Then to Havana, whose Cubans seemed
to be good-tempered despite severe food-shortage - four eggs a week, but
endless coffee, and lobsters for the fishermen. All were insistent on being
Cuban, 'culturally, ethnically, politically'. Fidel Castro claimed that the
elections on February 25 proved that 98 per cent of the electorate supported
the socialist system, though as no other party stood there was little
argument. He thought he might step down from presidency within five years.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Arts: Welcome to Ayckbournsville - Alastair Macaulay reviews
Ayckbourn's 'The Norman Conquests' in Scarborough, and decides that it is
the perfect place for a weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

<TEXT>
THE EAST Coast has its laureates: Aldeburgh's Britten; Hull's Larkin; and
Scarborough's Ayckbourn. People now come to Scarborough just because it is
Ayckbournsville; they come from the European continent and they come from
America in whole parties. Ayckbourn joined Scarborough's
Theatre-in-the-Round in 1957 and began to write plays there (aged 20) in
1959. He is sufficiently immodest now to observe that only Shaw is his rival
for longevity among playwrights. 'I've now written 45, which is a lot more
than Shakespeare did. But then he didn't have the chance of working in
Scarborough.'
To those who have not seen an Ayckbourn play in Scarborough, that last line
may give the impression that the town feasts Ayckbourn with a luxurious big
theatre - something along the lines of those in Stratford or Chichester. So
it is a shock the first time you find the Stephen Joseph
Theatre-in-the-Round - in the grounds of a school. (Its predecessor was used
to be in part of the town library. After a few years, the library said it
needed the space back 'for cultural reasons.')
Foyer space is limited, the auditorium seats 300, stage space is hardly
larger than that of most London pub theatres, the audience has to exit
across the stage, and the air-conditioning is noisy. For these conditions
Ayckbourn has conceived most of his most successful plays.
Now the theatre is to move a few blocks, into the former Odeon cinema. The
main theatre will still be in the round, and the stage area, though improved
by hydraulic equipment, will remain intimate. But the auditorium now will
seat 400, with improved exits and air-conditioning and larger foyers; and
there will be a second auditorium seating 200. In press conference this
week, Ayckbourn did not disclose any particular ambitions to write plays to
fit the new space. He spoke instead of being able to finish his staging of
the Chekhov cycle there, and of being able to foster several new playwrights
by giving them a place to create new work.
The new theatre will cost Pounds 4,350,000; 40 per cent of that has already
been raised. Ayckbourn himself has contributed L400,000; he plans that the
new theatre should open in 1995, in time to mark the 40th anniversary of
Stephen Joseph's foundation of the Theatre-in-the-Round there, and he says
he has ensured that the larger auditorium will bear Joseph's name.
Some theatre-goers may often have wished they had an excuse to stay in
Scarborough for more than one night, but scheduling seldom makes that easy
(with each play performed in blocks of performances). This season, however,
Ayckbourn's main project for this year has been to revive his famous trilogy
The Norman Conquests, directing this 20th-anniversary staging himself; and
so one may spend three days in Scarborough watching the three plays in
succession. Though the playwright has made a few surreptitious updatings -
Norman now says 'trainers' instead of 'gym shoes' - this seems designed only
to stop the plays becoming period pieces just yet.
The gist of The Norman Conquests, you may remember, is that each of the
three plays occurs during the same weekend, but in a different part of (or
outside) the same house. Watching them in a quick series - each one stands
very well on its own - is, of course, to find the laughter multiplying
steadily with every new bit of knowledge gained about the six characters.
But it is also to be amazed by the plasticity with which Ayckbourn presents
his characters and the events of the weekend. The Norman Conquests is the
farce equivalent of Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet: relativity is
all, and all versions of the truth are true.
Four of Ayckbourn's new cast are just about perfect: Adrian McLoughlin
(Reg), Andrew Charleson (Tom), Dariel Pertwee (Annie) and Buffy Davis
(Ruth). Their playing is in-the-round in every sense; they let you see the
different shades of their characters, with wonderfully objective playing. In
the exceptionally hard role of Norman - Norman the feckless Don Juan of the
provinces, the pathetically manipulative disaster area - Peter Lindford is
almost as fine; just a trifle too practised and fluent in some speeches.
Jane Maud attends too much to the surface of Sarah, deploying a hundred
little facial, vocal and gestural actressy effects which actually bar us
from seeing Sarah.
The Norman Conquests are all about a dirty weekend that never occurs. Now,
as it happens, Scarborough is just the place I would pick for a dirty
weekend. Any town with sea-bathing, and, a mediaeval castle, cliffs, and a
good theatre comes pretty high up my list. Even on a grey day you can walk
along the cliffs for miles, with the North Sea churning below; and even if,
like Norman or myself, you fail to get a dirty weekend to work out
successfully, it is a pleasant town in which to pass the days that precede
the evenings on which you watch The Norman Conquests unfold.
The Norman Conquests is performed at Scarborough on various dates through to
September 4

FT  29 MAY 93 / Arts: Opera sings out against cuts - Six major companies go
on the offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER years of phoney crises the nation's arts companies are convinced that
the crunch in public funding will actually happen this year. The six major
opera companies - Royal Opera, ENO, WNO, Scottish Opera, Opera North, and
Glyndebourne Touring, in an unprecedented show of unanimity, have decided to
go on the offensive in an attempt to safeguard opera in the UK.
They have produced a joint letter which has been sent to all the people that
matter, from Norma Major (separate one for John) down, spelling out the
devastating effect on their activities if the government goes ahead with its
threatened cuts and freezes. In total the government plans from next April
to reduce the subsidy of the companies by 6 per cent compared with previous
promises, a reduction in funding of Pounds 5.5m.
The Royal Opera has already cancelled a planned production of Oberon; is
having second thoughts about a revival of Gawain; and has postponed a joint
production with the Kirov of War and Peace. In addition the future of its
Garden project, dedicated to new and experimental opera, is threatened. The
ENO says that it has already cut rehearsal time to dangerous limits, and
would be forced to axe its Bayliss programme of opera for the young, cancel
new commissions, and cut the size of its orchestra and chorus.
WNO would reduce touring, new productions, education and outreach; Scottish
Opera would virtually eliminate touring; Opera North would drop its new
productions, including the planned Tannhauser, and its mid-scale touring;
and Glyndebourne would forego its educational work as well as a week on the
road.
The full horror of the projected cuts is set out in the June issue of the
magazine Opera. Quite rightly the opera administrators feel that they cannot
make good the short-fall by raising seat prices any higher, or attracting
more sponsorship money in the current state of the economy. Savings will
have to be made in their work load. Compared with past disaster scenarios
this one sounds much more convincing. The fact that all the directors have
co-operated on the document, and presented their case so early, confirms
that they take the situation very seriously.
Early evidence that this could be the bleakest year for the arts in decades
comes with the news that London City Ballet, the touring classical dance
company which depended mainly on box office and sponsorship for funding, is
at last calling it a day after its July 3 performance at Bath. The Arts
Council will not rescue it and only the unlikely appearance of a generous
sponsor can save it this time.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Of questionable taste - Few tycoons spend
their money in the salerooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a source of profound disappointment to antique dealers and auction
houses that the very rich rarely buy works of art. They prefer to squander
their time, and their wealth, on houses and horses, yachts and cars and
private jets rather than develop a connoisseur's eye.
Few of the British self-made millionaires of the 1980s became habitues of
Sotheby's and Christie's, or the Bond Street dealers, and if they did it was
generally to decorate their Mayfair apartments or Cotswold mansions with
comforting 18th-century furniture.
The flashiest buyers were the newly enriched foreigners who settled here.
Al-Tajir, from the Emirates, bought most of the ornate 18th- and
19th-century silver by de Lamerie and Storr to appear on the market in the
late 1980s, and in his desire to become an English gentleman Asil Nadir
spent lavishly on the contents of his London HQ. Guided by his interior
decorator he invested a reputed Pounds 7m through the leading London
furniture dealers, acquiring solid if unexciting antiques. He gave over the
odds for many items and when the liquidators cashed in the goods in 1991
they raised only Pounds 4.5m.
Most millionaires lack even Nadir's pretensions. Perhaps the saddest aspect
of the Maxwell debacle was the tasteless 'antiques' which filled his home
and office. There is talk of his children having good pictures but, judging
by the lacklustre auctions organised by his liquidators, art was not a
dealing area to catch the Big Man's interest.
Of course millionaires often employ a tame decorator to acquire the
trappings of wealth for their homes, but this is hardly collecting. Not
surprisingly, the most avid collectors among our local tycoons have been
individuals with ingrained artistic pretensions. Andrew Lloyd Webber is the
man that the dealers and auction houses are happiest to see. Buying now
through dealer David Mason, he has amassed the finest private collection of
Victorian art in the country, if not the world.
Recently his taste has broadened and in 1992 he paid the highest auction
price of the season when acquiring Canaletto's view of the Old Horse Guards
in Whitehall for Pounds 10.12m. He went on to buy the mad Richard Dadd's
great fairy picture, 'Contradiction', for Pounds 1.65m. Both are now on loan
to the Tate Gallery, which improves their public access - and their value.
Sir Andrew is obsessed with his boyhood passion for 19th-century art, in
particular the Pre-Raphaelites, and intends one day to open a private
museum.
This is the path followed already by the other great British collector of
the last two decades, advertising man Charles Saatchi. There has always been
some confusion as to how much of the vast collection of contemporary art
amassed by Saatchi was owned by him, and how much by the agency that he
built, fleetingly, into a world leader. There is certainly no doubting its
importance, and the occasional public shows in Saatchi's north London
private museum give access to a spread of contemporary art than no public
museum in the UK can emulate. If Saatchi likes an artist, he will buy up his
entire exhibition. In the main his investments have proved shrewd and his
art collection is now much more valuable than Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
In the last two years Saatchi has been off-loading some of his early loves,
works by Andre, Schnabel, Twombley and Lucian Freud, among others, to buy
the new Minimalist artists, plus the elderly RA Carel Weight and the young
aficionado of rotting whales, Damien Hurst. Saatchi has played the art
market better than any other collector. A Cy Twombley that he sold last year
for Dollars 1.65m cost him less than Dollars 100,000. He is the exception to
the rule that investing in art is a fool's paradise.
But both Saatchi and Sir Andrew had a feeling for art before they made their
money. It does seem that unless you have confidence in your own taste,
together with cultural leanings, you are left standing at the threshold.
Pop stars are rarely short of ego and like to think their music is art so
they were natural prey for the dealers. The death of Freddie Mercury was a
severe loss to the art market. He bought widely, from Japanese prints to
19th-century paintings, with a bizarre side interest in the lightly clad
females of Sir William Russell-Flint. Paul McCartney has spent millions on
art, including paintings by Magritte, de Kooning and Picasso: his special
passion is anything relating to Rupert Bear.
Also familiar faces in the auction rooms are Bob Geldoff, a knowledgeable
buyer of contemporary art, as is Peter Gabriel; Mick Jagger (whose interest
extends to the ultimate in connoisseurship, Old Master drawings); Elton John
(who sold his eclectic group of jewels, art deco, pop memorabilia, etc for
Pounds 4.8m at the peak of the art boom and subsequently invested in
contemporary Russian art); and Brian May of Queen (early photographs).
But the commitment of British show business to art is minor league stuff
compared with the collecting of the American entertainment industry. The
hills around Hollywood are the home of the new great collections. Madonna
has her personal curator who has bought the moderns - Picasso, Leger, the
Mexican Frida Kahlo and, recently, a 14th-century Old Master Madonna. Jack
Nicholson is a keen collector of modern art, including the work of Soutine;
Elizabeth Taylor buys jewels, naturally, but also Impressionists, and owns a
Van Gogh which she failed to sell at auction for Pounds 10m; and Dustin
Hoffman buys but Teddy Bears.
American millionaires are no more avid about art than their British
equivalents, but because there are so many more of them their impact is
greater. There is also much more of an art-as-investment ethos in the US.
When Alfred Taubman, the shopping mall tycoon, bought Sotheby's in 1983, he
began to drum up turnover by promoting art as a shrewd buy among his
super-rich acquaintances. With the help of loans and credit facilities the
great art boom of the late 1980s was fuelled, and prices of Impressionist
and Modern art in particular spiralled to dazzling heights.
For a time Picassos, Van Goghs and Renoirs were traded internationally like
equities. Suspect new millionaires, like Alan Bond, borrowed recklessly to
build up prestigious art collections which they hoped would add lustre to
their business empires. Bond never managed to pay back the Sotheby's loan to
acquire Van Gogh's 'Irises' for Dollars 53.9m, but fortunately the Getty
Museum stepped in and took the painting off his hands.
Sotheby's even managed to persuade the arriviste Japanese, always
susceptible to western fads, to buy up art by the plane load. This
unsustainable bubble reached its peak in May 1990 when a Japanese paper
manufacturer, Ryoei Saiti, paid Dollars 82.5m for a Van Gogh and Dollars
78.1m for a Renoir in the same week. These are the highest prices ever
achieved for works of art and it is unlikely that they will be matched for
many years.
The recession has left millionaires much poorer, and contemplating
over-priced works of art on their walls and in their bank vaults. Meanwhile,
the handful of serious billionaire connoisseur collectors sat on their hands
and waited for prices to return to rational levels. Perhaps they feel
normality has returned. One of the great collectors is Niarchos, the
shipping tycoon. He is believed to be the buyer of Cezanne's 'Still life
with apples' which sold for Dollars 28.6m in New York earlier this month,
making the auction houses smile for the first time in three years.
Other knowledgeable collectors are Baron Thyssen, who is also a director of
Sotheby's and who bought a Constable at auction there for Pounds 10m;
Barbara Johnson, the widow of the baby powder tycoon, who bought the
Badminton cabinet for Pounds 8.58m; Sol Steinberg, the publishing
billionaire and buyer of expensive Bacons; and Walter Annenberg, another
American publisher. When the price goes above Dollars 10m at a major
Impressionist sale they are likely to be among the half dozen likely bidders
 -unless Sotheby's and Christie's have managed to convert a new player to
the game.
As big collectors of British and European art, like Paul Mellon, stop adding
to their collections, or like Wendell Cherry and Malcolm Forbes, die, the
future for the collecting of traditional European artefacts dims.
Fortunately most of the great works are already in museums, and some
museums, like the Getty and the Kimbell at Fort Worth, are as well endowed
as any rich individuals, and can pick up masterpieces at auction.
The fact remains that whereas a century ago anyone who made a fortune was
likely to seek social acceptance by assembling an art collection, these days
the desire is absent. There will still be great collections assembled, but
in esoteric fields. The era of the great buyers of Old Masters,
Impressionists, furniture and silver, is past.

THE LAST WORD by Paul Micou Bantam Pounds 14.99, 252 pages
CROSSING THE RIVER by Caryl Phillips Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 237 pages
REMEMBERING BABYLON by David Malouf Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 200 pages
AMERICA IS where it all happens, religion-wise, and nowhere more so than in
Gawpassat, a prosperous little New England town. Here Uncle Ian Richmond,
the mystical central figure of Paul Micou's latest novel, has set up the
Institute of the Word, a tax-free organisation dedicated to making money and
peddling religion, in that order.
So successful is Uncle Ian that the fruits of his labour include a large
mansion, a nationwide TV show, Dollars 70m in cash, and a canary yellow
helicopter in which he flits from airport to home to yacht club on the
Lord's business. Not bad for a failed lawyer.
But Ian has a problem, one that will not go away. He is going to die soon -
the date of his death, preordained by God, has been predicted in one of his
many best-selling books on the Word - and he has no successor, no heir to
the Richmond empire.
Enter his nephew, Matthew 'Top' Richmond, a shiftless traveller whose only
claim to fame is that he once climbed Mount Everest in the company of a
black man. Matthew soon discovers what is expected of him. Discovers too
that there is much more to Uncle Ian than he had ever imagined . . .
It is a nice little satire, neatly crafted, gently poking the subject in the
ribs without ever drawing real blood. Micou is not a man for the jugular
when a simple nudge will do. He has an original mind, and a quietly cerebral
sense of humour.
Rather more sharply etched is Crossing the River, by Caryl Phillips, a
thoroughly absorbing novel which continues a theme dear to the author's
heart, namely the 18th century slave trade and the African diaspora
thereafter. The book begins with the sale of two brothers and a sister into
slavery, and in four disparate pieces traces the fortunes of some of their
descendants.
It sounds unpromising on paper, but is rather better than that in practice.
Phillips was recently identified by Granta magazine as one of Britain's 20
best young novelists, in which capacity his work has been condemned by
fellow writer Julie Burchill as absolute crap. But if La Burchill can find
anybody to read the book to her, she will discover in fact that it is
actually pretty good.
The first piece deals with a freed American slave, sent back to Liberia by
his indulgent master. The slave is supposed to be taking religion to his
less fortunate brethren, but when his master follows him he finds that the
slave has regressed under the influences of Africa and is living little
better than . . . well, a savage.
The second deals movingly with the plight of an elderly American negress,
hoping against all the odds to be reunited with her daughter, sold away from
her when the plantation was auctioned. The third recreates the log of the
18th-century ship which transported the original slaves, and the fourth
tells the story of a wartime Englishwoman who has an affair with a black GI
and bears his child, which is given away for adoption.
On the face of it the four stories appear to have little in common, but they
are all united by a strong narrative and a very high command of the English
language. The author is a rapidly maturing talent, and Crossing the River is
unquestionably his best book to date.
Good too is Remembering Babylon by David Malouf, a tale of the Australian
outback in the last century, when much of the continent was unexplored. The
story is seen through the eyes of a teenage castaway, washed ashore on the
coast of Queensland and rescued by a tribe of aborigines. He lives with his
rescuers for the next 16 years, until the first white settlers arrive and he
gets a chance to rejoin his own kind.
The book begins with his return to civilisation and the difficulty he has in
adjusting to a very different environment. He is taken in by a Scottish
family, which regards him more as a cuckoo in the nest than as one of
themselves. Other whites are wary of him, particularly when they catch him
talking to a couple of abos.
If the idea sounds vaguely familiar, that is because Malouf has covered
similar ground before in his earlier novel An Imaginary Life. Remembering
Babylon is in part a reworking of the same theme, a reflection of Malouf's
abiding interest in nature and the great outdoors.

PILLION RIDERS by Elisabeth Russell Taylor Peter Owen Pounds 14.95, 165
pages
SECOND SPRING by Max Egremont Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 275 pages
A RIVER SUTRA by Gita Mehta Heinemann Pounds 9.99, 277 pages
A MIRROR FOR LARKS by Victor Sage Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 9.99, 439 pages
SHORT sentences in a very short narrative, a buried world under the one we
are shown: Elisabeth Russell Taylor's Pillion Riders is a small masterpiece
of reticence. The story of an 'absolute' love, where no cost is counted, it
becomes a tale of disillusion because the beloved is not worth the feeling
he arouses: physical joy is all and it proves to be not enough.
Petulant and bored, a poor little rich girl married to a much older husband,
Opal is ready to be swept off her feet when Jean-Claude, a young composer,
turns up. On first meeting, in post-war Paris, without a language in common,
they flee to a freezing attic with a single cold tap and a hole in the
floor, shared with a house full of other tenants.
For some years, passion warms them, though both are unfaithful. Selfish
disagreeable though Jean-Claude is, one can believe how Opal is dazzled. But
the vicious attitudes of his peasant family come through, including
anti-Semitism fuelled by guilt at having betrayed Jews during the war. Opal,
though she still passionately desires him, is unable to stand more, and
leaves. In this chilling tale of the failure of romantic love, the writing
is precise, tight-knit, beautifully paced, and never in any spurious sense
romantic.
Max Egremont's Second Spring is more leisurely in style, set in the present
with its roots in a not-so-distant past. Alex von Kierich's right hand, with
its crushed fingers, declares something; as a conspirator in the plot to
kill Hitler, he was tortured. Was he the hero he seems, though? Is his aide,
the English Edward West, right to idolise him? Rumours force him to resign
as head of an aid agency, and he retires to the quietest life he can find.
Edward has also retired: to an English village, to gardening, local politics
and attraction to the daughter of nearby friends. Even after a meeting with
his old chief in Germany, things remain ambiguous. Edward finds no way of
judging Alex. Nor do we. 'We were all under fire then,' Alex says.
Guilt and betrayal are not as straightforward as they are in the ugly
post-war France of Pillion Riders. As in Edward's village politics,
carefully observed, resentments, hatreds, even snobberies play a part. Who
can judge?
This novel is full of vignettes from varied lives, of social observation and
the memory of unthinkable evil; of contrasts the mind can hardly accept, and
possibilities no-one dares face. Written with grace and humanity, times and
places are interwoven with panache.
Sutra means a thread or string, and is also a term for literary forms. On
the thread of the river Narmada, a holy site of pilgrimage, a number of
Indian stories in Gita Mehta's A River Sutra are told to the manager of a
rest house, a vanaprasthi or forest dweller, one who has withdrawn from the
world. The job gives him time for reflection and the story suggests the
variety of those he meets or hears about on the edge of river and jungle.
They are sad, violent, paradoxical and touching, always infused with
religious feeling; they involve people of all social levels and all
religious groups, except Christian.
These fleeting encounters, with their stories of change and development, of
new identities and often terrible sadness, are valuable to an outsider as
peepholes into Indian life and attitudes. They give a sense of landscape,
conjuring sounds, colours, textures, light, the monsoon, the river in every
mood and season, in a direct, dramatic way, without explanation or apology.
To read them is to be steeped in Indian life, to experience at least
something of its culture, although much of the mystery remains for an
outsider.
High finance, bloodstock and betting, which often go together, are
mysterious to outsiders and have a glamour all their own. Victor Sage's
first novel, A Mirror for Larks, is about all three, and the Italian phrase
which the title translates means bait, lure, false inducement. It is also
something almost unheard of today, a love story more or less without sex.
The narrator, Raymond Bosanquet, owns racehorses, loves betting, and plans
to set up a stud farm, all of which takes money, plenty of it. So when he is
introduced to a scheme for shifting millions to and from third world
governments, with a rake-off for himself on the way, he is not surprisingly
agog. From Florence to Monte Carlo to Paris, he and his cronies chase the
elusive but, for a while, not implausible millions and the whole thing bowls
along at a tremendous pace. Till the end, when realism takes over and the
tone changes. The face of someone who has just jumped from a sixth floor
window and is lying still warm in the morgue can hardly be described in
anything but horrifying terms.
The narrative is stretched, but most of the way it is irrepressibly good
company, with a sense of knockabout adventure that allows one to do what
real life so often forbids - to dream the impossible, never counting the
pennies or, in a wider sense, the moral cost.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Arts: Pretty, but misjudged - Max Loppert reviews WNO's new
production of Eugene Onegin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ONEGIN, in events shaped by an exact blending of accident, whim and fatal
misjudgment, the youthful hopes and dreams of all its leading characters are
shown to be crushed. The pessimism of Tchaikovsky's conclusion is pitiless,
the more so for having been reached by a dramatic process of
illusion-stripping leavened by the aura of country ease and familial
affection in which the early scenes are bathed.
This is one of the most deeply affecting of all operas. Or, rather, it can
be - when a just mixture of economy, tact, emotional depth and precise
characterisation is seen and heard to guide the direction of its staging and
score. In the new Welsh National Opera production it proves, alas, largely
un-affecting. The reason is not hard to find: a production hardly more than
a concatenation of arty effects, drenched in icing-sugar prettiness and, in
the finale, in over-the-top melodrama.
Howard Davies, a noted 'straight'-theatre director, was in charge of the
WNO's similarly arty Idomeneo last season; the difference, however, is that
he seems to have made a much bigger, indeed a monumental hash of Onegin. In
the Royal National Theatre's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof not long ago, he showed
himself a masterly judge of time, place, atmosphere and style. One of those
minor mysteries that dog the performing arts is how those same properties
could so comprehensively have been misjudged here.
Davies obviously wanted to make this the Chekhov opera that Tchaikovsky
failed to write (the collaboration between composer and playwright being, of
course, one of operatic history's most tantalising might-have-beens). To
achieve it he moves forward the period of Onegin to that of The Three
Sisters. Nothing intrinsically wrong with that; but from the railway line
surreally angled through the permanent set (by Bob Crowley) for the first
two acts, one senses that this has fuelled an ill-argued attempt at Social
Comment - crudely fulfilled in the third act, with its fin de siecle ball
full of social-malaise doings risible in themselves and constantly
contradicted by the music.
Worse than this is the Hollywood-and-water romanticism imposed on the early
scenes - all fluttering curtains artfully opened and closed (a lot of that,
and deeply significant every time) and peasant girls twirling balletically
across the stage and people sinking to the floor amidst trails of leaves and
snow. The main characters - Onegin and Tatyana above all - are allotted
stage actions which end up by robbing them of plausible motivation.
Often, brand-new motivation of mind-boggling stupidity is supplied. Drink,
if you please, drives Onegin to behave badly at the Larin party; Gremin's
aria is addressed, mirabile dictu, to Tatyana as well as Onegin. To play the
title part as an unshaven lout with a violent temper simply diminishes the
emotional drama. Again and again one feels the dramatic momentum ebbing
away, the heartfelt involvement of principals and chorus undermined, as
fancy stage pictures are created. Ah well - it does look pretty.
Carlo Rizzi is not, at this stage, a conductor able to restore balance
through the musical delivery. This is his first Onegin, and it shows - while
shapely, warm-toned orchestral playing betrays the presence in the pit of a
lively musician, his whippings-up of crypto-Puccinian excitement in moments
of passion denied Thursday's performance that very quality of tender
expansiveness through which Tchaikovsky's musical secrets are most
completely revealed. A fair amount of the David Lloyd-Jones translation got
covered.
The pity is that the cast, made up mostly of newcomers to the opera, could
have been encouraged to deliver a great deal more: above all the greatly
gifted Jason Howard (vocally a strong but unexpectedly dull Onegin), but
hardly less so Peter Rose (a loud, coarse Gremin). The Larin family - mother
(Penelope Walker) and daughters (Janice Watson and Yvonne Burnett) - display
a pleasing similarity in vocal vibrato, and form altogether an unusually
credible family unit.
Miss Watson's Tatyana, her lyric soprano cool but with lovely promise of
lustre and even lushness to come, is already the nearest thing WNO possesses
to a 'real' Onegin performer. One international element has been added: the
American Neil Rosenshein as Lensky, a role he undertook at Covent Garden
seven years ago. Since then, much heavier roles have been taken into his
repertory - at a price. Though Mr Rosenshein remains a touchingly
communicative actor, the dryness and wobble of his louder singing were
painful to hear.

<TEXT>
THE BOGGART by Susan Cooper Bodley Head Pounds 8.99, 182 pages
BOGGART GOES by many different names, depending upon which dank, dark corner
of the British Isles you happen to inhabit. In the Isle of Man he is known
as a Buggane; in parts of Scotland other than the one in which the opening
chapters of this book are set, he might be referred to as a Bogle. Two
characteristics of his character remain constant, however, no matter where
he happens to live: he is an invisible creature that haunts particular
places; and he is essentially a mischief-working thing, not one of the
devil's darker representatives upon this earth. He is a games-player, a
trickster, given to japes and tomfoolery; a creature with a talent, if not
an instinct, for happy, meaningless mischief.
Susan Cooper is best known for a quintet of novels known collectively as the
The Dark Is Rising sequence which were amongst the finest achievements of
children's literature in the 1980s. In these books she made a thoroughgoing
imaginative investigation of many of the myths and legends of the British
Isles, and also set herself the task of attempting to define the very
substance of myth - the timeless battle between good and evil, light and
dark, for example - within the wider context of a multi-faceted examination
of the history of Britain itself.
In a sense her new novel The Boggart is picking away at some of the same
rich seams; but it is also, significantly differently, drawing our attention
to the way in which there are quite as many unfathomable mysteries in our
'technological' present as there have ever been in the so-called 'primitive'
past.
The Boggart opens with a delightfully doleful piece of scene-setting in the
Western Isles of Scotland, melancholy as any random skirl of the pipes. A
lonely boggart, attendant for millennia upon the MacDevons of Castle Keep,
witnesses the death of the last scion of the old family. Accustomed to
making his mischief down the centuries in the peaceable fortress of Castle
Keep and having no knowledge of the present, the boggart is innocently
unaware of the fact that the world of the present day has effectively driven
out the Old Things, burying the wild magic beneath layers of reason and time
. . .
Then everything changes - utterly. The MacDevons' nearest surviving relative
proves to be a Canadian theatre director of Estonian origins. The family of
four (which includes two children, Emily and Jessup) pays a brief visit to
Castle Keep to claim their inheritance, taking the boggart back to Toronto
with them by accident . . . the boggart wreaks havoc in the Canadian
present, causing mayhem in the family's antiques shop, and ruining its
Hallowe'en celebrations.
Matters take a darker turn still when Emily's mother invites the ethically
dubious Dr Stigmore to investigate whether her daughter might not be to
blame in some way, being of a sensitive age. The doctor concludes that, as
an emotionally disturbed adolescent, she shows every sign of having fallen
prey to emotions that are classical links with poltergeist phenomena such as
they are now witnessing.
The boggart, slandered, persecuted, misunderstood, finally decides to take
refuge in Jessup's computer, from where he communicates with the children by
a piece of unintelligible gibberish that proves to be not the evidence of a
virus attacking the programme but a phrase in Gaelic (recognised by one of
the theatre's principal actors, a Celt himself), which means: 'I want to go
to my own country'. And so he returns, down the line.
The introduction of the supernatural into children's books, in whatever
shape or form, can often induce a sense of world weariness in the reader. It
can be an excuse for covert preaching (as in the case of CS Lewis) or, at
the opposite extreme, a species of spurious light entertainment. Seldom does
its evocation remain faithful to the spirit of what is known to be true of
the beliefs of both past and present; and, incidentally, seldom has a book
succeeded in reminding us that there are just as many superstitions and
bizarre hopes linked to the possibilities of the computer terminal as there
have ever been to the book of Common Prayer.

the South Sea Bubble are still pertinent / Books

<TEXT>
THE SOUTH SEA BUBBLE by John Carswell Alan Sutton Pounds 18.99, 293 pages
FLIGHT or suicide? Nadir jumped his bail, Maxwell drowned himself. It was
ever so. Old Craggs, a major player in the South Sea Bubble, took an
overdose of laudanum. Robert Knight, the secretary and lynch-pin of the
company, who bribed members of the Commons and peers of influence at Court
with the sang-froid of a man who has lost all sense of reality, took the
other way out - he fled to the States of Brabant, not quite so difficult to
extradite from as North Cyprus but extremely complicated. In those days
there was no plea-bargaining, an American invention that half-saves the
fraudster.
This reprint of Carswell's book, first written in 1960, has been triggered
by the discovery of a small cache of documents dealing with the British
government's effort to extradite Knight. Although the British government
went through the motions of requesting immediate extradition, secretly it
begged the States to keep him, even persuading them to fake an escape from
Antwerp when he was elsewhere. It is a splendid farcical end to the South
Sea saga of 1720-21, but Carswell thinks it to be of more importance than it
was. He sees the hand of Robert Walpole everywhere, but it was Townshend,
not Walpole, who was responsible for foreign affairs. In 1721 the firm was
still Townshend and Walpole, not vice versa.
But, as ever, for those who could bear the strain of exposure (and several
could not - Stanhope had a heart attack and Sunderland, although found not
guilty, succumbed shortly afterwards), the bulk of those involved in the
South Sea Bubble frauds survived. Their assets were confiscated. Their
holdings in public companies could not be denied but concealment of others
proved easy enough and most of them lived on in comfort and not penury. Even
Blunt who, after the Knights, was the most guilty of men for he had
corrupted the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Aislabie, got off not lightly but
at least afloat.
There was one difference between these fraudulent men and those who have
followed them down the centuries. The South Sea Bubble involved ministers
and washed around the Court and the Royal family. One good thing the Bubble
achieved was to frighten, forever, the politicians; ministers of the Crown
have, since the Bubble, been very circumspect. As for the City, on it goes]
In spite of some distortions and errors, the book is a very valuable one and
still the best account of the South Sea Bubble. It would make good reading
for any city financier: the dangers inherent in the passion for money, in
many ways more exciting, more illusory and more destructive than sexual
passion, can corrupt quite suddenly men of ability and judgment whose
ambitions and opportunities would seem to be satisfied. But greed, like
lust, stokes its own flames.
England's emerging financiers - promoters of schemes rather than traders,
the stockjobbers whom the landed gentry feared, hated yet longed to use -
were of short experience, as indeed were those in France who were embroiled
in John Law's Mississippi Scheme at the same time. And, of course, there
were few rules. Insider trading was in no way illegal; in fact there was
little or no control of any kind of chicanery and the judges took the robust
view that if the punter was fool enough to be taken in, then it was not for
the law to protect him.
In the end, the South Sea Bubble proved to be not very grievous in its
results - salutary perhaps for merchants and, of course, disastrous for some
men, women and families - rather like being a Name at Lloyds today. All were
not losers. For those of fine judgment it made millionaires and gave London
one of its great hospitals - Guy's, built on Bubble money. Even those whose
estates were rightly confiscated, in the mysterious ways of high finance
somehow flourished. Money, like dung, tends both to stick and to fertilise.
The younger Knight was soon back in the House of Commons and ensconced in a
vast Warwickshire country house and an Irish peerage followed. Shame has
never been a very common emotion in the City.
Carswell is at his best when describing his rogues' gallery of punters. He
has a nice eye for human weakness and is not over plagued by a sense of
social morality. After all, in the South Sea Bubble it was largely the
seriously rich who bled the merely rich. True, a few moderately rich men
like Sir Isaac Newton burnt their fingers, and it should be remembered that
those who bought their stock and sat on it come hell or high water did quite
nicely. Such prudence is still practised by a few when the market goes wild.
I feel, however, that there is still a book to be written about the South
Sea Bubble, but until it is written Carswell must be kept in print. In spite
of errors of scholarship and of judgment, it is a splendid dramatic tale
which rings bells and teaches wisdom.

A VIEW FROM THE WINGS by Ronald Millar Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99,
386 pages
THE STORY GOES, told by Sir Ronald Millar himself, that the day after
Margaret Thatcher resigned literary agents from around the world were on to
him non-stop to procure his help in seeking the lady's memoirs. In
exasperation, he said 'How about mine?' The next day one of them rang back
and said 'Why not?' A View From The Wings is the result.
Millar was the prime minister's speech-writer and (we now learn) a close
friend of the Thatcher family. He is the man who gave us such lines as 'The
Lady's not for Turning' at the 1980 Tory Party conference. He had also
written for Edward Heath and has dabbled with John Major. But it was clearly
Mrs Thatcher with whom he had the greatest rapport. Either she or one of her
colleagues invented the word 'Ronnification'. It meant that Millar had to be
sent for, often at the last minute, to put some spark - and a few jokes -
into a prepared text.
The practice worked very well. Whether you liked them or not, her conference
speeches were certainly striking, and Millar was helping her even before she
became prime minister. The interesting question is what made the
relationship click. Yet analysis is not Millar's strong point and he
provides no complete answer.
True, as he was told by CP Snow, he had the advantage of not being paid and
therefore not being a threat to anyone else's job. Millar also notes that
the first rule of speech-writing is to tailor the speech to suit the
speaker. Another is 'if stuck, go for a quote'. That is how he served Mrs
Thatcher. But he could not have done it if he had not been an actor and a
playwright, and the lady herself had not had a hankering for the stage. The
pair tended to address each other as 'dear' and sometimes even 'luv'. Some
of their exchanges recorded here seem distinctly camp. It must have helped
that Millar got on well with her main supporting partner, Denis Thatcher.
Between them they saw the funny side.
Even before he fell in with the Thatchers, Millar had a habit of landing on
his feet. His mother was widowed early and turned from amateur to
professional acting to make a living. There was never much money, but
usually an uncle to help with the school fees. In his youth Millar tumbled
on characters such as Ivor Novello and Noel Coward much as he later ran into
prime ministers. Even the now Norma Major was the nanny of the leading
actress in Millar's Robert and Elizabeth. She went off and married a Lambeth
councillor.
The book falls into two parts. The first half, about Millar's stage and
Hollywood career, is the more enjoyable because it tells a story that is not
widely known. Anecdotally, Millar has quite a lot to say about early wartime
Cambridge and his experience of the navy. This is a lesson which all writers
of memoirs should note: a life is not necessarily less interesting because
the character was not famous at the time.
By the time he comes to part two, on his association with Downing Street,
Millar is milking it a bit. We shall get better inside stories than this. He
also becomes remarkably reticent about himself. What was he doing when he
wasn't writing speeches for the prime minister? Few clues are offered.
Still, this is a happy book. John Major needs a speech-writer, too, but
probably Millar's not the man.

AND WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER? by Blake Morrison Granta Boks Pounds
14.99, 219 pages
ALL DECENT people have a book like this within themselves. The marvel is
that so few get round to sustaining it, though scribbled reminiscences must
sit in plenty of old desk drawers. For a son to celebrate his father's life
might be reckoned an act of common piety; but it also becomes an exercise in
self-definition, from the moment one utters a certain phrase and hears the
old man speak. Towards the end of his account, Blake Morrison reveals that
he has taken to seeing a therapist since his father's death. Perhaps, then,
it is not only piety and self-definition, but therapy too.
There is nothing extraordinary to report about Arthur Morrison, GP and
Yorkshireman. He was not a saint. He indulged in some gentle but steady
adultery, he enjoyed minor infringements of the law, he believed in no god,
and he spent every Sunday Simonizing his car (the law, he thought, was less
inclined to catch a speeding car if it was clean). He loved his children and
his wife, and was evidently held in local affection. You would have welcomed
his predictable chat over a pint and, more or less, trusted his medical
sense.
He died of cancer of the bowel, but he was 75 when he went. The reportage of
his death is poignant, but he seems like the sort of GP who would have
despised the notion that you have to die of something in old age, as if
otherwise you might carry on for centuries. As a ghost he makes a late
appearance and demands of his son 'What's the big deal about death?', but we
are not confined to the moribund man and the book is not all loaded with
grief. Astringent flashbacks catch father and son at intervals over 40 years
 -camping in the Lakes, polishing that car, tinkering with their DIY chores.
Even an expert at the father-son relationship like Arthur Miller would be
hard pushed to make anything dramatic of this yet, curiously, the book does
not suffer for lack of drama. Father in his dying state is not like the
drunken Noah, needing to be covered up. He meets death with dignity. His
peccadilloes have no tragic consequences, and those occasions when the term
'old sod' seems to fit him best are related without rancour.
The power of the book is drawn from its ordinariness. Never mind that this
is a literary editor at work: the fact is that the subject of the
hagiography is a man only ever seen with a copy of Jaws in his hands (and he
never finished that). What we like is the characterisation of a survivor,
who is easily understood by his endearing paternal dicta ('How much for
cash?'). The last vignette is bitten-off, and brilliantly done. Four weeks
before his death, he is still in charge around his son's London house,
having just mended a chandelier. He switches it on to test it. Then off
again. And in the darkness: 'Excellent. What's the next job, then?'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Distressed governesses - Jane Eyre was the
exception not the rule, says Anthony Curtis / Books

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE VICTORIAN GOVERNESS by Kathryn Hughes The Hambledon Press Pounds 25, 256
pages
'READER, I married him'. According to The Victorian Governess - an
informative account of this much exploited member of the domestic workforce
 -frequently she did not succeed in marrying anyone. Jane Eyre was the
fictional exception, not the rule in real life.
At around the age of 40 - the normal cut-off point for enforced retirement,
but it could easily come when a governess was still in her early thirties -
she became an isolated old maid, worn out by her exacting years ministering
to the spoiled brats of the aristocracy or of the newly rich merchant class.
She would be put to grass with nothing to live off except her meagre
savings, the financial support of her own family and such handouts as her
former employers might send her from time to time. Her likely fate was a
home for distressed gentlewomen or the dreaded alternative of the workhouse.
Much more typical of the conditions and expectations of the average
Victorian governess were those endured by sweet-tempered, God-fearing Agnes
Grey in the novel of that name by Charlotte's least famous literary sister.
We observe Agnes in two equally awful posts before she finally escapes into
a happy marriage with the curate (the optimum end to the governess story).
It is from Anne Bronte that we receive a full picture of the daily round of
humiliation experienced by someone who by birth and up-bringing was a lady
but who could never rely on being treated like one. Agnes became a governess
at 18 and was, like her creator, a clergyman's daughter, motivated by the
spirit of adventure but also by economic necessity. In that respect she was
very typical
Kathryn Hughes documents the 'plight' of the governess with a great deal of
material drawn from contemporary social history, fictional portraits,
memoirs of former governesses and advice books for aspiring governesses that
abounded throughout the Victorian era. As well as the three Rs the governess
was expected to provide her pupils with a rudimentary understanding of
French and German, and also tuition in music. To be expert in the latter
accomplishments increased her marketability and could help her to command
Pounds 15 to Pounds 20 a year for the novice to an exceptional Pounds 80 to
Pounds 100 at the linguistic and musical top of the scale.
Though she played a key part in a prosperous entrepreneurial society,
freeing its adult members from day-to-day parental responsibilities, the
governess totally lacked any economic or social clout. However great the
demand for governesses might become, it was always grossly exceeded by the
supply of new ones coming onto the market. The new governess soon discovered
that her status was painfully ambiguous - a gentlewoman, a
mother-substitute, employed on account of her refinement and breeding, but
just as much at the mercy of the whims of all the family as were the
servants below stairs.
The most famous governess of the later period - the narrator of The Turn of
the Screw - was quite exceptional in that she was given sole responsibility
for her charges in a household where her employer was completely absent and
where she was able to form an alliance with the housekeeper.
The relationship between her predecessor Miss Jessel and the upper servant
Peter Quint would have been a most unlikely occurrence. The governess as a
force exerting any moral pressure for good or ill within such a household
seems to have been more a creation of novelists and playwrights than a
reality.

IT CANNOT be so much fun being rich during the summer. True, you can take
off to those exclusive resorts which take pains to exclude the hoi polloi,
but from a gourmand's point of view, far too much is cheap.
This is not the case in winter, when the poor man's money goes on fuel. Not
for him the pungent game birds of the autumnal shoots, the precious truffle
unearthed from the frozen soil, the tropical fruits flown in from farmers
basking in the sun on the other side of the globe.
In the summer we may all live a little off the fat of the land: cheap
strawberries, fresh asparagus, peas and beans; there is spring lamb on the
butchers' stalls; the first gooey cheeses appear in the market made from the
milk of cows, ewes and goats nurtured on grass for the first time that year;
even wild salmon comes down in price so that it begins to nudge the farmed
stuff and tempts the brave man to splash out on the real thing.
Some things are actually free. Even in London bramble bushes yield delicious
blackberries and for those with a keen eye there are masses of wild
mushrooms to be gathered in the woods.
A few things, however, remain gruesomely expensive. One of these is caviar.
The most expensive caviar is beluga and in May the first of these little
whales are culled in the Caspian Sea.
In the old days they were transported across the Baltic on ships and reached
Britain more than a fortnight later. Now the best stuff arrives in
refrigerated lorries or is bought in Germany: the main market for both
Russian and Iranian roes. This year, for the first time ever, W G White had
its first beluga flown in for a lavish press breakfast at the Dorchester
Hotel in London.
The importance of this gesture is to convince an increasingly sceptical
market that these expensive eggs are still worth the price. There has been a
lot of talk of pollution in the Caspian and with the break up of the Soviet
Union there has been an awful lot more dodgy caviar shipped to Britain in
the bags of Polish sailors and Iranian airline pilots.
How good the caviar was in the first place is open to question, but a more
important issue is how well it was stored. The best caviar was always sold
to the main dealers for hard currency. Only the second quality was sold on
the domestic market.
There is also an obvious need to keep fresh fish in perfect condition if the
consumer is not to place his health at risk. With much of the caviar
currently on offer this is not proven. Buy from reputable dealers only.
Foie gras is another rich man's pleasure and one which is often mentioned in
the same breath as caviar. This was also seasonal: you extracted the liver
when you killed the goose - at Christmas.
Foie gras is easier to obtain out of season these days: firms such as
Georges Bruck in Strasbourg and Rougie in the Landes provide goose and duck
foie gras both in tins and in fresh terrines. The UK is still well behind
France, however, in the availability of fresh foie gras. Few but the very
top shops go to the trouble of making their own terrines.
Foie gras brings truffles to mind, but truffles are also seasonal. The first
whites are dug up after the November frosts in Piedmont. The blacks come in
around Christmas. The season is a short one, and it is over by the spring.
Even the rich have to make do with jars of truffles at this time of the
year, which generally lack the inimitable pungency of the fresh tubers. Your
best bet is to buy frozen.
Of course wild mushrooms are an alternative, but for the meaty cep you will
have to wait for the autumn. You may find consolation in girolles (or
chanterelles) for the time being. These are at their best during the summer
months providing the weather is not too dry.
And still the shopping basket is only half full. Acorn-fed, Iberian black
pig ham is at last available in London, something which the Spaniards used
to keep very much to themselves. You may buy the great poultry of the French
Bresse, but you will have to wait until Christmas before you may find a
capon.
Minute phials of balsamic vinegar change hands for fantastic prices and some
of these make their way over here. Olive oils are scented with white
truffles and ceps. Miniscule pots of saffron contain the stigmas of
thousands of crocuses. There are still gulls' eggs to be had, although you
will have to hurry as the season is drawing to a close. And Jamaican Blue
Mountain coffee? Or single domaine Darjeeling tea? Yes, there are still a
few paltry pleasures to be had in the summer while you muse on the greater
glories that come with the shortening days.
Caviar: W G White will supply direct (tel: 081-992-8764) or from Harrods or
Fortnum &amp; Mason. A meagre 50 gm pot will cost Pounds 68 from Harrods and
Pounds 78 from Fortnum. Harvey Nichols obtains its caviar from Princesse
d'Isenbourg and charges Pounds 45.79 for 50 gms of beluga. The same caviar
may be ordered direct for Pounds 3 less (081-960-3600).
The most expensive foie gras in Britain is Rougie's Mille Feuille goose
liver with 6 per cent truffles at Pounds 70.50 for 400 gms. This is
available from both Harrods and Harvey Nichols. Harvey Nichols does fresh
foie gras from Rougie at Pounds 50.40 per lb. Harrods and La Boucherie
Lamartine (071-730-3037) make their own terrines: Harrods' costs Pounds
14.95 a quarter, Lamartine's Pounds 48 per lb. Both sell uncooked livers
should you wish to make your own.
Frozen truffles can be bought from Harrods (one week's notice) for Pounds 28
per oz - otherwise you will have to buy jars. Lamartine's are Pounds 85 for
six blacks. Fresh girolles are Pounds 18 per lb from Harrods, fresh morels
Pounds 6.50 a quarter from Harvey Nichols.
Black pig ham is Pounds 13.75 a quarter from Harvey Nichols, Bresse poultry
Pounds 6.35 per lb from the same source or Pounds 5.50 from Harrods. Last
Christmas a 7lb Bresse capon cost one Harvey Nichols customer Pounds 150.
Harvey Nichols sells 100 ml bottles of 12-year-old balsamic vinegar for
Pounds 32.45, Harrods has some strange German wine vinegars including an
Eiswein vinegar at Pounds 36.90 for 25ml.
Truffle oil costs Pounds 4.95 for 55ml from Harvey Nichols. Saffron is
Pounds 1 a gm from Princesse d' Isenbourg, which flavours its foie gras with
it - to interesting effect.
Gulls eggs are 95p each from Harrods. Blue Mountain coffee is Pounds 18 per
lb from Harvey Nichols and Bloomfield Darjeeling costs Pounds 9.90 a quarter
from Harrods.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich (Food and Wine): Ah yes, the dreamy,
satin-textured '66 - Jancis Robinson recalls a sensational, ground-breaking
tasting with expert winemaker Jean-Claude Berrouet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN MY nearly 20 years as a wine groupie I have been to many seriously grand
tastings. An over-comprehensive look at the 1959 claret vintage springs to
mind. Much more clearly than any single wine, I remember an Irishman
whispering as we filed solemnly into a chamber full of tasting samples: 'If
only we could actually drink one of these wines with dinner tonight.'
At least I remember the glory of the Ch Latour a Pomerol among the vast 1961
tasting I attended (playing hookey from the launch of my own television
series in order to do so). Claret is the most common tasting subject because
it is a long-lived wine produced in quantity, and submits neatly to being
divided 'horizontally' (same vintage, different chateaux) or 'vertically'
(same chateau, different vintages). My tasting file is stuffed with
purple-spotted notes on such events.
But it was not until last month that I came across a tasting of the world's
most expensive claret, Ch Petrus, Pounds 800 a dozen bottles in a dire
vintage, several thousand in a good one. Perhaps this is partly because the
British, so few of whom can afford it, tend to look very, very slightly down
their noses at it.
It is Pomerol, for a start, a parvenu that affords dangerously instant
gratification. No pain is associated with tasting fleshy young Pomerol,
which does not suit the masochist brigade reared on tannic young Pauillac
and St Estephe.
For this reason London is not the most likely place for a Petrus tasting -
but I hardly expected to come across one in the backwoods of rural France.
In fact, seasoned observers like me do not expect to come across consumer
wine tastings of any sort anywhere in France outside the capital. Wine
tasting is not the leisure activity in France it has become for British
consumers.
But here it was, lying in the reception of a smartish hotel in the depths of
the French countryside, where the average annual income must be well under
FFr100,000 (Pounds 12,000) - an application form for tickets, at FF1850, for
a forthcoming tasting of Petrus. Seven vintages back to 1945, if you please.
And the very night before I was due to leave.
The organiser of this unmissable event, tied in to an auction also held at
the hotel which I still kick myself for missing, is Michel Fauveau, who
works on Toulouse's huge aerospatial campus. (When I asked him what he did,
he told me: 'I observe the Earth'.) An obvious obsessive, he has transformed
his obsession with wine into the Club Oenophile du Midi (tel: 61 27 37 69 or
62 24 43 34).
The organisation of the event was fascinatingly different from the British
norm. For a start, the application form included the question: 'Are you
familiar with wine tasting?' which I cannot imagine being asked in Britain.
Nor can I imagine Fauveau's British counterpart demanding verbal input, as
in the classroom, from tasters who had paid more than Pounds 200 for the
experience.
And I would not have thought that many Brits would have dared stroll into
the tasting room with a cigar, as the auctioneer did. Yet the average age of
the 28 assembled tasters (for two bottles of each vintage, a generous
serving) was impressively low, partly reduced by a member of the French
national football team and his entourage.
The tasting was presented by a noted expert, in this case the Petrus
winemaker Jean-Claude Berrouet himself, who shares with his employer,
Christian Moueix, a sensible view of wine's place in life. He pointed out
somewhat ruefully that wine tasting as such is something new in France,
something 'tres Anglo-Saxon'. The point of wine, he rightly stressed, is to
be drunk, preferably at a table with food.
And that was another important national distinguishing mark. You can spend a
lifetime at wine tastings in Britain before anyone mentions food, but at
this early evening tasting, Berrouet and most other commentators suggested
dishes - increasingly specific dishes as dinnertime approached - to go with
each wine.
With the 1945, in decline and smelling of 'a nice 18th century manoir,' a
tableful of local doctors proposed ris de veau aux truffes.
It was hard to discern any national variation in taste, but since no
activity is more subjective than wine tasting, this is hardly surprising.
There were considerable variations between the bottles in the older
vintages, but the 1966 that reached the table I shared with Mme Fauveau was
a dream: seductive, tannin-free, headily perfumed, satin-textured and much
more concentrated than the bottle of the often vaunted 1967.
I was also bowled over by the 1982, which is intense and meaty and has many
years to go, and the 1962 (made, as Berrouet was careful to point out, when
there was not a single oenologist, or qualified winemaker, in the Pomerol
region) was also fabulous, tasting provocatively close to its peak.
The rich, almost porty 1971 with its notes of chocolate and coffee is
another vintage the seriously rich should be thinking of clearing out of
their cellars, while the 1975 was a delightful surprise, the vintage's
notorious tannins well in retreat.
For me, this had been a sensational tasting, breaking new ground in subject
and location, but I had to wait just 48 hours before being put in my place.
At a double magnum dinner back in London, admittedly designed for seriously
rich wine collectors, I met a Belgian who told me that at his Petrus tasting
he had not only had all the vintages, but all seven bottlings of the ne plus
ultra 1947.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Tales of honest corruption - As They Say in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY OWN contacts with the seriously rich have been of a fringe nature. I have
brushed up against those who have brushed up against the fringe members of
that group which graces these pages. They are the people who have often
become enormously wealthy in their own right but have also helped to enrich
others. They are the honestly corrupt.
There is a crucial point that has been missed in the reporting of current
Italian scandals. Its most central characteristic is that Milan is
Tangentopolis, or Kickback City. Milan is also the richest sub-region in the
whole EC. Many will deduce that it is the city's wealth that has made it the
centre of the corruption bringing Italy to its knees.
A moment's reflection should dispel that illusion. Corruption bears little
relationship to the availability of money; poor societies are more corrupt
than rich. And in Italy there is the reality of Naples to offset the example
of Milan.
There is corruption a la milanese and there is the napolitano version. One
works, the other does not. Some years ago Italy rewrote its national
statistics to achieve the sorpasso, the overtaking of Britain to become No 5
in the world's GNP stakes. The justification was the uncounted value of the
country's black economy. And corruption is part of that seamless black
fabric.
Honest corruption can ensure that industry grows without being hampered by
pettifogging restrictions. Honest corruption means that a bribed official
stays bribed and does not sell his services to another bidder. Honest
corruption can ensure substantial savings on the cost of expensive law
enforcement agencies designed to stamp it out. And it provides a means of
permitting the super-rich to spread their wealth around a bit.
There are two sentences I recall from fringe members, or at least spokesmen,
of the group of which I write. The first was enunciated by a Swiss banker 20
years ago who told me: 'Nobody who has never been to prison can be a
success.'
At the time I was inspecting a Mediterranean property development which he
had backed. It was before the flowering of the timeshare movement and was
based on offering north European investors a free week a year in the
development plus 'interest' on a fixed-term loan which was geared to the
rental income generated. The bank helped individuals (subject to exchange
control in their own countries) to obtain their money to invest in the
project.
A problem would arise when the loan matured. I wondered how it would be paid
off or replaced. That was when the banker smiled and pointed out that the
investor would be encouraged to maintain his stake because the alternative
would mean his national authorities would be given details on how he had
illicitly transferred the initial investment. The scheme helped both to
unleash large sums of productive medium-term capital and to end the
iniquities of exchange control.
The other seminal phrase came at the end of an interview about the Latin
American debt crisis I conducted in 1988 with a local central bank official.
When I had turned off the tape recorder, I said: 'Now, come on, how much of
the money was stolen?'
'Senor, the money that was stolen was invested better than the money that
was invested.' We now have the evidence of the truth of that judgment:
long-term gains were secured by ensuring that Latin American governments
were not able to waste the money that had been so improvidently borrowed.
The peoples of eastern Europe were saved by the men and women who became the
modest super-rich of their societies during the long night of communism.
These Ivan Boeskys of socialist arbitrage would leave Warsaw railway station
with nothing but a few pairs of jeans, and return from a fortnight on the
Trans-Siberian with caviar, samovars, and what appeared to be Chinese
schnapps. These would be sold for dollars and the process would start again
from a higher base.
Free markets dealt these operators a savage blow. The young man who bought
deutschemarks legally with his zloties for the first time could, for a few
weeks, make a fortune driving to West Berlin and returning with half a ton
of wurst two years past its sell-by date.
But he was soon overtaken by improved consumer information and the spread of
open markets. He found to his horror that those officials who had made his
life so difficult in the past were becoming the new rich of the 'economies
in transition.' The men who had constructed a ludicrous system which
survived only thanks to those who bent the rules now became the lords of
spontaneous privatisation.
Today the nightclubs of eastern Europe are no longer populated by the
enterprising youngsters who almost made their societies work. The paunchy
middle-aged in dreadful suits, wrists laden with gold jewellery, have taken
their place. They can afford apartments in Paris and London. They have made
off with bits of state-owned factories which they once managed. As a Polish
scientist told me: 'They do not even know how to use a knife and fork
properly.'
In the eyes of western experts these are the new 'honest corrupt' of the
transition process. The test is - will they make the system work?

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Refresh your body and give your mind a
holiday - Lucia van der Post finds that fat farms now offer a lot more than
lettuce leaves and lemon juice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS MAY seem perverse and it almost certainly sounds spoilt, but I have
spent years turning down blandishments to become thinner, more beautiful,
less toxic, more toned, to have my crystals dispersed, be wrapped and
pampered, pummelled and hosed down.
I've said 'No' to invitations to almost every fat farm in the country. You
would need to be very rich, very depressed or very daft, I reasoned, to want
to put up with the boredom, the lettuce leaves, the fatties in shell-suits,
when you could perfectly well be dining on lemon juice and lettuce leaves in
the comfort of your very own home.
But I was wrong. Fat farms, these days, are no longer for fatties. Dear me,
no. Fat farms have metamorphosed into health spas or hydros (terminology is
all) and these days it is stress, not flab, that brings most of the
customers. The days when they revolved round nothing but calories,
calisthenics and cellulite have gone and though you would never confuse it
with eating at Quaglino's, you certainly will not starve.
Which isn't to say that visiting a health farm is entirely stress-free.
What, for instance, do you wear? Forget Jane Fonda; health spa chic is
summed up by a luscious, thick, white towelling robe. Not that everybody
knows this. If you are one of those sensitive souls who feels mortally
affronted by the sight of a shell-suit (I know this may sound odd, but
believe me this would include almost the entire fashion fraternity) then a
health farm is not for you.
And what on earth do you wear for a massage, the massage virgin may want to
know? (The same towelling robe, which you then discard and nothing else it
seems, but modesty is preserved by a lot of very intricate play with towels,
practised as skilfully as if it were an ancient branch of origami, as first
one limb and then another is extracted from beneath the towels.)
And does the lady with the seaweed wrap require you to take everything off?
(She does, she does, and here there is no scope for subtle towel play as you
are painted from neck to toe in fishy-smelling mud so you just lie back and
think not so much of England as of the wonderful things it's doing for your
cellulite).
A health spa, you soon learn, is another country. Think of it as going
abroad - it helps if you speak the language and adapt easily to strange food
and customs. Conversation is strange and limited - not everybody is at their
wittiest when wearing no make-up and nothing but a towelling robe in front
of total strangers - but you soon get the hang of the lingo.
Strange-sounding remedies . . . holistic massage, aromatherapy, G5 massage,
cathiodermie, seaweed wraps, flotation tanks, full body exfoliation, high
pressure Blitz water jets . . . become the stuff of daily chat and it isn't
long before one is quite relaxed about looking daft.
Most health spas have evolved a formula that is roughly the same - they are
usually in large country houses with gravel drives that crunch nicely as you
drive up. New 'wings' and 'spas' have usually been added on to cope with the
ruthless accounting these projects involve. Staff ratios are high and at
their best they are as comfortable as a luxurious hotel. Most never escape
the faint whiff of the hospital or the convalescent home as rafts of
white-clad personnel wander round brandishing sphygmomanometers and seeking
to discuss one's 'medical history.'
Most are set in lovely grounds (my husband, for instance, loved the fast
early morning walks at both Champneys and Grayshott Hall because of the real
beauty of the landscape), all have pools and gyms, libraries and
quiet-rooms.
You should check what is on offer carefully - most include one massage a
day, use of the gym, the swimming pool and sauna as well as all sporting
facilities and classes in the basic day rate charge. Beauty and special
treatments, which are many, various and full of alluring promise, are
usually extra.
You soon learn that serious body-care costs serious money. You could
perfectly easily run up an extremely large bill in no time at all. At
Grayshott Hall, for instance, I whirled from my daily massage (included in
the daily rate) to a 'stimulating G5 massage ' to a seaweed wrap, a
'Minimise Your Middle' class, fitting in two tennis lessons and a 'Step to
The Beat' class in between, all of which added up to Pounds 485 for two days
and nights. My husband, though, who had just one treatment (the Flotation
tank - 'like lying on a lilo, except there is no lilo') totted up just
Pounds 342.30.
Some are more spartan than others. At Grayshott Hall, for instance, there is
no alcohol on the premises at all which could come as something of a shock
to some (it certainly would have done to me if I had not thought to bring my
own supplies) whilst at Champneys they will sell you half a bottle of wine a
day.
Though much that is on offer is the same, the atmosphere and the clientele
varies. The designer set seemed to gather at Champneys, old money goes to
Forest Mere and Henlow Grange seems to have a nice little niche in the
celebrity market while Grayshott Hall has a good raft of professional
people.
All, however, are agreed on one thing - the new approach to fitter,
healthier eating means you need to eat plenty of starchy foods such as
potatoes, rice, pasta and pulses, a moderate amount of lean protein and very
little fat and refined sugar. Salad dressings, we learn, can be made from
lemon juice, garlic and lots of herbs. Sauces can be made from low-fat
yoghurt, meat ('never,' said Linda Brewer, who is in charge of La Jalousie's
Spa, 'eat a portion bigger than the palm of your hand') should have skin or
fat cut off.
The end goal these days is much more awesome than merely dropping a few
pounds - nothing more nor less than 'to establish long-term healthy
life-styles'. 'Life-style counselling' (new buzz word) is available for
those who can face it.
Holistic, new-age chat is everywhere - flotation tanks, yoga, reflexology,
holistic massages are all the rage. The treatments are lovely but I could
have done without the psycho-babble that goes with it - it's when they feel
your toes and tell you that they have glimpsed your soul that I start to
crack. Reflexologists, in particular, have a strange obsession with
fallopian tubes and ovaries whose current state they relay, acting rather
like radar, to the mummy on the table.
I loved the tennis (the clinic at Champneys and the coaching at Grayshott),
loved the exercise classes, adored the massages, and by the end felt
pampered, squeaky clean, silky soft and so laid-back I wasn't sure if I
would ever make it up again. It was a wonderful chance to try out a vast
range of treatments, classes and activities and see which ones I would go
back for. I enjoyed the fact that the food on offer was fresh and ample and
calorie-counted so you knew what you are downing but gloriously bereft of
those nasty fats and sugars.
A weekend is not long enough for dramatic transformation but it lifts the
spirits, sorts out the impurities and encourages the will-power. I have
become rather hooked. I think it will be Eugenie-les-Bains next - a
combination, so they tell me, of Michelin three-star restaurant, low
calories and health spa. A perfect rounding of the circle - you work out in
the spa in order that you can put it all back on again in the restaurant.
Of course, there are those who say if they are going to spend these kind of
sums then they would rather spend it on a truly sybaritic long-haul holiday,
somewhere like, say, the Caribbean . . . Ah well, then I have just the place
for you. Jalousie, a lush, green plantation in St. Lucia where outside your
very own cottage (with very own patio and plunge pool) you fall asleep to
the croaking of the tree frogs and the high-pitched whirr of the cicadas and
you wake to the palms waving and coconuts crashing. All around are mangoes
and avocadoes, blue skies and choices . . . choices . . . choices. Quite
stressful, really.
Shall I go to aerobics at nine (run by the delicious Leslie whom, it seems,
everybody always wants to take home with them) or have a bash at
scuba-diving? Shall I see whether my water-skiing technique has survived a
three-year gap or go for something more relaxing, like a seaweed wrap? Then
there is the pedicure, the manicure, the tennis lesson with Barum and the
round-robin tournament at five all to be fitted in.
Jalousie is a holiday resort and a spa all in one - every one of the four
restaurants offers a low-calorie menu but you do not have to have it while
pool lizards need never make it to the spa. Use of the gym, the tennis and
squash courts, the pool, the water sports and the classes as well as all
meals, snacks and drinks are included, just the special treatments and a few
special activities are extra.
Most of us, however, were there for the action. Wedding and Home wanted her
scuba-diving certificate; the Evening Standard was on a serious keep-fit
binge (aerobics, then work-outs in the gym followed by intensive sessions on
the running machine); the Express was into grooming and GQ was there to lend
tone in his cream linen bespoke suits and battered panama.
As for me a sliced second service, thinner thighs, neater waist, smaller me
was the aim and though that is pushing it in just four days, I have nearly
mastered the serve and there really is marginally less of me. I am addicted
to the running machine, have come away with five different recipes for
low-calorie salad dressings and hope one fine day to be back.
It is, of course, a long way to go to get fit but you could not hope for a
more beautiful place to do it in.
Most such places have one serious drawback (apart, that is, from the price)
 -to be truly at ease you need to put your mind on hold or tell it to crash
out. Forget Proust. Resign yourself. You are not going to read Decline and
Fall this time. Then you can just relax and enjoy it.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: How to fight evil of cellulite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MENTION cellulite in medical circles and a look of quite exquisite vagueness
crosses the countenance but I have not met a woman yet who does not know
exactly what it is. It is fat that is more than fat. It is the fat that
tends to gather round thighs and buttocks, that wrinkles and dimples and
looks like orange peel. Most women dread its arrival as they might the
plague. Its root cause is imprecisely understood but the consensus is that
it is caused by a combination of hormones (which is why it is almost
exclusively a female complaint), sluggish circulation, sedentary life- style
and accumulated toxins.
There is no simple way of dealing with it as so many factors are involved. A
good diet, replacing tea and coffee with water, coupled with regular
exercise is a start but most cases need more specific help. Here are some of
the most encouraging solutions.
Grayshott Hall's 'Stimulating G5 massage' (Pounds 17) was very aggressive
and not very enjoyable and I was never going to have anything to do with it
again until I looked at my legs. They were distinctly better. It made more
difference than any other treatment. It is available in many health salons
including the Hawkins Clinics in Putney and Wimbledon where a course of six
treatments (and sauna) costs Pounds 72.50.
Aromatherapy is, by contrast, marvellously enjoyable, involving a massage
with heavenly-smelling oils. Aromatherapy Associates, 68 Maltings Place,
Bagley's Lane, London SW6 has treatments aimed at shifting cellulite and the
consensus is that it really does help by breaking up fat deposits,
encouraging lymphatic drainage and improving the skin texture. A course of
five costs Pounds 166.25.
Most dramatic of all, most expensive and the only truly medical treatment is
Cellulolipolysis. It is a non-surgical treatment involving transcutaneous
electrotherapy. Although I haven't tried it I was much impressed by the
evidence of an independent German doctor who says it is the only treatment
that really deals with the problem. Six treatments cost Pounds 820. Contact

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Major and minor equality at Eton - Nigel
Spivey discovers bright minds, happy faces, and not the faintest whiff of
boiled cabbage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAD primed myself to breeze into Eton College unawed and brashly
meritocratic. After all, travelling to Eton from Cambridge is not a simple
matter of changing venues for the same traditions. Cambridge has women,
Cambridge wears grunge; and no one would now believe, on the face of it,
that the same monarch founded both Eton and King's College, Cambridge.
For King's is, of all Cambridge colleges, the spearhead of grunge and good
causes and gender awareness. At King's, they try to be as unlike Eton as
they can. And since I generally admire the ideals of the dons at King's, I
motored towards Eton if not with a chip on my shoulder, then at least smugly
determined to advertise the fact that you can get to Cambridge perfectly
well with a pauper's education.
At 7pm on a warm May evening, the playing fields of Eton were murmurous with
as many as 1,000 well-heeled athletes. This was the sight which filled
Thomas Gray, the unofficial Eton laureate, with melancholy. He watched the
boys at play and saw only 1,000 innocents, bound unwittingly for all life's
disasters and disappointments. Who tosses the googly? Who sends that frisbee
shimmering over the greensward?
Unlike the poet, though, I found myself not only engrossed briefly in a game
of cricket where whites were worn and handshakes exchanged, but also
gladdened generally by the youth, the variety and the number of these people
on the playing fields. Happy shining faces. Promise and energy everywhere.
True, the nearby unbeautiful town of Slough and the M4 are blotted utterly
from one's consciousness here. It is a little paradise of wickets, walls and
running streams, ringed by great old horse chestnuts. But, instinctively,
one felt this to be the rightful place, and these the rightful pursuits, of
adolescent boys on an early summer's evening.
Money talks. And public schoolboys, too. Later that evening, I sat down to
dinner with some of the masters and the boys; and while I blundered along
with my inquiries ('What is the Wall Game all about?' and 'Can you play
Fives with four?'), I became aware that with these boys, who were lower
sixth (or whatever Eton calls it), there was no need to condescend. They had
wit, they had charm. They strung together sentences without the yeah, right,
kind of, sort of, er, basically inarticulacy which characterises most modern
youth-speak. You would happily have had their company every night of the
week. I was not sure whether to envy or pity those who had to keep these
bright minds occupied in the classroom.
Dinner was cooked by a member of the fair sex, who in Eton argot is known as
a dame. I never saw her, but understood a dame to be some sort of
matriarchal presence prevailing at each of the 25 constituent houses of the
school. The house I visited seemed rather elegant: not bestrewn with
bachelor mess, and not a whiff of old sports socks or boiled cabbage.
More well-spoken Adonises knocked about on a croquet lawn outside. The
absence of girls did not appear to have stunted their growth, or turned them
into rude uncivil brutes. I gathered from the masters that Eton has no plans
to admit women as pupils and, against my own expectations, I found myself
applauding that resolve. This school is about schooling. Sex can come later.
There is no need to relate details of the lecture I gave to one of the
school societies. It is enough to say that no speaker could have wanted a
better-informed or more sparkling audience. Again, I was struck by the
confidence of these Etonians. And their manners: each one appeared to have
mastered the art of being polite without aloofness, charming without
unction.
The dress code of the evening was smart by most standards, but casual
according to Eton rubric. The full sartorial glory of the place was not
revealed until the morning when I stepped out onto the High Street and fell
in momentarily with what appeared to be the dawn end of a society ball.
Then I registered that these jaunty hedonists had files and textbooks tucked
under their arms. Bunter Major, Flashman Minor, Widmerpool Minimus - all
rendered equals, of a sort, by their white tie and tails.
The master who had been my host waved me off. He, too, was in white tie: a
scholar dressed as nattily as any courtier. I had heard him rise at 6am to
begin his marking and preparation for the day. And I had realised already
that the elegance of manners at Eton presented a deceptively fogeyish front
to a system of education based on straight hard work - a system committed
fundamentally to producing mature and lively minds.
In short, I drove off as an Old Etonian manque, a troubled meritocrat. So
money can buy you good grace. So shortage of cash is not the necessary
foundation of a well-built character. No wonder Eton oozes such confidence.
There is no need to change, even when all around is changing. For Eton is,
in the best sense of the phrase, an island of class in a classless society.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Ship ahoy - afloat on a sea of oil money /
Keith Wheatley investigates the market for luxury yachts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO sell luxury goods believe that money never vanishes: it simply
moves on. Customers may change but the overall demand remains. Take
super-yachts, for instance.
'The market has shifted from British and American owners,' says Jonathan
Beckett, a partner in yacht-broker Nigel Burgess which sells more of these
largest and costliest toys than anyone else. 'It touched down briefly in
Japan, but I don't think life at sea fits the recreational pattern of most
Japanese. Some of the brokers thought of opening offices in Tokyo, but I'm
glad we didn't.
'Then, the market was briefly with French and Italian owners, but we're now
back with the Middle East plus a resurgence of interest from France and
Holland. Indeed, we're selling boats to younger men in the Middle East.
Quite often, their fathers bought yachts 20 years ago in the first rush of
oil money and they've grown up with it as part of their lives.'
In spite of the recession, Burgess had its best year ever in 1992 and sold
seven 'large yachts,' a term owing as much to cheque-books as waterline
length or tonnage. Such vessels cost Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m; Dollars 20m
would be unusual but not spectacular.
Yachts such as the liner-sized Trump Princess - owned in the past by both
the New York property speculator Donald Trump and Arab wheeler-dealer Adnan
Khashoggi - pass (on paper) through brokers' offices. So do glorious
restoration jobs such as the 1929 Rosenkavalier, 217ft of Weimar glory built
by Friedrich Krupp.
Its original owner, yeast magnate Max Fleishmann, followed the fashion of
the times by copying the lines of an 1890s' steam yacht. Although it looked
an antique, it was propelled by 750hp diesels of the kind that went on to
power Hitler's navy.
The new owner is Andreas Liveras, a British-based Greek Cypriot businessman.
The yacht's satellite communications and accommodation are as modern as
those at any international hotel but Liveras has gone to just as much
expense to restore and preserve the original engines as if they were Old
Masters - which, in a way, they are.
Is the market recession-proof? Are these the extravagant toys of men - the
owners are always men, although the boats are often named after wives or
daughters - so rich that the ebb and flow of the profits cycle is nothing to
them? Probably not.
After a peak in prices during 1989, the whole market seized-up for a year
during which almost no mega-yachts was sold. They sat in the harbour at
Antibes, France, like white tombstones. Vessels once used for non-stop
socialising were tended by just a solitary shipkeeper, pumping the bilges
and polishing the brass work.
Designer Jon Bannenberg, the most successful man in his field, was an
exception; new-build projects for yachts costing more than Dollars 30m
continued to keep his office at Chelsea, west London, working flat out.
'Cars and trains can't be made individually any more,' he says. 'Yachts are
the last way of creating a totally unique environment that you can travel
in.'
But Bannenberg - an aesthetically fierce man who admits to giving shipyards,
and even clients, a hard time - admits the business is heady, even
dangerous, from a commercial point of view. 'No one actually needs these
vessels. You need only four or five people to decide not to build and you
haven't got a business.'
After the Gulf War, there was a distinct pause in orders. 'We hung on and
ran the company very tightly. We never make the mistake of thinking we have
the right to live like the clients.'
What owners appear to want, more and more, is boats that can be lived-on
comfortably for weeks at a time. If the ultimate modern luxury is privacy
and seclusion, the super-yacht offers it in abundance. Faxes, modem-linked
computers and satellite phones mean that keeping contact with an office
presents no problems.
William Simon, a former US Treasury secretary who now operates a huge
investment business, runs his operations for several months each summer from
his 110ft sloop Freedom. One year, it cruised the entire South Pacific while
the boss continued to buy and sell on the New York markets.
Although aerials and satellite domes can look ugly on a sailing yacht or a
restored Edwardian classic, there are ways round the problem. Recently,
Bannenberg created a false second funnel for an older yacht undergoing
stem-to-stern restoration. Inside were all the external electronics for the
communications.
Will yachts continue to get bigger? 'Ten years ago,' says Beckett, '40
metres was a big, big yacht. Now, the benchmark is 50m-55m. But there will
be a tailing-off. For one thing, costs increase proportionally to
displacement, which rises exponentially with length. Second, if you build
something 80m long, you are virtually stuck on a floating island. Only three
or four desirable ports in the entire Mediterranean are open to you. Not
many of my clients want to be anchored three miles off St Tropez.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Chance to break free of the hordes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LUXURY TRAVEL is not for everyone, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. First-class
tickets. Executive helicopters. Private islands. Toffs' safaris. Exotic
playmates. If these things make you feel guilty or uncomfortable, then you
are part of mass travel - the happy, cut-price hordes.
But there are times of the year when even those of modest means and limited
social achievement can discover whether they have any sort of talent for
luxury travel. At present, anxious to drum up business, even the world's
grandest hotels are launching seasonal offers to encourage business.
A good example is Orient-Express Hotels, one of the world's best hotel
companies, which has a dozen properties. At peak times these hotels are way
beyond the reach of those of common purse. But from now until late autumn,
all sorts of people are welcome to try them.
Orient-Express recently produced its first-ever brochure of seasonal offers.
Take the Hotel Cipriani in Venice, probably its most famous hotel, located
on its own private island, Giudecca, a short cruise by private launch from
St Mark's Square. I stayed there six years ago and was charged Pounds 19 for
a cup of tea and sliver of fruit cake. The shock knocked me over.
Between October 10 and November 7, however, the Cipriani is offering
double-room accommodation and breakfast (Sunday to Thursday nights only) at
Pounds 102 per person, a fraction of its normal charge. The Cipriani's food
is outstanding, but unless you are extremely rich you will find it essential
to do what I did: take the launch to St Mark's and eat in town.
Other low-season deals at Orient-Express properties include: Mount Nelson
Hotel, Cape Town, South Africa: six nights' double accommodation with
breakfast, Pounds 307 per person, until October 31. Great views of Table
Mountain. Excellent gardens and swimming pool. Reasonably eccentric (always
a good sign).
The Lodge at Vail, Colorado, US: three nights' double accommodation with
breakfast, Pounds 161 per person, June 12-30 and September 1-October 3. I am
not a skier. I find it rather common. But last June I stayed at The Lodge
and enjoyed it considerably: no snow, perfect weather, tennis, horse-back
riding, walking in the mountains.
Observatory Hotel, Sydney, Australia, close to the harbour: three nights'
double accommodation, Pounds 193 per person, until September 1.
Welcome Hotel &amp; Golf Course, Stratford-on-Avon: double accommodation from
Pounds 50 per person per night, including breakfast, various dates in August
and winter. This is one of the nicest, best-located country-mansion hotels
in England. It is a mile or so outside Stratford, on the road to Warwick,
and is set in 157 acres of parkland, lakes and formal Italian gardens. Stay
three nights and you get a free round of golf.
Another upmarket company that is offering seasonal discounts is the much
larger Inter-Continental Hotels, which recently unveiled savings of up to 60
per cent in 39 European properties.
The programme runs from today until September 12, with rates starting at
Pounds 65 at the Forum Hotel, Berlin, and Pounds 85 at the Castellana
Inter-Continental, Madrid. The rate buys you a luxury double room any day of
the week, breakfast for two and all taxes and service charges, payable in
local currency.
In Europe, participating hotels include the Amstel in Amsterdam, the Grand
in Paris, the Churchill in London (Inter-Continental's most recent European
acquisition; it has five in the UK all told), De La Ville in Rome, Carlton
in Cannes, Ritz in Lisbon, Athenaeum in Athens and Forum in Budapest. Rates
at the last-named are from Pounds 89 per night.
Aside from Europe, discounts will be available this summer in virtually all
Inter-Continental and Forum hotels in Asia and the Pacific, Latin and north
America, and in parts of the Middle East and Africa.
Orient-Express and Inter-Continental are only two of a number of upmarket
hotel groups world-wide. The latest Relais &amp; Chateaux guide, for example,
covers 411 independent hotels and restaurants in 40 countries.
Orient-Express Hotels reservations: UK, tel: (071)-928-6000; US:
(800)-237-1236; France: (01) 45 62 00 69.
Inter-Continental Hotels: London: (081)-847-2277, UK outside London:
(0345)-581444; US: (800)-327-0200; France: (01) 05 90 85-55.
Relais &amp; Chateau: London: (071)-491-2516; France: (01) 47 23 41 42.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Where pearls grow on trees - Christopher
McCooey visits a sheltered bay where gems are farmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MCCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AZURE SKY and a cerulean sea in a bay surrounded by green hills. We are
in the Ise Shima national park on the Pacific coast of central Japan.
A bamboo raft rocks gently as a boat draws alongside. Mrs Asano steps nimbly
on to the floating platform and ties up as her husband shuts down the
outboard motor. The Asanos have come to check their oyster baskets to see if
nature has worked her alchemy to produce for them some lustrous pearls.
Mrs Asano, wearing a white cotton bonnet to shade her eyes from the sun and
its reflection off the water, pulls up the first basket of oysters. Deftly,
she inserts a wide-bladed knife into the joint of the bivalve and twists it
open. The point of the blade searches in the fleshy organs of the creature's
body and pops out a perfect pearl into an aluminium dish.
She picks it up, making a duck's beak with her thumb and index finger, and
turns it this way and that, examining it critically. It glistens with the
body juice of the oyster that produced it, but when the juice is wiped off
it begins to glow sensuously with a rainbow-like aura. There is the merest
blush of pink and an evenness of lustre. It is a moment of primal pleasure.
'I have opened thousands and thousands of oysters in the past 20 years,'
says Mrs Asano, her round face split by a dazzling smile enriched by a full
set of gold-capped teeth, 'but it is always exciting, especially when you
find a pearl of great beauty like this one. We can sell this for Y50,000'
(about Pounds 280).
Not all pearls fetch such a good price. The very best pearls are sold
individually, but the majority of the Asanos' pearls are sold by weight
through a co-operative venture which holds auctions periodically. The big
companies, like Mikimoto, send buyers to the auctions and the Asanos' annual
production of about 8 kilogrammes is then graded and marketed by them.
For centuries, natural pearls were used as charms, talismans and adornment
for noble men and beautiful women. Taken in powdered form, they were used as
potions for love and cures for lunacy - one and the same condition, some
might say. But during the last century, several people began trying to
produce cultured pearls, including a German named Hessling who experimented,
unsuccessfully, with freshwater pearl cultivation.
It was the eldest son of a noodle shop owner from Toba, on the Pacific coast
of central Japan, who succeeded in convincing the skeptics that seeding
oysters to produce pearls was a viable business. He wasn't the only pioneer,
but Rokichi Mikimoto's great talent was not only in raising cultured pearls
but marketing them as well.
Mikimoto irritated his first oyster in 1888. He prized it open and inserted
a foreign body into the living mollusc's reproductive organ, and then
returned it to the sea. A foreign body in the gonads even sounds irritating.
As might be expected, the oyster did its best to ease its discomfort by
secreting nacre (mother of pearl) and isolating, by enclosing, the irritant.
Eventually, after countless failures, Mikimoto succeeded in producing a
pearl, although it was not spherical. That was in 1893; it took him another
12 years before an oyster gave him his first artificially cultured - but
perfectly round - pearl.
This pioneering work was done in Ago Bay, in Mie prefecture. Today, the
sheltered bays of Mie account for 70 per cent of Japan's production of
cultured pearls, of which about half are exported. About 10,000 people are
involved in commercial pearl cultivation in Japan.
Pearls are among the few organic gems; jet and amber come from plants. The
Asanos begin the process of making this most feminine of gems by growing
oysters on trees. When female oysters are spawning they release thousands of
larvae into the water, to come to rest where they may. The Asanos lower
trees into the water in suitable locations and the little molluscs attach
themselves to the branches.
'After two or three months,' Mr Asano grins, 'we raise up the trees and
transfer the oysters to barrels which are then left in the sea for another
two or three years.'
When the shells are about 6cm across, they are ready for use as mother
shells. Pearls can form in other shellfish, in abalone and mussels, for
example, but the pearl oyster (pinctada fucuta) is the most suitable host
for cultured pearls.
'Half the oysters that are seeded die,' says Mr Asano. 'Of the remaining 50
per cent, 10 per cent reveal an uncoated nucleus; 20 per cent have pearls,
but because of their shape are unsaleable Of the remaining 20 per cent,
about 5 per cent have pearls which are excellent and it is with these that
we make our profit.'
With luck, by November (the optimum time for harvesting) the Asanos will
have a rich harvest of soft and velvety gems from the warm sea.
How to get to Ise Shima national park: from Tokyo station take the Hikari
(non-stop) Shinkansen to Nagoya (two hours) and change to the Rintetsu
railway for Toba (90 minutes). In Toba there is the Mikimoto Pearl Island
(admission: Y600) which shows all aspects of pearl cultivation and has
displays by ama - diving women, who used to gather wild oysters from the
seabed, but now dive for edible shellfish and seaweed. Inquire at the Japan
National Tourist Organisation (JNTO) office for a visit to a family-run
farm. Buying pearls: At Mikimoto in Toba (and other specialist stores in
Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, etc) pearls are of the highest quality and there is a
luxury goods sales tax of 15 per cent on jewellery items costing more than
Y30,000. No discounts are offered.
Many other companies beside the big ones and the department stores sell
cultured pearls, and it is possible to get discounts (often amounting to the
equivalent of the sales tax) in the smaller jewellery shops. For the best
buys, locate a shop that is a wholesaler as well as a retailer of pearls.
Prices here can be 50 per cent cheaper than in department stores.
Size, colour, lustre, roundness and whether the pearl is marked or not
determine the value of pearls. Generally speaking, pink pearls are rarer and
more expensive.
If in doubt about the origin of a pearl, rub it across the edge of your
teeth. Real nacre on natural and cultured pearls is gritty; imitation nacre
is smooth.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Potted palms, possibly; luxury liners, never
 -We asked Nicholas Woodsworth, Travel Correspondent, if wealth would change
his travel tastes. His answer / part No and part Yes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH, Travel Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS somewhere between the hour of late afternoon tea and early evening
cocktails. Pen in hand, viennoiseries and a cup of Assam summer flush beside
me, I sit writing in quiet contemplation in the lounge of Amsterdam's Amstel
Inter-Continental Hotel.
Like most of the world's truly luxurious establishments, the Amstel's
extravagances are discreet. Waiters do not hover here, but appear from
nowhere at opportune moments. There is a tinkling piano at the far end of
the glass-roofed lounge, but it tinkles very softly. There are polished
wooden floors, thick carpets, potted palms, gleaming period furniture and
crystal chandeliers. None of it, though, interferes with the room's prime
attraction, its magnificent river-side view of the boats, quays and barge
traffic on the Amstel River.
Upstairs there is more of the same extravagance. Invisible, a butler hangs
about night and day waiting for me to ring my bedside buzzer. My room is
full of rich fabrics, objets d'art, a private bar of cut-glass decanters,
cabinets concealing VCR, CD, fax and sundry other unsightly machines. In the
marbled bathroom there are Hermes toiletries, towels of a size I get lost
in, huge bathtub fittings of ornate and gleaming complexity.
And should I decide to order one of the Amstel's Rolls-Royces or its private
launch for a whirl around town, there is a telephone by the toilet.
This, I am tempted to say in the luxurious idleness of the moment, is what
travel is all about. Why not, if one can afford it, gad about the world
surrounded by crystal and polished wood, well-mannered receptionists and
skilled waiters? Why bother, money being no object, with services that are
anything less than the finest?
But even as I peruse the evening's dinner menu, my eye drawn excitedly
onwards by scallops in truffled ravioli to a bouillabaise of Brittany
lobsters, a calmer, interior voice calls me to order.
This is not travel, it says, so much as mobile self-indulgence, a mere
pandering to the senses in a place other than home. This kind of travel does
not make a vast distinction between one destination and another. What I am
doing in Amsterdam I could equally be doing in any luxury hotel anywhere on
the globe.
Travel is one activity in which the large bank account and the smoking
credit card act as great levellers: the more you spend, the higher the
standard of international service you will receive - and the more the
services in one country will resemble those in another. In its cosmopolitan
refinement the Amstel is similar to the Imperial in Vienna, the Mandarin
Oriental in Hong Kong, or the Taj in Bombay. Even the quays and barges of
the Amstel River cease to be real quays and barges, but become simply an
exotic backdrop to the real business at hand - luxury.
If the aim of travel is to enjoy the great variety of life the world has to
offer, serious wealth can be a serious obstacle. It tends to cut the
traveller off from the world which, in theory, he has set out to explore. I
have no fetish for seediness, gave up back-packing years ago, and
occasionally enjoy the luxury of a top-class hotel. But whether they are of
any interest in themselves or not - and often they are - I find that small,
modest, local hotels allow me a much closer and immediate touch with the
world around.
What applies to hotels applies to other aspects of travel. Ultimately, there
is no correlation between the amount of money you spend on a trip and the
amount of satisfaction you get out of it. What counts in travel, as in most
other endeavours, is not the amount of money you spend, but how you spend
it. The best things in life are not always free, but neither are they always
the most costly.
Often the most expensive restaurants in town are used only by wealthy
tourists, while some of the best local meals and atmosphere are to be found
in places with plastic tablecloths.
Book yourself a holiday in an expensive and isolated beach resort and you
may come home tanned and relaxed, but it will not really have mattered which
country you were in. More isolating still are luxury cruises. The prospect
of sailing into the Caribbean sunset surrounded by high-density wealth and
boredom is dismaying.
Even roughing it can have its problems. Travel over the Kalahari, up the
Amazon or along the Silk Road with a luxury tour company that promises to
pamper you with all the comforts of home in the wilds, and you may well find
the wines excellent and the company convivial. On the other hand, you might
as well have stayed at home.
In some cases, conspicuous wealth can be a positive disadvantage. Walk
around sporting expensive clothing, watches or optical equipment in the
streets of some of the world's poorer countries and you will not only
distance yourself from the majority of people; you may also be setting
yourself up for a mugging or worse. And as tourist killings in various
places have shown, the urban jungles of the developed world are by no means
safer.
But enough carping about luxury travel. Money is, after all, the stuff that
makes travel possible, the only item besides a passport that is essential.
Without it you stay firmly grounded in one place. There are endless travel
projects that simply cannot be realised without lots of money. Scads and
oodles of it.
I may not like the idea of sailing the Caribbean in a luxury cruise liner,
but I would love to sail it on my own with a few friends. We could try
piling into an 8ft inflatable rubber dingy and doing St Lucia, Martinique
and Tobago on the cheap, but frankly I would prefer a 36ft ketch.
Other of my own travel fantasies that require a certain minimum of costly
physical back-up include: the use of a Toyota Landcruiser and the time to
slowly demolish it on the back-roads of Namibia and Botswana; the hire of a
helicopter and pilot for glacier skiing in the Canadian Rockies; a private
expedition to Antarctica so I do not have to join a party of concerned
individuals all wearing red parkas and being lectured to death on green
issues.
Money, though, can also buy travel expertise that is much needed. I would
love to wander into the Karakoram and Pamir mountains of central Asia. I
would also love to wander out again. At times like these a little moneyfor
guides and interpreters might not be amiss.
There are also times when I would like to know just why this Etruscan vase
or that Buddhist stupa is of such significance. Having a cultural or
historical expert's explanation could make all the difference on a trip,
say, to Asia minor or Japan, and there are high-quality tours that cater to
just that kind of need. And just how am I going to navigate that ketch in
the Caribbean? Alpine para-gliding, underwater diving, salt-water kyaking -
in any kind of specialist travel activity, technical instruction is
essential.
There is, in fact, no end to the kinds of ways in which money can improve
travel. It can buy privacy and seclusion in a crowded world. No matter how
alluring they are, I avoid places if there is no escape from tourist hordes.
It can satisfy the interests that travel develops - if I could afford it, I
would fill my house with beautiful carpets and ceramics from around the
world. And it can buy comfort.
I may not be strong on luxury hotels, but travel itself can sometimes be
trying. Given a few hundred thousand in my bank account, I would never
travel anything but first-class.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Life stirs again for the ghost of property
past - London remains in the vanguard but there's plenty elsewhere for the
multi-millionaire with liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN

THE PROPERTY market is returning from the dead and good houses are selling
fast. Within a week of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (KFR) marketing Leckhampstead
House - a handsome Georgian village property well-placed for the M4 near
Newbury, Berkshire - with a guide price of Pounds 625,000, it had gone.
Similarly, the buying service of Lane Fox snapped up Chisenbury Priory, a
Georgian house near Pewsey, Wiltshire, at a price in line with the suggested
Pounds 1.5m. Its client was the first person to view and bidding started at
once.
Last autumn, the market was a ghost. It took time to see that Britain's exit
from the European exchange rate mechanism and its aftermath - a lower pound
and lower interest rates - could be a blessing in disguise. The two groups
to grasp the opportunities first were foreigners buying in London and
British farmers, who have had a windfall gain in the green pounds they
receive under the EC's Common Agricultural Policy.
London is still in the vanguard and expensive houses like 5 Holland Park
(KFR, guide price Pounds 6.75m) are selling, as are flats that buyers from
Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysian acquire as investments. Aylesford reports
that half the flats it has sold this year are in this category, many of them
bought without viewing. And once the price for 11 Yeoman's Row in South
Kensington had been reduced from its November 1992 figure of more than
Pounds 700,000 to around Pounds 695,000, the house went in a few days - for
Pounds 640,000.
The best guide to how the market is turning is the Corporate Estate Agents
index. Based on data from the agents owned by banks, building societies and
insurance companies or quoted on the stock exchange, and equalling about
half the UK agency market, it shows that net sales (excluding those that
fell through) in April were up 26.3 per cent on April 1992, and contracts
exchanged were up 8.3 per cent. Small (4-5 per cent) declines as against
March reveal the impact on business of the Easter holidays.
'Is now the time to buy?' I asked Charles Ellingworth of Property Vision, an
up-market buying agent in west London. 'I am not a seer,' he replied, 'but
the market turned last autumn. There has been a 5 per cent bounce since
then. How far it will go is unclear. My view is that it will move up at the
rate of inflation, which is not much.'
While this is hardly a bullish view, it is probably healthier for being
realistic. A bearish outlook is out of the question. The main problem now is
that too many buyers are chasing too few properties, a lament heard
throughout the UK where agents are desperate for new instructions from
vendors.
'It is a tricky market,' says Ellingworth. 'Discrimination is the name of
the game.' In other words, the quality of the individual property matters
far more in figuring the price than the pundits' generalisations.
WHAT DOES the market have for the multi-millionaire with cash? Leading
candidate as the most expensive house on sale is 9 Tregunter Road, SW10, at
a guide price of Pounds 9m from De Groot Collis and Savills.
The outside of this town house gives little clue to the riches inside.
Property developer Northacre has rebuilt it with no expense spared, linking
it by rooms running under the garden to 10 Cathcart Road to make an urban
mansion with 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms.
The Cathcart Road end functions as the spare rooms and staff quarters. The
heart of the underground section is a 32ft swimming pool lined with columns.
Next door is a billiards room.
Columns and marble are equally important in Quinlan Terry's Gothick Villa in
Regent's Park, which the Crown Estate is selling through Savills and
Lassmans for Pounds 6.5m (Weekend FT, May 15/16).
At a similar price - offers over Pounds 6.5m - is Halkin Gate House off
Belgrave Square, where two town cottages have been transformed into another
urban mansion with basement swimming pool. The rich need exercise. Agents De
Groot Collis can arrange it.
Is there a better address in London than 5 Belgrave Square? This house,
built by Thomas Cubitt, used to be the home of Sir Henry Channon, a
Chicagoan who married Lady Honor Guinness and was for a long time an MP for
Southend. Known as 'Chips,' his published diaries are a splendid, gossipy
guide to the years from 1934 to 1958 when he knew everybody. Aylesford asks
Pounds 3.25m for a 40-year lease, to include a newly renovated mews house.
IN THE country, the honours go to the Pickenham Hall estate in Norfolk
between Norwich and Cambridge, a rare chance to buy a large Edwardian house
with plenty of land (3,627 acres) including a shoot, farmhouses, cottages
and almost all South Pickenham village. KFR offers it at the intriguing
guide price of Pounds 6m-Pounds 10m, demanding all the estate agent's skills
to achieve the right figure for the vendor. For Pounds 4.5m in adjacent
Suffolk, and still unsold despite much publicity last year, is Heveningham
Hall (Weekend FT, May 15/16). Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, the architectural
historian, called it 'the grandest Georgian mansion' in the county. KFR and
Savills are the agents.
Another estate on the KFR books is Great Hundridge Manor in Buckinghamshire,
a Grade II, late-17th century house with a 13th century chapel that is now
the billiard room and a stud with 24 loose boxes. To breed your Derby winner
here costs around Pounds 3.5m.
With an offer over Pounds 3m, Strutt &amp; Parker will sell you Thorncombe Park
estate, placed conveniently near Guildford in Surrey. The house, in which
the vendors have lived for 56 years, started in the 18th century, and comes
with the appropriate panoply of cottages, lakes, parkland and woods.
In the same price range is Grove Farm, a large fruit farm at Harwell in
south Oxfordshire offered by John D. Wood for Pounds 3.7m as a whole, or in
lots. The sale includes 500 acres of orchards, cold storage for 2,200
tonnes, a farm shop, a pick-your-own business, cottages, managers' houses
and an irrigation lake.
Clive and Alison Hartwight - a local family - have built Grove into an
impressive operation specialising in plums, cherries and apples. It has a
turnover of Pounds 2.42m, 20 full-time staff and up to 120 part-time
pickers.
KFR is selling a Victorian Gothic extravaganza near Newbury called
Stargroves - once owned by rock singer Mick Jagger - for around Pounds 2m.
Its grey cement rendering and slate roof remind you of Scotland. For half
the price, KFR also offers author Evelyn Waugh's old house, Piers Court at
Stinchcombe in Gloucestershire. It was a wedding present from his (second)
wife's grandmother in 1937; they moved later to Somerset.
IN SWEDEN, Stikkan Anderson, former manager of the pop group Abba, is
selling the Villa Ekarne on the island of Djurgarden, a Royal National
Reserve Park owned by the King of Sweden near the middle of Stockholm.
The house, from the early 1900s, is of wood on granite foundations and was
designed by Ragnar Ostberg, of Stockholm town hall fame. Included in the
sale is a painting of My Family by Carl Larsson which has hung at the end of
the entrance hall and foot of the stairs since being commissioned by the
first owner.
The agents are Sotheby's with Wrede in Sweden, and the price for a leasehold
(known as an arrende in Swedish) is around SKr20m (Dollars 2.72m).
For the rich who hanker after owning a hotel in warmer climes, there is the
Club Aldiana in Senegal, a Club Med type of operation with 600 beds in
thatched bungalows, superb food and, of course, marvellous beaches. Hotel
broker Michael Pegg is offering it for a much-reduced DM9m (Dollars 5.57m).
Another paradise on Pegg's books is the Royal Sunset Island resort hotel in
Tonga, with 26 four-bedded bungalows in eight acres of tropical gardens. At
Dollars 1.6m, it would be easy for an hotelier to sell up in the UK and move
to the life of the lotus eaters - or for a millionaire to buy the ultimate
venue for house parties.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Tale of the horsetrader who gambled
everything - Michael Thompson-Noel describes how Robert Sangster and Vincent
O'Brien found the key to the bloodstock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN racehorse owner Robert Sangster and trainer Vincent O'Brien first set
eyes on The Minstrel at the Keeneland yearling sales, Kentucky, in July
1975, they were not sure what to make of him.
The Minstrel was a son of the great Canadian sire, Northern Dancer, and that
they liked. And The Minstrel had tremendous self-assurance, and that they
liked. But he was small and chestnut-coloured and also flashy, with four
white stockings and a big white blaze.
In the multi-billion lottery of international horse racing, the colour of a
yearling's coat and the number of white feet he has, let alone his size and
deportment in the auction ring, are not just trifles.
They may be crucial. Millions may be at stake, for there is a feeling among
experts that the chestnut colour in racehorses signifies petulance and
temper, while four white stockings are almost a taboo.
According to a just-published book about Sangster, Horsetrader, by Patrick
Robinson, O'Brien said nothing when The Minstrel was first brought out for
him at the Keeneland barns. 'He stared quietly into the yearling's eye,'
writes Robinson. 'And the little horse stood stock still, staring back.
Vincent smiled at him, pulled his ear gently, ran his hand down the horse's
neck . . . 'He's more than 14.1 hands,' he said. 'But not much. He could
just be big enough, but only just'.'
In the auction ring, Sangster and his syndicate bought The Minstrel for
Dollars 200,000. They thought they had got a bargain because, alone of all
the yearlings O'Brien had studied, it was The Minstrel that had 'spoken' to
him.
On the flight from the US to O'Brien's Ballydoyle training complex in
Ireland, most of the yearlings O'Brien and his clients had purchased that
week were restless and nervous. Some were dark with sweat. But none of this
applied to the robust little chestnut colt that could only just angle his
head over the front of his travelling box to get at his hay-net. There was
no sound from The Minstrel - just a steady munching.
Two years later The Minstrel won the English Derby, hard ridden by Lester
Piggott who thwacked and thwacked him with the whip over the last quarter of
a mile. The Minstrel won by a neck. O'Brien was trembling as the little
champion crossed the line. O'Brien's wife was in tears. Sangster was in
shock.
In the next few weeks The Minstrel won the Irish Derby and then the
mid-summer European middle-distance championship, the King George VI and
Queen Elizabeth Stakes, at Ascot. Following which he was shipped back to the
US, to Maryland, with a price tag of Dollars 9m around his handsome -
chestnut - neck.
The tale of The Minstrel is one among hundreds of stories that help maintain
the momentum of Horsetrader, one of the most riveting books about
international horse racing ever published - impressively well-researched,
exciting and well-written.
More, it takes us inside the mind of a man who inherited substantial wealth
(the Vernons Pools business) and then parlayed those riches into a
horse-owing and breeding empire. Usually an intensely private man, Sangster
has never before allowed his fantasies and motivations, as well as the
mechanics of his assault on the racing world, to come under such scrutiny.
One of the key players in the syndicate that Sangster formed with O'Brien
was the great Irish bloodstock expert John Magnier, who in 1974 spelled out
a winning strategy to take on the world of thoroughbred breeding by the neck
and shake loose the key of gold.
Sangster and Magnier were at Goodwood, enjoying a quiet drink after watching
a tough US-bred colt by Vaguely Noble named Ace of Aces, owned by the Dallas
billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt, humble the best milers in England to win the
Sussex Stakes.
''Look at that,' said Magnier. 'You could have bought him as a yearling for
Dollars 30,000. Now he'll probably be syndicated for upwards of Dollars 2m
to go back to Kentucky. I'm wondering if that might not be the answer: to
raid the sales in the US for yearlings, which cost one-twentieth of the
price of stallions, and hope to get it right once every four or five times.
That way we'd own the stallions before they retired - and no one could get
them away from us.'
Specifically, they tried to corner the market in the offspring of Northern
Dancer - a shrewd ploy and one that brought them many triumphs. In the years
that followed, Sangster, O'Brien, Magnier and their rich friends raided the
US yearling sales. The value of the bloodstock that has passed through
Sangster's hands from the mid-1970s to the present undoubtedly exceeds
Dollars 1bn.
But the good times could not last. In the early 1980s various oil-rich Arab
owners, especially the Maktoum family of Dubai, moved into the market. Their
money spouted from the ground. As a result, they made life extremely
difficult for mere multi-millionaires like Sangster and his partners.
To complicate things further, in the late 1980s the racehorse market nosed
into decline - yearling and stallion values collapsed, owners withdrew,
breeding studs went bust.
But Sangster is still in business, these days as a commercial horsebreeder.
In 1992 he enjoyed heartfelt success with the classic-winning Rodrigo de
Triano, which he eventually sold for Dollars 6.2m cash to the Japanese in
the absence of a comparable offer from the UK.
'As I have always stressed,' said Sangster, 'the strength of a big
investment in thoroughbred horses is its global appeal. There's always
someone, somewhere, who will have the money for a classic stallion prospect.
I am a horsetrader, and right now I'm very happy with my situation.'
According to Patrick Robinson, Sangster's racing forays were based, back in
the 1970s, on a start-up investment of about Pounds 2m. At the height of the
market boom in 1984 and 1985, Sangster's bloodstock interests were probably
worth approaching Dollars 350m worldwide.
'There were bank loans to be serviced, of course,' writes Robinson, 'but
these were settled upon the sale of Vernons Pools. Even as the market
crashed further, in the 1990s, his accountants assiduously calculated the
value of Robert's international bloodstock empire, and on the day Rodrigo de
Triano wrapped up the British season the figure stood at a conservative
Dollars 157m - a quite remarkable total given the world bloodstock recession
and the wildly fluctuating values of breeding stallions.'
Last season, Sangster banked close to Pounds 1.5 in prizemoney, which paid
for the bulk of his racing and training expenses. And he sold Dollars 20m
worth of yearlings. At least 50 yearlings he had bred were on their way to
his own training complex in England. And in Ireland, the mares he owns were
preparing to produce almost 100 foals.
Occasionally, says Robinson, Sangster, O'Brien and Magnier still get
together in Ireland. They can be seen at the top of the Ballydoyle gallops,
watching the horses work.
'Their talk always seems a bit conspiratorial, their laughter private to
themselves, a certain remoteness suggesting they have much to say, but only
to each other. It is perhaps the type of close camaraderie which settles
only upon men who have fought many battles together. Somehow these three
diverse personalities had made the lunatic world of the thoroughbred
racehorse actually work, profitably and with dazzling success. At times they
had gambled everything . . .'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Packer and his assassins - In the
free-spending world of top-level polo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLO MUST have considerable magic if it can make Kerry Packer an Englishman.
The Australian media tycoon is a fanatical player and the biggest spender in
the British game. His two teams, Ellerston White and Ellerston Black, based
in the West Sussex village of Stedham, probably will cost him more than
Pounds 2m to run this season.
A goodish chunk will go to his South American professionals, Gonzalo Piere
and Adolfo Cambiaso. These 'hired assassins,' as the top players are known
in the game, command six-figure fees for three months' work. They will play
with Packer and young Briton Tarquin Southwell; yet, the rules of the
venerable Hurlingham Polo Association, the sport's governing body, say that
50 per cent of the team (two players) must be British.
'Every patron is deemed an honorary Englishman for the duration of the
season,' says HPA secretary Buff Crisp, explaining how Packer changes
nationality each May. Indeed, while the green meadows of southern England
stage the world's best polo each summer, few of the players or backers in
its high-goal format (the sport's equivalent of motor racing's Formula One)
are British.
Almost every 10-goal player (the best possible handicap) in the world will
be playing for one or other of the 14 teams entered in the top division, a
phenomenon that could be a tribute to the British administration. 'Why do
they come here and spend - or earn - God knows how many millions of pounds?'
asks Crisp. 'We're good at organising tournaments and the games will be
totally fair.'
Professional umpires will be used for the first time this season but Crisp
says it is difficult to acquire completely impartial umpires since, unlike
other sports such as rugby or soccer, there is virtually no pool of players
sidelined by age to draw upon. 'Retired polo players simply don't exist.
They either go broke or die.'
Since Prince Charles has done neither, why all the headlines about him
'quitting' the sport? In fact, he has simply withdrawn from the high-goal
game and will continue to play at a more modest recreational level with a
team called the Maple Leafs. The other notable retirement has been England
captain Julian Hipwood who, on a handicap of seven, had been the country's
top player since the mid-1970s.
Hipwood, 46 and a polo professional all his life, is unashamedly nostalgic
for a past with more fun and fewer hired guns flying in. 'People like Kerry
Packer don't have a budget,' he says. 'He wants to win the Gold Cup so badly
he will simply spend what it takes. In the old days, out of a season's cost
of Pounds 100,000, the patron would spend Pounds 10,000 on players and
ponies and the rest on having a good time. Not any more, I'm afraid.'
Don't such owners - businessmen, not athletes - risk looking silly playing
alongside professionals? After all, a tycoon might buy a football club but
he would not play at centre-forward. 'You do find one or two people
sniggering, but on the whole the patrons do very well,' says Hipwood.
Where he does find a tension is between the imports and the struggling
British journeyman. 'They fly in with hat and stick and get Packer's best
pony put underneath them, while the English pro is out there grooming and
slaving away. We're friends on the field but, underneath, there's an
uneasiness about them coming in and taking our jobs.'
This, of course, is simply the part of polo beloved of the glossy magazines
and Jilly Cooper novels. At the grass roots the game is thriving and
growing, without any recourse to plane tickets to Buenos Aires or Australian
millionaires.
'Seventy-five per cent of our members have a handicap of one or below
(equivalent, roughly, to a 15 golf handicap). That's where the strength is
in this country,' says Crisp. 'Over 100 pony clubs now have polo teams.'
So, why are the top players called Carlos rather than Charles? 'We've got
more concrete than pampas in this country and our season is only a quarter
of the year,' Crisp explains. 'Maybe it's also temperament.'
Even if the chances of being put on the Packer payroll range between slim
and zero, the number of people rolling up to learn polo at Anthea Hartley's
Chiltern polo centre, an hour north-west of London, is soaring. Why? 'It's
very difficult for Joe Bloggs to have a go at polo without making a major
financial commitment,' she says. 'It's also like learning to play in a
goldfish bowl if you go to a club. Everybody's watching you and you're bound
to feel inadequate. Unlike tennis, you can't go out and practise in
private.'
Her clients range from property men to policemen who pay Pounds 30 for a
two-hour evening session, plus Pounds 25 to hire a pony. They start by
poring over a table-top pitch with plastic players and horses to learn rules
and tactics. 'They want to jump straight on a horse and hit the ball but it
can be dangerous and you need briefing,' says Hartley. 'A lot of girls come.
Women tend to be enthusiastic and do it as a fun thing. The men are often
dedicated towards becoming serious players.'
Since she does not play herself, I (wrongly) imagined Anthea as the wife of
a polo fanatic. 'Actually, we don't mention the P-word in front of my
husband,' she confides. 'He's a rugby man, but very tolerant of all these
horses.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Studying the Ascot form - Avril Groom says
watch the legs in the Royal Enclosure this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT EVERYBODY who attends the events of the English social season is
super-rich, and not all the seriously rich do the season. But those who are
prepared to stand up and be counted at the summer's high-profile events are
intensely interested in fashion and the way they look.
At Royal Ascot, still the glossiest daytime occasion in the social calendar,
you need confidence to run the gamut of paparazzi, scribbling gossip
columnists and curious sightseers who clog the entry to the royal enclosure.
Techniques vary, from those who stride out, glancing neither to left nor
right in anonymous, tasteful clothes, to the publicity-seeker ambling by in
an outrageous hat. But all are on display, and for many Ascot is more about
seeing and being seen than about horses.
Royal Ascot is so hyped that many serious racing folk stay home and watch on
TV. The seriously rich who do go dress appropriately and smartly. They may
not have bought a new outfit for five years. They go to traditional couture
houses such as Hardy Amies, or their own dressmaker, or a shop in the
country.
For men one bespoke morning suit can be a lifetime's investment. But for
women, more subject to fashion's changes, the season is the perfect excuse
for new outfits, though not all high-profile women can be seen to spend, in
spite of the Princess of Wales's recent spree in Paris.
Even in 1993, however, there are seriously rich women who do not mind
looking the part. They are invariably beautiful and manage to look feminine
and slightly sexy while staying just within the bounds of good fashion
taste.
The assorted wives of Robert Sangster, for example, would not dream of doing
Ascot in last year's frocks. What they would dream of is a short silk
outfit, striking enough to stand out, perhaps softened with a ruffle.
But fashion is changing to the long soft style, which can be dangerously
casual. What women like the Sangster wives wear will be a talking point of
the season. Will they cover those trophy legs? Will they abandon gilt
buttons and big trims for the new plainness. Or will they sail blithely on
in the short, sharp outfits that have made the past few years so smart?
Soundings indicate that this season is unlikely to break records for
smartness. There is a rather negative mood and a feeling that fashion is in
transition. The new look is almost too trendy as yet. This year many women
will probably stick with safe favourites.
Among a crowd more in tune with their husbands' pockets than avant garde
fashion there is resistance to the longer length. A visit to Chanel revealed
a flurry of women having their slim, calf-length skirts raised to just on
the knee. Bruce Oldfield, an Ascot set darling, says he has sold a few
tailored jackets with long, soft skirts, 'but far more short coat and dress
or jacket and dress sets. The difference from last year is that people are
buying more of them.'
But the soft look is having an influence, if not on length. Glitz is buried,
with those big gilt buttons replaced by soft ties and bows, a near-absence
of trims and gentle, narrow shoulder lines on even the most tailored jacket.
Seriously rich fashion fanatics can score points by getting the soft look
just right. Absolute winners are Chloe's softly fluted suits and Donna
Karan's monochrome ruffled chiffons.
The new long look needs a fresh approach to accessories and make-up.
Plainness gives space for the big, decorative hat. Graham Smith says big
brims are back, and manages to put a soft curviness into those of even his
most structured styles.
The hard-edged leather bag and bright red lips are redundant, while make-up
should involve low-key colours like slates and peaches.
'Wearing layers with a soft skirt, split to show the leg, is a sophisticated
version of the new Bohemian look, but it takes some confidence,' says Joan
Burstein, of Browns. Good compromises come from Amanda Wakeley, who does
pure and simple long shapes in the best of fabrics, and from Laura B, whose
soft, floppy, subtle jackets have 'the right plain necklines for showing off
good jewellery' and do not loudly proclaim particular designer origins. They
go with flattering curvy sarongs or light georgette pleated skirts: both
long, though Laura has had to do a lot of shortening.
This, then, is the style designers feel the seriously rich should wear to
Ascot. Whether they will is another matter, for taste and fashion sense were
never the exclusive preserve of the wealthy.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Ever widening social circles - From Henley
to Cowes, Brenda Polan considers how high society's season survives in a
chilly climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN

<TEXT>
ACCORDING to The Tatler, a British society magazine, the first event of the
social season is the Grand National steeplechase. But after this year's
debacle, the omens for the 1993 calendar of race meetings, regattas, flower
festivals, balls and chilly picnics did not, at the start of April, look
good. Yet, succeeding events have gone as planned, affected only by some
poor weather, a slight decline in numbers - and a willingness by the women
to wear last year's frock.
Too many, perhaps. In the past fortnight, two of London's foremost suppliers
of clothes to the smart set have put up the shutters. First to go was
couturier Victor Edelstein, maker of beautiful ball gowns and cocktail
dresses; he declared that, because his market had shrunk so much, he would
soon be unable to pay his workroom staff.
Courtauld, the textiles manufacturer, withdrew financing for Arabella
Pollen's own-label collection. Pollen is the darling of the younger, leggier
sort of racegoer. The company still wants her as a consultant but feels
there is, at present, no profit in the kind of clothes British society women
wear. Other British couturiers are rumoured to be under pressure as their
customers bow to a new mood of sobriety.
'People,' says Ewa Lewis - meaning right-thinking, sensitive, sensible,
affluent-to-rich people - 'do not want to be seen to be spending. There is a
certain guilt about enjoying oneself when so many people, from the miners to
one's friends who have been hit by (the) Lloyd's (underwriting disaster),
are suffering the effects of the recession.'
Lewis should know. She is the social editor of The Tatler. Last year she
described the crowd at the Royal Ascot race meeting as low-key, anonymous
and battle-dressed. 'Everyone,' she summed up, 'looked as though they
shouldn't be there.'
Furtive might be the word she refrained from using. After all, drinking
champagne, eating lobster and making large bets while the economy crumbles
is not so different from fiddling while Rome smoulders.
But although the mood of some taking part in the season might be subdued,
the onlookers have never been so entranced. The media's romance with what it
deems the upper classes grows ever more passionate. Page after page of most
tabloid newspapers - and several soi-disant 'qualities' - is filled with the
marital entanglements, misdemeanours, commercial enterprises and sartorial
preferences of the titled.
The rich and famous were always with us. The phenomenon of the impoverished,
obscure and obscurely-titled as objects of curiosity, envy and even
adulation is a late-1980s' development which, far from fading in the
commonsense 1990s, seems to be gathering pace.
Thus Eve Pollard, editor of the Sunday Express, squeals with delight when,
in her role as the BBC's fashion commentator at Royal Ascot, she manages to
identify a frock-wearer with a title; for Pollard, titles have a
miraculously beautifying effect on the ugliest of frocks. Thus the
once-august Sunday Times devotes resources (which might, on other
newspapers, fund whole features departments) to in-depth analyses of the
sins and solecisms of an archaic elite which would far rather (except when
it has a country hotel to promote) be left alone.
Nor is it simply a matter of bread and media circuses; nor even, for the
deferential British, a matter of deriving comfort from the orderliness of an
enduring social hierarchy. It is a cocktail of aspiration, ambition and
envy.
Many may read, watch and dream; some try to gain entry. New millionaires can
buy their way in; beautiful or clever women have done it via marriage.
Provided a newcomer is prepared to learn the unwritten, unspoken rules and
abide by them, there has always been room. Today, says Lewis, there is more
room. Society is readier to embrace the outsider than ever before.
Gone is the day when a grandee of the old guard could insist that cabinet
minister Michael Heseltine could not be called a gentleman since he had
needed to buy his own furniture. In the 1990s, the regulators of society -
the people who send the invitations, issue the badges and allot the seats -
are more likely to judge by worth than bloodline. 'Nouveau riche,' says
Lewis, 'is a phrase that is fading from currency. In fact, only an outsider
would use it.'
The revival of the debutante phenomenon is an illuminating example of a
class's survival mechanisms at work. On one level, it is a revival of an old
practice: that of the indigent but aristocratic selling their services as
sponsors of the rich but proletarian. (You could not be presented at court
without a sponsor who belonged there already). On another level, it brings
marriageable young women of means into the cash-strapped social circle.
Presentation at court is not bought so easily these days (although to be
launched on the season is an effective substitute). Today, the monarch and
her family take part in the season only so far as their personal preferences
dictate - mainly, if there are horses (or dear friends) involved.
The nature of most events changed so radically in the 1980s that many of the
old guard felt elbowed out of places and occasions which, as familiar to
them as nanny's knee, had suddenly become strange. The two new factors at
work were charity and commercialism. There was a sense, even in the 1980s,
that hedonism could not be its own reward; conscience should take a cut,
too. So, for every event there was a charity committee, a raffle and a
justifying cheque.
Simultaneously, businesses realised that their names could borrow cachet
from association with upper-class pursuits and that clients could be
thrilled and impressed by a day at Windsor Great Park, Goodwood, Cowes or
Henley. Those who took their clients to Wimbledon did not get it quite
right.
But even when the event is right and the sponsor has a monopoly, the result,
says Lewis, is a distortion. 'The Cartier International polo match is
corporate entertainment with a capital C; regardless of the fact that many
of the old polo brigade will actually be lunching not in the chic Cartier
tent but in the rather grotty and unglamorous HPA (Hurlingham Polo
Association) tent.'
Long before the recession zapped entertainment budgets, the gloss was fading
from the concept as over-wooed clients became jaded and cynical about the
extent to which they were a part of the proceedings rather than its subsidy.
But questions as to whether the season can survive its loss of sponsorship
and the personal losses of its participants do not arise.
The season is entrenched as a way of life and the means, marriage-wise, to
secure the future of a resilient class. It is the coveted goal of the most
energetic and resourceful of outsiders - and a splendid spectacle for
everyone else.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Tradition gives way to the age of the nerd -
Tycoons once dressed to fit their image, says Brenda Polan. But things are
changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHISPER IT low in Jermyn Street and Savile Row but we are entering the age
of the nerd. As those long-promised green shoots of economic growth finally
peep through, it is becoming clear that the new wealth-makers will be
pallid, round-shouldered, and wear huggy jumpers and anoraks.
According to several surveys, it is the computer whizzes, the developers of
ware both hard and soft, who are leading the independent sector out of
economic stagnation and decline. Tomorrow's tycoons are the lads in
wire-framed glasses to whom a keyboard is as familiar as a dashboard and a
mouse as necessary as a gear stick.
Once, getting (and holding) great wealth demanded a military bent. Later, it
demanded the technical inventiveness and organisational skills of the
manufacturer. More recently, it called for an understanding of money as a
commodity in its own right - the iron nerve of the risk-taker and
asset-stripper, the political cunning and ruthless manipulativeness of the
media mogul, or an instinctual identification with the yearnings of the mass
market.
By and large, each generation of new rich has expressed its origins in its
style. The self-made earl or the ennobled and empalaced general (whether
Percy, Churchill or Wellesley) did not (as Northumberland, Marlborough or
Wellington) become any less dashingly military in manner or dress. The
Victorian industrialist dressed himself to match his blackened smokestacks
and his sober self-importance.
According to the costume historian's tongue-in-cheek explanation, toilers in
the City of London espoused the pin stripe at the end of the last century
because its splendid orderliness and comforting colour scheme reminded them
of the columns in their ledgers.
Most of this century's newly rich, however humble their origins or
unorthodox their rise, have made haste to conform. They may well, as did
Lords Hanson and White when they were misters on the make, cut a swathe
through the female population of Hollywood clad in slightly raffish versions
of the pinstripe double-breasted suit, but it was undeniably just that.
Their contemporaries acquired a Savile Row tailor just as fast. Even the
international operators - the antipodeans, colonials, foreigners and
expatriates such as Garfield Weston, Rupert Murdoch, Sir James Goldsmith,
Kerry Packer, Mohamed Fayed, the Barclay twins, Conrad Black and George
Soros - slip into that Square Mile uniform when they need to concentrate or
borrow.
The change began with the post-war, baby-boom tycoons whose wealth was based
on servicing the needs, desires and fashion fads of their own large,
affluent and greedy generation: men like Richard Branson, Chris Blackwell,
Alan Sugar, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Christopher Moran, Andrew Cohen, David
Sullivan, John Madejski, Peter Waterman, Michael Green, Brian Reynolds,
Cameron Mackintosh and Lawrie Lewis.
These, if they can be coerced out of jeans and a loud sweater, tend to
prefer the off-the-peg suit in lighter fabrics and paler shades, usually
with an Italian label and wide trouser legs. They are partial to flamboyant
waistcoats. They sometimes wear grey shoes. Ties bother them, as do razors.
In their hearts, they appear to yearn for the in-your-face freedom of their
contemporaries, the pop-star tycoons like Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Dave
Stewart and Elton John. What, they seem to ask, is the use of being rich if
you cannot be scruffy? What is the point of being a 1960s' person if you
give in to the wrinklies?
Those who do give in have a tendency to add a maverick element. Andreas
Whittam-Smith, editor and co-founder of The Independent newspaper, appears
to have a passion for a certain satin-finish tie in shades of pastel pink
and baby blue. This clashes horribly with his complexion, but he wears it
with a pale grey suit or dark pinstripe every time his picture is taken.
Sugar, wealthy founder of the Amstrad electronics empire, is rather like an
ageing beauty who will not relinquish the fashions of youth and appears
reluctant to discard his late-1970s' pink shirts with white button-down
collar.
The female tycoons, and there are a few, have had to write their own dress
code. They had a little help from an American called John Molloy who, in the
early 1980s, wrote a guide for ambitious women called Dress For Success.
This took the male power-and-authority uniform and, basically, substituted a
knee-length skirt, flesh-coloured tights and medium-heeled court shoes for
trousers, dark socks and black shoes.
Molloy also recommended an early Thatcher-style pussy-cat bow instead of an
old school tie. Fashion reshaped the basic formula, but only a little.
Simone Mirman of Sock Shop and countless ambitious brokers, bankers, estate
agents and niche retailers played the game; Anita Roddick of Body Shop and
Debbie Moore of Pineapple did not, creating their own relaxed styles of
dress more in keeping with their business philosophies.
The latest crop of men and women to watch - the under-40s who are energetic
and driven enough to form a recovery vanguard - are, for the most part, a
conventionally tidy-looking lot, their hand-out photographs revealing clear
eyes, straight ties and cheap haircuts.
Not all of them are unredeemably nerdish. Shami Ahmed of Joe Bloggs Jeans;
Tim Hely Hutchinson of Headline Publishing; Archie Norman of Asda; Neil
MacKinnon of Citibank; Julian Richer of Richer Sounds; Pippa Wicks of
Courtaulds; Kathleen O'Donovan of BTR; Nicola Horlick of Morgan Grenfell;
Robert Hanson and Tim Vestey, both of the family firms  - all tend towards
relaxed informality or, at least, a loosened-up version of the conventional
uniform.
But the boys who cannot fail, surely, are the keyboard kings in the Brains
specs, the unpressed chinos and the machine-washed jumpers. Whether wealth
will ever seduce them into expensive clothes and a good barber is doubtful.
Economic recovery might be in sight but many things have changed
irrevocably: the cultural dominance of bankers within the business world,
and the idea that they must be propitiated by adoption of their uniform, are
just two of them.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Wealth that's simply gross - Truth of the
Matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MONEY IS THE root of all evil.' Wrong. What Paul wrote was: 'The love of
money is the root of all evil.'
ARISTOTLE had said much the same three centuries before. The Christian
church has had its ecclesiastical knickers in a twist on the subject for
centuries since.
Only in the past 50 years have Christian academics taken up economics and
attempted to bring some intellectual and moral order to the hubbub. And it
is only in the past decade that anyone has had the effrontery to take Adam
Smith at his word and proclaim from the rooftops that greed is a social
virtue as the only plausible engine for economic growth.
Odd, isn't it, that only the well-to-do really like this argument? Recently,
I sat next to the assistant editor of a national newspaper who was preaching
fervently this gospel of the higher selfishness. I found myself a lone voice
pleading for the outworn shibboleths of Christian ethics. 'Positively
Gothic]' murmured one recent and portly convert to the economic
enlightenment. Well, as custodian of the finest Gothic cathedral in the
land, I might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.
There are two levels of moral discourse about wealth: social and personal.
Wealth, in the sense of resources for living a full life, must be good.
Wealth creation is a good thing. An impoverished society deprives its
members of the resources to fulfil their potential. They grow up physically,
intellectually and spiritually stunted.
But all societies exist in a wider social context. Wealthy communities live
in or alongside poor ones. Sometimes, the contrast is grotesque. Do the
former have any moral responsibility for the latter? My journalist neighbour
denied it. The economic machine is driven by the visible threat of poverty
as much as by the lure of wealth. Some trickle-down might occur fortuitously
(huh]) but no welfare programmes, please. Leave that to the do-gooders. And
the same goes for international affairs. Let the market do its own thing.
The hidden hand will work for the optimum benefit for the maximum number of
people. Hard cheese for the poor. Or no cheese. I passed him the Stilton.
I find in myself a deep moral revulsion against that view. Of course,
concern for the poor - native human compassion - is not confined to the
Judaeo-Christian tradition. In Rabbinic law, bystanders are guilty if they
do not intervene to prevent an injustice. It is a central religious issue.
The rich have a moral obligation to the poor equivalent to the moral
responsibility of parents for their own children. It is not just
philanthropy, an optional extra for really nice guys. It is part of the core
curriculum.
Wealth, serious wealth - no, let us call it by its name, gross wealth - in
the hands of a few individuals or a small class distorts the fabric of
society. It gives huge, unfettered and often invisible power to people -
such as Robert Maxwell - who are not accountable to anyone. It subverts the
democratic process and is often above the law.
The existence of gross affluence and abject poverty in the same community is
outrageous morally and a symptom of a profound social malaise which affects
the relationships of almost everyone. It destabilises the community and
instigates violence.
If I am at the beck and call of an acquisitive instinct - greed - I cannot
at the same time respond to a generous urge which would rather see someone
else profit than myself; or to that warm-heartedness which is interested
genuinely in people as people, rather than what they are.
In my experience the very wealthy often endure a kind of loneliness which is
crowded but cold. Nevertheless, it seems that unequal degrees of wealth and
a keen ambition to acquire it are now an inescapable pre-condition of
economic growth.
Even moderate wealth seems often to produce a coarsening of moral
sensibility. As a parish priest, I have had access to the personal lives of
some of the most impoverished of our fellow citizens, and have dined at the
tables of some of the richest. Among the latter, I often feel in myself a
kind of generalised moral unease. Kindly, witty and urbane, they are
insulated from the pain and vulnerability of the bulk of humanity.
They evince a moral numbness. The wealthy, particularly, cannot bear very
much human reality. It questions the moral foundation of their personal
lives. It is much more comfortable to turn greed into a virtue.
I was so challenged by a visitor from the Sudan who was offered supper by
his hostess, having previously been entertained to a substantial lunch. He
shook his head in surprise. 'Oh, no, thank you. You see, we only eat every
other day.' A vigorous, good and happy man.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: How to keep your fortune - Peter Knight has
some tips on warding off villains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWOP THE Patek Philippe for a Swatch, trade in the Rolls for a Mondeo (no
personal number-plates allowed), go ex-directory, jettison your British
Airways Executive Club gold card and become irregular in your habits. Above
all, try hard to be dull.
Being dull is the safest and cheapest way for the super-rich to stay alive
and keep their families and fortunes intact. Conforming to common-sense
rules reduces the risks posed by those who have plunder on their minds.
'Criminals are like jays. They are attracted to things that are bright,'
says Simon Adamsdale, a director of security experts Control Risks. 'To
reduce the risk you have to keep a low profile because that is a denial of
information to the criminal.'
Staying safe is all about managing risk, which is mostly about the control
of information. Robbers, kidnappers and other horrible people want to know
as much as possible about their target, to reduce the risk of being caught.
Denying villains this information will make their task more difficult and
could encourage them to look elsewhere.
'The whole principle is to avoid a situation in which you are threatened.
Once you are surrounded by armed people or very fit young men, for example,
you have little chance of escape. The key is to stay alert and avoid the
situation if possible,' says Adamsdale.
To stay out of trouble, Control Risks recommends adopting five common-sense
principles:
Be aware of the risks. Learn how to detect suspicious signs. Find out, for
example, where the dangers lie when travelling abroad. Know when it is wise
to cross to the other side of the street rather than risk being confronted
by a suspicious character.
Maintain a low profile. Keep out of the society pages, go ex-directory, get
an ordinary-looking car, live in a modest house.
Be erratic. Make sure that your routine does not become too predictable  -
make it difficult for the jays to swoop.
Equip yourself with good communications that enable you to call for help in
an emergency.
Create layers of protection. Make sure your home, for example, is protected
with more than a picket fence and a chihuahua (install alarms, rottweilers,
lights, locks and a safe room at the core of the house with good
communications).
Gadgets found in the security shops - anything from night sights to
debugging devices - are a waste of money unless they are part of an overall
security plan. Learning about the risks and how to reduce them, and
developing such a plan, is simple and, compared with the cost of top
accountants, cheap.
Security consultants - there are many in the telephone book - will offer
help. Choosing the right consultant is rather difficult because there is no
guide to recommend best buys, so check with a super-rich friend or
high-level executive in the oil business (a risky occupation) to see who
they use.
Locate your adviser and start with a short consultation. Fees vary according
to the circumstances, but think in terms of a few hours, which will be
charged at a half-day rate. Control Risks, for example, charges Pounds 375
for one consultant to talk to a group. A two-hour consultation with you
alone costs about the same. For a high-risk person, Control Risks recommends
a two-day assessment and basic training.
An experienced - probably former police or former armed services -
consultant will analyse your security position, advise on what sort of
protection you need and then teach you or your chauffeur how to drive in
difficult situations (kidnap, ambush, attack). You will emerge a lot wiser
about the sort of risks you face and how these can be reduced.
Much of the advice will be common-sense, but it will help more than a pistol
under the pillow. You will also get a report and recommendations on the next
steps. Price for the assessment: Pounds 1,500.
Control Risks acts as a one-stop service and will supply bodyguards (budget
for around Pounds 300 a day, depending on experience and the job) and the
necessary technology (anything from alarms to bullet-proof cars) you might
need to keep hold of your life and riches.
It is information and not gadgets, firepower or brawn that is key to keeping
out of trouble. Business travellers are most at risk, especially when they
visit countries where kidnapping is a national past time. Taking the family
on holiday to some areas of the world can also expose the super-rich to
super-risks.
Calling the Foreign Office in London is one way of finding out what dangers
lurk abroad, but this is certainly not foolproof.
Control Risks has an online database that gives information on security
issues in over 70 countries, as well as its own analysts and correspondents
who supply information and intelligence. The service is not necessarily
foolproof, either, but it is independent.
For the super-rich to be super-safe, the most important thing is to adopt
the right attitude - to tone down the glow of wealth. This can be difficult:
many of the very wealthy have spent their lives clawing their way free of
the dullness of being ordinary. They do not want to be ordinary again.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Where have all the playboys gone? - Dear
Giovanni or Alphonso, please call me soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAMILLA SALMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WAS when a girl could have fun. But take this sad tale from my diary of
early this week. The scene: an intimate table at a smart Chelsea restaurant.
The characters: one footloose brunette (me) and one renowned playboy (my
date).
Enter the opposition. 'Darling, how lovely to see you,' trills a bronzed
blonde, draping her limbs over Freddie. 'How come you never call me these
days? We must meet up.' Freddie smiles weakly. I scowl.
It never used to be like this. You had Freddie for the evening. He lived
only for you. Now, a sighting of this dreamy dish is as rare as caviar on a
City bagel. And everyone wants a bite.
They are welcome to it. He is droning on about the exams he is taking, the
diet he is on and, worse, his latest girlfriend, in whose honour he is
considering hanging up his prophylactic. (She is seriously rich). Each diary
page reads the same. Freddie, Charlie, Hugo, James and Johnnie are otherwise
engaged. Are playboys growing up, or what?
I turn to my old friend Hannah - a Punjabi princess whose vowels make an
Etonian sound like a taxi driver - for advice. She used to date 'Bungalow'
Bill Wiggins, Joan Collins' walker, and has been wooed by cricketer Imran
Khan as well as by the Duchess of York's duo, Steve Wyatt and John Bryant.
Hannah should know.
'If you are really that desperate, the only place you will find one nowadays
is an escort agency,' Hannah tells me. But even Sabre and Bearskin, a new
company of former guards officers which specialises in supplying companions
for women in need, does not answer its telephone to me.
Five years ago, you could not go to nightclubs like Annabels or Tramp
without tripping over a playboy waving a deck of gold cards and offering a
dream of an evening. 'They would take you to some nice restaurant,' says
Hannah. 'Nowhere particularly expensive, as they knew the food would be
wasted on you because either you were dieting or too in love to eat.' Today,
all you find is Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil, Italians, aged businessmen
muttering about the Pounds 200 bill, and wealthy tourists.
What has gone wrong? Where are the playboys?
Hannah again: 'It is no longer fashionable to be flashy and the recession
has forced many to marry. Besides, to be a playboy you need a plaything, and
so many girls are now going off and getting proper jobs that they can no
longer say 'Yes, I'll come to Monte Carlo with you' at the drop of a hat.
Look at Serena Stanhope, Viscount Linley's fiancee. She is still going to
carry on working at Armani even though she clearly does not need to.'
The 1980s bred playboys as fast as the 1990s have killed off estate agents.
Rupert Deen was a case in point. He inherited a shipping fortune and lived
for the sporting and social seasons. His butler wore leather jackets, and he
had girls posted to his house in the country by chauffeur-driven car.
Rupert was last sighted shopping forlornly for sausages in Safeways. His
only hope is to find a rich woman and marry her. Loyal friends are reputed
to have clubbed together to finance a Pounds 20,000 bet to encourage him.
Those who are still in pocket have a more sober lifestyle. They have become
serious about money, fret if they miss an appointment at the gym and are
horribly likely to choose water when buying you an aperitif. Casinos are
visited once a week and nightclubs once a fortnight.
One socialite tells me: 'If I told you the names of any of the young
playboys on the scene, they would mean nothing to you. They are all
foreigners, and unexciting ones at that - the odd Swiss banker, a French art
dealer. It is much more amusing to listen to retired playboys. They may wear
toupees and be draped with an anaconda, but at least they tell stories of
the real high life.'
As for me, I have scratched all the Anglo-Saxon boys from my list. Giovanni,
Massimo and Alphonso - I am painting my nails and waiting for you to call.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Neat and discreet - Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE vibrating barber's chair was tilted back, the obviously wealthy
executive snored gently.
The self-consciously elite barber, near the Imperial Hotel in central Tokyo,
does not bother to post his prices on a board. It is a system much like that
of the better class of Japanese bar.
Mama-san decides when you walk in how much you will pay. On the way out, the
price is ornately scribbled on a slip of paper. Depending on the amount, it
is either an invitation to return or an expensive warning that this classy
establishment is not for the likes of you.
Riches are meant to be enjoyed discreetly in Japan. It is the gangster who
buys a large white Cadillac with tinted back windows and it is the upstart
property developer who boasts an over-powered speed boat.
The truly rich person prefers to indulge behind the drawn screens of a
ryotei, where the watered-down whiskies come in monogrammed glasses and the
services rendered are less important than the promise of prestige.
Feeling rich, and doing it with dignity, is more important in Japan that
possessing a pile of large denomination notes.
The yen of the seemingly wealthy is often that of the expense account;
collateralised assets are sometimes no more than a small patch of
undeveloped dirt in a strategic Toyko location.
Land buys money in Japan. Taikichiro Mori, the recently deceased tycoon who
headed Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest business people, was
the wealthiest of all because he had the most land.
Mori, worth an estimated Dollars 13bn, owned 82 buildings through his
private company, Mori Building, which remade a district in central Tokyo.
Mori and the like-minded founders of Honda Motor and Matsushita Electric
combined an apparent disdain for riches with a remarkable ability to create
and accumulate wealth.
Given that their wealth was made during the decades of post-war
reconstruction, it is not surprising that this generation, which prided
itself on 'making things,' should be aghast at the instant wealth frothed-up
during the bubble years of the late 1980s, when stock prices seemingly
defied gravity.
In his memoirs, a conscious-stricken Mori told of early discomfort at
receiving rental and interest payments: 'I became sceptical about receiving
unearned income from the renting business.'
That was not the case with Yasumichi Morishita, a financier and stock
speculator, famed for his purchases of Impressionist art during the bubble
era, when Japanese imports of art topped Y15bn (Pounds 88.23m) a year. In
the years since, art imports have fallen 80 per cent and Morishita's small
network of companies has gone bust.
Not only the shady Morishita liked the idea of sophistication. Men and women
of lesser means bought golf club memberships during the late 1980s in the
hope of feeling rich, and with an eye to reselling the certificates at a
profit. But clubs which promised the most prestige have brought the greatest
disappointment.
The Gentry Hills Golf Club has collapsed, membership prices at the Classic
Golf Club have fallen 78 per cent, and the Gatsby Golf Club issued 15 times
more memberships than promised, meaning that the certificates were devalued
and the fairways very crowded.
The bubble may have burst, and the old industrial class may be chuckling,
but the fondness for prestige has not diminished. Even if golf club
memberships remains out of reach, there is still Gatsby hair mousse or gel,
advertised in gawky English as 'highly valuable cosmetic.' Brand names are
still an important accessory for the wealthy.
La Tour d'Argent, which prides itself on being the country's most expensive
French restaurant, says the collapse of stock prices has yet to dull the
pampered palate.
Business entertaining accounts for about 30 per cent of its trade and
'common people can't really afford to have dinner here' anyway.
The bill would be no trouble for Hiromasa Ezoe, the founder of Recruit, a
business information company at the centre of a stocks-for-favours political
scandal in 1989. Ezoe, who goes to court once a week for ongoing hearings,
topped the list of Japan's taxpayers last year, paying Y3.96bn after
confessing to making a large profit on a share deal.
Now that he has lost control of Recruit and has the prospect of a jail
sentence to concentrate his mind, a more contemplative Ezoe has concluded
that 'joy exists in the process of gaining assets, not in the assets
themselves.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Brazil - the beautiful and the damned /
Christina Lamb describes trillionaire life in the country with the biggest
gap between rich and poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL is perhaps the only country in the world where the entire working
populace are millionaires. Unfortunately, most are also poor. With a million
cruzeiros now worth Dollars 25, to be seriously rich in Brazil one must have
a good few trillion stashed away.
And plenty such people exist. Forget the Brazil of economic crises, growing
slums, ailing Indians and Dollars 2,000 per capita income. Instead, welcome
to the country which is second only to the US in purchase of private jets
and where high society is so flourishing that the Association of Columnists
boasts more than 500 working members and even the Journal of Commerce has a
large gossip column.
Wealth is flaunted. At one favourite hangout, Leopoldos, in Sao Paulo,
diners watch images of themselves and other customers projected on to a
giant videoscreen, enabling close scrutiny of who is wearing what and
flirting with whom. In tropical Rio, fur wraps are de rigueur for true
socialites.
These are the authentic beautiful and the damned. 'Beautiful' because in the
world capital of plastic surgery, nobody with money is allowed to retain
nature's imperfections. Nose jobs, face lifts, bottom tucks, cellulite
removal, breast implants - the decision is not if but when the next cut
should come. Ivo Pitanguy is Brazil's high priest of plastic surgery;
fittingly, he has become a member of the serious rich himself, owning an
island south of Rio.
'Damned' because Brazil has the world's biggest income gap between rich and
poor - a contrast particularly obvious in Rio, where luxury apartments rub
shoulders with sprawling slums. Already the crime rate is so high that even
the only-slightly-rich live behind bars protected by armies of security
guards and drive bullet-proof cars. Sometimes, sipping cocktails on their
penthouse terraces, rich Brazilians look at the lights of the surrounding
slums and wonder how long before the masses swarm upon them, demanding
justice.
Meantime, they are having a ball. 'The Brazilian elite are like a bunch of
people having a wild champagne party on a boat which is heading towards the
edge of Niagara Falls,' says a World Bank official.
The day starts late for Brazil's seriously rich. For the women it begins
with exercises or a jog along the beach, followed by a light lunch at a
restaurant such as Antiquarius to discuss the events of the previous night.
Then it is a trip to the hair salon, perhaps tea at the Copacabana Palace,
then home to prepare for a party or dinner at one of Rio's classy French
restaurants - Le Bec Fin, Claude Troisgros or Le Meridien. For the younger
set, preferred hangouts are Banana cafe or Gattopardos, followed by dancing
at Hippopotamus.
Weekends are spent messing about on boats, jetskis and microlites in the
coastal resorts of Angra dos Reis or Buzios, or horse-riding in the
mountains of Petropolis. There are also frequent trips to the requisite
fazenda in the country, and to Miami, New York and Paris where rich
Brazilians descend on fashion houses like Chanel and Balenciaga, practising
the French that it is so chic to speak at home.
Although Brazil's security problems have caused a few of the rich to flee
permanently, most return. According to Jeff Thomas, a leading society
writer: 'They love to see their names in the papers; abroad, they are not
celebrities.'
There is nothing like being rich in a developing country. Even the
moderately well-off can maintain armies of servants, including
white-uniformed nannies to walk the baby and handlers to exercise the dog.
And while strict import laws meant that, until recently, some trappings of
wealth, such as cell phones and smart cars, were unobtainable, even for the
richest, they could still live like kings.
Behind the high brick walls surrounding the estate of 'Baby' Monteiro de
Carvalho, one of Rio's most favoured sons, you encounter mansion after
mansion (one for each of his children) on the long drive until finally
reaching the colonnaded main house, which is like something out of a de
Mille movie.
Brazilian governments have seemed exclusively interested in improving the
lot of the rich, preferring to spend money on subsidies and incentives for
large industry and agriculture rather than social welfare. Monopolies have
been protected, land reform carefully skirted.
The coffee and sugar barons of the past have been replaced by
industrialists, media moguls and bankers, the latter scooping profits from
the soaring inflation rate. Owners of construction companies have also grown
rich from huge development projects at inflated costs which are responsible
for much of the Third World's largest foreign debt.
Proving that crime pays in Brazil, the serious rich also include a fair
number of organised crime bosses, plus corrupt politicians and officials.
Former president Fernando Collor and his frontman, P C Farias, transformed
from a used car salesman to a multi-millionaire, have not let disgrace
interfere with their lifestyles. Orestes Quercia, who recently resigned as
head of Brazil's largest political party, is alleged to have built a fortune
of as much as Dollars 1bn during stints as governor of Sao Paulo.
In spite of Brazil's social apartheid, the serious rich do not let
themselves be troubled by such things as conscience. You will rarely catch
the rich wives of Rio dirtying their hands in good works. As one society
woman told me: 'The poor are always robbing us, my dear, so why should we
give them money ?'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: The franc alone is not enough - Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are some places where money alone is not enough, and Paris is one.
Anyone - well, almost anyone - with a fistful of francs can buy their way
into the front row of the Chanel haute couture show, the best seat at the
Opera de Bastille, or a candy-coloured villa on Cap Ferrat.
But they need much more than money to join the gilded group of guests chez
Baronne Marie-Helene de Rothschild at Hotel Lambert on the Ile Saint-Louis.
The Rothschild salon is the summit of the French social scene. The baronne,
aided and abetted by her husband, Baron Guy, patriarch of the banking
dynasty, need barely blink at the bills for her Christian Lacroix ballgowns,
or for the mink-covered plates that decked the tables of the surrealist
ball, her social coup in 1972.
But Marie-Helene de Rothschild has the elan to turn her soirees into more
than just gaudy gatherings of the very, very rich. Her salon is modelled on
those that Marcel Proust visited in 19th century Paris and on that of
Marie-Laure de Noailles in the 1930s, whose artistic proteges, Jean Cocteau
and Salvador Dali, mingled with the creme de la creme of French society.
The Rothschild guest list is the giveaway. There is old money in Baron
Alexis de Rede, who lived in Hotel Lambert before the Rothschilds, and new
money among the baron's fellow bankers. There is also politics in Jacques
Chirac, mayor of Paris and prospective French president, alongside Edouard
Balladur, the new conservative prime minister who may yet be Chirac's chief
challenger for the presidency. And there is culture in Bernard-Henri Levy,
the philosopher, and, before his death, Rudolph Nureyev.
What the guest list says is that the Rothschilds are not only rich, but can
hold their own in artistic and political circles too. It speaks volumes
about the ambivalent attitude towards wealth in a country like France, where
an idiosyncratic blend of Roman Catholic guilt and republican egalitarianism
rubs up against the snobbish vestiges of the ancien regime.
The French revel in the (very expensive) things that money can buy. It is no
coincidence that le luxe - the business of selling luxurious goodies like
champagne, designer clothes and foie gras - is one of France's most
successful export sectors. But the real allure for the French is power.
Wealth, even serious wealth, is only respected when, as with the
Rothschilds, it is backed by political influence and spent with taste.
The key to the Gallic ambivalence about money lies in the means of acquiring
it. It is still possible to inherit wealth in France, but the combination of
stiff taxes and strict inheritance law has injected enough egalitarianism
into the system so that anyone who is born rich and wants to die rich will
almost certainly have to make more money of their own.
The first blow to the French aristocracy was the 1789 revolution, when the
estates of all those who were guillotined or who fled the country were
confiscated and auctioned off to the bourgeoisie.
Napoleon Bonaparte dealt the decisive blow in 1804 by abolishing
primogeniture, the principle whereby fathers can leave their estates to
their first-born male heirs. Whereas the British upper classes have handed
down fortunes from generation to generation, French estates have been
parcelled out among the various legatees.
Expectant heirs now face the additional obstacle of death duties, as Pablo
Picasso's family discovered when it was forced to hand over most of his art
collection to the state following his death in 1973. There is also the
wealth tax, tabled by the socialists, which taxes the very rich not only on
their income but on the value of their property.
The French aristocracy may have held on to their titles, and to the ancient
de prefixes before their names, but they cannot count on inheriting very
much money, or on keeping it for very long. The great French fortunes of
today belong to bankers and industrialists - the Rothschilds, Schlumbergers,
Dassaults and Michelins - who have added to their inheritances.
This notion of the rich justifying their privileges is reinforced by an
education system rooted in the concours, the competitive examinations that
people take to get into the best universities, the Institut d'Etudes
Politiques (alias 'Science Po') or the Ecole Polytechnique ('X') in Paris,
and the elite Ecole Nationale de l'Administration (ENA).
In theory the exams should ensure that the system is egalitarian. In
practise the student rolls of Science Po, X and ENA are still dominated by
privileged Parisians. Yet the existence of these institutions, all of which
are geared towards preparing their alumnae for careers in the public sector,
has an important influence over French perceptions of success. This is
because the country's brightest brains are trained to run the country as
politicians or bureaucrats, not to make money for themselves in the private
sector.
Anyone who does become rich in France is invariably apologetic about it.
Pierre Berge, who made one fortune by founding the Yves Saint-Laurent
fashion house and another by selling it, prefers to style himself as a
failed painter rather than a successful businessman. Bernard Arnault, who
battled his way to the top of the LVMH luxury goods group in the 1980s,
bills himself as a frustrated concert pianist.
No wonder Baron Guy de Rothschild was swift to reassure Paris - Match
magazine this month that not only does he not have a chauffeur, but often
travels by Metro, although he was rather hazy about the price of Metro
tickets. 'Between FFr5 FFr7,' he surmised. 'All I know is that they give you
a few coins back each time.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: A land of millionaires - Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FORGET TALK of the worst recession since the second world war
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany and the Germans have never had it so good. For the first time,
millions of Germans have been able to spend a peaceful half-century devoting
themselves to the task of making money.
Four times during the course of this century the wealth produced by a
generation of Germans was wiped out, twice in world wars, twice as a result
of inflation. But since 1948, when the introduction of the D-Mark ushered in
an era of unprecedented prosperity, there has been no war, and no inflation
to speak of.
As a result, Germans are richer than they have ever been, and the wealth
built over the past prosperous decades is about to be passed down from one
generation to another, intact.
Estimates are that approximately DM2,000bn in assets of one form or another
will be passed on in this way by the end of the century.
Some of the inheritors are the old aristocratic families for whom
inheritance is no novelty. These include fabulously wealthy grandees such as
the Duke of Bavaria, who owns much of the part of southern Germany which
bears his name, or the young Prince Thurn und Taxis, whose mother, the
redoubtable Princess Gloria, tends a fortune worth DM1bn or more until her
son comes of age.
Although Germany is teeming with aristocrats, who disport their ancient
titles and stick together socially, most are not seriously rich. They work
in the upper echelons of banks in Frankfurt or Munich, dreaming of
repossessing old estates in the east of Germany or even further afield, in
Bohemia or Silesia.
Germany's real wealth is in industry and commerce, not land. Whole sectors
of the economy are owned by a handful of individuals, and generally a much
greater share of the German economy is in private hands than in countries
such as Japan, the US or UK.
The size of the German economy, still Europe's biggest, means that Germany
has thousands of millionaires and hundreds of people who are worth tens, if
not hundreds, of millions of Deutsche - Mark.
To stand a chance of being included in the German Forbes magazine's list of
the 400 richest people in Germany, for example, you have to be worth at
least DM190m. According to this list, there are more than 100 German
families or individuals worth DM1bn or more, over 40 worth DM2bn-plus, and
10 worth more than DM5bn.
Few of these individuals will be familiar to Anglo-Saxon readers, as
Germany's super-rich live calm lives as far from public gaze as possible.
Among the most discreet is the 69-year-old Otto Beisheim, majority owner of
the Metro stores group. The last time he appeared to explain his business
strategy was shortly after it was founded 28 years ago. Metro, with sales of
around DM60bn, is one of the world's biggest retailers, and Beisheim's stake
is worth an incalculable number of billions. Long ago he moved to
Switzerland, for tax reasons.
Equally discreet are the four members of the Haub family who own Tengelmann,
a retail group with sales of nearly DM50bn, which is Germany's eighth
biggest non-financial company.
Perhaps the Haniel family is the richest of all, but their fortune, worth in
the region of DM10bn according to Forbes, is divided between several hundred
descendants of Franz Haniel. Other rich families include the Oetkers, owners
of the food manufacturing group of that name, the Oppenheims, owners of the
Sal Oppenheim private banking empire, the Henkels and the Boehringers, who
own two of Germany's larger chemicals companies, and the Merck family, which
owns the large pharmaceuticals company of that name.
For the Porsche family, the difficulties currently being experienced by the
sports car company of that name are not unduly worrying; the family's
business interests extend beyond car manufacturing and they own one of the
biggest companies in Austria.
The Quandt family owns the majority of the shares - perhaps two-thirds  - in
BMW, the most resilient of German car manufacturers amid difficult market
conditions.
These families - and a few more - are Germany's super-rich. Slightly less
prosperous are those who are merely extremely rich - people like Hans Peter
Stihl, chairman of the German industrial association, who controls one of
the world's largest manufacturers of electric saws.
But the core of German wealth lies with those who are rich on a more modest
scale. The German arm of 3i, the UK venture capital group, calculates that
there are 15,000 companies in Germany with a turnover of between DM20m to
DM200m, all but a handful of which are privately owned.
These companies form the fabled 'Mittelstand,' the medium-sized
privately-owned companies which form the backbone of the economy and are
largely responsible for Germany's post-war success.
The recession means that some families are experiencing an acute sense of
diminishing wealth. But only in rare cases is the wealth being wiped out
altogether. For all its present difficulties, Germany remains a land of
millionaires.

FT  29 MAY 93 / The Long View: Clarke's big opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT THE UK's ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism
last September could not trigger the Newbury by-election apparently could:
the sacking of Norman Lamont.
More charitable commentators are blaming Lamont's fall more on poor
presentation and unlucky timing than on policy errors, but the fact is that
he never properly seized hold of economic strategy. He inherited John
Major's blundering entry to the ERM at the wrong rate and at the wrong time
and remained too much in the Treasury's grip.
His espousal of ridiculous economic forecasts of recovery became a standing
joke. During the 1992 election campaign he acquiesced in the government's
cynical, albeit vote-winning, promises of economic growth and continued low
taxation; the medium-term Red Book projections of March 1992 were among the
more spurious ever. The electorate is now taking its revenge.
Finally, having been forced out of the ERM, Lamont failed to turn policy
around and rebalance fiscal and monetary policy to the proper degree. This
is how we have wound up with a crazy Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing
requirement for the current financial year, after the March Budget which was
far too hesitant. If only Kenneth Clarke had been given this opportunity
last September. At least he has his own first Budget in November rather than
next March. In some respects Clarke has been dealt a rotten hand, with big
spending cuts and tax increases on the agenda. However, he is in a splendid
position to blame much of the coming agony on his predecessor's errors of
judgment.
Meanwhile he starts from a position of low inflation, with scope for pushing
short-term interest rates lower. A modest economic revival has started, too.
So although the economic cards may be of low denomination there could be a
few political aces tucked away.
The financial markets have taken Lamont's departure fairly calmly - even
casually - although the foreign exchanges are clearly apprehensive that
sterling may become vulnerable to changes in policy. One of Lamont's several
strategic errors has been once again to swallow Treasury and Bank of England
advice and encourage a renewed overvaluation of sterling.
He has been misguidedly promoting an underlying inflation target of no more
than 4 per cent which has been seriously inhibiting the restoration of
balance within the British economy. To get imports down and exports up, in
the context of a serious European recession, sterling weakness must be
tolerated. The possibility of a reassessment here is plainly going to cause
nervousness, especially as foreigners have been buying gilt-edged again. But
financing deficits smoothly must surely take second place to getting the
real economy back on an even keel.
Now the estranged Norman Lamont moves to the backbenches. Will he play the
malevolent role that Geoffrey Howe performed in the latter days of Margaret
Thatcher? And will Kenneth Clarke, the amiable thug, play a kind of Denis
Healey part in the crumbling Major administration?
The parallel may be far from strained, because Clarke will be struggling
with the same scale of deficits as Healey suffered in the late 1970s, and at
much higher real interest rates. It could be tempting for Clarke to engineer
the same kind of financial crisis that struck Healey in 1976.
Such turmoil can, of course, be very uncomfortable, and even dangerous, but
in a mature democracy there may be no other way of forcing through tough
measures. And perhaps Clarke needs the crisis soon, while his own hands seem
reasonably clean and Norman Lamont's appear soiled. Another important factor
is that Lamont has been carrying out Major's economic wishes, and the prime
minister stands to lose reputation should Clarke make a better fist of
managing the economy.
Clarke has two basic strategy choices. The markets are assuming he will
finance a big deficit for several years, then try to inflate away the
accumulated burden of the debt. This seemed to be the only route that Norman
Lamont could imagine, given that he was proposing to fund seemingly endless
and gaping budget deficits at very high real interest rates.
However, there is little or no domestic private sector inflation being
generated in the British economy at present. This is not at all like 1989,
when Nigel Lawson was forced out. The banks are battening down the hatches,
and pay inflation is 4 per cent and declining. Another possibility thus
presents itself, that the new chancellor could seek a way out through an
interest rate offensive, unhindered by fears of inflation, at least in the
short term. Instead of pushing long bond rates up, as Lamont has been doing
recently, there would be a concerted attempt to force down both short and
long rates aggressively.
Imagine a serious attack on the fiscal deficit this autumn, along with a
sharp cut in short-term interest rates. Sterling would weaken, helping to
sustain an export-led recovery. Would the gilt-edged market become alarmed
about inflation in the medium term? Maybe, but suppose the supply of gilts
were reduced, and suppose short-term rates were low enough, then it might be
possible to engineer a buying panic as investors chased a declining supply
of paper with a worthwhile yield.
This is not standard Treasury or Bank of England thinking, but Kenneth
Clarke has little grounding in establishment thinking on the economy. He may
ponder on the fact that of Tory chancellors since 1979 only Howe has
retained much of a permanent reputation, and that is because he was prepared
to challenge the standard thinking of his time and propose a radical
alternative. He was also prepared to tear up an election manifesto and raise
taxes.
On the other hand, he never became prime minister.

FOR THOSE who enjoy a little vulgarity, the behaviour of the rich in the
1990s is a marked disappointment. What a contrast with the 1980s when, in
the words of Ronald Reagan's first budget director David Stockman, 'the hogs
were really feeding.' It wasn't just the hogs.
The Trumps were trumping, the Milkens milking, the Goldsmiths greenmailing
and Thatcher's entrepreneurial children were jumping joyfully from the play
pen. Even at this short distance the 1980s look the finest years for
would-be nouveaux riches since the forebears of many of today's ducal
families grew fat on the dissolution of the monasteries.
The billionaires and millionaires who are making the headlines in the 1990s
are a notably more austere bunch. George Soros, the high-minded
philosopher-speculator who found the fault lines in the European exchange
rate mechanism and recycled the British taxpayer's money to Bosnian Moslems
and needy Hungarians; Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft and richest bachelor
in the US, whose recent decision to marry one of his managers shows no sign
of transforming him from a computer-world frog into glamour-world prince;
David Sainsbury, one-time backer of Britain's Social Democratic Party,
charitable donor and eponymous chairman of the food retailing group that
remains one of Britain's most remorseless money-making machines. The
tricoteuses of the French Revolution - who knitted as the tumbrils rolled -
would scarcely have known what to make of them.
The new austere tendency, if that is what it is, has nothing to do with any
wave of popular feeling against the rich. If anything, the extraordinary
feature of the past dozen years has been the lack of any serious backlash on
the part of the world's underdogs, despite the failure of First World wealth
to trickle to the Third.
Numerous poor countries have suffered a protracted decline in the price of
the commodity exports on which their economies depended. And within
individual countries, notably in Latin America, the trickle down theory of
economics failed to work because so much of the money trickled out in
capital flight, as the rich tried to escape the depredations of incompetent
or corrupt politicians.
Yet the political response to impoverishment has increasingly been to adopt
the prevailing ideology of the developed world: the market. The result in
Latin America, once the home of dependency theory and the economics of
despair, has been that capital, both native and foreign, has trickled back
to finance an unprecedented experiment in liberal economics. Meantime the
dragon economies of Asia have reasserted the merits of self-help in
spectacular style. Their millionaires are busily exporting a uniquely potent
brand of workaholic materialism to the ramshackle economy of China.
In the developed - and more especially the English-speaking - world, the
present sober condition of the rich is no more than a natural evolution from
the ideological 1980s. The Reagan-Thatcher years delivered lower marginal
tax rates, financial liberalisation, balance of payment deficits and buoyant
stock markets. For the first time in recent memory the political culture
turned pro-business. And in this frothy, consumption-led cycle, the service
industries - finance, advertising, entertainment, trophy wives - boomed as
never before.
Bejewelled dames apart, these were not commodity-intensive pursuits. And
those manufacturing industries that did flourish in the 1980s, such as
computing, relied not on expensive commodities like metals, but on a cheap
form of sand called silicon. Hence the poor performance of the less
developed countries in the prolonged recovery of the 1980s.
But the rich of the developed world are now infected by the curse of the
Third World nations: since economic activity was financed in the previous
decade by unprecedented resort to borrowing, much of the First World has
suffered a debt-induced recession.
The new millionaires have thus been culled not by sans culottes, but by the
laws of financial gravity; and the extent of their financial and ethical
misdeeds, rather than the nature and substance of their particular business,
has been the chief determinant of their fate.
Witness how printer and publisher Robert Maxwell, scourge of the widows and
orphans, succumbed to the grim reaper; Michael Milken of junk bond fame to
the zealous prosecutor; Asil Nadir of the fruit-to-fraud conglomerate Polly
Peck to the administrative receiver, if not to the courts. Meanwhile,
entertainment figures such as Andrew Lloyd Webber, Mick Jagger and Paul
McCartney, representatives of one of the frothiest of all service
industries, are alive, and well and very rich.
The attrition has been worst in property, an industry that has a peculiar
knack of exposing the banking fraternity's propensity for collective
aberration. For those of envious disposition, one of the most satisfying
falls from grace has been that of US real estate man Donald Trump. He it was
who, in a moment of intense hubris, wrote an improving tract called The Art
of the Deal.
The 1990s demonstrated that the only artistry in his balance sheet was pure
trompe l'oeil. Others whose art proved similarly insubstantial were the
Reichmann brothers of Canada, Godfrey Bradman and Trevor Osborne in the UK
and the frenetic Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond.
Bond, like US junk bond financier Michael Milken and arbitrageur Ivan
Boesky, found that one of the squares on the Monopoly board said 'Go To
Jail.' Gerald Ronson, the property man jailed for his role in the share
scandal surrounding the Guinness takeover of Distillers, was another to make
that discovery.
Yet so persuasive is Ronson in dealing with his bankers that he has achieved
the unique distinction of being the first man to combine de facto bankruptcy
with millionaire status. His recently agreed pay package, which includes an
annual salary of Pounds 500,000 indexed against inflation, is estimated to
be worth more than Pounds 4.4m over five years - an astonishing reward for
one who brought one of the world's biggest private companies to its knees,
even though he built it originally.
At least Ronson's outfit is a private concern. The quickest path to riches
in recent years has been for the directors of quoted companies to wreck the
business after taking the elementary precaution of demanding the longest
possible contract. This ensures hefty compensation for loss of office at the
shareholders' expense.
Many who have failed to wreck their companies have been equally shameless in
paying themselves risk-free fortunes regardless of performance. Still more
have milked the pension fund by manipulating pre-retirement salaries. This
exploitation of slack accountability in the Anglo-Saxon financial system is
a gravy train that rolls on regardless of recession. Why on earth do
institutional shareholders, in effect the legal owners of the corporate
sector, allow it to continue?
The biggest loser of recent years has been Old Money. According to an index
compiled by the agents Savills, the value of agricultural land at the end of
last year had fallen in real terms to a mere 37 per cent of its value at the
start of the 1980s. As Savills' Bertie Ross points out, there have been
off-sets against this fall in values, such as big productivity improvements
in farming and surpluses from planning gains on development land.
But for the really big landlords with holdings in commercial property as
well, there has been a double bind. While equities have generated
unprecedentedly high returns, commercial property has been one of the worst
performing investment categories of the past dozen years. Investment
Property Databank's index indicates that the capital value of commercial
property has fallen by more than 30 per cent in real terms since 1980.
Since many of the older aristocratic estates are averse to borrowing, the
attrition is long term and will be felt mainly when property is passed from
one generation to another. Yet for Queen Elizabeth II, the pain is more
immediate, in that any capital loss will be compounded by her new settlement
with the tax man - conscience money, in the eyes of the tabloid press, for
the colourful ways of the younger members of her family.
For less regal landed estates, an unexpected twist has come from John
Major's government, in the shape of legislation to enfranchise leaseholders.
This assault on property rights gives new meaning to Keynes's phrase about
the euthanasia of the rentier.
It has also caused the Duke of Westminster, Britain's biggest landowner
after the Queen, to resign from the Tory party in protest. But does anyone
care much any more when the highest in the land discover that they are
downwardly mobile? What, come to that, is the point of the rich? Are they
really doing their stuff?
The bien pensants of the 18th century had no difficulty with these
questions. As Dr Johnson put it: 'You cannot spend money in luxury without
doing good to the poor. Nay, you do more good to them by spending it in
luxury than by giving it; for by spending it in luxury you make them exert
industry, whereas by giving it you keep them idle.'
Unfortunately (if you share the Johnsonian point of view) the spending power
of the rich is too small, nowadays, to offset the rise in the savings of the
masses that brought about the recession. From an economic point of view, the
very rich are not very relevant.
A more political justification comes from those who trumpet the merits of
maintaining a class of people who are rich enough to stand up to the
powerful and to stand down on matters of principle. An unlikely apologist of
this ilk was the post-war Labour leader Clement Attlee. It was he who said
of the Cecil dynasty in the Tory party: 'Cecils don't give a damn, and that
makes a lot of difference.'
Certainly it is striking that the only high-profile, voluntary departures
from ministerial office in recent years in Britain have not come from those
like Major or Norman Lamont who made the biggest mistakes, but from those
who made or inherited the most money. Michael Heseltine could well afford,
in a purely financial sense, to resign over the Westland saga; and former
defence minister Alan Clark could equally afford to resign over . . . no one
is quite sure what.
Yet Heseltine all too transparently does care about his own advancement in
politics, which is presumably the mark of new money. Clark, in contrast,
appears not to care about high office, but has left less of a mark on
politics than on the lives of those who were acquitted in the
Matrix-Churchill arms-for-Iraq affair, where his candour about Whitehall
duplicity prevented serious injustice.
For a better example of what a rich maverick can do in politics, one has to
look to the US and to Ross Perot, that peculiarly American version of the
Socratic gadfly. But while Perot unquestionably enlivened last year's
presidential election and continues to stir the debate on the US budget
deficit, he holds no office and smacks too much of the quack to bear
comparison with the Cecils.
Even then, the striking thing about the last politically influential Cecil,
the fifth Marquess of Salisbury, was the ineffectiveness of his principled
departure from politics. He bowed out after attacking the colonial
secretary, Iain MacLeod, for his conduct of Britain's retreat from empire.
Yet the resulting battle in the Tory party petered out without causing
lasting damage or securing political change. History's verdict would seem to
favour the meritocrat rather than the aristocrat on both the point at issue
and MacLeod's subsequent career, which took him to the cabinet as a sadly
short-lived chancellor of the exchequer.
That leaves a more subtle and provocative case for the rich, advanced by the
libertarian philosopher Friedrich Hayek. Hayek argued not only that people
of independent means are essential for the preservation of competitive
enterprise, but that the rich are even more valuable when pursuing aims that
bring no material return. In a majoritarian democracy, he argued, the state
simply cannot provide sufficient diversity of patronage in arts, education,
politics, morals and religion.
There would even, he adds, be a strong case for selecting at random one in
1,000 and endowing them with fortunes to dispose of at whim; but since
inheritance is already random, and those who inherit wealth less prone to
the grosser pleasures than the newly rich, inheritance will do very nicely
instead.
For Hayek, such a system justifies itself even if a mere handful of these
inheritors spends in a beneficial manner, because waste, however shocking,
is the price of freedom. And measured by this undemanding criterion, the
present-day rich are clearly doing a splendid job.
In less fiscally stressful times the British government might have put up
the money for the National Gallery's Sainsbury wing. But it would surely
have had misgivings about the superb Saatchi gallery in St John's Wood,
which embraces the kind of contemporary art that can sometimes embarrass
government ministers.
Nor would any government be likely to put the taxpayers' money into prizes
for religious research, as the octogenarian fund manager Sir John Templeton
has done.
The pluralist's response might be that the rich are not as diverse, in their
tastes, as they might be; and that Hayek underestimates the diversity of the
wonderfully imperfect democratic process. Ken Livingstone's Greater London
Council might not have been every libertarian philosopher's ideal - though
Livingstone is closer to the anarchist than the authoritarian wing of the
Labour Party - but it backed far wilder ventures, artistic and otherwise, in
its time, than most private millionaire patrons would wish to contemplate.
Even a quango like the Arts Council can be astonishingly and quirkily
creative  - or destructive - under the direction of such lords as Keynes,
Goodman or Rees-Mogg.
That said, in a world marked by structural budget deficits, the 19th century
campaigners who were able, thanks to a sufficiency, to abolish slavery,
reform the prisons and bring humanity to the treatment of the insane, are
almost certainly due for a late 20th century renaissance. Perhaps, also, as
university funding is squeezed, are the gentlemen scholars like Darwin, de
Tocqueville or Henry Adams, and the recipients of patronage like Marx.
Love them or hate them, millionaires are the only people in the straightened
1990s who can fill many of the intellectual, cultural and social gaps left
by a state that is in obligatory retreat. The rich, of necessity, are always
with us.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Exchange undercut on new dealing system: Row over US offer
to build replacement scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NASDAQ, the US over-the-counter stock exchange, has offered to build a
replacement for London's ageing dealing system, known as Seaq, for Pounds
37m, an estimated Pounds 20m less than a rival system planned by the Stock
Exchange itself.
The surprise proposal, endorsed by a group of Stock Exchange board members,
was the subject of a heated four-hour board meeting on Wednesday at which
Nasdaq officials were present.
Supporters of the Stock Exchange's own proposal were said to have argued at
that meeting that the Nasdaq proposal fails to take account of additional
required spending, and that the total costs of both systems were broadly
equal.
The Stock Exchange's board met last week to discuss the results of a review
by IBM, the US computer group, of the Stock Exchange proposal, developed in
conjunction with management consultants Andersen Consulting, against those
of an earlier, more expensive plan put forward by Nasdaq.
That review, commissioned by the Stock Exchange, strongly urged adoption of
the system proposed by the exchange itself. Among other things, it said the
exchange plan offered a 'British' solution to the matter.
In spite of IBM's recommendations, intended to provide an independent view
of the two proposals, Stock Exchange members remain deeply divided about the
best replacement for the ageing system which, all agree, will be unable to
cope with the exchange's future growth.
For one thing, members have become increasingly sceptical about the
exchange's ability to develop an inexpensive system because of its failure
to make the proposed Taurus paperless trading and settlement system work.
In addition, market makers, who agree to buy and sell specific company
shares under all conditions, feared that the exchange was contemplating a
system that would eliminate the need for market making.
In April, a group of leading market makers who are members of the Stock
Exchange board retained consultants Booz Allen to examine alternatives to
the exchange's proposals. They recommended a system to be developed by
Nasdaq.
The Nasdaq system proposed at Wednesday's meeting would be able to take
two-way price quotes electronically from market makers and distribute them
on screen; directly handle interacting orders, beginning with inactive
stocks for which there are few or no market makers; and produce a stream of
quotations for commercial vendors of stock prices such as Reuters.
Supporters argue that its chief advantage is that it would prove more
adaptable as trading volumes increased.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Anger in Germany at scrapping of liberal law on abortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN constitutional court yesterday scrapped eastern Germany's liberal
abortion law, prompting the fury of women's groups and opposition
politicians in the east and the west.
Ms Renate Hildebrandt, labour minister of the eastern state of Brandenburg,
said: 'This is a catastrophe. It is just impossible at the end of the 20th
century.'
In eastern Germany, a 1972 law permitted free abortion on demand up to the
12th week of pregnancy.
The court of seven men and one woman also declared unconstitutional a
compromise law passed last year to unify abortion regulations in the western
and eastern states. It decided abortion was no longer a criminal offence but
declared that it would be subject to restrictions throughout Germany and
that state funding for abortions would no longer be available.
The court's six-to-two ruling, aimed at protecting the rights of the unborn
child as required under the constitution, was welcomed by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and the Roman Catholic church.
In 1991, eastern German women had 32 abortions for every 100 births,
compared with western Germany's nine abortions for every 100 births. Tighter
restrictions will also mean that women, who make up 65 per cent of the
unemployed in eastern Germany, will not be able to afford abortions.
'Whoever has money can afford an abortion. Whoever doesn't will have to
return to back-alley butchers,' said Ms Heidemarie Wieczorek Zeul, a senior
member of the opposition Social Democrats.
Women's groups were last night planning to protest against the court's
ruling by holding demonstrations in Berlin and other German cities.
The court's decision highlights the difficulty in reconciling two
diametrically opposed views on abortion, and the wider difficulties of
integrating east and west at the social level.
In 1976 the Bonn government passed a law permitting abortion up to 12 weeks,
provided a woman met certain social and psychological requirements and
received medical advice.
As a result, only two-fifths of abortions for west German women complied
with the legal requirements. The remainder were carried out privately or
took place outside the country.
East German women perceived their legal rights not as an ethical issue, but
as one that gave them the freedom to make decisions outside state
interference.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Labour leader faces defeat on one member one vote plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Smith, the Labour leader, faces the prospect of defeat at the autumn
party conference over his plan to introduce one member one vote for the
selection of Labour parliamentary candidates after another normally moderate
union rejected the proposal yesterday.
The Union of Communication Workers' conference voted to oppose any plans to
weaken or remove the union's voting strength in selecting Labour candidates
and electing the party leader and deputy leader. Before the last election
unions accounted for 40 per cent of the vote in the selection process.
Mr Smith has turned one member one vote into a test of his own political
credibility but the only big union so far prepared to back him over the
issue is the AEEU engineering union. Seven of the top eight unions
affiliated to the Labour party are opposed to his plan.
Efforts may have to be made to compromise on the issue but any climbdown by
Mr Smith would deal a severe blow to his position at a time when he needs to
reassert his authority in the party.
Early last week delegates at the conference of MSF - the professional and
technicians union - also rejected the advice of their leaders and voted to
oppose one member one vote despite a strong speech from Mr Smith.
The Labour leader had hoped to win wider support inside the unions by his
recent suggestion that union political levy payers should be entitled to
cut-price membership of the party to participate in candidate selections.
But his idea has so far failed to impress union leaders who want to uphold
union organisational links with Labour at local level.
Over the past few weeks Mr Smith has made it clear that he wants to maintain
close ties with the trade unions, which he believes are valuable in keeping
Labour in touch with industrial realities. But at the same time he believes
it is in the interest of unions that they do not play a dominant role in
selection.
In a speech on Thursday, Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB
general union, rejected one member one vote but proposed instead the unions
should ballot among their 4m political levy-paying members on selecting
Labour candidates.
'Local union members, living in the constituency and paying the political
levy , could cast individual votes amounting to no more than a third of the
total', explained Mr Edmonds. 'This system would significantly broaden the
electoral base of selected candidates'.
Supporters of one member one vote point out that Mr Smith does not need to
win a majority of union votes at conference to secure that objective.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Stirling loses three pfennigs against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stirling lost three pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday, closing at
DM2.4775. Its weakness was mainly due to the intrinsic strength of the
D-Mark, following hawkish comments on German rate cuts from Bundesbank
council members. But dealers said that the pound was undermined by
uncertainty over the direction economic policy will take under the new
chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke. Speculation that Mr Clarke might lean towards
cutting interest rates brought UK gilt prices down a full percentage point.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading industrial shares closed 14.6 points down at
2,840.7.

FT  29 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Hartstone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone Group's behaviour is a case study in how not to communicate with
shareholders. Despite the Stock Exchange's intervention, shareholders remain
ignorant of the causes for its precipitous fall from grace. One has to hope
its refusal to explain itself is not an example of how more companies will
behave once the new insider trading legislation comes into force.
The hosiery group's profits warning in March, four weeks before its
year-end, led stockbrokers to reduce their profits forecasts from Pounds 36m
to Pounds 23m. The company, however, reassured with a promise of an
increased final dividend. Just two months later, Hartstone has issued an
even gloomier warning, suggesting profits may reach only Pounds 9m.
Ominously, Hartstone revealed it was also in urgent discussions with its
bankers and would not pay the dividend after all. Such an extraordinary
deterioration requires an explanation.
There is a curious inconsistency compared with Queens Moat which has also
kept mum about the reasons for its misfortunes. The Stock Exchange seems
content to allow Hartstone to continue trading; Queens Moat is suspended.
Arguably suspension simply locks small investors in, but it would help avoid
a false market if a way could be found to prise more information out of
Hartstone. Another sobering point is that, unlike Spring Ram, Hartstone
boasted two heavyweight non-executive directors. Even companies complying
with the Cadbury committee strictures are not immune from nasty surprises.

There are two ways of looking at the tension emerging again inside the ERM.
One is that the D-Mark has strengthened in sympathy with the yen, thus
aggravating the peseta's weakness ahead of the Spanish elections. If this is
the whole story, the tension should pass. An opposition victory might force
the peseta out of the system. But the yen seems unlikely to strengthen much
further without prompting a corrective interest rate cut by the Bank of
Japan. The Tokyo authorities must be concerned that pressure on the export
industry is reversing recent stock market gains, wiping out the fragile
advance in economic confidence. Once the dollar stabilises against the yen,
the D-Mark, too, might fall back again, easing broader worries about the
ERM.
That overlooks the more sombre aspect behind the D-Mark's movement. Despite
the deepening German recession, the Bundesbank remains cautious about
cutting rates. Several of its council members pointed yesterday to
reservations, for example, about the renewed acceleration of the money
supply and the trend in long term interest rates. Their arguments suggest
that, far from making alleviation of recession a priority, the Bundesbank
may be anxious to ensure the exchange rate remains firm to ward against
inflation.
Yesterday's poor French unemployment figures are a reminder of how
ill-equipped the rest of Europe is to stand the strain. The peseta may yet
struggle through, but its exit from the ERM would be harder to shrug off as
a little local difficulty against a background of diminishing market
expectations of lower German rates. Some of the remaining survivors would
quickly come under threat as well.

Mr Peter Brooke's hints of a relaxation of the rules preventing
consolidation of the ITV network certainly switched on the stock market. The
shares of several TV companies shot ahead after the national heritage
secretary's remarks in anticipation of juicy takeovers.
The excitement is premature and might be misplaced. There certainly appears
to be a need for industry rationalisation if independent television
companies are to remain competitive with cable and satellite rivals. As
currently structured, the ITV network wastefully duplicates production
facilities and corporate structures. Industry executives suggest there may
be up to Pounds 200m of 'excess' cost in the system. Some rationalisation
may occur next year, when any of the big nine stations can bid for one of
their smaller peers. Mr Brooke will now consider whether they should be
allowed to bid for each other too.
Such a change would provoke fierce opposition from some in the industry. It
might also raise problems with the OFT. Would the competition authorities,
for example, nod through a merger of Carlton TV and Central if it gave the
combined group more than 30 per cent of ITV revenues? ITV companies may
argue that the TV advertising market should be more broadly defined. But
that sits oddly with their contention that BSkyB is a subscription not an
advertising channel.

If any soothsayer told Mr Lamont to beware of ex-Cambridge chums wearing
suede shoes, the warning came too late. But whatever cheer the sociable Mr
Kenneth Clarke's elevation to the Treasury may raise with the beer-and-fags
fraternity, it is unlikely to warm hearts much within the City. The whole
incident is a mark of the weakness of the Major administration. That is
ironic, given that it is barely a year since Britain was hailed in
newspapers and City circulars as the sole haven of political stability in
Europe.
Given that the change was motivated by psychological perceptions rather than
policy differences, it would be unwise to expect rapid changes. The new
chancellor might in principle favour slightly lower base rates, but he is
unlikely to startle the markets with any early moves. He may wait to see how
the recovery develops over the summer, before moving in time for the party
conference if the need arises. On spending, the additional political weight
Mr Clarke carries may actually enable him to carry through larger cuts in
the autumn than the wounded Mr Lamont could have managed.
September will be crucial, with clearer indications on spending, interest
rates and first-half corporate results all coming together. Meanwhile, both
gilt and equity markets have been left on hold. Lost in yesterday's hoo-ha
was the CBI survey which showed output expected to rise strongly in all
sectors, particularly exports. The balance of payments crunch may be a
little further off than the market thinks.

FT  29 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bonds, figures and futures
depress Dow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
A fall in bond prices, a downward revision in first quarter economic growth
figures, and selling in the futures markets combined to drive share prices
lower yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.40 at 3,527.43.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 2.21 at 450.21,
while the Amex composite finished 0.71 lower at 438.22, and the Nasdaq
composite down 4.06 at 700.53. Trading volume on the NYSE was light at 209m
shares. After setting records on consecutive days, analysts expected Dow
stocks to run into profit-taking yesterday morning.
It was no coincidence that the three big stocks which provided almost all of
the gains for the Dow on Thursday - Chevron, Caterpillar and Texaco - were
all lower on heavy selling yesterday.
Investors remain nervous about the markets' recent gains, unsure as to
whether the economy and the outlook for corporate earnings justify prices at
such high levels.
Yesterday's news that the original estimate of a 1.8 per cent growth in
gross domestic product during the first quarter had been revised down to
only 0.9 per cent seemed to confirm that economic recovery this year is
advancing at a slow pace. It was these concerns about the economy, allied to
some selling of stock-index futures, which together with profit-taking
pushed equities lower across the board.
Later in the day, a sharp fall in bond prices only added to the decline.
Chevron fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 88 1/8 , Texaco gave up Dollars 5/8 at
Dollars 63 7/8 and Caterpillar dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 5/8 , all
on profit-taking following recent gains.
Steel stocks featured with USX dropping Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 43 after a
federal appeals court upheld a judgment in an anti-trust case against a
railroad once owned by USX.
The group will be responsible for paying the damages, estimated at Dollars
630m, unless the supreme court overturns the ruling. LTV, which is the main
beneficiary of the judgement, rose initially but ended steady at Dollars
1/4 in huge volume of 13m shares.
National Steel fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 18 1/2 after Goldman Sachs
downgraded the stock from a 'buy' to a 'market performer', while Bethlehem
Steel was also affected by selling, falling Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 19 3/8 .
Concern about the economic outlook affected airline stocks: AMR, parent of
American Airlines, fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 70 3/4 , Delta tumbled
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 57 3/8 and UAL dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars
134.
Jenny Craig rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 16 on hopes that the company,
which operates weight loss centres, will benefit from the financial troubles
afflicting one of its main competitors, Nutri-System.
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended little changed in moderate trading. The composite
index was off 3.28 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 3866.44, for a gain on the
week of about 31.5 points. Advancing issues edged declines by 361 to 327,
volume of 59.080 shares was down from Thursday's 67.858 shares, and trading
value was CDollars 446m against CDollars 706.6m. The banking group fell 1.08
per cent to post the largest decline among sub-groups. Golds gained 1.30 per
cent.

FT  29 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Bundesbank and German investors in a
bind - Christopher Parkes explains the economic background to the becalmed
and troubled Frankfurt bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just when it seemed safe for investors to raise their heads above the
parapet - a federal budget consolidation programme in the bag, an outbreak
of industrial harmony in east and west, and interest rates apparently fixed
on a gentle but persistent downwards slope - the flak has started to fly
again.
Growth in German money supply, after lagging early in the year so far below
the central bank's target range that some Bundesbankers even started to
believe that action was needed to give it some encouragement, returned to
its bad old ways in April with a 7.3 per cent annualised surge in the M3
measure.
Then came Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, confirming the discovery of
another black hole in federal revenues.
Some DM100bn of savings would be needed to the end of 1996, he said. The
Bundesbank, already blaming the government for most of the upwards lurch in
M3 and thereby feeding more inflationary pressure into the system, was
hardly likely to be impressed by the implications for federal deficits.
This week, as more junior members of the bank's policy-making council
muddied the issue, differing in public over whether a 'pause' in the
interest rates decline was necessary or not, Mr Otmar Issing, a member of
the bank's permanent directorate, tried to raise the mood.
The German economy would hit bottom this summer (industrial output fell more
than 10 per cent in the first quarter), but it would start to improve in the
second half.
Then he spoilt it all. Inflation of 4 per cent was incompatible with the
bank's aim of stability. Monetary growth rates and a situation in which the
D-Mark was relatively strong outside the country but declining in purchasing
power inside, made it difficult for the bank to formulate policy, he said.
The bank once again finds itself in a bind, more willing than it is prepared
publicly to admit to ease rates in the interests of softening the domestic
recessionary squeeze, but unable to move as fast as some of its members and
most of the rest of Europe would like for fear of rocking the D-Mark's
stability.
This leaves investors in a comparable position, weighing the likelihood of
rate cuts pushing the market upwards against the downward tendencies
encouraged by falling company earnings. Mr Thomas Holmes, at Schroder
Munchmeyer Hengst, believes this condition will prevail through the summer.
Although he believes that the Bundesbank 'must and will do something', its
policymakers were genuinely shocked by April's monetary growth through its
annualised ceiling of 6.5 per cent. Their lack of action on securities
repurchase rates, following the recent relatively steady downward moves
followed by chips off the discount rate, suggests that they feel that market
expectations had started once again to exceed what they could realistically
deliver.
The government has promised to cut deep into public spending. There will be
no sacred cows, it pledges. The Bundesbank has heard such promises before
and may be forgiven for a measure of scepticism.
For all its failings, however, the first so-called 'solidarity pact' which
was intended once and for all to stem deficits, at least proved that the
political establishment was capable of relatively speedy compromise in areas
where rapprochement would have been unthinkable a year ago.
Spending cuts on the scale now needed will require approval by the
opposition-controlled Bundesrat or upper house.
While the horse-trading proceeds, the bank is unlikely to sit on its hands.
Partly to encourage the negotiators, but mainly to prevent any further
decline in consumer and business confidence, it will probably make its
contribution in the shape of sporadic but small rate reductions.
It is still widely believed in Germany that the post-summer recovery (an
unhappy echo of the one being forecast at this time a year ago) will start
from improved foreign sales, which account for some 45 per cent of gross
national product.
Given that 70 per cent of exports go to European countries, many of which
are labouring under high interest rates as a result of Bundesbank policy,
the optimists are well advised to be cautious.
At current exchange rates, German products also lack a certain edge in the
area of price competitiveness.
Chances of internally generated demand helping to improve matters are
virtually nil.
With industrial capacity utilisation below 80 per cent, there is no reason
for increased capital investment.
Consumers are tightening their belts to cope with a real earnings fall this
year - average pay is up by 3.5 per cent while average inflation will be 4
per cent. They are increasingly afraid of unemployment: industrial
absenteeism is half 'normal' levels. Already confronted with a round of
looming increases in taxes and welfare contributions, the public now face a
round of swingeing public spending cuts to fill Mr Waigel's black hole.
Such confidence as exists within industry and government about an end to the
recession is based partly on the shaky premise that things, surely, cannot
get any worse. The finance and economics ministries, in an unusual display
of harmony, agree this is now the worst economic slump in the history of the
federal republic.
Where it is to be found at all, hard evidence for improvements is equally
flimsy. At Volkswagen, for example, where the management has done a
creditable job talking up its prospects, chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech admits
that most of the company's progress back towards consistent profitability
this year will have to come from cuts within.
As for selling cars, he says that he expects business to get a bit of a lift
from the September Frankfurt motor show. Meanwhile, he says he is encouraged
by an increase in second-hand car prices over the past three weeks.
That Mr Piech, for all his preoccupations, should keep such a close eye on
the banger market speaks volumes for the intensity of the search for good
news.

FT  29 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases in an
otherwise strong region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITIES ended only marginally lower in spite of the yen's continued advance
against the dollar, as investors waited patiently for fresh incentives,
writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 8.94 to 20,843.69, up 1.4 per cent on the week,
after reaching a session high of 20,939.66 and a low of 20,746.61. The Topix
index of all first section issues rose 1.11 to 1,654.82 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.19 to 1260.22.
Volume was 550m shares compared to Thursday's 757m. Advances led declines
628 to 434 with 127 issues unchanged.
Brokers said that investors lacked the energy and the interest to lift
equity prices, with arbitrageurs and individual investors dominating dealing
for most of the session.
Market participants kept to the same strategy of focusing on individual
issues with above-average results, or shares backed by strong incentives, an
analyst at a Japanese brokerage said.
Non-ferrous issues rose in tandem with gold prices overseas: Mitsui Mining
and Smelting Y13 to Y564, Sumitomo Metal and Mining Y10 to Y1,090 and Dowa
Mining Y3 to Y656.
Isuzu Motors, the day's most active issue, advanced Y16 to Y530 on reports
that it will develop a ceramic engine.
But profit-taking put pressure on financials, after two consecutive sessions
of sharp gains. Mitsubishi Bank retreated Y20 to Y2,760, Daiichi Kangyo Bank
Y10 to Y2,030 and Daiwa Bank Y20 to Y1,170.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 31.88 higher at 23,112.76, in volume of
36.0m shares.
Roundup
A STRONG end to the week's trading was recorded by several of the region's
markets yesterday.
SINGAPORE broke through the 1,900 barrier to close at its second successive
year's high helped by strong overseas interest. The Straits Times Industrial
index finished 19.18 higher at 1,905.34 in volume of 311.5m shares, a gain
of 2.4 per cent on the week.
Sembawang Shipyard was among the actives, the shares rising 70 cents to
SDollars 13.70 and the warrants 80 cents to SDollars 8.05.
TAIWAN saw a strong technical rebound after recent losses: the weighted
index closed up 146.15 at 4,356.10, a week's advance of 1.3 per cent.
Turnover was TDollars 27.3bn, up from TDollars 17.9bn.
The financial sector led the advance, gaining some 6 per cent, with the
important banks and Cathay Life rising by their daily limits.
AUSTRALIA remained firm as the price of gold continued to rise. The All
Ordinaries index ended up 11.3 at 1,760.4 and up 3.8 per cent on the week.
The gold index put on 80.1 or 4.2 per cent to 1,998.9, its highest since
July 22 1988, with Placer Pacific up 17 cents to ADollars 3.34 and Poseidon
Gold gaining 32 cents to ADollars 3.42.
HONG KONG, however, lost some momentum as confirmation of the reopening of
airport talks between China and Britain and the likely renewal of China's
Most Favoured Nation status by the US triggered profit-taking. The Hang Seng
index shed 49.33 to 7,397.91, a gain of 3.2 per cent on the week.
Property groups were affected, with Cheung Kong and Sun Hung Kai Properties
falling 50 cents each to HKDollars 28 and HKDollars 39.50 respectively.
NEW ZEALAND closed at another record high although turnover dropped to
NZDollars 27m from Thursday's NZDollars 33m. The NZSE-40 index rose 7.72 to
1,650.16, up 2 per cent on the week. Brokers said that the rally had been
driven by Fletcher Challenge, up 3 cents at NZDollars 2.77.
MANILA fell sharply as many foreign investors took profits. The composite
index shed 11.58 to 1,597.45 but remained 1.6 per cent ahead on the week.
Turnover was 382m pesos.
BOMBAY fell for the fifth consecutive session, the BSE index closing down
50.38 at 2,165.58.

FT  29 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan weakens ahead of results
from Montedison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Market Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY was moderate yesterday as markets wound down ahead of the long
weekend, writes Our Market Staff.
MILAN waited for the Montedison and Ferruzzi results, which were due out
after the close of trading. However, with many analysts expecting
substantial losses from the former - confirmed after the session had ended -
the Consob suspended dealings in Montedison shares in after hours trading.
The shares fixed L45 lower at L1,330.
The Comit index closed off 1.36 at 539.45, 3.4 per cent lower on the week.
In its latest survey of Italian equities Kleinwort Benson comments that with
Mr Carlo Ciampi now installed as prime minister 'the government could well
deliver what the market is asking for: a tough 1994 budget, a favourable
wage agreement, a clear electoral reform and a successful kick-off to the
long awaited privatisations'.
After the close Ferruzzi announced that it would open up its capital to
outside participants. Its shares fell L11 to L1,063.
The nervousness in Fiat, which has hung over the shares all week, continued
with investors expecting a cut in the dividend when it announces its results
on Monday. The shares closed down L245 at L5,860 before gaining slightly on
the kerb to L5,875.
Among the day's gainers, Stet attracted interest with a rise of L55 to
L3,076, improving to L3,113 after hours.
PARIS lost ground in technical trading and some profit-taking ahead of the
long weekend.
The CAC-40 index lost 15.89 to 1,888.70, up 1.5 per cent on the week.
Turnover of some FFr5bn was swollen by the expiry of futures and options.
The automotive sector remained under pressure after further gloomy news on
European car sales: Peugeot slipped FFr8 to FFr531 and Michelin FFr8.40 to
FFr137.60.
Elsewhere Elf Aquitaine lost FFr1.70 to FFr374.50 following a disappointing
profits forecast on Thursday.
MADRID lost the better part of this week's gains on profit-taking and
futures related selling, the general index ending 3.81 lower at 258.77, up 1
per cent on the week, in turnover of Pta20bn.
All sectors fell, Argentaria losing Pta160 to Pta4,605 in banks, and Repsol
Pta50 to Pta3,245.
AMSTERDAM subsided as recession fears increased, reflecting the lower dollar
and a worse than expected fall in first quarter GDP. The CBS Tendency index
fell 1.3 to 105.2, 0.7 per cent up on the week.
ZURICH held its own against the lower dollar, the SMI index closing 2.6
higher at 2,270.7, 1.7 per cent higher on the week. The watchmaker, SMH,
extended its gains, up another SFr40 at SFr1,990 on buying from Geneva.
STOCKHOLM fell after the release of a larger than expected loss by
Trelleborg, the mining group. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 1.2 to
1,097.0, up 0.45 per cent on the week.
Trelleborg fell SKr3.00 to SKr51.50 after reporting a pre-tax loss of some
SKr427m in four months to April.
LISBON continued its upward career, the BTA index putting on 57.5 to a new
1993 high of 1.994.8 at 1 pm for a gain on the week of 7.4 per cent. Among
the features was a 46 per cent gain in Lisnave, the world's largest ship
repair company, which put restructuring proposals to the government
yesterday.
ISTANBUL soared 3.45 per cent to a new record high, the 75-share market
index gaining 279.68 to 8,375.75. Turnover was TL800bn.
Brokers said that a rally had been expected before next week's holiday as
buyers could take advantage of a 10-day delay in settlements.

FT  29 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug stocks pull the market down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDER consideration of the appointment of a new chancellor of the exchequer
in the UK appeared to do nothing to shake the view of the London stock
market that little immediate change in domestic economic policy is likely.
There was no shift in market forecasts by the leading securities houses,
although one commented that, 'Mr Lamont's memoirs should make interesting
reading, especially if he publishes very shortly.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, is expected to meet his test later
this year when his budget will show whether he has been tough enough on
public spending. Long-dated government bonds fell by nearly a full point
yesterday, but market strategists maintained that it was much too soon to
regard this as a judgement on the government re-shuffle. An extremely poor
opinion poll showing by the Conservative party in its southern England
heartland reinforced the political pressures on the government.
The equity market, however, continued to react to Wall Street, which fell
sharply yesterday as it moved into its new session with a loss of 25 points
on the Dow Average. The London market, which had been moving narrowly during
the early part of the session, extended its losses later.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,840.7, down 14.6. Lack of support
also hit the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which lost a further 4.2 to 3,165.4. But
trading volume was generally unimpressive. Seaq volume dipped to 577.3m
shares from Thursday's 660.5m, with non-Footsie business providing about 66
per cent. Retail business worth Pounds 1.37bn in the previous session
confirmed the recovery in genuine customer investment interest.
The rally in brewery and consumer stocks seen on Thursday was reversed
yesterday. Pharmaceutical stocks ran into pressure on renewed worries over
the Clinton administration's healthcare policies. The final day of trading
in its present shape of ICI, Britain's blue chip chemical group, passed
ingloriously.
Over the week, the first leg of the two week trading account in equities,
the FT-SE Index has gained 28.5 points or about 1 per cent. Although doubts
on the progress of the recovery in the domestic economy have continued, UK
equities have benefited from Wall Street's progress to new peaks - hence
London's unhappiness when the Dow opened on the downside yesterday.

FT  29 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hartstone warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers demolished the Hartstone share price after the company, involved in
leathergoods and hosiery, shocked the market by issuing another profits
warning, the second in three months.
It accompanied the warning with news that it had breached banking covenants
in its existing lending agreements and that the chairman and chief executive
had relinquished his responsibilities.
Hartstone shares, which traded as high as 277p earlier this year, plunged to
32p before closing 57 down at 34p with around the market suggesting that
many speculators, gambling on takeover rumours in recent weeks, have been
badly burned. Turnover in Hartstone reached a hefty 13m shares.
The market's latest newcomer, RPC Group, the packaging company put on a
sparkling debut. Against a placing price of 125p, the shares raced up to
close at 159p with 16m shares changing hands.
This week's switching out of the oil majors, BP and Shell, and into British
Gas proved a short-lived affair, with the last-named losing almost all of
Thursday's rise and closing 3 1/2 down at 290 1/2 p. One specialist said:
'Contrary to rumours in the traded options market earlier in the week, it
was becoming increasingly obvious that the Monopolies Commission will open
up the domestic gas sector to independent competition and that this will
probably result in severe downward pressure on gas's earnings in the medium
term.'
BP eased 3 to 307 1/2 p despite stories that the Cusiana oil field in
Colombia may be officially declared commercial within a few days. Shell fell
6 1/2 to 605p, with Goldman Sachs, the influential US investment bank, a big
seller.
The increase in the Lasmo's US bond issue, which dealers said showed the
large appetite of the US lending institutions for oil stocks, saw the shares
hold at 153p and probably underpinned its membership of the FT-SE 100 Index,
at least until the next quarterly meeting of the FT-SE Steering Committee,
on June 9.
A positive AGM statement from Tesco left the shares 1 1/2 up at 222p in good
volume of 5m. The shares have been strong all week on anticipation of better
news, which duly showed in yesterday's statement in the form of sales
running more than 9 per cent higher than last year. Like-for-like sales,
after stripping out the effect of new store openings, were said to be up 1.5
per cent in the first three months of its new financial year. Chairman Sir
Ian MacLaurin said: 'There are signs this year that our performance is
improving against the opposition.'
Hotel group Forte, which announced a 90.5 per cent take-up of its enhanced
scrip dividend offer, gained 2 to 194p. Savoy Group climbed 20 to 775p.
Forte refused to confirm press rumours that it has appointed a former Savoy
executive to its management team.
Guinness continued to be the focus of attention in the drinks sector as the
group followed up its AGM this week with a series of presentations. The
shares have been flat performers in recent months, hemmed in by weak
overseas markets, particularly in whisky, and worries over its brands. While
some drinks analysts believe the bad news is now in the shares, there is
little support for any short-term change in sentiment. Yesterday, the stock
slipped 9 to 466p.
Shares in Mosaic Investments, suspended last September at 60p, were relisted
following approval from shareholders for its re-organisation proposals.
However, dealers remain cautious and the shares promptly dived 41 to close
at 19p. Further weakness in English China Clays raised fears that the stock
may lose its FT-SE 100 status. The shares gave up another 8 to 414p.
McKechnie added 8 to 418p with BZW said to have been recommending the stock.
The list of stocks trading against the market trend included Lex Service,
where the shares jumped 11 to 341p, after Smith New Court upgraded profit
expectations and turned a buyer of the stock.
Smith increased the current year forecast by Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 37.5m and
the following year's figure by Pounds 2.1m, saying: 'Lex's change of policy
to increase the sale of used cars is going to result in improved margins.'
Suggestions that the weakness in GKN's German market, one of its most
lucrative, may after all not be as bad as had been feared, together with a
trading squeeze, saw the company's shares put on 9 to 457p.
Whispers of an impending order saw British Aerospace move 10 ahead to 339p,
in trade of 1.8m. Sentiment was further assisted by a Paribas
recommendation.

FT  29 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug stocks hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some hefty falls in the prices of US pharmaceuticals stocks on Wall Street
on Thursday evening, and renewed weakness in US markets when they opened
yesterday, brought keen downside pressure in London on the big UK drug
stocks.
The US drug sector, along with international drug stocks, fell back as
investors reacted to renewed fears that the Clinton administration may
instigate a series of reforms in the US healthcare system, including a
closer scrutiny of profit margins in the drugs industry.
Wellcome, particularly, suffered badly, closing a net 23 off at 721p, only
marginally above the day's low point. Glaxo fell away to 604p but later
rallied to end a busy session only 3 off at 609p, after good turnover of
3.7m. BOC was another stock to come under fire after the latest bout of
nervousness triggered by the US worries, the shares slipping 9 to 658p.
Pharmaceuticals specialists said the big underperformance of UK drug stocks
so far this year - the FT-SE Actuaries Health and Household sub-sector has
fallen about 17 per cent while the FT-SE 100 is marginally higher - was
triggered by worries about the Clinton approach to the healthcare business.

THE extraordinary general meeting of ICI shareholders, called to vote on the
Zeneca demerger, duly nodded through the break up of the old ICI company,
albeit in the face of dissent by some shareholders, but was accompanied by a
fresh bout of weakness across all classes of ICI/Zeneca shares.
In their last trading session before the demerger ICI 'old' shares fell 11
more to 1244p, after turnover of 2.2m. and the 'new' a further 6 to 608p,
after 605p, on 1.9m traded. Zeneca, ex-rights, lost 8 to 632p and the
nil-paid 7 to 37p.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Fall in Euromarks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in German interest rate markets yesterday took the view that the
Bundesbank would keep monetary policy tight for some time, following a
succession of hawkish comments from the central bank's council members,
writes James Blitz.
A common theme of trading in all money markets in the last five days has
been the growing belief that Germany will put its interest rate cutting on
hold because of fears that the D-Mark could weaken.
That caution on policy was underlined very strongly yesterday as three more
council members voiced fears about renewed growth in German monetary supply.
The 3 regional central bank presidents, all speaking separately, expressed
concern about the deteriorating fiscal health of the state and federal
governments because of the economic slowdown.
'What this means is that the external pressure to lower interest rates has
gone and the Bundesbank is concerning itself with domestic issues,' said one
London-based money market dealer.
The comments triggered a strong fall in Euromark futures yesterday in
remarkably heavy trading. The September contract was at one stage 25 basis
points lower from its opening level, at 93.21. It later recovered to close
at 93.23 with nearly 80,000 lots traded on the day.
At this level, the market is pricing 3-month D-Mark interest rates at 6.79
per cent, 70 basis points below yesterday's cash level.
French franc futures were also lower in the wake of the German move,
although by a smaller margin. The September contract dropped 8 basis points
to close at 93.06.
In sterling markets, dealers remained uncertain whether Mr Kenneth Clarke's
appointment as UK chancellor would increase the prospects of another cut in
UK base rates this year.
The September short sterling contract was more-or less unchanged yesterday
at 94.14, while the June contract was 2 basis points higher at 94.06.
According to one sterling dealer, the market is unsure what Mr Clarke stands
for. 'He has never worked in the Treasury before,' he said.
Three-month sterling cash closed yesterday  1/16 per cent softer at around 5
7/8 per cent. There was a Pounds 2bn shortage, which was easily despatched
with no late assistance.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Changing views on the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR weakened sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, falling through
the DM1.59 level, after a huge downward revision of first quarter US growth
raised serious concerns about the scale of the economic recovery in the US,
writes James Blitz.
A downward revision of the GDP figures for the first three months of 1993
had been expected after a spate of poor indicators in recent weeks. But the
scale of the revision, down to 0.9 per cent from a provisional 1.8 per cent,
was far larger than anticipated.
This alone would have suppressed the dollar against a D-Mark and yen that
have been resurgent this week. But the weakness was compounded by a
succession of comments from Bundesbank council members, underlining that
monetary growth in Germany may put the country's rate-cutting on hold for
several weeks.
The comments, from regional central bank governors, underlined that April
monetary growth had been very worrying and that next month's figures were
expected to be no better.
The combination of these factors had three effects on the market yesterday.
First, they pushed the dollar down 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day to a close of
DM1.5870, as dealers took the view that the short term interest rate
differential between both currencies might not narrow soon.
Second, the dollar's weakness put more pressure on its exchange rate against
the yen, triggering two more rounds of central bank intervention from the
Federal Reserve. The dollar still closed weaker in Europe, at Y107.20 from a
previous Y107.80.
Third, the comments from the regional governors triggered more flows of
funds into the D-Mark in the ERM, pushing the peseta below its central rate
against the German currency for the second day running: the Spanish currency
closed at Pta79.10 from a previous Pta78.83.
The French franc also weakened again, to close at FFr3.377 from a previous
FFr3.371. The German currency closed 3 pfennigs stronger, at DM2.4775,
against a pound that looked rudderless in the wake of the UK's cabinet
reshuffle.
Mr Jim O'Neill of Swiss Banking Corporation has long believed the dollar
could soon revisit its historic low against the German currency of DM1.3860
set last year.
Yesterday, Mr Neil MacKinnon, head of research at Citibank, took the same
view. 'We should expect the dollar to outperform the D-Mark in the longer
term because of German weakness,' he said. 'But if DM1.55 breaks, there is
effectively a black hole on the other side and there is a risk of
significant weakness.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzis to loosen grip on
family company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI, Italy's second largest industrial grouping, yesterday decided to
seek outside shareholders to offset mounting losses, reduce borrowings and
concentrate on a core of agro-business.
The move, aimed at ending the Ferruzzi family's tight hold on the group,
marks an important milestone in Italian corporate history as pressure mounts
on family-controlled companies to modernise managements and broaden capital
bases. The group is controlled through Serafino Ferruzzi. This is owned by
Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, chairman and sole son of the group's founder, and two
sisters, Alessandra and Franca.
A third sister, Idina, ceased to be a shareholder in July, 1991, following
the highly-publicised departure of her husband, Mr Raul Gardini, from the
group's helm.
Ferruzzi's aggressive expansion in the 1980s was largely due to Mr Gardini.
He is now blamed for the high gearing behind much of the group's problems.
Yesterday it was announced that new shareholders, local and foreign, would
be sought in Serafino. Through Serafino, Ferruzzi has a 45 per cent stake in
the stock market-listed Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) which controls
Montedison, the food to chemicals group.
Ferfin yesterday revealed a L1,519bn consolidated net loss for 1992, against
a L115bn profit in 1991. Turnover rose 12 per cent to L19,900bn from
17,800bn. The figures were after financial charges of L1,644bn, up from
L935bn.
Net financial indebtedness of the group rose 72 per cent to L15,120bn from
L8,800bn.
Ferfin blamed non-operating companies' performance as largely 'the principal
cause of the fall in the group's results.'
Ferfin said it wouldn't declare any dividend. In 1991, it paid a dividend of
L45 per ordinary share and L75 per savings share.
Montedison is itself heavily in the red. It reported yesterday a 1992 loss
of L1,244bn (Dollars 841.67m) against a profit of L168bn in 1991. Gross
turnover last year was 8 per cent higher at L16,968bn.
The group has just sold its pharmaceutical interests, bringing in L1,900bn,
and is now awaiting the outcome of a deal with Shell to reorganise and
reduce its plastics business through its Himont subsidiary.

FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Outokumpu plans FM527m rights
issue

<TEXT>
OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday announced plans to
raise FM527m (Dollars 96m) through a one-for-five rights issue at FM33 a
share.
The proceeds will be used to strengthen the company's balance sheet and help
fund a FM1.8bn scheme to expand copper and nickel production at the group's
Harjavalta plant over the next three years.
The Finnish state, which is the group's main shareholder with a 57.5 per
cent direct stake, has already agreed to support the issue.
Skopbank, the third largest Finnish commercial bank, cut its losses sharply
in the first four months, but warned of worse figures later in the year. It
said it would need further state support.
The bank's operating loss for the January-April period fell to FM501m from
FM1.38bn, as credit losses halved to FM526m from FM1.01bn.
However, the bank predicted that operating losses for the full year would
amount to FM2.1bn as credit losses reached FM1.8bn. It said it would need a
further FM700-800m from the state this year, in addition to a FM700m
injection announced last week, to help it keep its capital adequacy ratio
above 8 per cent.
At the end of April, the bank's capital adequacy stood at 8.6 per cent,
compared to 8.2 per cent at the end of 1992, when it made a FM3.46bn
operating loss.

JARDINE Matheson's quest to insulate itself from possible interference by
China after Hong Kong reverts to the mainland in 1997 took a bizarre turn
yesterday. The company said the government of Bermuda had agreed to pass a
law which would bring it under a statutory version of the London Takeover
Code.
Jardine, a Hong Kong-based trading group controlled by the Keswick family,
moved its domicile to Bermuda in 1984 and has been given a legal status
there by acts of the colony's legislature. The proposed changes would mean
that Jardine is subject to the same regulatory framework as a company
incorporated in the UK.
The company has long feared that after 1997 it could have its property
confiscated by administrative means, as happened in Shanghai after the
communist takeover of China in 1949.
It has recently been subject to attacks by the Chinese government for its
alleged interference in Hong Kong politics. Nearly two years ago it
unsuccessfully sought to avoid Hong Kong's takeover code by moving its
primary stock exchange listing to London.
Mr Greg Terry, an executive director, said yesterday's announcement had
nothing to do with China's attacks on the company, but represented a further
step in a process that had been under way for some time. The company would
be subject to a more stringent regime of regulation, he said.
It is understood that Jardine informed representatives of the Chinese
government of the planned changes this week.
In Bermuda, the statutory version of the Takeover Code, which comes into
force in July next year, will apply only to Jardine and its subsidiaries. It
will be administered by Bermuda's Monetary Authority, which will convene a
panel in the event Jardine is subject to a takeover bid or makes one itself.
Jardine said it continued to be bound by Hong Kong's takeover code, but that
it intended to discuss the implications of the change in Bermudan law with
regulatory authorities in Hong Kong.
The Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, said:
'If Jardine were to seek exemption from our code, our overriding
consideration would be the protection of investors and Hong Kong's
credibility as an international financial centre.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Power Corporation takes holding
in Time Warner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Power Corporation has bought a small stake in Time Warner, the US
entertainment group, reinforcing signals that the company is seeking a role
in international communications.
Power's purchase of a 1 per cent stake in Time Warner, for USDollars 99m,
was disclosed in documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission by Seagram, the drinks group which revealed this week it had
built up a 5.7 per cent interest in Time Warner.
The Seagram and Power investments are bound to heighten the speculation
which has swirled around Time Warner since the death of its chairman, Mr
Steven Ross, in December.
Seagram insisted yesterday the purchases by the two Montreal-based companies
took place independently, and were 'not part of any co-ordinated strategy'.
A Power official declined to comment.
Seagram has indicated it plans to lift its investment in Time Warner to 15
per cent to fulfil a long search for a 'third leg' to complement its drinks
business and its 24 per cent stake in EI Du Pont, the US chemicals group.
Seagram and Power have a number of links with each other. Mr Paul Desmarais,
Power's chairman and controlling shareholder, sits on the Seagram board,
while Mr Charles Bronfman, whose family controls Seagram, is a Power
director.
Mr Desmarais, together with unidentified European investors, last year
sought to interest Seagram in a joint investment in Time Warner's
entertainment division. Power, which has access to cash resources of about
CDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 1.96m) is also thought to have considered a much
bigger investment in the Time Warner parent last autumn.
A Seagram official, however, said these discussions were 'very brief and
fleeting'. He said Mr Desmarais absented himself from deliberations by
Seagram's board on the Time Warner investment.
Power already owns a number of Canadian newspapers and radio and TV
stations. Through its affiliate, Pargesa, the Geneva-based merchant bank, it
also jointly controls Radio-Television Luxembourg.
Two months ago, Power paid CDollars 180m for an 18.7 per cent stake in
Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper publisher. Power also has substantial
interests in financial services in north America and Europe.

FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Standa net ahead 23% for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDA, the big Italian retailing chain controlled by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
Fininvest concern, raised net group profits by 22.9 per cent, to L38.1bn
(Dollars 25.77m), last year. The improvement came on the back of a 9.2 per
cent rise in sales to L4,398bn.
The increase in revenues matches that at Rinascente, Italy's biggest
retailer, controlled by Fiat. It corroborates analysts' forecasts that the
two big retailers have been gaining ground in the recession at the expense
of small family outlets. Moreover, Standa's increase is based on a
broadly-unchanged number of outlets.
The improvement has continued into this year, with a 9.5 per cent rise in
group sales in the first quarter, it said. In January, Standa bought 60 per
cent of the regional Essebi supermarkets chain for L220bn, payable over
three years.
Consolidating Essebi, in which Standa has an option to buy the remaining 40
per cent for L75bn this year, will push up group turnover to about L5,000bn
this year - within sight of Rinascente's market leadership.
The company is paying an unchanged dividend of L300 a share on ordinary
shares and L330 on savings stock.
The earnings recovery follows aggressive marketing and continuing
restructuring to lower costs. At operating level, profits soared to L68.2bn
from L27.6bn.
The earnings rise after tax was depressed by higher taxation and
extraordinary items, including about L15bn in restructuring costs.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Platinum takes a cue from
gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF the froth from the gold rally has blown over into the platinum
market this week.
Yesterday on the London bullion market platinum at one stage traded above
Dollars 400 a troy ounce, before finishing at Dollars 396.75, up Dollars
6.50 on the day and Dollars 12 on the week and the highest level for more
than two years.
This left platinum at a premium to gold of Dollars 17 a troy ounce, compared
with only Dollars 9.60 at the end of last week.
'The widening of the platinum to gold spread to around Dollars 20 was
confirmation that it was safe to keep buying gold at the current levels,'
said Mr Andy Smith, analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland. He added that
the weakness of the US dollar against the yen had encouraged the market to
believe that the Japanese would seize the opportunity to buy platinum.
The gold price has been led this week by New York's Comex, where fund and
option activity has kept things on the boil. In London yesterday the price
retreated from the day's high of Dollars 383.50 a troy ounce after US funds
liquidated long positions ahead of the holiday weekend.
Gold closed at Dollars 379.75 a troy ounce, Dollars 3.05 up on the day and
Dollars 4.60 on the week after a jittery few days.
Mr Smith pointed out that at current levels Hong Kong gold, normally at a
premium of 50 cents to Dollars 1 to London, had moved to a discount,
reflecting weaker demand in the Far East.
However, GNI, the London futures broker, says in its June futures and
options briefing that a tight physical market has made gold ultra-sensitive
to any pick-up in investment demand. In three of the past four years the
mined supply of gold has fallen short of fabrication demand.
Western investors have piled into gold because they believe they have little
to lose, GNI says. Gold's perceived floor at Dollars 330 a troy ounce
provided limited risk on the downside, while low interest rates in nominal
and real terms was minimising the income foregone from investing in precious
metals.
On the London Metal Exchange copper has been volatile, but with good volume
and good two-way interest driving the moves. On Monday three-month metal
bounced off Dollars 1,820 a tonne, leading to an attempt on Tuesday on
resistance at Dollars 1,850. But profit taking took prices back down on
Wednesday, and on Thursday the price was back below Dollars 1,800.
Mr William Adams, analyst with Rudolf Wolff, said copper was trading in a
broad range between a recent low of Dollars 1,705 on May 7, and Dollars
1,885 on May 13. It needed to remain above Dollars 1,760 for a further
attempt on the upside.
The continuing increase in LME warehouse stocks is keeping the market under
pressure. Copper stocks rose by 725 tonnes on Monday and a further 6,000
tonnes on Thursday and now stand at a record 420,400 tonnes.
Yesterday three-month copper closed at Dollars 1,795 a tonne. Cash copper -
still traded in sterling on the LME - closed at Pounds 1,146.50 a tonne,
down Pounds 37.50 on the week.
The pressure on copper has spilled over to most of the other base metals,
although lead and aluminium have been steadier.
Lead, which was at a 6 3/4 -year low last week, was boosted on Monday by
news that Metaleurop was stopping production at smelters in France and
Germany between June 15 and August 15, cutting refined output by 50,000
tonnes. Prices moved sharply ahead, but have since drifted lower. Cash lead
closed at Pounds 258.50 a tonne yesterday, up Pounds 2.75 in the week.
The aluminium market is keeping a close eye on negotiations at Reynolds and
Alcoa, where labour contracts expire at the end of the month and the unions
have a mandate for strike action. Cash aluminium closed yesterday at Dollars
1,128 a tonne, just Dollars 8 up on the week.
Tin prices, already on a downward path, were not helped by Malaysian
suggestions that the quota system of the Association of Tin Producing
Countries was not worth maintaining. Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's primary
industries minister, said on Thursday that prices could not be any worse
than present levels even if the quota system was abandoned. Cash tin closed
at Dollars 5,303.50 a tonne yesterday, down Dollars 146.50 on the week.
The failure of the International Coffee Organisation in March to renegotiate
an agreement has kept world prices near historic lows. This week producing
countries started to take matters into their own hands.
Late on Monday Brazil and Colombia, the two largest producers, agreed to
freeze stocks and limit exports respectively to 17m bags and 13m bags (60
kgs each). At the same time Central American producers - Costa Rica,
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala - agreed to withhold 15 per cent of
their production for 1993-94.
Together these countries account for about 60 per cent of world coffee
production. They look set to form a Latin American alliance which other
countries could join. Ecuador has already shown interest, and the
Inter-African Coffee Organisation has expressed strong support.
However, the markets appear more concerned with the high level of consumer
stocks, which some estimates put as high as 20m bags. The London July
robusta coffee contract closed yesterday at Dollars 920 a tonne, down
Dollars 27 on the week.

FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Malaya launches expansion plan with deals
worth Pounds 2.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYA GROUP, the USM-quoted motor dealership company, yesterday unveiled an
ambitious expansion plan which, it claims, could revolutionise the outlet
system for vehicle sales in the UK.
Announcing a Pounds 1.5m acquisition of Sands of Burnham, one of Britain's
largest Citroen dealers, Malaya said it was the first step in a five-year
strategy aimed at establishing a network of 55 dealerships around the
country.
Unlike traditional dealer networks, usually tied to one make of car, Malaya
plans to take advantage of the relaxation of franchising rules to stock
vehicles from every leading motor manufacturer.
The network, designed to be an umbrella group for independent dealers, will
allow some outlets to remain dedicated to one make, while others will be
multi-franchise. As a whole, the network aims to encompass all makes.
Mr Nick Lancaster, who built up the Lancaster dealership group and last year
took control of Malaya, said the expansion would be financed through
borrowing and a stock placing and open offer to shareholders.
The first part of the scheme - the acquisition of Sands and a separate
Pounds 1.18m dealership site at Bow, east London - depended on raising
Pounds 9.6m from a placing due to be completed by June 25, he said.
Malaya has agreed to pay Pounds 1.2m in cash for Sands, with additional
finance raised through the issue of 1.2m new ordinary shares at 25p each.
Albert E Sharp, which is underwriting the issue, said all the shares had
been placed and up to 25 institutional investors were expected to take part.
'After the cash considerations for the Sands and Bow acquisitions, the
balance of Pounds 7.2m will provide for the increased working capital of the
enlarged group and for further acquisitions,' the directors said.
The company aims to open 17 dealerships in London and the M25 corridor over
the next 18 months and has set its sights on further outlets in Birmingham,
Manchester, Leeds, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Although UK new car sales faltered last month with sales 1.9 per cent down
on April 1992, Mr Lancaster forecast strengthening demand and a sharp
turnround in profits.

FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: TR Property to refocus on quoted stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TR PROPERTY Investment Trust, which invests in commercial property and
property shares, yesterday announced a fall in net asset value from 30.71p
to 28.78p per share for the year to end-March.
The sharp fall took place in the first half of the year; in the second half
they rose by 13.7 per cent from 25.3p.
The performance reflects the continued decline of property values, tempered
by the sharp increase in property share prices since sterling left the
exchange rate mechanism last September.
The trust is aiming to build up the proportion of quoted stocks in its
portfolio and reduce its holdings of direct property.
Mr Peter Duffy, director and manager, said the trust would increase its
holdings of medium-sized companies, which he expected to outperform the
larger companies in the sector.
The trust's total revenue rose by 71 per cent to Pounds 8.48m (Pounds
4.96m), reflecting a reduction in the provisions against trading stock. Net
revenue, after tax of Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 488,000) rose from Pounds 822,000
to Pounds 2.71m.
Earnings per share rose from 0.28p to 0.95p while a proposed final dividend
of 0.5p (0.85p) leaves the total down from 1.45p to 0.9p for the full year.

FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: William Cook blames US for fall to Pounds
3.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM COOK, the Sheffield-based steel castings group, yesterday blamed a
slide in profits on trading losses of more than Pounds 1.5m at its US
subsidiary.
Pre-tax profits in the 12 months to March 27 fell from Pounds 4.76m to
Pounds 3.85m on sales down 10 per cent at Pounds 100.5m (Pounds 111.2m).
Mr Andrew Cook, chairman and chief executive, said poor sales at the
Unitcast plant in Toledo, Ohio, had undermined the performance. Losses on
disposal of the US business, sold to its management last December for the
nominal sum of Dollars 10, were Pounds 4.7m excluding goodwill. A further
Pounds 3.2m was written off to reserves in attributable goodwill.
Pre-tax profits benefited from lower exceptional charges of Pounds 1.72m
(Pounds 3.31m) and net interest costs of Pounds 2.31m (Pounds 2.89m).
Sales in the US fell 62 per cent to Pounds 4.57m (Pounds 12.1m), while
turnover in the UK declined by only 3 per cent to Pounds 95.9m (Pounds
99.1m) and produced a trading profit of Pounds 9.47m (Pounds 11.5m).
Earnings per share fell from 15.03p to 11.74p. The proposed final dividend
is cut from 5p to 3.5p making a halved total for the year of 5p.
'Manufacturing in the US was a disaster,' Mr Cook said. 'But it remains our
strongest export market and we are determined to go on trading there.'
Expressing optimism over the group's domestic performance, Mr Cook said
order books were being held at 'tolerable' levels and borrowings had fallen.
'Year-end gearing, even after adjusting net worth for the US write-off, was
under 60 per cent,' he added.

AT A low key extraordinary meeting yesterday, shareholders of Britain's
biggest manufacturer, Imperial Chemical Industries, voted to dismantle the
company.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, defended the decision to spin off the
bioscience division, Zeneca, as well as the way the demerger was handled.
The meeting was attended by only about 300 people, and the giant ballroom at
Grosvenor House was abandoned for a smaller location at the hotel. It was
far from clear how many were shareholders and how many came from the legion
of advisers and lawyers associated with the deal.
Most criticisms of the demerger came from pensioners and individual
shareholders. Some opposed the break-up of a company 67 years in the making.
One shareholder described the meeting as the most historic in the company's
history. Others criticised the amount paid to advisers and directors.
When asked whether the two companies would be vulnerable to a hostile
takeover, Sir Denys said the board had decided against poison-pills.
'The two companies will have to perform, helped by cost reductions and
strategic positioning. That is the best assurance I can give,' he said.
The debate, however, was academic. Sir Denys informed the shareholders that
of the 236m proxy votes cast 235m were in favour. The motion was carried
with only about 30 people voting against.
Zeneca shares will be listed on the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday, when
dealing is expected to start.
Shares in Imperial Chemical Industries ended the last day in their current
form down 11p at Pounds 12.44. On the grey market Zeneca when-issued shares
closed down 8p at 632p ex-rights. Zeneca nil-paid rights ended 7p lower at
37p.

FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone warns on profits again - Market
value falls by Pounds 58m as negotiations begin with bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Hartstone Group was yesterday locked in negotiations with
bankers as the group issued its second profits warning in less than three
months.
The news sent the shares crashing from 91p to 34p, wiping Pounds 58m off the
group's market value of Pounds 92.9m. The shares have fallen steadily from a
high in March of 272p.
They were depressed by the announcement early in March of unexpected
restructuring provisions totalling Pounds 8.5m and a profits warning.
Analysts at that time downgraded their 1993 forecasts from Pounds 36m to
Pounds 23m.
Yesterday Hartstone announced that the provisions would actually total
Pounds 12m, while profits after exceptionals were not expected to be less
than Pounds 9m. The final dividend, which in March the group had promised
would be increased, will now not be paid.
The company denied that the larger provisions were the result of any one
problem.
The Stock Exchange said it had been monitoring the situation for some time.
Yesterday's announcement is believed to have made a suspension of the shares
unlikely.
Mr Stephen Barker, who built the company into Europe's third-largest hosiery
group and who holds 2 per cent of the company, is to resign as chairman and
chief executive with immediate effect. He will remain on the board.
Hartstone announced his departure and the profits warning after an all-night
meeting with its financial advisers.
Mr Shaun Dowling, the non-executive director earlier this month promoted to
deputy chairman, becomes executive chairman. A new chief executive, and
finance director to replace Mr David Grattan, were being sought.
The group's difficulties appear to stem from the deepening recession in
Europe, where Hartstone built up a sizeable hosiery business through the
Pounds 82m acquisition of two companies in 1991.
Analysts speculated that Hartstone was labouring under heavy stock and debt
burdens. At the end of 1992, Hartstone was already carrying stock of Pounds
85.7m, largely due to the acquisition of the European hosiery groups, a
little more than a third of the value of its total sales of Pounds 237.8m.
The recession in continental Europe, however, is expected to have made
matters worse. Hartstone suffered a sharp downturn in trading in the final
quarter and is understood to have a serious cash flow problem.
The group has defaulted on Pounds 13.5m in deferred payments for
acquisitions, including Michael Stevens and Etienne Aigner, the leathergoods
groups based in the US, and Aznar Industrial, the Spanish lingerie group.
Net debt, which at the interim stage was Pounds 67m, is estimated to have
risen to more than Pounds 90m. Gearing is expected to be more than 100 per
cent.
Hartstone said yesterday that it had breached at least one banking covenants
calling for 2.5 times interest cover. Interest charges at the half-way stage
had risen from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 3.3m.

FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Mosaic shares drop to 19p as trading
resumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Mosaic Invest-ments, the Birmingham-based mini-conglomerate which
has been reorganising its business and finances for the last nine months,
fell by two-thirds to 19p when they resumed trading yesterday.
The shares were suspended on September 29 last year at 60p after the group
had failed to raise finance for the redemption of preference shares and had
to pass a dividend it had already announced.
Since then Mr Hugh Sykes, chairman and company doctor, has been putting
together the complex restructuring and reorganisation package.
A sharp reduction in the share price had been expected following the
restructuring which included debt for equity swaps and lifted the number of
issued shares from 17.1m to 34.4m.
The restructuring, approved by shareholders at an extraordinary meeting
earlier this week, involved converting preference shares into ordinary
shares at the rate of 20p each. New banking facilities have been put in
place together with a number of board changes.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, who has been on Mosaic's
board since 1987 has now resigned as a non-executive director in view of his
other business commitments. He briefly acted as temporary chairman before Mr
Sykes was appointed and confirmed yesterday that he retains a 'not very
significant stake' in the group.

FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Gresham House talks continue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gresham House, the investment trust, saw its group negative asset value
increase from 18p to 105p per share over 1992.
However the net asset value per share for the core investment trust was
static at 61p, against 62p.
The pre-tax loss for the year fell from Pounds 8.87m to Pounds 3.47m. The
future of the company is still dependent on the ongoing refinancing talks,
which have been continuing for two years.
Mr Alfred Stirling, chairman, said that he was still hopeful that the
negotiations would be successful in the near future. He previously warned
that failure could be fatal.
Subject to the success of the talks, agreement has been reached on the
claims by EFT Finance, which have been subject to litigation, for an
aggregate sum of Pounds 850,000.

FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: New Devro chief to come from within
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVRO, the sausage casings producer which is shortly to be floated on the
Stock Exchange, has changed its mind on who to appoint as its chief
executive designate and is to pay Pounds 390,000 compensation to the man
originally offered the post.
Earlier this week, Devro's advisers confirmed that the company was to
appoint Mr David Fyfe, 50, who resigned last week as managing director of a
division of Hickson International, the specialty chemicals group.
But yesterday Devro said that institutions to whom it had been making
pre-flotation presentations had indicated a strong preference for an
internal candidate. Accordingly, it has decided to appoint as chief
executive Mr Graeme Alexander, 43, currently the company's technical
director.
Devro said that 'the process with Dr Fyfe has been discontinued by mutual
consent and compensation of Pounds 390,000 has been agreed.'
Mr Alexander will succeed Mr Frank De Angeli, 68, when he steps down later
this year. Devro said that the change would 'maintain the continuity of the
successful management team.'
Devro's public relations advisers said yesterday that there had been no
reassessment of Mr Fyfe's capabilities in the light of a statement last week
by Mr Dennis Kerrison, chairman of Hickson, that Mr Fyfe was unlikely to
reach board level at Hickson early.
The advisers said the question of Mr Fyfe and the Hickson board was related
to the way that board was structured, which is on the lines of a Continental
supervisory board.
Devro expects to produce the pathfinder prospectus for its listing in the
next few days. The flotation is expected to value the company at about
Pounds 170m.
Devro is one of the world's leading makers of collagen sausage casings, with
plants in Scotland, the US and Australia. It was acquired from Johnson &amp;
Johnson of the US in a Pounds 108m management buy-out in 1991 and last year
made an operating profit of Pounds 21.8m on turnover of Pounds 82.7m.

TDS Circuits, the USM-quoted maker of printed circuit boards, reduced its
pre-tax losses for the year to February 28 from Pounds 921,000 to Pounds
779,000, after an exceptional Pounds 85,000 for further reorganisation
costs.
Turnover improved slightly to Pounds 6.25m (Pounds 6.02m) 'against a
background of relentless price pressure in the PCB market.' Export sales now
represented more than half of this as a result of the continuing strategy to
internationalise.
Losses per share fell to 11.99p (13.57p).

In the half year to March 31 Kelsey Industries achieved a turnround from
pre-tax losses of Pounds 119,000 to profits of Pounds 32,000. For its last
full year to September 1992 losses were Pounds 307,000.
Turnover for the group, which makes solder and audio and video accessories
and has interests in industrial roofing and insulation contracting, grew
from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 22.8m.
Most of the solder companies had performed better, Mr Philip Arbib, the
chairman, said. Kelsey Roofing had a much improved order book and he
expected its losses to be eradicated by the year end.
Losses per share amounted to 2.7p (5.6p) and the interim dividend is cut to

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
East Surrey Holdings, the water, property and building supplies group,
lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.54m to Pounds 5.7m in the year to March
31.
Mr John Fooks, the chairman, said that on the water side the company
suffered a 7 per cent decline in metered consumption, mainly because of the
recession. In its non-regulated activities performance had been below
expectations because of the effects of a depressed economy.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 23.8m (Pounds 21.9m) with unmeasured water
supplies at Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 15.9m), measured water supplies at Pounds
5.37m (Pounds 5.26m) and other activities at Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 685,000).
The pre-tax result was after net interest payable of Pounds 1.01m (Pounds
982,000).
Earnings were little changed at 38.8p (38.7p). A proposed final dividend of
7.36p (6p) lifts the total to 11.46p (9.56p).

Cheam Group, the south of England water supplier, turned in a 38 per cent
pre-tax profits advance - from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.3m - over the 12
months to end-March.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up by Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 13.7m.
An improved final dividend of 7p (4p) is recommended, raising the total for
the year to 11p (7.5p). The dividend is more than three times covered by
earnings per share of 37.2p (26.6p).
Mr Andrew Kennedy, chairman, the improvement had been achieved in the face
of increasing industry regulation and in spite of a 1 per cent voluntary
abatement of the increase in water supply charges permitted by the
regulator.

FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Castings shows slight downturn to Pounds
4.37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASTINGS, the West Midlands based iron castings supplier, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits down slightly at Pounds 4.37m for the year ended
March compared with Pounds 4.46m in the previous period.
Turnover fell to Pounds 33.8m against Pounds 35.1m. The directors said that
'the year has been most unpredictable with a reasonable start, poor middle
and an improvement towards the end. We hope it will continue to improve to
the levels we enjoyed three years ago.'
They added that the brunt of the downturn was borne by the company's
Brownhills site.
The directors stated that it was 'most disappointing' to lose more than
Pounds 200,000 as a supplier to Leyland DAF, the commercial vehicle maker,
which collapsed in February.
The board proposes a final dividend of 3.05p (2.77p) giving a total for the
year of 4.35p (4.07p). Earnings per share were 14.3p (14.66p).

FT  29 MAY 93 / Poles apart but ready to do a deal: Despite Poland's
government crisis, the country is poised for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One vote decided the outcome of yesterday's no-confidence motion in the
Polish parliament. It was that of Mr Zbigniew Dyka, recently sacked as
justice minister in the coalition government led by Ms Hanna Suchocka. He
turned up too late to vote for the government of which his Christian
Nationalist party is a member.
In effect, the government crisis now facing Poland happened by mistake. The
minority government succumbed to the vote called by the Solidarity trade
union group in parliament despite clear signs that most of the 18 political
groups in the 460-seat Sejm, or lower house, neither wanted nor expected a
crisis.
But the no-confidence vote, which threatens to leave Poland without
effective government just as the first signs of economic recovery are
appearing, did not come from nowhere. It followed months of parliamentary
skirmishing both within the government coalition, which never enjoyed a
parliamentary majority, and between the government and a wide spectrum of
opposition parties.
The skirmishing came to a head over two main issues: the tight budget and
the government's ambitious privatisation programme.
The strategic aim of the most powerful members of the six-party coalition
government has been to run a budget capable of retaining the confidence of
the International Monetary Fund and foreign investors.
This forced Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the finance minister, into a series of
bruising encounters with the more populist or nationalist members of
parliament. Solidarity, in particular, took up the cudgels on behalf of the
main losers from the spending curbs - teachers, nurses, other public sector
employees, and farmers.
It was Solidarity which insisted that the budget be amended to provide
higher pay for teachers and nurses. The government argued that Poles must
accept fiscal stringency now to attract the capital needed to create
sustained economic growth. It refused to amend the budget, which received
the reluctant assent of parliament on February 12 and which set a ceiling on
this year's budget deficit of 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
The most the government would concede was a promise that it would allow a
small increase in salaries if the introduction of value-added tax in July
raised revenues above target.
Such tough policies have led to domestic strife for the government but have
helped transform Poland's external credit rating. A month after the budget
vote the International Monetary Fund approved a Dollars 660m standby
agreement. This will help Poland secure the full 50 per cent reduction of
its Dollars 33bn official debt. Under an agreement with the Paris Club of
official creditors in March 1991, Poland received debt reduction of 30 per
cent immediately and the promise of a further 20 per cent if it abided by
strict IMF performance criteria. In addition, the World Bank last month
agreed two new loan programmes worth Dollars 750m for agricultural reform
and bank restructuring.
Support from international institutions has helped reassure foreign
investors and set the scene for the most important task facing Poland - the
achievement of a debt reduction agreement with the London Club of commercial
bank creditors. Poland owes the banks Dollars 12.1bn in capital and
capitalised interest accumulated since Warsaw stopped servicing the debt in
1989. London Club talks with the banks are due to resume in Paris on June 8.
Yesterday's crisis underlines the urgency of reaching a similar 50 per cent
reduction agreement.
Paradoxically, the no-confidence vote could help Poland's debt negotiators,
as it highlights the difficulty of squeezing more money out of the budget
for up-front debt repayment as demanded by the banks. The likelihood is that
President Lech Walesa will seek to install a caretaker government to carry
on with debt negotiations and other administrative functions.
Poland's constitution places the initiative firmly in the president's hands.
At a cabinet meeting after yesterday's vote, President Walesa refused to
accept Ms Suchocka's resignation offer, leaving his options open. He can now
either ask Ms Suchocka or another politician to form a new government on the
basis of the present parliament, or run the risk of a political vacuum until
an election.
Ultimately he could opt to take over as head of a presidential government.
But this would saddle him with a responsibility he appears reluctant to
accept. He, or any other head of government, would be obliged to demand the
same economic sacrifices as Ms Suchocka.
At present, no combination of parties is likely to achieve an overall
majority in the current parliament. This might change, however, after an
election which would be fought under new electoral rules, approved by
parliament only hours after yesterday's no-confidence vote. The new rules
mean that parties with less than 5 per cent of the vote cannot be
represented in parliament. This is expected to reduce substantially the
number of parties and possibly lead to more stable coalitions.
Ms Suchocka, the 47-year-old Poznan lawyer close to the Solidarity movement,
has become the most popular politician in Poland. But the four years since
Poland became the first former Soviet bloc country to form a non-communist
government have also seen a recovery in the political fortunes of former
communists.
They are not in a position to form a government, as happened recently after
elections in Lithuania. But the formerly communist SLD has become the
largest single group in the Polish parliament. It helped the government push
its privatisation plan through last month and is gaining credibility in
business as well as political circles as a possible junior partner in a
future coalition.
This time the SLD voted as a bloc for the no-confidence motion. But this was
only after discreet talks with the Democratic Union about its terms for
abstaining. The Union is the former Solidarity mainstream party to which Ms
Suchocka belongs, and which formed the core of the outgoing government.
The latest crisis appears to bring closer the day when parties such as the
Democratic Union could join forces with the SLD, the self-declared social
democratic successors of the now dissolved communist party, or the former
communist peasant movement, the PSL.
But at this stage the most likely outcome is the formation of another shaky
coalition, probably led by Ms Suchocka. Continued instability will remove
any lingering illusions about the political and economic difficulty of
eastern European transformation. Poland has had its difficulties and made
its share of mistakes. But it is also poised for recovery and enjoys a
strong consensus on economic policy. It would be a mistake to overreact to
the latest act in its political drama.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Appliance of UK science: The lessons of this week's white
paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's science white paper follows in a long line of government policy
statements whose central theme has been the need to harness UK research more
effectively to wealth creation.
The reorganisation of the Office of Science and Technology will give
industry a bigger say in the way the government distributes its Pounds
1.2bn-a-year science budget. And the technique of 'technology foresight'
will be introduced to pick those areas of research that are most likely to
lead to winning products.
But the evidence suggests that the emphasis of the white paper - adapting
the science base to the needs of industry - should be the other way round.
The overwhelming priority is for industry to reform itself to make better
use of the excellent UK science base. Certainly, the success of the new
strategy will depend far more on the attitudes of industrialists than on
researchers or the government itself.
International comparisons continue to give a high rating to British science
across all subjects from clinical medicine to astrophysics. Its global
impact far exceeds what would be expected from the UK's 5 per cent share of
the world's research budget.
Analysis by the US Institute for Scientific Information shows that since
1981 UK spending on science has fallen sharply compared with other
industrialised countries, but the output has held up both in quantity and in
quality. And there has been no decline in the performance of physics and
engineering research compared with chemistry and the life sciences, to match
the changes in the pattern of British manufacturing such as the rise of
pharmaceuticals and decline of electronics.
In the field of optics and acoustics, for example, UK scientists published
58 per cent more papers during the period 1988-92 than in 1981-85 and their
influence - as measured by citations in other scientists' research - rose
from 21 per cent to 46 per cent above the world average. Southampton
University's opto-electronics research centre made a particularly important
discovery in 1987 - how to make optical fibres carry messages for thousands
of miles without loss - which Professor Alec Gambling, the director, says
will rank in importance with the invention of the transistor. It has already
been licensed by more than 30 users worldwide.
In short, British universities and research laboratories offer a healthy
flow of scientific expertise and new discoveries. But as Lord Flowers,
chairman of the House of Lords science committee and a former rector of
Imperial College, put it this week: 'Helping the horse to water will do
little for his health unless he can be persuaded to drink. British industry
must be induced to increase its commitment to research and innovation, or it
will continue to fall behind.'
Academic leaders understandably hate the idea that they may be forced to
devote scarce public funds to industrial research that should be done by
industry itself. 'Japanese companies invest about three times as much in
research, development and training as UK companies - leading to innovative
products and processes,' Dr David Harrison, chairman of the university
vice-chancellors' committee, pointed out in his response to the white paper.
According to the Department of Trade and Industry, UK manufacturers'
spending on R&amp;D per employee is less than half that of their competitors in
the US and Germany. That is why many of the 800 written submissions during
the white paper's consultation period urged the government to introduce
direct tax incentives for corporate R&amp;D - an idea which Mr William
Waldegrave, the minister for science, rejected on the grounds that special
tax subsidies encourage creative accounting and distort commercial
investment decisions.
Yet people familiar with industrial research know that discoveries are more
likely to be commercialised if they are made and developed in-house than
bought in from an outside laboratory - the well-known 'not invented here'
syndrome.
In fact, exciting results and discoveries are not the main thing that
companies want from the science base, according to managers responsible for
R&amp;D in industry and the DTI. 'Goodies sitting on the universities' shelves
are fairly low down the list of priorities,' said one.
At the top of the list, by general consensus, is a reliable supply of
well-trained scientists and engineers. In that context, the most important
policy announced in the white paper may be a shift in postgraduate
education: more masters' degrees and fewer doctorates. Indeed the normal
pattern will be for a student to complete a year's MSc before he or she is
considered for a three-year PhD.
The change is intended to reduce the large number of expensively trained
PhDs looking for a much smaller number of academic posts - and at the same
time give more people industrially oriented skills in the form of an MSc.
But it has drawn a lukewarm response from industry.
After trained manpower, industry wants new ideas from the science base. It
is here that the government's 'technology foresight' proposals for
identifying spending priorities could eventually pay a large dividend. The
Office of Science and Technology stands a good chance of breaking down the
academic-industrial divide if it draws enough experts from universities and
industry into the 20 or 30 foresight panels which it plans to set up. They
should include young enthusiasts as well as the greying men who have
traditionally been delegated to liaise with government.
British science continues to create a vast amount of knowledge and wealth
for the world. The national question is whether it can be harnessed more
effectively for the UK.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Letter: No reason for allowing BT to be a special case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JON DAVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Cable telecoms' (May 19) invites one clarification,
without my encroaching on issues of government policy.
BT has not been, and is not, excluded from the provision of fibre optic
networks carrying both entertainment and telecommunications services.
Indeed, the Cable Authority accepted BT's plans for such a development in
the Thames Valley and awarded the cable franchise for that area to a BT
subsidiary rather than its north American competitor.
For whatever reason, BT decided subsequently to forgo the opportunity
presented to it and it sold the Thames Valley franchise to a North American
company, from which it will be facing competition in the provision of
telephone services.
In the circumstances it is difficult to see on what basis BT can expect
sympathy either for having part of its market taken away from it or for
being deprived of the right to exploit fully any information super-highway
it may build in that area or in any other area.
The ITC will be advertising franchises for those parts of the country where
there is not yet a cable franchise. BT - or for the time being its
subsidiaries - may compete with others for the right to construct and
operate in those areas a new network capable of combining entertainment and
telecoms.
What your leader suggests is that, for BT only, those processes be abandoned
and that instead all necessary rights should simply be bestowed on BT
forthwith.
The arguments for by-passing the statutory processes, granting privileges to
one company to the exclusion of its competitors and denying to many
businesses and householders the possibility of benefiting from competition
in telecommunications, surely need more rigorous examination.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Springtime in Paris: David Buchan examines signs of a thaw
in the traditionally uneasy Anglo-French relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would perhaps be going too far to say that in the two months since the
new French government came to power, Britain's relations with its
cross-Channel neighbour have become better than at any point in the past two
decades.
But there was no mistaking the reciprocated warmth in Mr John Major's second
meeting with his new French counterpart, Mr Edouard Balladur, in Paris
yesterday. Speaking in general terms about their two-hour chat, the UK prime
minister said he could not recall a time when Anglo-French relations were
'in better shape'.
Mr Balladur was more concrete in citing the Gatt trade negotiations as an
example of where the two leaders had decided to make a fresh effort to
bridge their countries' real differences. The French prime minister even
volunteered his 'gratitude' for the 'help' of Mr John Gummer, then the UK
agriculture minister, in reaching an EC farm agreement this week. (Mr Gummer
was given the environment portfolio in Thursday's cabinet reshuffle.)
In fact, Britain was not trying particularly to advance French interests
this wek in Brussels, though it and others among France's partners clearly
hope that Paris has now been sufficiently buttered up to accept the
politically awkward oilseeds deal with the US in the next two weeks. But the
very fact that he exaggerated the extent of British help shows Mr Balladur's
desire to put the best face on his relationship with the UK.
The Gatt endeavour is, in a sense, the key to understanding the new
cross-Channel link. It is weaker than Paris's relationship with Bonn, where
30 years of formalised co-operation virtually commit the two partners reach
agreement on divisive issues. Paris and London have only committed
themselves to try to reach agreement. Nonetheless, this could lead to a vast
improvement in a relationship whose uneasiness dates back, as Mr Major
quipped yesterday, to 'William the Conqueror's coming over to Britain with a
certain degree of malice aforethought and Henry II's coming to France to
conquer half the country and marry the rest'.
Why the sudden springtime in Anglo-French relations? It must first be said
that there was never a permafrost over Britain's relations with the previous
Socialist government. The two countries, for instance, have continued
practical military co-operation, despite the abstract arguments about the
future of European defence and Nato which were part of the Maastricht treaty
negotiations. But for nearly five years France had focused on reaching
agreement with Germany on an agenda - including economic and monetary union
(Emu) and social policy - which was largely inimical to Britain's ruling
Conservatives.
The change in the ideology governing France has helped, but not radically.
This is because conservatism differs on either side of the Channel. Under Mr
Balladur, France is no longer accusing Britain of social dumping, but that
is because UK or UK-based companies (such as Hoover Europe) are no longer
the only foreign firms laying off workers in France. Mr Major reiterated his
view in Paris yesterday that the EC's social charter was a recipe for 'job
destruction' - a stance which no French government could publicly support,
even though Mr Balladur clearly shares much of Mr Major's concern about
Europe's growing lack of competitiveness.
France is now pursuing privatisation - aping techniques used in British
state sell-offs - such as 'le partly paid' equity and 'le golden share' from
Britain - but stopping short of selling state-owned utilities as the UK
government has done. But the question of who owns French industry is of less
relevance to the UK than its desire for the government to reduce aid to
French companies.
But the nature of the French government is important in another way. Within
the Gaullist RPR party, Mr Balladur himself comes from the stable of Georges
Pompidou, the man who let Britain into the EC as a kind of counterweight to
Germany. Within today's RPR party, too, are some deputies - nearly half its
parliamentary strength - who voted against Maastricht in last September's
referendum.
Mr Balladur, who as finance minister in late 1987 was the first to propose
to his EC colleagues a European central bank, therefore has Euro-sceptics
whom he cannot ignore, just as Mr Major has. And the French prime minister
cannot wholly rely on his pro-European coalition partner, the UDF, because
its leader, ex-President Giscard d'Estaing, still harbours ambitions for a
return to the Elysee.
This has pushed the RPR towards Mr Major's views on the need within the EC
for subsidiarity, decentralised decision-making and a closer check on the
European Commission. Separately, too, the RPR's right-wing pressure for a
crackdown on crime and illegal immigration has led the Balladur government
to delay abolition of frontier controls, as forseen in the Schengen
free-travel convention shunned by Britain.
But it is foreign policy, and above all their diplomatic and military
involvement in the Bosnian crisis, which has brought the two governments
into constant contact. This was true last year, too. But the Balladur
government's arrival coincided with Washington's first initiatives. And both
London and Paris have reacted allergically to US ideas of bombing Serbs or
arming the Moslems. France and Britain are both solidly behind a patient
strategy of sanctions.
The lengthy nature of such a strategy will only serve to ingrain the growing
habit of Anglo-French diplomatic co-ordination, underlined once again by
yesterday's announcement that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary,
will be in Paris for another Bosnian session with Mr Alain Juppe, his French
counterpart. The latter has said he sees Britain, as France's fellow United
Nations Security Council member and holder of nuclear weapons, playing a key
security role in the post-Maastricht EC.
Any such Anglo-French rapprochement on external policy can, however, easily
founder on the two governments' fundamental disagreement on economic policy.
Not so much on Gatt where Paris may now be able to finesse the agricultural
issue with some help from its EC partners. Mr Major yesterday expressed
'understanding' for France's farm problems, but stressed 'we must find a way
through the Gatt tangle this year'.
The future flashpoint lies more in monetary policy, where almost no one in
France, for all the country's current doldrums, wants to follow Britain out
of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. But Paris is reconciled to Mr Major taking a
longish time to return sterling to the ERM. Luckily, too, for Mr Major, Mr
Balladur shows absolutely no sign of traditional Gallic impatience with the
long Maastricht timetable for Emu. The French prime minister scoffs at any
post-Maastricht ratification bid to accelerate this timetable, by pointing
to the budgetary problems of France and others.
After his lunch with President Mitterrand yesterday, Mr Major paid tribute
'to France's longest-serving president for more than a century, who is
listened to with great respect', knowing full well that much of the real
authority in Paris now lies with Mr Balladur. But the likelihood of Mr
Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, winning the 1995 presidential election
will return undivided power to the Elysee, and perhaps rock the new-found
relationship with Mr Balladur.
If it does not, then Britain stands a chance of having a real say in the
1996 revision of the Maastricht treaty. Instead of shouting from the
sidelines, as it did in much of the run-up to Maastricht, it might even join
France, and perforce Germany, in setting the agenda. That, Mr Major knows,
could put Britain at the centre of Europe.
