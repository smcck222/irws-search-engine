(5): Not for use by amateurs - The role of the workstation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE computer workstation grew out of the need to juggle daunting figures on
a desktop and in a realistic timeframe. In the early 1980s the first option
for vast calculations was a very large mainframe or supercomputer. Their
processing power is still called upon for resource-hungry design in
aerospace, for instance. But impressive performance comes with a price tag
of over Pounds 1m.
From the outset, the computer workstation was designed to be affordable. The
software that unlocked the door to cheaper scientific computing was the Unix
operating system, which has now made the breakthrough into commercial
respectability. But in 1982 it was the province of the technical fanatics
who characterised California's Silicon Valley. Initially unfriendly to the
common user, Unix offered the right environment for engineering
applications.
Sun was the start-up company that came to symbolise the rise of the
workstation. It embodied all the cliches of the West Coast IT entrepreneurs.
Launched by enthusiastic programming fiends in jeans, it was the antithesis
of the blue chip hardware manufacturer. The market for powerful workstations
exploded, taking Sun to a turnover of over Dollars 3bn, with 550,000 units
shipped in under a decade.
Mr Bill Passmore, Sun's northern Europe vice-president, pinpoints labour
savings as a crucial factor in the rise of the workstation. 'Suddenly,
companies found they could design an aircraft wing by putting a Pounds
30,000 a year designer in front of a Pounds 30,000 computer.' By displaying
complicated computer modelling packages on a desktop, the workstation cut
out the connection to a mainframe. This bypassed the teams of specialist
programmers needed to keep large systems up and running.
More powerful chips have diminished the size of the workstation, abolishing
the storage cabinet under the desktop. But the prospect of greater power led
some users to apply workstation technology indiscriminately. In the late
1980s boom banks began to invest heavily in purpose-built dealing rooms.
Some sites were kitted out with a powerful workstation at every dealing
position, which proved an expensive error.
To have sophisticated software running at high speed is only of value if the
user knows how to bring that power to bear on his job. In many dealing rooms
90 per cent of staff are quite happy with a conventional PC running a
commonplace spreadsheet such as Lotus 1-2-3. The workstation makes sense
only if it is driven by the right user.
The dramatic expansion in the capabilities of the humble PC has shadowed the
advance of the workstation. With the arrival of the 486 series chip, and its
successor Pentium just around the corner, the PC is well and truly in
workstation territory. Windowing software and graphics have boosted the
worth of advanced applications running on standard office equipment.
Mr Chris Sarfas, desktop marketing manager at Digital Equipment in the UK,
admits that Dec's workstation products have superficial rivals in the PC
world. 'The key differential has always been high performance, but the PC of
today outperforms the workstation of three years ago.
'The primary advantage of the workstation over the PC is for the power user,
the designer or top-end financial dealer. A PC can take a live video window,
but it can't do that and run five other screens incorporating a live data
feed.'
There is a growing convergence between PCs and workstations, aided by
software that combines ease of use with first-rate graphics. The workstation
market starts just beyond the price bracket of top-end PCs, at around Pounds
5,000 a unit. But top specification systems can cost Pounds 60,000. At this
level the workstation is intruding on the preserve of mid-range computing
and killing off the super-minicomputer of the 1980s.
Not all workstation manufacturers have mirrored Sun's meteoric performance.
Earlier this year Next Computer abandoned workstation production after two
years. Shedding half its workforce, Next declared it would concentrate on
developing software to complement the latest generation of computer chips.
it seems that Next was squeezed out by the market clout of established
producers and the blurring of identities between PCs and its workstation
products.
The workstation may be harassed by the PC, but it is still upwardly-mobile.
The key to harnessing workstation technology lies in remembering its roots.
It came about as a precision tool for professionals with a
processing-intensive job. They are still the right candidates for a
workstation's capabilities and price tag.

(3): High-cost Japanese lose out - Foreign competitors are gaining ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S computer manufacturers - from the giants Fujitsu, NEC and Toshiba to
their smaller cousins such as Seiko Epson - have suffered from a dramatic
fall in demand over the past year.
The value of sales fell 12 per cent from the year before, according to
estimates by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, as Japanese
companies moved to cut capital spending and consumers held back from buying
new machines.
Corporations, faced with a pressing need to cut costs amid the economic
slowdown, targeted spending on information and communications equipment,
areas in which they had invested heavily in the past.
Consumers stopped making new purchases, particularly towards the end of the
year as low-priced machines, newly available from foreign companies, raised
expectations that prices would fall further and that Japanese manufacturers
would also be forced to cut prices.
Manufacturers have found the market situation so difficult that the computer
industry association has applied to be included on the Ministry of Labour's
list of industries qualified to receive employment subsidies to help tide
companies over bad times.
The fall in demand would have been bad enough for Japan's computer industry.
But in the midst of the worst economic slump in recent history, the industry
has been confronted with a hitherto unknown entity in its home market:
foreign competition.
Last year, Apple Computer jumped to third place in the market share league
table and some believe it could rise to second place this year.
IBM, Compaq and Dell are other US companies that have created a stir with
low-priced models. They have yet to make much impact in terms of sales, but
their presence symbolises a changed market environment for Japanese
manufacturers.
Like their foreign competitors before them, Japan's computer manufacturers
are having to face up to the fact that computers are becoming commodity
items.
Until now, Japanese manufacturers were able to charge high prices for their
computers and obtain high margins as a result of a relative lack of
competition in their home market.
The difficulty of processing the Japanese language kept the domestic market
in effect closed to many potential outside competitors.
However, developments in software have made it possible to overcome this
hurdle, removing a barrier to competition in the home market.
The result is that unlike in the past, computer manufacturers in Japan will
increasingly have to compete on price as well as on the merits of their
products.
The situation has exposed a weakness among Japanese manufacturers. When it
comes to computers, they are not particularly cost competitive.
Those that depend on high-cost manufacturing in Japan are unable to compete
on price. Moreover, unlike IBM, which uses standardised parts throughout the
world, Japanese companies use proprietary systems which are more costly to
produce.
As a result, Japanese manufacturers looking to offer cheaper computers are
likely to turn increasingly to IBM-compatible machines, rather than their
own proprietary systems, to complete the lower end of their product range.
Recent moves by a number of computer manufacturers to turn to OEM suppliers
for some of their products illustrates the trend.
Earlier this year, Hitachi indicated that it would obtain some of its
computer products through an OEM arrangement with IBM. Meanwhile, Fujitsu
says it may take OEM supplies of low-priced IBM-compatible machines from
Acer of Taiwan.
In addition, the Japanese are facing the consequences of an increasing move
towards downsizing and open systems.
These developments pose the biggest threat for the two computer giants
Fujitsu and NEC.
Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer which depends for 70 per cent
of revenues on computers - of which about 30 per cent comes from large
mainframes - will have to shift its revenue base from hardware to software,
says Mr Koichiro Chiwata, industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, the US
securities house.
Meanwhile, the advantages that NEC, the country's largest PC manufacturer
with over 50 per cent of the market, has enjoyed with its proprietary system
will be eroded, Mr Chiwata believes.
Last year, NEC saw its PC shipments fall 5 per cent; the company's debt
rating has been downgraded by Moody's, the debt rating agency, which expects
competition to intensify.
Fujitsu and others have already started to place greater emphasis on
software and systems to counter the fall of profits from hardware resulting
from lower consumption and weak prices.
Fujitsu has come up with a list of charges on 20 different software and
after-sale services such as maintenance and repairs. Both Hitachi and IBM
Japan have similar price lists.
But it will not be easy for them to convince their Japanese customers to
agree on service charges as these have until now been regarded as part of
the price of buying a machine.
On the brighter side, in spite of a lingering mood of low consumption,
Japan's computer market is expected to recover this year. Dataquest, the
high technology consultancy, forecasts growth of 6.6 per cent in 1993. The
range of low-cost machines currently available, the launch of Windows and
the purchasing cycle will all contribute to the rise in demand, it believes.
As the market recovers, it is likely to become an even more heated
battleground between domestic manufacturers struggling to protect their
proprietary systems and their margins against the cost advantages and the
open systems offered by their US competitors.

(4): Massively parallel challengers - The new supercomputer battleground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL a few years ago the market for supercomputers, the behemoths of data
processing, was a relatively sedate affair involving just a handful of
American and Japanese companies led by Cray Research of the US.
But new approaches to supercomputing using alternative technologies threaten
to turn it into a fiercely competitive battleground and upset the
established order.
Cray still dominates the world market for traditional supercomputers with
around two-thirds of the installed base, according to Ms Jane Doorly of
Dataquest, the information technology market research group.
She believes Cray's Japanese rivals Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi, have not made
inroads into the North American or European markets because Cray also
dominates the software side of traditional supercomputing.
Cray's most powerful machines, the Y-MP C90s, can cost more than Dollars 30m
each and are capable of processing up to 16bn calculations in a second.
They are used in universities for academic research, by government agencies
for example for weather forecasting, and increasingly by industry for
design, modelling and other functions which can provide a competitive
advantage.
These supercomputers achieve their fast calculation speeds by using one, or
a small number of high-power data-processors, 16 in the case of the Y-MP
C90, to work through computer code using a technique known as 'vector
processing'.
Because these traditional supercomputers use costly custom-made processors,
they are expensive and performance improvements are coming more slowly as
designers try to wring more speed from individual processors.
By using different techniques and cheaper standard technology about a dozen
companies including Intel, Kendall Square Research, Thinking Machines,
nCube, NCR and MasPar Computer in the US, and Britain's Meiko Scientific and
Parsys, are building machines which promise to be more powerful than
traditional supercomputers, but cost much less.
This new generation of supercomputers works by linking hundreds or thousands
of smaller off-the-shelf processors - often reduced instruction set
computing (Risc) microprocessors - using a technique known as 'massively
parallel processing' (MPP).
Unlike vector processing systems which tackle each part of a job in
sequence, one at a time, parallel systems divide the problem into small
parts and share it out among lots of processors which then work
simultaneously.
The industry is sharply divided over the technical merits of the two
systems. The supporters of MPP machines claim they offer greatly improved
price/performance value and will ultimately replace the monolithic-style
vector processor.
Critics argue that they are still largely unproven and that they are much
more difficult to programme than vector processors. 'Parallel processing is
not mainstream, it is for niche applications,' says Ms Doorly, 'there are
still lots of technical problems.'
The main problem remains the lack of software to run on the machines.
Currently, only about two dozen applications run on MPP supercomputers and
only a handful of those have gained widespread acceptance. Software
developers are reluctant to write applications for a fragmented market of
competing standards.
So far, multi-processor based supercomputers have mostly only challenged
Cray's lower powered machines. But some competitors have begun to combine
elements of both parallel and vector techniques to challenge Cray's
top-of-the-range models.
In particular, Fujitsu's VPP500 supercomputer, unveiled last autumn,
combines the two approaches in a technology predictably called 'vector
parallel processing'. The VPP500 has enabled the Japanese company to take a
spectacular lead in the race to build the world's most powerful computer.
Fujitsu, in the supercomputer business since 1977, has half of the Japanese
and 23 per cent of the world market. It claims its supercomputer is capable
of up to 355bn calculations per second. It comprises from seven to 222
vector processors, each roughly equivalent to a conventional mid-range
supercomputer arranged in parallel. Fujitsu believes it can sell 50 units
over the next three years at between Dollars 10m and Dollars 50m a unit.
That may well depend on whether the VPP500 fulfils Fujitsu's ambitious
performance claims - experts warn that Japanese supercomputers have a
reputation for running faster on paper than when solving real problems.
However, Cray has acknowledged that it faces new competitive pressures and
is struggling to cut costs. Last year sales fell by 8 per cent to Dollars
797.6m. The group reported a Dollars 14.9m loss, after a Dollars 42m
restructuring charge to cover job cuts, compared to a Dollars 113m profit
the previous year.
Cray reckons its restructuring moves will cut costs by Dollars 50m a year
but has also begun to rethink its product strategy. It has introduced
cheaper, less powerful, entry-level, models costing around Dollars 300,000
to compete with the mini-supercomputers made by such companies as Convex
Computer. At the other end of the scale it has begun to answer the challenge
of MPP machines by developing its own, codenamed the TD3, based on Digital
Equipment's Alpha chip which will also combine vector and MPP technology.
It has also established a joint venture with California's Sun Microsystems
to build a machine aimed at filling a niche at the top end of the
workstation market and to create a 'seamless software environment' that will
allow Sun systems and Cray supercomputers to work together with increased
efficiency.
This is important because the supercomputer manufacturers also face a
potential challenge from a technique known as 'clustering'. This involves
linking together separate high-end desktop workstations to form what
Hewlett-Packard calls 'a loosely coupled, parallel supercomputer.'
To develop these systems HP has formed an alliance with Convex Computer, the
Texas-based mini-supercomputer manufacturer. Ms Peggy Heppelmann,
workstation business manager for HP in the UK, says both IBM and
Hewlett-Packard are already selling 'a reasonable number' of workstation
clusters.

(2): Information technology: time to be bold - The future of the European
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S market for information technology, now the world's largest and
accounting for some 36 per cent of global consumption, is dominated by the
US and threatened by the Japanese.
'Will there be a European computer industry in the year 2000?' Mr Gavin
Kirkpatrick, chief executive of the British Computer Society, the UK
organisation for data processing professionals, has asked in a series of
international lectures.
That is a serious question which many industry observers are pondering.
Europe's large, indigenous IT suppliers - Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, Groupe
Bull of France and Olivetti of Italy are losing money and putting in place
strenuous restructuring measures.
So serious are the problems that Mr Carlo de Benedetti, Olivetti chairman,
has questioned publicly whether the Italian computer manufacturer - which
lost Pounds 276.3m last year - can survive. Naturally enough, he believes
the company's turnaround strategy will prove successful but it is an anxious
time, not helped by Italy's political difficulties.
Siemens Nixdorf (SNIS) is taking far longer to return to profits than its
managers predicted at the time of the merger of Germany's largest
electronics manufacturer and its best-known computer company. While Siemens'
senior executives defend SNIS's position in the group, there is no doubt it
is a heavy drag on Siemens' resources, raising speculation that the
electronics giant might welcome a partner or buyer for the computer company.
Groupe Bull, under Mr Bernard Pache, its new managing director, is
continuing the transformation started under Mr Francis Lorentz, his
predecessor, with further rounds of job cuts - 3,000 or 8 per cent of the
workforce this year alone. The group lost FF4.72bn (Dollars 863m) last year.
Mr Michel Carpentier, director-general for the IT industries at the European
Commission, believes the European industry is at a crossroads. Writing in
the European Information Technology Observatory, a new overview of the
market, he notes: 'Europe's competitive position has declined from 1985 to
1991 with its IT trade balance dropping from minus Ecu 9bn to minus Ecu
27.2bn and with high technology for less than one fifth of European exports
compared with 31 per cent and 27 per cent in the US and Japan respectively.'
Mr Carpentier says the key weakness in Europe is its inability to integrate
research and development and innovation in an overall strategy which both
exploits and orientates them.
To which must be added a cautious attitude on the part of its major
customers. European companies are less likely to spend heavily on IT without
obvious cost justification. While this protects them from the wasteful use
of IT seen in many US companies, it can also act as a dampener on
imaginative projects.
Europe's strength, on the other hand, is its ability to innovate, albeit in
a comparatively small number of industry sectors.
The value of the European market is considerable. In 1992, the IT business
in the 12 EC countries and the five European Free Trade Association partners
amounted to some Ecu 225bn, of which Ecu 128bn went on data processing and
office equipment - the traditional IT areas - and the rest on
telecommunications.
Europe's bid to maintain a separate identity in IT may be helped by the
profound structural changes which are transforming the industry.
Downsizing, moving from mainframe based operations to data processing based
on client-server systems, for example, may prove easier in Europe where
there are perhaps only a fifth as many very large mainframe sites as in the
US. The technical and managerial choices involved in downsizing are never
easy; European computing services companies capable of advising and
supporting a customer through a downsizing decision are equal to the best
and have the advantage of local knowledge.
Computers: very large and very small ones will characterise tomorrow's data
processing business. Europe has skills in building both.
Advanced Computer Research International, a new company set up in France
under the guidance of Mr Jacques Stern, former head of Groupe Bull, is
developing a commercial supercomputer based on Digital Equipment's Alpha
chip. DEC has agreed to take a stake in the new company.
Acorn Risk Machines, a joint venture between Acorn Computers (owned by
Olivetti but based in the UK), Apple Computers and VLSI of the US has
developed tiny, high-powered microprocessors which consume very little power
and are well suited to consumer products. Apple will use an ARM
microprocessor in its 'Newton' personal digital assistant.
Software: fast, effective and economical production remains a global
problem. Europe's computer companies are as advanced as any in software
development. Earlier this year a group of companies including Sema Group and
Logica of the UK, Groupe Bull and Cap Gemini Sogeti of France and Siemens
Nixdorf of Germany established a software research institute in Bilboa,
Spain, to seek better ways of writing computer software. The idea is not to
compete with packaged software suppliers such as Microsoft or Lotus, but to
develop better methods of creating very large pieces of bespoke software.
Mr Kirkpatrick of the BCS has no doubt there will be a European computer
industry at the end of the century but he questions what kind of an industry
it will be. Will it be dominated by software and services rather than
hardware development and manufacture? Will Europe's research initiatives be
pursued in isolation or in collaboration with with the rest of the world?
Who will be the majority shareholder in Europe's industry?
ICL of the UK points to answers to all three questions. Based in Europe, it
is owned by Fujitsu of Japan and now derives most of its revenues from
software and services. It collaborates with companies worldwide in research,
though most of its activities are European-based.
Mr Kirkpatrick emphasises that the future of the European industry depends
on a change of attitude rather than technological prowess. 'If we in Europe
want to be world leaders in this business, we have to be far more ambitious
for the business opportunities that informatics offers and rather less
interested in the abstract culture that is one of its endemic distractions.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (4): Taking positions in the
dining-room - Profile of Richard Edwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU'VE HEARD of George Soros, the currency speculator who claims to have
broken the pound on Black Wednesday.
Now meet Richard Edwards, a 42-year old Cambridge University graduate who is
carrying out the same kind of short-term currency speculation from his flat
in Hampstead, North London.
As currency dealers go, the two men operate on different scales. Mr Soros's
Quantum fund, which is based in New York, has several billion dollars under
management. Mr Edwards, an ex-bank dealer who runs a one-man fund from his
dining room, says he controls funds which are under Pounds 100m.
Mr Soros can claim that his speculation was enough to help bring about the
devaluation of the pound.
By contrast, Mr Edwards has the more modest claim of having recently turned
Pounds 25,000 of his own money into Pounds 1m in 18 months.
What both men have in common, however, is that they are involved in intense
short-term speculation on financial markets, making them the scourge of
central bankers round the world. 'People in my profession are shy of calling
themselves speculators,' says Mr Edwards. 'I am not shy at all. A speculator
is what I undoubtedly am.'
Mr Edwards is one of the growing breed of commodity trading advisers (CTAs)
 -like the hedge funds - which are causing concern to central banks.
In recent years, the number of these funds has grown in the US and Europe as
national capital controls have broken down, exchange rate volatility has
gone up and returns on speculation have increased.
Mr Edwards says that the essence of their business is to take active
currency risks for a range of clients that want higher than average returns
on their money.
The client will first deposit a sum of capital with a commercial bank as
collateral. A manager like Mr Edwards is then given limited power of
attorney over its use. He can then buy and sell currencies in the foreign
exchange market, taking highly leveraged positions that are well in excess
of the collateral deposited.
Mr Edwards takes positions three times the size of the collateral. This
speculation is lucrative: 'My returns for customers have been slightly over
30 per cent,' he says.
But it is risky, too. 'I make thousands of decisions every year,' he says.
'If just one of them goes wrong, it can jeopardise all the others. If, last
year, I had speculated strongly that the French franc was about to devalue
and had held my position, I could have had everything wiped out.'
What technology do budding CTAs need? First - and the centrepiece of Mr
Edwards dining room - is a terminal with the latest exchange rates and a
chart-drawing function.
Second item: a portable telephone. 'I have to know about exchange rates and
bond prices constantly,' he says. 'It can be very tiring.'
Those who speak of the immorality of speculation are unaware of how the
financial markets are changing, he says.
'It used to be considered that there was a difference between investment -
which was honourable - and speculation - which wasn't,' he explains. 'But
the distinction between useful investment and useless speculation is
becoming blurred.'
Will this speculation grow? 'The currency market these days is so huge and
competition so intense that dealing costs are now very small. It is
therefore very cheap to get in and out of the market fast.'
Is he a millionaire? 'A millionaire these days is someone who makes a
million a year.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (3): Fund managers flex their
muscles - How new players are curbing central bankers' joy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER MONTHS of turmoil on the currency markets, this ought to have been a
time of celebration for the world's central bankers.
The pressures inside the European exchange rate mechanism have eased.
Germany has cut its short-term interest rates, reducing the pressure on
Europe's recession-hit economies. And the French franc appears to have
finally shaken off numerous speculative attacks against it.
But celebration is far from being the order of the day. For central banks
and governments are becoming increasingly concerned about the acute
structural changes in the nature of foreign exchange dealing. And, in
particular, there is increasing discussion of how a powerful new group of
players - the pension funds and the US hedge funds - are dominating this
market, and overwhelming the power of governments to control exchange rate
movements through market intervention.
Until a few years ago, international currency dealing was dominated by
commercial banks making markets in foreign exchange off the back of trade
flows.
But in the last four years, fund managers in the non-banking sector have
become the prime movers of capital, with the power to shift sums vastly in
excess of the reserves of central banks and governments.
These institutions are the most important players in the foreign currency
market today, because of the international diversification of their asset
portfolios in the late 1980s.
The liberalisation of cross-border financial flows and the reduction of
national capital controls in recent years has encouraged fund managers to
invest in overseas assets. The declining level of US interest rates has also
forced major American investors to look abroad for higher returns.
That quest for overseas returns has been intense. In its recent report on
capital flows*, the International Monetary Fund stated that cross-border
equity holdings in the US, Europe and Japan increased from Dollars 800bn in
1986 to Dollars 1,300bn in 1991. European institutions now invest about 20
per cent of their assets abroad, while foreign investments of US and
Japanese institutions generally range between 5 and 7 per cent.
One result of this internationalisation of assets was to increase foreign
currency turnover to levels that dwarf the reserves of the central banks.
Net daily foreign exchange turnover last year was about Dollars 1,000bn,
compared with central bank reserves of Dollars 555.6bn in April 1992.
But the critical point about these funds is not just that they move capital
in huge sizes. Instead, the methods by which each of these types of fund
operates threatens to make exchange rate movements more volatile in future.
The US hedge funds are the most notorious of the new players. Their star
performer is Mr George Soros, who claims that his Quantum Fund broke the
pound on Black Wednesday and forced its exit from the ERM.
Other well-known hedge fund managers in the US include Mr Paul Tudor-Jones,
the Caxton fund and Mr Andy Krieger of Capital Holdings.
According to the IMF report, each of these funds has less than Dollars 10bn
under management. But they use their capital to indulge in highly leveraged
positions - or margin trading - giving them formidable power in the market.
The essence of margin trading is that a fund provides a certain sum in
collateral to a commercial bank, which then allows the fund to take
positions in the market which could be up to 10 times greater than the
amount deposited.
If profits are made, the bank passes them on to the fund's account. If the
fund starts to lose, however, the bank will 'close out' its position and
annex the deposit when it equals the net losses.
The power of leverage is consolidated by the fact that the hedge funds take
positions which are very short-term, highly aggressive and often directed at
smaller markets where intense buying and selling can affect exchange rates.
'Their basic principle is that a million lemmings can't be wrong,' said one
investment banker. 'If the peseta is moving downwards, then a hedge fund can
push its entire fund out of the peseta in one go. By being conspicuous and
powerful, they can move the market in a desired direction.'
In the recent currency crisis, the activity of the hedge funds, which have
excellent track records, encouraged other market participants to operate in
a similar way.
As the IMF report puts it: 'While the hedge funds acted as market leaders,
the real financial muscle was provided by institutional investors (mutual
funds, pension funds, insurance companies) and by non-financial
corporations.
The sheer size of these funds provides much of their power. While a bank
might take positions in hundreds of millions of dollars, it would not be
unusual for a pension fund manager to move billions of dollars in one go.
But here again, it is not just the huge sums that the pensions funds have,
but their new methods that explain their new power.
Until recently, the rapid expansion of international fund management had
not, of itself, had much impact on exchange rates. Much of the international
portfolio diversification has been into long-term regional funds which do
not take active currency decisions.
However, improved liquidity and trading technology is now allowing investors
to move quickly into and out of domestic and international investment
positions.
According to the IMF: 'Advances in the technology of financial transactions
 -ranging from back-office clearance and settlement to trading and
information systems to settlements of payments - have reduced transaction
costs to the point where they less and less serve as an impediment to
rearranging portfolios when expectations change.'
Moreover, specialist managers are now managing currency as a separate asset
class in itself or managing the currency exposure of funds as a separate
decision.
This latter method of control, called currency overlay, makes it easier to
separate currency management from that of the underlying assets.
Mr Dirk Morris, of JP Morgan Investments, in London, says: 'The currency
overlay business has grown from nothing four years ago to the management of
somewhere between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 25bn today. And our own business
has grown by 30 per cent over the past year.'
Is all this a cause for concern to central banks? There is little doubt that
these flows can now overwhelm governments.
As the IMF puts it: 'When private markets, led by the increasing financial
muscle of institutional investors, reach the concerted view that the
risk/return outlook for a particular currency has deteriorated
significantly, the defending central bank can be faced with a run that could
easily amount to say Dollars 100-200bn a week.'
Admittedly, turnover in other markets is still far greater. The entire
volume of marketable debt in US government securities turns over, on
average, once every eight days, a far greater figure than would be the case
for foreign exchange.
But the market practitioners are convinced that the role of the big funds in
currency markets is set to increase in the coming years. Governments need to
decide whether there is anything they can do to manage these flows, or
whether the game is already up.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (2): Can the politicians make Emu
fly? - Monetary union is threatened by diverging European economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPECTRE is haunting the European Community, the spectre of the 1930s.
Rising unemployment, a deeper-than-expected recession and a resurgence of
'go-it-alone' national economic policies have cast doubt on EC plans for
European Monetary Union.
What once seemed a logical progression from the successful project to create
a Single European Market by 1992 now looks questionable. European economies
are diverging, not converging. The recent realignments by Spain and
Portugal, on the very day that the Bank of France made its sixth
interest-rate cut since the election of a new government, underlined the
emergence of a two-tier monetary Europe.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, frets that such
competitive devaluations will destroy the single market and sew mistrust
among member states. He is also worried that the UK economic recovery, based
on a floating exchange rate, may tempt other EC members states to pursue
economic growth outside the constraints of the exchange rate mechanism, the
designated vehicle for Emu.
The central question facing policy-makers is how the Emu project can regain
credibility. To an extent, the answer depends on the fate of the Maastricht
treaty, of which the plans for monetary union were by far the most
important.
Mr Henning Christophersen, the jovial Danish EC economics commissioner,
likes to point out that, once the Maastricht treaty is ratified, confidence
in Emu will return. According to his analysis, the Danish Yes vote in the
second referendum on Maastricht should speed up ratification in the UK,
restoring stability to the financial markets and making it probable that a
majority of the Twelve would elect to proceed to Emu in 1997, in line with
Maastricht.
The trouble with this analysis is that it blames all of Emu's troubles on
the original Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty in their first
referendum. Yet several high-level inquiries into the recent upheavals in
the ERM make clear that economics, just as much as politics, was largely to
blame.
As a recent report by the International Monetary Fund noted: 'Actual
achievements in convergence among the ERM countries - although significant -
were neither durable nor deep enough to justify assuming complete fixity of
exchange rates.
'Losses of competitiveness, large fiscal deficits not yet under control,
weaknesses in financial sectors, sharp cyclical differences, and divergent
mixes of monetary and fiscal policies (in the wake of German unification)
were each vulnerable elements.'
Much criticism has been heaped on the Bundesbank for pursuing unnecessarily
high interest-rate policies, to the detriment of the rest of Europe.
Germany's national priorities clashed with her (nascent) international
obligations. The need to control inflation, because of the Bonn government's
decision to borrow to finance German unification, clashed with the need to
defend at all costs parities in the ERM.
Yet the Bundesbank has a strong case for arguing that other ERM countries
failed to make timely currency adjustments before last September. The
absence of realignments after January 1987 led to currency rates becoming
out of line with economic performance. Maintaining parity became a virility
symbol, all the more so as weaker, higher-yielding currencies such as the
Spanish peseta became repositories for huge amounts of 'hot' money.
According to a central banker involved in drafting the report on the ERM
crisis last autumn, an estimated Dollars 200bn to Dollars 300bn was held in
these weaker currencies. Once they came under attack, it became impossible
for the central banks to maintain the parities. The ERM, which by habit had
become a fixed exchange rate mechanism, reverted to its original semi-fixed,
adjustable form. Hence, the monetary authorities' conclusion that the ERM
does not need fundamental reform.
The British government disagrees. Yet its contention that there are
'fault-lines' in the ERM has one flaw: it has not put forward any blueprints
for reform. Meanwhile, the 'hard core' ERM currencies - the German mark,
French franc, Belgian franc, Dutch guilder, and Luxembourg franc - have
survived with their rates intact.
The two battles to save the franc were seminal events, leading to even
closer co-operation and a sense of solidarity between the French and German
authorities. The single most important result was the election of a pro-EC
government in the French parliamentary elections. The French political elite
closed ranks, and the advocates of a floating franc were reduced to silence.
Yet the franc may only have gained a stay of execution. The nagging concern
among Emu enthusiasts is whether the strategy of maintaining the ERM for
four to six years before the full transition to Emu is merely an open
invitation to speculators.
According to a report by the Commissariat Du Plan - the semi-official
think-tank in Paris - one idea would be to form a 'monetary Schengen'. This
would draw on the name of the group of hard-core EC countries which agreed
to dismantle their frontiers before other members were ready.
Among the suggestions are: a formal commitment to ERM central rates and a
possible reduction in the fluctuation margins from 2 1/4 to 1 per cent; all
central banks to hold reserves denominated in the currencies of partner
countries; stronger mutual support mechanisms for intramarginal
intervention; and central bank independence (a subject taken up with
alacrity by the new French government).
A Danish No would have forced both France and Germany to consider these
moves as a statement to the financial markets that they are still serious
about Emu. But in the light of the Yes response, EC economies will have to
show more convergence. Emu enthusiasts suggest that the pressure for
monetary union is so overwhelming that the strict 'convergence criteria'
will be simply fudged in 1996. But the Bundesbank has other ideas; and so
may Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(1): Heads roll in year of havoc - The past year has been eventful, even by
the computer industry's restless standards. Senior figures have quit as
newer, more agile competitors make the running. The scene has been set for a
major shift in the balance of power
</HEADLINE>

THE computer industry is notoriously volatile, but the past 12 months have
been eventful even by its restless standards. Some of the most important
heads in the business have rolled as companies have been forced to jettison
entrenched attitudes and yesterday's ways of doing business.
'This kind of impact, this kind of change in industrial structure is very
exciting but it is very difficult for the companies involved,' Mr Bill
Gates, chairman of Microsoft, told a London audience last month with some
understatement.
The resignation of Mr John Akers, chairman of International Business
Machines, set the seal on a year which saw the traditional industry in
disarray as newer, more agile competitors made the running. On one memorable
day in early 1993 as IBM's share price slipped towards towards Dollars 45,
its market capitalisation was briefly equal to that of Microsoft, the
leading personal computer software supplier, and Intel, the biggest
microprocessor supplier.
Since then, Mr Akers has been replaced by Mr Louis Gerstner, formerly with
RJR Nabisco. Mr Gerstner has yet to make known his plans for returning the
company to profitability, although the indications are that he has set his
face against breaking up IBM, which lost some Dollars 5bn last year, into
independent businesses. He is, however, beginning to make his own
appointments at senior level, placing outsiders like himself, with
formidable reputations for cost cutting, in key positions. For example, Mr
Jerome York, formerly with the Chrysler motor company, has been appointed
finance chief.
The transformation in progress at IBM reflects what is happening to many
established computer companies today. Closely cherished business principles
are having to be abandoned. IBM, for example, no longer rules out forced
involuntary redundancy as a way of cutting staff numbers. It no longer
insists that its future is tied to mainframe computers - cuts in research
and development funds will fall more heavily on the mainframe side than on
faster-growing areas such as network computing.
In similar fashion, Digital Equipment, once the global leader in scientific
and technical computing, has had to accept that it missed the boat in high
performance workstations and open, or industry standard, systems.
Mr Kenneth Olsen, its founder and chairman, has stepped down and under new
management headed by Mr Robert Palmer, it is restructuring, focusing on a
market-driven approach and attempting to establish Alpha, its innovative
64-bit microprocessor chip that is said to be the world's fastest, as the
industry standard.
Compaq, the leader in high performance personal computers, has had to
abandon its emphasis on selling high-priced machines through the dealer
channel. Masterminded by new management under Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, after Mr
Rod Canion, its founder, was ousted, Compaq's resurgence in the marketplace
has been a consequence of developing a new range of low cost machines
distributed through a variety of channels.
The personal computer market has now divided into high end machines, broadly
defined by IBM's PS/2 range, and lower priced 'value-for-money' machines.
'No-name' makers - personal computer manufacturers without much of a track
record - had been making heavy inroads at the lower end of the market. Now
that established makers, led by Compaq and IBM, are making their presence
felt in the second tier, branding has become, again, an important selling
point. One indication is the decision of Virgin, Mr Richard Branson's music
to airlines group, to enter the market.
The machine, to be launched later this year, will use the same
microprocessors and operating system as other PC makers; but it will bear
the Virgin name, which could prove a powerful selling point.
Changes in the way computers are used within organisations are gathering
pace. The emergence and growth of network, or client server computing, is
one of the keys to the hiatus in the industry today. It has been accelerated
by the availability of powerful desktop machines coupled through high
capacity networks.
It is becoming important for many companies because it is a better match for
the way business is conducted today than traditional systems.
Don Tapscott and Art Caston writing in 'Paradigm Shift'* argue: 'As long as
businesses and governments could function and survive as large hierarchical
bureaucracies, then large, centralised, monolithic host computers were
well-matched. However, isolated host systems can no longer match the
fast-paced, streamlined and integrated operations of today's well-planned
organisation. The client-server approach to work organisation treats
business units as networked clients and servers with well-defined roles,
each making a measurable contribution to the business and having equally
well-defined relationships with other clients and server units.'
Mr Fred Gibbons, chief executive of the Software Publishing Corporation,
told delegates to the Asian Technology Roundtable conference earlier this
year: 'Investment is moving from traditional applications towards
client-server systems. It will not happen overnight, but in the next five
years more applications will be developed on client-server systems than on
mainframes.'
So the scene has been set for a major shift in the balance of power. Who
will be the market leaders in the new computer industry that will develop
over the next decade? According to Charles Morris and Charles Ferguson,
writing in the Harvard Business Review earlier this year, the secret lies in
domination of an architecture, a design which becomes an industry standard.
The two youthful challengers to IBM's market domination, Intel and
Microsoft, fit this pattern. IBM in effect threw away control of the
personal computer market when it chose Intel microprocessors and
commissioned Microsoft to develop MS/DOS for its first personal computer.
Intel has since grown to become the world's largest semiconductor company.
Mr Andrew Grove, Intel chairman, says: 'It took us 22 years to get to
Dollars 1bn a quarter in revenues and, thanks to the explosion in demand for
our 486 chip, less than three years to get to Dollars 2bn a quarter.'
The company hopes to continue its advance with the release of Pentium, the
successor to the 486 chip. Selling at almost Dollars 1,000 in its fastest
version, it will be used in high performance personal computers and network
servers. A slew of personal computer makers including IBM, Compaq and
Hewlett Packard have already announced products based on Pentium.
Microsoft is the world's largest personal computer company driven by sales
of a broad range of products but especially MS/DOS and Windows, the most
broadly used operating system in the PC world. It is taking a step into the
unknown this year with the launch of Windows/NT, an operating system
designed for client-server systems, making it possible for users to work on
several programs simultaneously and for several users to share the same
computer.
Intel and Microsoft will inevitably face heavy competition from other
companies - notably IBM and Apple - as technology changes, and there is no
guarantee they will be able to maintain their domination. There are other
areas where standards can be set, where control of an architecture can give
a company market leadership.
PC networking is one such area: the US company Novell is well on the way to
setting the standard. Groupware is another. This is software that enables a
group of computer users to work together over a network. The market leader
is Lotus Development Corporation with a product called 'Notes'.
Mr John Landry, chief technology officer of Lotus, is fond of saying that in
communication: 'First there were talking drums, then there was the
telephone, now there is Notes.'
Notes is a step on the way to comprehensive 'multimedia', the combination of
text, sound, graphics and moving video in a workstation. Mr Gates of
Microsoft describes it as the communication of today's information: 'It is
simply allowing everyone in the company to collaborate, allowing you to
track everything you have done on a new product design, everything you have
done with customers.'
The companies which control the design of multimedia systems will be the
IBMs of tomorrow's data processing industry.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (1): Getting their breath back -

for the future remain. Events of the past year show how sound economic
policies and internationally compatible interest rates are a necessary, but
not sufficient, condition for currency stability

<TEXT>
GLOBAL FOREIGN exchange markets have gone through their most turbulent 12
months since the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in
the early 1970s.
The European exchange rate mechanism has been in almost continual crisis
since September, with the latest aftershocks to the original eruption
forcing devaluations of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo earlier
this month. Unprecedented cross-border flows have forced sterling and the
Italian lira to quit the system and necessitated three devaluations of the
peseta, two of the escudo and one of the Irish punt.
Never has central bank intervention been so large scale or ineffective in
trying to control currency markets. Policy-makers and foreign exchange
market players are still coming to terms with the past eight months' events.
Clearly, special factors exacerbated the original ERM crisis. But in many
ways, the foreign exchange markets were ripe for turmoil.
What was already the world's most liquid market had undergone wide-ranging
changes in the previous five years. Global foreign exchange turnover grew
rapidly with the liberalisation of cross-border financial flows. This rapid
expansion was spurred by the spread and increased sophistication of
technology that reduced transaction costs. At the same time, investment
decisions were increasingly concentrated in the hands of professional fund
managers.
Net turnover in the three largest markets (London, New York and Tokyo) is
estimated to have increased threefold in the past six years: a rate of
growth far exceeding that of world trade or international investment
business. Market surveys conducted by the Bank of England, the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of Japan suggest that global net
turnover now approaches Dollars 1,000bn a day - a sum dwarfing the estimated
Dollars 550bn of currency reserves held by the industrialised countries.
The nature of trading has also changed, making developments less predictable
for policy-makers. Trading of derivative securities has expanded rapidly. In
Britain, for example, spot transactions accounted for only 50 per cent of
gross turnover in 1992, compared with 73 per cent in 1986. Trading in
forwards and swaps increased from 27 per cent of gross turnover in 1986 to
47 per cent last year.
Into this volatile mix have come new players, bringing added muscle and new
attitudes to currency trading.
For years, foreign exchange markets were dominated by the large
international banks, the securities houses, corporate treasurers and central
banks.
These long-established participants have since been joined by institutional
investors, such as pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies, and
the US-based hedge funds. The hedge funds - made famous overnight by the
ability of Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund to make Dollars 1bn from
sterling's devaluation since Wednesday September 16 - have proved to be
especially potent. They are largely unregulated, because they are usually
incorporated in offshore locations, and operate primarily by taking highly
leveraged, speculative positions.
If the hedge funds are the shock troops of the new generation of
speculators, the pension funds are the heavy artillery. A recent study by
the International Monetary Fund cited estimates that the cross-border assets
of the world's leading pension funds could be as high as Dollars 880bn by
the middle of this decade. Already some of this potentially mobile money is
being actively invested in speculative ventures. Hedge fund managers in New
York say that traditionally cautious institutions are entrusting them with a
small portion of their assets in the hope of big gains.
In this volatile climate, the ERM countries paid heavily for failing to
agree a timely adjustment of their parities in response to the exceptional
inflationary pressures unleashed by German unification.
The Danish No vote in the June 1992 referendum on Maastricht exposed the
fragility of so-called convergence plays, in which investors had piled into
high yielding, fundamentally weak ERM currencies such as the peseta, lira
and British pound, in the belief that they would not be devalued in the
approach to economic and monetary union in Europe.
France's decision to hold a referendum on Maastricht on September 20, gave
the markets a firm date to speculate against.
Italy's 7 per cent lira devaluation of early September poured fuel on the
glowing embers, because it was the first ERM devaluation in many years to
exceed the system's pre-set margins of fluctuation and so reward the
speculator.
Reports late on Tuesday September 15 that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, was dissatisfied because sterling had not devalued
further fanned the flames. Although eventually denied, they made the crisis
unstoppable.
The September crisis produced massive windfall profits for many banks and
financial institutions at the expense of the industrial world's central
banks. Although there were some losers - Bank Negara, the Malaysian central
bank, is thought to have lost heavily by backing sterling, and to have
sharply reduced its speculative forays into the market - there were far more
winners.
These developments have presented the world's monetary and regulatory
authorities with a serious headache. And careful examination of the events
leading up to and beyond last September, by experts in the IMF, the Group of
10 leading industrial countries, as well as by the European Community
monetary committee and the EC committee of central bank governors, have
produced no magic formula for avoiding future mishap.
At European level, there is now a rift between those who acknowledge the
need for greater exchange-rate flexibility and those who want to accelerate
the drive to economic and monetary union as a way of pre-empting further
speculative attacks.
The one unanimous conclusion is that the enhanced volatility of the markets
cannot, and should not, be countered by the re-introduction of exchange
controls. Such action is considered to be folly in an increasingly
interdependent world economy.
Central bank intervention is no longer a sufficiently potent weapon to deter
speculative flows. Net sales of D-marks by European central banks totalled
DM284bn in the second half of 1992. But this massive deployment of currency
reserves and central bank borrowings was unable to prevent the devaluation
or floating of the Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, Italian, British, Irish,
Spanish and Portuguese currencies.
True, the successful defence of the French franc by the Bundesbank and
Banque de France showed that large scale intervention can work, provided the
markets are convinced of the determination of the monetary authorities
involved and the credibility of the economic policies they represent. But
victory was costly for France, involving increases in interest rates that
damaged the country's government, economy and banks.
The past year's events show how sound economic policies and internationally
compatible interest rates are a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for
currency stability.
The speculators' enthusiasm for attacking currencies may yet be dimmed by
closer international co-operation and more timely adjustments of exchange
rates.
But fears for the future remain, because the power of the investment
community to overcome defenders of exchange rates will increase in the years
ahead as cross-border investments grow and capital markets become more
integrated.
The foreign exchange markets are likely to remain potentially volatile, at
least until the world's monetary authorities have demonstrated an ability to
impose crippling losses on one of the new generation of players.

FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: BT in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that the organisers of the flotation of the third tranche of BT shares,
labelled BT III, will positively encourage the big institutions to increase
their share stakes in BT before BT III is launched saw BT shares surge ahead
yesterday.
Significantly, turnover in BT stock traded in the market picked up strongly
yesterday, with 15m shares changing hands. 'The BT marketing effort is now
in full swing, and there is a widespread feeling around the market that the
move to reward pre-issue buyers of BT has got the big institutions on the
side of BT,' said one telecoms specialist.
It was pointed out that institutions who sold short of BT shares prior to BT
11 in 1991 were penalised by having their allocations of BT 11 restricted.
Some funds moved to big underweight positions in BT and therefore suffered
post theflotation, having to purchase stock in the open market to regain
weightings.
Dealers said the market is bracing itself for a number of research notes on
BT as the marketing campaign builds up. 'Coded signals in the market suggest
that there will not be many sell recommendations in BT in the next few
weeks,' was the comment of one broker not locked into the flotation process.
BT shares closed 14 1/2 higher at 427 1/2 p. The stock reached an all-time
peak of 442p on March 31 this year, before slipping back after the
resignation of previous finance director Mr Barry Romeril.
A surprise announcement from J. Sainsbury and Boots that the latter would
open pharmacies in several of the former's supermarkets intrigued the
market. Boots shares declined on the news, said by dealers to concern
worries that Boots may have trouble gaining licences. They closed 5 off at
429p.
However, analysts close to the company said they believed Boots would begin
non-prescription drug operations in the event of not getting licences. It
was also suggested that the two groups had already advanced plans to extend
the experiment to a majority of Sainsbury's stores. Sainsbury shares were up
a penny at 469p.
Safeway supermarket owner Argyll Group produced full year profits at the top
end of market expectations, although profit-taking cut short any advance in
the shares. They closed 3 lighter at 314p after turnover of 8.6m. Baring
Securities lifted its forecast to Pounds 460m for next year.
Publicity given to Friday's purchases of Burmah Castrol shares by two of the
company's directors was said to have encouraged persistent support for
Burmah shares, which ran up 8 more to 699p.
Cable and Wireless extended Monday's strong performance, finishing 25 higher
at 749p. The stock was boosted by the impressive performance of shares in
the near 60 per cent-owned Hong Kong Telecom on the Hong Kong market
overnight, and a feeling among stock market chartists that the shares are
now a strong chart buy.
HK Telecom is scheduled to announce its preliminary results tomorrow, with
NatWest Securities forecasting a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
HKDollars 7.38bn. NatWest emphasised 'the flow of positive news out of C and
W and its good earnings and dividend prospects for 1993/94', and reiterated
its long-term positive stance on the shares.
C and W's preliminary figures are due on June 22, with NatWest predicting
pre-tax profits of Pounds 800m, compared with Pounds 644m last time, and a
near 15 per cent increase in the dividend total to 15.2p.
The electronics sector provided a host of strong performers, notably
Tunstall Group, the emergency communications equipment manufacturer, whose
shares raced up 24 to 437p following much better than expected interim
results. Group profits of Pounds 3.2m compared with most market estimates in
the region of Pounds 2.7m.
Quality Software, which peaked at 538p on its market debut last month,
returned to prominence, closing 17 firmer at 496p.
The blow to Speyhawk, whose shares were suspended yesterday at 14p after
calling in the receivers, prompted fresh fears in the sector of a second
wave of receiverships. Mr Graham Stanley at NatWest Securities said such a
move could jeopardise the recovery in investment yields, and he recommended
stocks with strong cash flow rather than those relying solely on an
improvement in property yields.
The Speyhawk move dented the recovery in the property shares seen in recent
sessions, although a spurt in late trading left most of the leaders
positive.
Pharmaceuticals company Medeva rose 3 to 218p after announcing that phase
three clinical trials had begun on a wart treatment that it is developing
with US group Matrix Pharmaceuticals.

FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn EMI pleases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Results at the top end of market expectations sent Thorn EMI ahead 26 to
856p. There was also an element of relief that the figures dispelled some of
the worries overhanging the stock in recent months. These have included
concern over the effect of a US inquiry into rental business, and most
lately over the official UK inquiry into compact disc prices.
Those troubles were largely forgotten yesterday as a welter of upgrades and
buy recommendations were disclosed. In particular, the contribution of
Virgin Records, bought last year, defied the more cautious expectations.
Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett said: 'One of the most attractive aspects
is Thorn's continuing ability to increase its margins in its music
business.' Analysts upgraded profits forecasts to a range of Pounds 360m to
Pounds 385m for 1993-94.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, is to lose Mr
Brian McGowan, its chief executive, sent a tremor through the stock as
investors searched for what might lie behind the resignation announcement.
There were hints that some very downbeat comment on the company would be
made in today's UK newspapers, and the shares fell 14 before rallying to end
a net 10 down at 310p after 6.4m traded.
Mr Geoff Alum at NatWest Securities said: 'McGowan was a good man and this
is a loss in the short term. However, it may prove a turning point in the
long term.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca bounces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securities houses involved in the forthcoming Pounds 1.3bn Zeneca rights
issue were relieved to see a bounce in the shares, which have been drifting
dangerously close to the rights level of 600p a share. The Zeneca ex-rights
price quoted in the official grey market recovered 8 to 630p with 2.4m
dealt, while the nil-paid bounced 6 to 36p on heavy turnover of 3.1m.
Traders said SG Warburg, BZW and Goldman Sachs, the primary underwriters,
were all bidding for stock yesterday. Meanwhile, the ICI 'new' rose 4 to
636p and the existing shares added 8 at 1268p.

FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Chemicals sector pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOURS that Courtaulds, the chemicals group, was poised to announce a
rights issue with its results today depressed the share price in early
dealings, but were finding little credence by the close of trading.
One analyst had warned earlier this week that a bear raid on Courtaulds 'was
not impossible' given the company's net debt of as much as Pounds 400m and
impending demands on shareholders from Zeneca and BT.
Moreover, the specific nature of yesterday's rights rumours - that
Courtaulds would announce a one-for-four cash call to raise Pounds 450m  -
pointed to a bear raid and the shares, down 9 at one stage, turned the
corner in the afternoon to end 9 ahead at 522p. Courtaulds is expected to
announce full year profits of around Pounds 190m today.

FT  26 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Picture brightens towards the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNCERTAIN session in the UK stock market yesterday ended on a more
confident note, with a rebound in the trading issues of Zeneca, which will
be formally demerged from ICI next week, relieving some of the equity
sector's worries over current funding pressures. London was also helped at
the close when Wall Street opened firmly in spite of a sharp fall in US
consumer confidence.
However, market strategists hesitated to put too much faith in yesterday's
gain of 12.1 to 2,837.7 in the FT-SE 100 Index in a session featured by the
appointment of an official receiver at Speyhawk, the UK property group
widely involved in office development in the City of London.
Although the stock market was in plus territory throughout the session,
progress was fitful and equities were often driven by development in stock
index futures, where the June contract on the Footsie lost its fair value
premium during the afternoon.
With the bond market facing a Pounds 3bn auction of government securities
today, the big institutions were still inclined to stand aside from
equities. Seaq volume increased to 591.2m shares but analysts pointed to a
retail worth of only Pounds 1.06bn on Monday's Seaq total of 510.5m shares.
Trading in the non-Footsie stocks slackened somewhat, making up only about
54 per cent of the day's Seaq total. Although finally at another new peak of
3,172.7, the FT-SE Mid 250 was ahead only 4.3 points on the session.
Suspension of Speyhawk shares, ahead of disclosure that a receiver had been
appointed, had a relatively mild effect on a stock market well versed in the
overhanging problems of the property sector, and now focusing on recovery
prospects.
The late uptick in Zeneca issues, seen by some analysts as a sign that the
pre-launch selling may be drawing to a close, had favourable implications
for the market as a whole. Similarly positive was evident support for BT
shares as the campaign for the BT3 sale got under way in the City.
The market is still towards the lower end of its existing trading range and
there were no claims yesterday that the corner had yet been turned. However,
if today's government bond auction passes off satisfactorily, then the stock
market will have cleared another of the hurdles which have been restraining
investment confidence over the past six weeks or so.
Uncertainty over the progress of economic recovery in the UK is also likely
to remain unanswered, at least until the next set of monthly economic data
arrives, with the unemployment statistics expected to remain in the
forefront of the market's collective mind.
Most of the features reflected developments in particular stocks rather than
in wider aspects of the stock market - 'a market for stocks, rather than a
stock market,' commented Mr Paul Harrison at Salomon International.
The strength of the Hong Kong market brought buyers in for some Far Eastern
issues. But most of the blue chip internationals traded quietly, the
pharmaceuticals extending the losses of recent sessions.
On the domestic side, brewery shares rallied from the losses suffered in the
wake of last week's trading news from the sector, but retail stores could
make little progress.

FT  26 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic data fail to give
buyers incentive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS had just a slightly firmer tone in subdued trading yesterday as
news of weakening consumer confidence offset another decline in bond yields,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.85 up at 3,516.63. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 firmed 0.86 to 448.85, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.35 at
695.04. New York SE volume was 222.8m shares.
For the second consecutive day, business on the US stock markets was
relatively light, with investors choosing to stay on the sidelines until a
clearer picture of either the state of the economy, or the direction of
monetary policy, emerges.
Uncertainty surrounding President Bill Clinton's economic plan, which goes
to the vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow, also frightened some
investors away.
News on the economy failed to provide any incentive to buy stocks yesterday.
Although there was positive news, in the form of a 2.7 per cent rise in
April existing home sales, there was also some bad economic news as the
Conference Board announced that its index of consumer confidence fell to
61.5 in May, down from 67.7 in April. The decline was much larger than
analysts had expected, and took the index to its lowest level in six months.
Although the consumer confidence data depressed market sentiment, early
gains in bond prices, which temporarily pushed the yield on the 30-year
issue below 7 per cent, supported stocks. Even a late turnround in bonds
failed to push equities into negative territory.
Amax jumped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 22 3/4 in volume of 3.9m shares on news
that the company will merge with Cyprus Minerals to form a new group with
assets of about Dollars 5bn and combined revenues of Dollars 2.8bn. This did
not encourage investors in Cyprus Minerals, which fell Dollars 1 to Dollars
26 5/8 .
First Chicago rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 after Warburg Securities
upgraded its rating on the banking group's stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy'.
Other banks were firmer as fears of a rise in interest rates receded.
Citicorp put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 28 1/8 , Chemical Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 37 3/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 at Dollars 30 1/4 .
Wal-Mart firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28 3/8 in busy trade after the
retailer launched a Dollars 1bn issue of new debt securities. The issue is
Wal-Mart's second big cash-raising exercise this year: in late-February it
sold Dollars 750m of five-year and 10-year notes.
On the Nasdaq market, Dell Computer plummeted Dollars 7 3/8 , or more than
20 per cent, to Dollars 24 3/4 in volume of 13m shares after the company
reported a sharp drop in first-quarter net income to 25 cents a share.
Canada
TORONTO, after Monday's holiday closure, made headway in most sectors,
contrasting with a setback in the high-flying gold shares group. The latter,
which has led the market in recent sessions, eased in spite of a stronger
close in gold futures.
The TSE 300 index climbed 23.9 to 3,859.9 and rises outscored declines by
394 to 298 after volume of 76.2m shares valued at CDollars 572.8m.
The Bank of Canada key rate fell to 5.10 per cent from 5.40 per cent, which
could prompt the leading Canadian banks to cut prime lending rates from 6
per cent. Second-quarter earnings reports from the six big banks also begin
tomorrow.

make headway

<TEXT>
A RALLY in the futures market triggered by a lower than expected earnings
decline for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone pushed the Nikkei average
moderately higher, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 155.60 at 20,631.76, after reaching a session
peak of 20,730.75 and low of 20,482.58. The Topix index of all first section
stocks put on 7.60 at 1,618.29, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was
0.80 up at 1,243.88.
Volume came to 450m shares, compared to Monday's 414m. Advances led declines
by 667 to 361, with 155 issues unchanged.
NTT, the country's largest telecommunications group, announced a 29.5 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits for 1992.
But brokers said investors, who had expected a greater drop in earnings for
the last financial year, were encouraged to place buy orders. The shares
finished Y13,000 higher at Y998,000.
Some technical analysts said the Nikkei should stay within a narrow range in
the short term, encountering strong resistance at the 21,000 level. The main
reason for this, they added, was because overseas investors have become net
sellers, arbitrage sales have increased recently and fresh incentives are
scant.
Securities house dealers and individual investors are recognised as the
primary buyers in the market, some brokers said, while financial
institutions, life insurance companies and domestic corporations are still
cautious about equity investment.
Ricoh, a leading office automation equipment maker, and the day's most
active issue, rose Y20 to Y762. Brokers said the company continues to
attract interest after forecasting an increase of 61 per cent in pre-tax
profits for the current fiscal year due to restructuring.
Unicharm, a leading manufacturer of sanitary napkins and paper diapers,
climbed Y70 to Y2,550 on good earnings.
Some banking issues moved into positive territory: Mitsubishi Bank advanced
Y40 to Y2,580, Sumitomo Bank Y40 to Y2,070 and Sakura Bank Y20 to Y1,520.
The shipbuilding sector fell on light profit-taking. Mitsui Engineering and
Shipbuilding lost Y12 to Y465, Mitsubishi Heavy Industry Y14 to Y721 and
Kawasaki Heavy Industries Y2 to Y462.
In Osaka, the OSE average appreciated 66.75 to 22,811.82 in volume of 25m
shares.
Roundup
RECORD HIGHS were registered in Hong Kong and New Zealand.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index climbed a further 91.79 to 7,368.18, up 35.5 per
cent since its 1993 low of January 4. It hit the new high on news of a
US-recommended, unconditional renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN)
status, tied to improvements in human rights in 1994.
Turnover expanded from HKDollars 4.89bn to HKDollars 5.76bn.
Hong Kong Telecom and Hutchison Whampoa led the gainers, rising 40 and 60
cents to HKDollars 11.90 and HKDollars 22.50 respectively.
The MFN news encouraged buying of industrial and trade related stocks, with
Yue Yuen Industrial gaining 13 cents at HKDollars 1.91.
NEW ZEALAND topped Monday's previous peak on the strength of the domestic
dollar, the NZSE-40 index closing 9.36 higher at 1,637.62 in turnover of
NZDollars 33m.
Brokers said that the main action was in the better class second-liners but,
among the leaders, Carter Holt Harvey rose 2 cents to NZDollars 3.00 ahead
of Friday's results and Fletcher Challenge moved forward 6 cents to
NZDollars 2.71.
AUSTRALIA saw industrial and finance stocks improve, while interest in gold
shares weakened. The All Ordinaries index advanced 11.9 to 1,697.4 in
turnover of ADollars 293m.
National Australia Bank was the star performer in the banking sector, rising
16 cents to ADollars 9.85 after higher earnings last week.
SINGAPORE and KUALA LUMPUR were mixed, the former registering a 5.59 gain to
1,860.74 in the Straits Times Industrial index and the latter, similarly,
putting on 6.89 to 731.37 in the KLSE comp-osite, while the broader
industrial index slipped 1.94 to 1,266.20.
MANILA's composite index advanced 14.93 to 1592.64, turnover rising from
108.7m pesos to 148.4m pesos.
SEOUL tumbled after seven consecutive days of gains, its composite index
ending 6.64 lower at 727.27 as volume sagged from 49m to 40.2m shares, while
TAIWAN saw the weighted index weakening 31.87 to 4,227.05.
BOMBAY lost further ground following the exchange's decision to ease
restrictions on short selling.
The BSE index closed 53.72 down at the day's lowest level of 2,285.62.

FT  26 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris climbs further on
government plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST bourses closed higher yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS reacted positively to the government's plan to issue a bond which
holders will be able to convert into shares of newly-privatised companies.
The money raised, estimated at some FFr40bn, will be used to finance
spending on infrastructure projects and other job-creation schemes.
The CAC-40 index put on 29.72 or 1.6 per cent to 1,891.09 in turnover of
FFr2.6bn. Mr Andrew Shepherd-Barron, French analyst at Kleinwort Benson,
said that the scheme seemed to be 'very imaginative' in that it sought to
make it attractive for funds to come into the equity market in the gentlest
possible manner, while also answering critics of the budget in doing
something to stimulate the economy.
L'Oreal was one of the few stocks to go against the trend on the day,
falling FFr15 to FFr1,032 after Gesparal, the holding company, said that it
was to offer ordinary shares in exchange for the L'Oreal investment and
voting right certificates held by other investors.
MADRID was encouraged by the Bank of Spain's interest rate reduction. There
was general strength in construction stocks and some individual features in
banks as the general index closed 2.23 higher at 258.90, turnover rising
from Pta16.5bn to Pta25.2bn.
FRANKFURT's bond and equity markets staged a technical recovery in the
morning, the Bundesbank's average bond yield falling 4 basis points to 6.68
per cent and the DAX index recovering 15.09 to 1,618.18. German equity
market turnover eased from DM4.7bn to DM4.5bn.
However, dealers on both sides had more to talk about in the afternoon as
North Rhine-Westphalia, the country's largest state, came in with a better
than expected inflation rate of 3.9 per cent over the twelve months to
mid-May. Bonds picked up further, and leading German equities did likewise
in London trading.
The afternoon gains, however, were not across the board. Continental came
out with a warrant bond and the underlying shares, DM2.10 higher at DM198.60
at the official close, dropped to DM191 in the Frankfurt post-bourse.
AMSTERDAM remained strong in Unilever, up Fl 3.20 at Fl 195.70, but within
the same sector Nutricia fell back sharply on news that it was to recall one
of its brands of baby food from four US states because of possible
salmonella contamination. The shares fell to a day's low of Fl 114.50 before
recovering slightly to close off Fl 4.80 at Fl 117.20.
The CBS Tendency index put on 1.0 to 106.1.
Philips picked up 50 cents to Fl 27.60 news that rival manufacturers might
agree on a common standard for HDTV in the US.
BRUSSELS saw several big blue chips go ex-dividend, including Electrabel,
CBR, Societe Generale de Belgique and Petrofina. Dealers said that this was
the main reason why the Bel-20 index fell, against the general trend, by
13.72 to 1,190.93,
The chemicals group, Solvay, fell BFr300 to BFr11,400 in higher than usual
volume of 13,600 shares. On Monday, it said that it will close around 10 per
cent of its soda ash production.
MILAN registered a sharp fall in Fiat on reports that Mr Cesare Romiti, the
managing director and chief executive, was to be investigated in connection
with the country's corruption scandal. The shares were down L29 to L6,546 at
the fix before slipping further to L6,400 on the kerb.
The Comit index, however, managed a rise of 1.31 to 558.55.
There was some interest in Montedison, which put on L17 to L1,187,
encouraged by recent first quarter results, while Ferruzi gained L23 to
L1,124 and Fondiaria improved on Monday's rise to close up L700 at L31,400.
The latter stock is being assisted by renewed speculation that Ferruzi might
sell either some of Fondiaria's assets or the insurance group as a whole.
OSLO fell in a technical reaction to recent strength, gaining little support
from a new cut in the central bank's overnight lending rate. The all-share
index ended 4.15 lower at 470.76 in moderate turnover.
ISTANBUL accelerated on selective buying of electricity companies, carmakers
and communications groups, the market index closing 192.43 higher at
8,201.19 for a three-day gain of 3.6 per cent. Turnover was estimated to
have risen from TL542.5bn to between TL650bn and TL700bn.
WARSAW's bourse suspended trading in three stocks on account of buying
pressure, and scaled down buy orders for five others because of insufficient
supply.
Prices of 13 out of 17 stocks hit all-time highs and the WIG all-share index
rose 259, or 8.1 per cent to another record of 3,463.1. Turnover was 168bn
zloty.

FT  26 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Shenzhen seeks a sharper image to
attract investors - Equity market regulatory reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Shenzhen market, similar to China's other fledgling stock market in
Shanghai, has proved extremely volatile recently, sliding by about 7 per
cent in the first week of May.
Prospects of tighter supervision over the Shenzhen exchange under new
national regulations, and a growing belief among foreign investors that
Chinese investments are best made through Hong Kong-listed companies, are
among factors taking the gloss off the local markets.
Located in one of China's pioneering special economic zones, Shenzhen has
experienced dramatic ups and downs since formal operations began on July 3,
1991, including riots last August when investors engaged in an unseemly
scramble for new issues.
Ms Chao Xia, an exchange official, says that in spite of a rocky start the
exchange is continuing to expand with a steady build-up of new listings.
Ambitious plans are also in hand for a new stock exchange complex, combining
not only equities trading, but also commodities and futures.
Some 33 companies are listed on Shenzhen's A-share local currency market,
which is open to Chinese investors, while nine companies, restricted to
foreign investors, comprise the B-index. The market also encompasses bond
trading.
According to Ms Chao, market capitalisation of both A and B shares combined
had reached Rmb64bn (Dollars 11.2bn) by the first quarter of this year,
compared with Rmb44bn at the end of 1992. Turnover on both markets reached
Rmb24bn in the first three months.
Some 250 brokers are registered with the Shenzhen exchange. The trading
floor can seat 210, but less than 80 brokerage houses are active at this
stage. Ms Chao says that, like Shanghai, plans are under way to allow
foreign brokers to be represented directly.
On the sensitive issue of whether Shenzhen feels something like a poor
relation compared with the much larger Shanghai bourse, Ms Chao says it is
'policy' not to make comments on each other.
But she does observe that Shenzhen is intent on developing a market with its
own 'characteristics', by which she means that the exchange will provide a
focus for companies in southern China, including those on Hainan island,
which itself is undergoing a devel-opment boom. There are no plans, she
says, for cross-listings between the two.
She attributed Shenzhen's rather sluggish B-share market performance to the
fact that investors were awaiting the listing on the Hong Kong market of a
number of mainland companies, including Qingdao Brewery and Shanghai
Petrochemical.
Ms Chao also indicates that Shenzhen has learned its lesson from last
August's riots, when it sought to list a number of companies, all in one
day, under a lottery scheme which was open to manipula-tion by unscrupulous
local officials.
That episode pushed Beijing into belated efforts to enhance its regulatory
capabilities. Last October the state council, or 'cabinet', announced the
establishment of a securities policy committee and a securities regulatory
commission to advise on securities-related matters.
Both bodies have been advising a special securities law-drafting committee,
which recently circulated a proposed law covering the gamut of equity
securities issues, from insider trading to the operations of futures markets
and the establishment of securities companies and investment funds.
Sensitive, perhaps, to the prospect of national regulation, the Shenzhen
city government recently set up its own supervisory body. To be headed by Mr
Li Youwei, the mayor, the agency will draft laws, codes and rules for the
stock market, an announcement said.
One of its tasks will be to bolster confidence and help eradicate erratic
price fluctuations which appear to be unconnected with the health or
otherwise of companies themselves or of the local economy.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Euromarks retrace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE bearishness towards the prospect of more interest rate cuts in Germany
continued yesterday, although German interest rate futures reversed their
recent trend and rallied slightly, writes James Blitz.
In recent days, the D-Mark's weakness in the wake of Denmark's ratification
of the Maastricht treaty has made investors think that the Bundes-bank might
not be so willing to cut interest rates.
Comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, and Mr Otmar
Issing, the Bundesbank chief economist, have also under-lined the new
caution on German rates.
Both men yesterday raised new doubts about the pace of rate cutting, warning
that such reductions could undermine confidence in the D-Mark.
There appears to be less certainty over when the Bundesbank will next lower
official rates.
One London-based dealer said yesterday it was now fairly certain that there
would be no reduction in the discount rate at the next two Bundesbank
council meet-ings. The repo rate is also unlikely to be cut in today's money
market operation.
Call money was tight yesterday at 7.80 per cent due to end-of-month
liquidity difficulties for banks. The Bundesbank would probably prefer to
add extra funds through paragraph 17 rules or the Lombard rate, rather than
the advantageous repo rate.
However, German interest rate futures enjoyed a mini-rally yesterday, partly
as a result of a technical retracement following a week of heavy falls.
The September Euromark contract rose 10 basis points from its previous close
to finish at 93.52. The June contract continued to be traded far less
heavily, and ended at 92.77, up four basis points on the day.
Sterling interest rate markets enjoyed a rally yesterday following
continuing rumours that Mr John Major's cabinet might be reshuffled.
The September short sterling contract gained 10 basis points on the day to
close at 94.16, while the June contract was up 4 basis points at 94.04.
In the sterling cash market, three-month sterling cash was slightly firmer
at 5 15/16 per cent yesterday, from a previous close of 5 7/8 per cent. The
Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 650m, and the overnight rate
of lending dropped to 3.50 per cent.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar weakens against yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR dropped close to its historic low against the yen yesterday as
dealers took the view that the US would be looking for a stronger Japanese
currency at this week's trade talks between Tokyo and Washington, writes
James Blitz.
The US currency has been under pressure against the yen after last week's
higher than expected trade deficit raised speculation that US officials were
seeking a depreciation of the dollar.
The yen received a further boost yesterday after Mr Lawrence Summers, the US
Treasury Undersecretary, was reported as saying that a stronger Japanese
currency could help to reduce Tokyo's trade surplus.
These comments helped to push the dollar down from Y110.60 at the start of
European trading to a close of Y109.50, within a shade of its all-time low
of Y109.15. In New York it ended at Y109.40.
The dollar's weakness against the yen was also mirrored in its exchange rate
to the D-Mark during European trading yesterday.
A common factor pushing the dollar down against both currencies was a
surprisingly large 6.1 percentage-point fall in the US consumer confidence
index to 61.5 in May. A slight dip to 66.2 had been forecast.
The figure helped to dampen recent speculation that last week's meeting of
the Federal Reserve's open market committee has mandated Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, to raise US interest rates by 50 basis points if he so
wished.
A second factor weakening the dollar against the D-Mark was a growing belief
that the Bundesbank will not ease its repo rate at its weekly money market
intervention today.
The Bundesbank yesterday announced a 14-day securities repurchase tender at
variable rates, but few expect the current lowest rate of 7.60 per cent to
fall. That is partly because Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank
president, and Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank chief economist, have
recently underlined new caution on German rates because of the D-Mark's
recent weakness.
These factors helped to push the dollar down nearly a pfennig against the
D-Mark to a close of DM1.6285. It finished in New York at DM1.6305.
However, the D-Mark enjoyed little new strength against European currencies.
The Swiss franc appreciated against the D-Mark after Swiss National Bank
said it would be taking a closer look at monetary growth in the setting of
interest rate policy.
Switzerland's short term interest dates are currently around 5 per cent, and
yesterday's announcement raised speculation that the Swiss might be cautious
before cutting them again. The Swiss franc ended at SFr0.895 per D-Mark, up
from SFr0.899.
Sterling gained some ground against the D-Mark following a slight upward
revision in the UK's first-quarter GDP figures. It later slipped back to
close unchanged at DM2.5125.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian cotton export quota up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN Cotton Advisory Board has sanctioned the export of an additional
200,000 bales of cotton of 170kg each during the season ending August 1993
after an upward revision of the crop estimate.
Earlier, the board had in phases released export quota totalling 1.5m bales.
It is allowing further exports as the cotton crop estimate for the 1992-93
season has been revised upward to 13m bales from the earlier 12.4m bales.
The total supply of cotton during the year will be over 16.3m bales,
including the opening stock of 3.3m bales. Moreover, the country has
imported 73,000 bales.
According to trade sources, the board should have allowed an additional
export of at least 500,000 bales to shore up the raw cotton prices.
A bumper crop and the delay in the announcement of the export quota have
kept the cotton prices low. But many of the aberrations in the market will
disappear if the government accepts the agriculture ministry suggestion of
total decontrol of raw cotton export.
It wants the abolition of the export quota system which favours the
government agencies and the minimum export prices for the commodity.

THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development is to lend Dollars 174m
to Russia for improving oil production in western Siberia. The loan will be
made to the Purneftegas Oil Producing Association for the rehabilitation of
300 wells.
The US government made a Dollars 50m loan to the Polar Lights partnership,
which was created to develop four oilfields in Russia's polar region. The
Polar Lights joint venture is run by Conoco, the US oil company, and
Arkhangelslgeologia of Russia. They are initially planning to invest Dollars
300m to develop a 100m-barrel oilfield.
Oil from the giant Tengiz field in Kazakhstan is about to hit the markets,
less than two months after a deal to develop the field was signed, said
Richard Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum, Reuter reports.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market unimpressed by bid to
firm coffee prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRODUCERS have started to work hard to put a floor under world
prices. But the markets remain unimpressed, preferring to focus their
attention on the high level of world stocks.
Brazil and Colombia, the world's two biggest producers, overnight on Monday
agreed after a series of high level meetings to freeze stocks and limit
exports to 17m bags and 13m bags (60 kgs each).
At the same time, the Central American producers agreed to withhold 15 per
cent of their coffee production in the 1993-94 coffee year.
Colombia 12 days ago acted independently to set an effective floor of 60
cents a lb below which it will not sell coffee. African producers have also
indicated a desire for some sort of action to shift prices further away from
the 20-year low of 51.65 cents seen in New York last September.
On Monday night, however, the July arabica contract in New York shed nearly
4 cents to 61.45 cents a lb on news that stocks certified against the New
York contract had risen by more than 80,000 bags in a week to 5.7m bags.
Last night the New York July contract was at 63.20 cents a lb in late
trading. London's July robusta contract closed at Dollars 918 a tonne, down
Dollars 15 on the day.
The latest producer moves follow the collapse at the end of March of
negotiations on renewing the international coffee agreement.
Colombia appears to have tacitly admitted that it has been using domestic
stocks to boost its market share as the latest deal sharply curtails its
exports, leaving Brazil with a ceiling of 17m bags - the amount it exported
in the year to the end of March.
In the same time Colombia exported 16.8m bags from a crop of 17m bags, while
the four Central American countries - Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala - exported 10.5m bags.
The countries taking action represent about 60 per cent of world coffee
production. But stocks held by consumers are estimated at between 17m and
20m bags, and as one analyst said yesterday: 'Stocks like that in Antwerp
and Hamburg have a far bigger depressive effect on the market than they
would in producers' warehouses.'
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London broker, said the move would
do very little to tighten the market as Colombia has completed its sales for
last year and will not return to the market until December.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD PALM oil production is forecast to hit a record 13.4m tonnes in
calendar 1993, up 1.35m tonnes from 1992, according to Oil World, Reuter
reports from Hamburg.
Palm oil output is expected to rise 1.3m tonnes to 13m tonnes between
September 1992 and October 1993.
Some 90 per cent of the increase in production has come from Indonesia and
Malaysia, Oil World said in its report.
But an expected 800,000-tonne fall in world output of 16 other oils and fats
in 1993 has caused a switch in demand into palm oil.
China, which remained largely out of the market until March, has now
returned as a fairly heavy buyer of Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil.
The latter two countries are the only major suppliers in the market at
present.
Oil World said China should remain a large purchaser between April and
September this year because Chinese palm oil stocks are low and domestic
demand is high.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North Sea herring's nose dive -
Dutch concerned over depleting stocks of a staple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DER KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the Netherlands about to celebrate the traditional opening of the 'new
herring' season, Dutch biologists are expressing concern that the number of
the fish in the North Sea is starting to decline again after steady growth
throughout the 1980s.
The North Sea's herring population is currently estimated at roughly 1.2m
tonnes, an important gain compared with the late 1970s when stocks were
practically wiped out, though down slightly from the most recent peak of
1.5m tonnes in 1989.
Overall, however, the total still falls well short of the previous target of
2.2m tonnes set by stock managers. It remains far below the 3m-4m tonnes of
the species that swam in the North Sea just after the second world war.
Herring, which can be eaten all year around after freezing but which tends
to be consumed most often in the summer months, is a mainstay of Dutch
fishmongers, accounting for 33 per cent of the average fish shop's annual
turnover.
This year's season opens in the Netherlands today with a traditional charity
auction of the first catch in Scheveningen, the seaside district of The
Hague.
Like the public relations surrounding 'beaujolais nouveau' in the wine
world, the festivities attached to the 'new herring' are designed to bolster
the delicacy status of the country's favourite fish.
The Dutch explanation for the reduced numbers is as regularly recurring as
the marketing extravaganza that accompanies the start each year of the
herring season: Danish trawlers systematically overfish young herring in the
waters of Skagerrak and Kattegat to supply their fishmeal industry,
weakening the ability of the population to reproduce in the North Sea, the
Dutch say.
'The problem remains acute, and Brussels has yet to take sufficient action
against the Danes,' Mr Ad Corten, a biologist and herring specialist at the
Dutch national fisheries research institute RIVO, says.
Still, numbers have improved considerably since all herring fishing was
banned in the North Sea from 1977 to 1981 to give dwindling stocks a chance
to recover. Mr Corten says the recovery of shoals since then shows that
stock management can be successful.
Nevertheless, biologists are concerned about a new policy by the Dutch
government aimed at preserving a 'biological' minimum of fish for population
replacement rather than a minimum number of fish needed to foster stable and
commercially-viable catches. According to Mr Corten, this could lead to
strong fluctuations in the number of herring in the future.
The appellation 'new herring' is a slight misnomer. The fish are generally
three years old and are considered to be at their tastiest in the months of
May and June, when they rapidly put on fat to prepare for the autumn and
winter.
The Dutch fishing industry is hoping for a repeat of the 1991 season, when
the herring were of the right size and the right fat content to make that
year's 'vintage' top quality. In 1992, the herring were smaller and
contained less fat.

OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish metals and mining group, is to modernise the
production facilities at its Harjavalta plant through an investment
programme worth FM1.8bn (Dollars 326.9m), Reuter reports from Helsinki.
'Capacity at the nickel production line will increase to 32,000 tonnes per
year, the copper smelter's capacity will increase to 160,000 tpy and the
copper refinery's to 125,000 tpy,' Outokumpu said.
The programme, to run between 1993 and 1996, includes the copper smelter and
nickel production line located at Harjavalta and the copper refinery located
at Pori, both towns in western Finland.
Nickel production will increase from 18,000 tpy, copper smelter capacity
from 100,000 tpy and copper refinery capacity from 70,000 tpy.
'The raw material required for expanded nickel production will be sourced
from Outokumpu's wholly owned Forrestania nickel mine in Western Australia
and through a long-term purchase agreement for concentrate from Western
Mining Corporation's Mt Keith mine when it starts up in 1995,' Outokumpu
said.
'The copper raw material supply is based on the production of Outokumpu's
own copper mines, existing long-term purchase agreements and additional
future agreements,' Outokumpu said.
Outokumpu said these copper and nickel production facilities would be among
the most efficient units in the world.
'These investments also mean a considerable improvement in terms of
environmental production. The Harjavalta's works' emissions will be reduced
from current levels even though production will almost double.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo American edges RTZ to win
Brazil copper deposit stake
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TUSSLE between the world's two biggest mining companies, RTZ Corporation
of the UK and Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, for a stake in a
world-class copper project in Brazil has been won by Anglo.
The copper deposit, at Salobo in the Carajas region of the Amazon, is owned
by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), Brazil's biggest state-controlled
mining group.
The project, which is expected to cost Dollars 750m, is very important for
Brazil, which at present has to import much of its copper requirements.
Anglo, acting through its Brazilian affiliate, Moro Velho, won the joint
venture race by offering CVRD better terms. Unlike RTZ, it was not insisting
on a majority stake and operational control. Anglo and CVRD will start a
feasibility study which is expected to result in the partners moving ahead
to develop a mine producing 150.000 tonnes a year of copper and 8,000 tonnes
of gold. They hope to complete the study in one year and then to get the
mine into production in another three years.
The Salobo deposit was discovered in 1976. Since then, CVRD has spent
Dollars 120m on it.
CVRD already has established that the ore body consists of at least 700m
tonnes containing 0.7 per cent copper and 0.5 grams of gold a tonnes, with
more ore to be discovered.
Development has been held back because of its unusual ore. It has to be
ground into a very fine powder because the copper is disseminated through
it.
RTZ is continuing talks with CVRD about the possibility of some form of
joint venture associated with nickel deposits owned by the two groups.
Mr Antonio Netto, technical director of RTZ Minercao, the UK group's holding
company in Brazil, said its nickel project at Fortaleza das Minas in Minas
Gerais state is very high grade, with two per cent nickel and 0.5 per cent
copper a tonne. But the reserve of 7-8m tonnes is not enough to support
investment in a concentrator, smelter and refinery, which are needed because
Brazil has none.
CVRD has a nickel deposit in Carajas and it might be possible for the two
groups to share a nickel refinery in Brazil.

Precious metals trading followed a familiar pattern in London as the
commodity funds in New York weighed into the GOLD and SILVER markets pushing
prices sharply higher, dealers said. Gold was fixed in London at Dollars
377.50 a troy ounce in the afternoon, up on the morning setting of Dollars
374.35 which had followed lower overnight prices after a sell-off by the
funds on Monday. The Dollars 372 support level held well and once gold
failed to go through it, upside potential was there. On the LME TIN moved
off the lowest levels since the early 1970s, but still closed easier. The
market, depressed by fundamental oversupply and poor demand prospects, faces
further losses, dealers said. Three-month COPPER was encouraged by Monday's
bounce off Dollars 1,820 support, and gradually pushed higher to test
resistance above Dollars 1,850 a tonne by the close. ZINC rallied away from
Monday's six-year lows, mostly on covering and corrective buying, as there
is little joy in the fundamental picture. LEAD slipped back, as the rally
fostered by Monday's Metaleurop cut faded. ALUMINIUM was mildly supported by
news that Alcoa and Reynolds unions are to hold a strike vote.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kazakhstan moves to promote its
chrome and ferro-alloys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KAZAKHSTAN'S CHROME and ferro-alloys industry, which is being widely blamed
for the low prices causing havoc in western markets, has formed a new
organisation, with some help from western traders, to defend and promote its
interests internationally.
This move comes at a time when it is widely expected in the industry that
the European Commission will shortly impose anti-dumping duties on imports
of ferro-silicon into the community from several countries.
Called the International Chromium Committee of Kazakhstan, the new
organisation's membership includes senior officials from the Donskoye mining
complex near Khromtau, reputed to have the biggest chrome mine in the world
with an annual output of 3m tonnes of ore, and the Yermak ferro-alloy plant,
which produces about 600,000 tonnes of ferro-silicon and 400,000 tonnes of
ferro-chrome a year.
Also involved in the new organisation is the New York-based trading company
AIOC Corporation.
Mr Elliot Spitz, executive vice-president of AIOC, said the move indicated
that the Kazakhstan industry was resisting approaches for it to join with
some western producers and had decided to take an independent direction.
This followed meetings between Kazakhstan officials and US stainless steel
companies recently.
'We are seeing a reorganisation of the basic industries of the former Soviet
Union with associations being formed at national and regional levels.
Various friendly western organisations are helping to establish these
organisations,' said Mr Spitz.
AIOC is also a member of the International Aluminium Committee set up last
month by the Commonwealth of Independent States.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Mixed reception for Abbey National
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National launched a Pounds 500m five-year deal via UBS and SG Warburg,
which met a mixed reception despite being quite attractively priced. Dealers
said the five-year area of the yield curve was still suffering from
oversupply.
Abbey National said the proceeds would be used partly to repay outstanding
debt and partly to meet demand for mortgages, which has been rising for
several months.
If demand for mortgages continues to grow, building societies may find that
they, too, need to raise larger amounts in the wholesale markets due to the
decline in deposits they have suffered.
Abbey's five-year offering yesterday was priced to yield 60 basis points
more than the comparable gilt issue. Dealers said this represented
floating-rate funding of about 15 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate. Abbey recently launched a Pounds 650m 10-year deal and a
Dollars 1bn 10-year offering.
At the long end of the market, Bristol &amp; West Building Society launched a
Pounds 75m issue of 10 3/4 per cent subordinated bonds due 2018, arranged by
Baring Brothers and Hoare Govett.
The deal, which will count towards lower tier two capital for the society,
was priced to yield 190 basis points over the comparable gilt issue due
2017, and met strong demand from UK insurance companies. The long-end of the
market is now the only area of the yield curve to offer double-digit
coupons, which seem particularly attractive in the current low interest rate
environment.
In the dollar bond market, Asian Development Bank's Dollars 500m issue of
10-year bonds via JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers also met a rather mixed
reaction. The lead managers said that they had sold around Dollars 400m of
the issue between them, but some dealers said that the issue looked rather
aggressively priced at 23 basis points over the 10-year Treasury yield,
given the fading performance of the US bond market.
The issue was designed to increase European distribution of ADB's bonds, to
widen the investor base, since the ADB now taps the the yankee bond market
and the dragon bond market separately.
The lead managers said that around 60 per cent of bonds were placed in
Europe.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: German bunds rally on better inflation
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government bonds, which have suffered a sell-off in the wake of
Denmark's vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty a week ago, sprang back to
life yesterday with a half point rally.
The bounce was prompted mainly by technical factors, dealers said, although
the latest inflation figures also helped sentiment, with the state of North
Rhine-Westphalia reporting a 3.9 per cent rise in prices year-on-year.
The bund future contract opened at 93.86 and reached a high of 94.32, ending
the day at around 94.30. Volume was heavy at 83,000 contracts. The DTB June
Bobl future rose to 98.63 from 98.33.
DETAILS of the French government's new FFr40bn bond depressed long-dated
government debt prices, but short-dated issues remained firm.
The June 10-year future settled at 117.10, down 0.06, while the 10-year OAT
yielded 7.19 per cent against 7.18 per cent at the previous close.
THE Bank of Spain trimmed its key money market rate by 25 basis points to
11.25 per cent at yesterday's auction of central bank certificates, giving a
small lift to bond prices. The 10-year 11.30 per cent bond yielded 10.91 per
cent, against 10.92 per cent on Monday.
UK government bonds traded in a narrow range ahead of today's gilt auction
of Pounds 3bn of 7 3/4 per cent stock due 2006, and ended the day slightly
firmer.
Market participants said the gilt market has held up reasonably well ahead
of the auction, helped by healthy overseas interest. 'We haven't seen the
usual pre-auction setback,' commented Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG
Warburg Securities but there was plenty of speculation about how
well-covered the auction will be.
AFTER posting early gains on news of weak consumer confidence, longer-dated
US Treasuries fell back.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 101
7/16 , yielding 7.006 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up
1/32 at 99 7/16 to yield 4.163 per cent.
Prices struggled to make ground in the morning, undermined by a rise in gold
prices, and a fall in the dollar, triggered by comments from a Treasury
under-secretary on Japan's trade surplus being cut due to the strong yen.
Although the long end of the market rallied after the Conference Board
announced that its index of consumer confidence fell from 67.6 in April to
61.5 in May, longer-dated securities gradually slipped back as the dollar
moved lower against leading currencies. Comments from Federal Reserve
chairman Mr Alan Greenspan, who spoke positively of the economic outlook,
also contributed to the late declines.
Prices at the short end recovered from early weakness, however, in the wake
of strong demand for the Treasury's Dollars 15.75bn two-year note auction.
JAPANESE government bonds recouped their early losses to end the day higher,
helped by the combination of a favourable auction result, a generous
injection of funds in the money market by the Bank of Japan, and news
reports that the central bank is worried that long-term interest rates are
too high.
Yesterday's auction of new 10-year bonds went better than expected, dealers
said. The new Y800bn bond issue - known as the No 159 JGB - has a coupon of
4.9 per cent and matures in June 1993. The bonds were sold at an average
price of 100.06, corresponding to a yield of 4.891 per cent.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Emerging market investors
avoid local currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL institutional investment in emerging bond markets remains
largely concentrated on Eurobond issues and Brady bonds, or other
restructured bank loan vehicles, rather than on the local currency markets.
According to a survey of 30 institutional investors active in the emerging
markets - by Kleiman International, a US-based consultancy - Mexico,
considered the most mature of the markets by both debt and equity investors,
is the only one to attract large-scale investment from overseas.
In other emerging markets, local currency markets remain dominated by
domestic and expatriate investors, but all respondents expect local markets
to grow quickly over the next 12 to 18 months.
Ninety per cent of the institutions surveyed have holdings in Mexican Cetes
(Treasury bills) and/or adjustobonos (fixed real interest rate adjustable
bonds) while only 24 per cent hold local currency bonds in any other market.
One-fifth invest in Argentina - in both peso and dollar-denominated
instruments issued locally - while just over 10 per cent hold Venezuelan
paper, mainly central bank zero-coupon bonds. Despite the highly developed
capital markets in Chile, the investor base remains domestic.
In Asia, only 16 per cent have holdings in local markets, mainly in Malysia,
Thailand and the Philippines.
The survey showed that investors' primary concerns are for the
macro-economic and political situation; the next big consideration is the
currency, since a sharp devaluation can wipe out even high bond yields. A
clear government exchange rate policy is necessary for fixed-income
investments, according to those surveyed.
Investors also focus on credit risk, although risks across markets can be
difficult to compare. The governments of Mexico and Colombia mandate local
credit ratings, which are viewed as a useful guide.
Local currency corporate bonds with higher yields than government paper are
starting to attract significant interest, the survey found. Although viewed
as riskier than government paper, investors believe that companies will
benefit more quickly than governments from economic reform.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: FFr40bn bond to finance
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday announced a record
FFr40bn bond issue to finance his economic recovery programme.
He said the new state loan would primarily be aimed at individuals who could
convert their bonds into shares of newly-privatised companies, or put them
into tax-exempt long-term savings plans.
He gave few details except to say that the issue would carry a 'market'
interest rate, and that it only represented a 'short-term' increase in
government borrowing before the proceeds from privatisation started to roll
in the autumn.
The bond issue will have a maturity of four years, Mr Edmund Althandery, the
economy minister, said last night. The coupon on two to five-year French
Treasury notes is around 6.5 per cent.
To attract retail investors, buyers of the issue will be given a preference
in buying shares in companies which the government plans to sell off. Later
today, the government is to list the companies it plans to sell from this
autumn.
The prime minister also said that purchasers of the special bond issue would
get the same tax breaks which, he announced on May 10, would be offered to
people switching their savings out of short-term money market funds into
long-term savings plans.
The Balladur bond 'will probably be treated as a special issue and managed
as a special fund,' Mr Potts said yesterday, like special issues in the past
in France and like the bonds currently issued by the German Treuhand agency.
The finance ministry last night announced a new overall borrowing programme
for 1993. It plans to issue FFr250bn worth of bonds and FFr230bn in two to
five-year notes.
Mr Christopher Potts, an analyst with Banque Indosuez, said that the market
had never coped with such an amount before, 'but there is a lot of money
stacked away in money market funds which could be tapped'.

TELEGLOBE, Canada's overseas telecommunications group, has completed a
CDollars 400m credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions,
Reuter reports from Montreal.
The five-year revolving credit facility replaces four existing banking
facilities totalling about CDollars 300m and will provide additional credits
to fund investment, mostly in telecommunications.
Teleglobe also arranged a USDollars 95m non-recourse financing with
Toronto-Dominion Bank for the USDollars 400m Cantat-3 transatlantic

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Shiseido's turnover keeps its
good looks

<TEXT>
JAPANESE consumers' preoccupation with good looks was apparently little
affected by the economic slowdown in Japan.
Shiseido, the cosmetics group, posted a marginal increase in pre-tax profits
to Y32.4bn (Dollars 294.54m) on sales 3 per cent ahead at Y400.4bn despite
generally depressed consumer spending in Japan.
Shiseido saw strong demand for its toiletries in particular, which account
for more than 24 per cent of its revenues. The toiletries division, which
sells products ranging from shampoo to disposable nappies, is an area into
which the company has been putting a lot of effort.
Meanwhile, the cosmetics division, which accounts for nearly 70 per cent of
turnover, posted a 1.5 per cent increase in sales to Y278.8bn.
Although cosmetics was not immune from the fall in consumer spending,
Shiseido found that shoppers were on the whole loyal to its brands,
particularly in skincare products and to higher end cosmetics products
generally.
Consumers also took to the value-added products launched by the group, such
as its 'whiteness' cosmetics for use against freckles.
Shiseido is emphasising its pharmaceuticals business and is entering the
prescription drugs market with the launch of a medicine jointly developed
with a Japanese pharmaceutical company, which is used in cataract surgery
and cornea transplants.
The company says that this business, which will take it back to its roots as
a pharmaceuticals concern, is four times larger than the cosmetics industry.
Kanebo, the Japanese cosmetics and textiles manufacturer, reported a 48 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to March and a dividend cut.
Parent company taxable profits fell to Y4.49bn from Y8.63bn the year before.
Sales rose nearly 3 per cent to Y510bn.
Kanebo said cosmetics sales, which comprised about 30 per cent of overall
sales, rose 4 per cent but the gain was offset by a 6 per cent fall in
textile revenues.
The company warned that sales would fall further to Y480bn in the current
year while pre-tax profits would more than halve to Y2.3bn due to lower
income from sales of securities and property.

<TEXT>
SEIKO, the leading Japanese watch and clock maker, blamed weak domestic
demand and global recession for a 61.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Y1.3bn (Dollars 11.76m) for the year to March, its second consecutive fall.
The company said the shift in Japanese consumption to lower-priced products
amid the prolonged economic downturn and diminishing exports had put
pressure on earnings.
Net profits fell 23.8 per cent to Y1.1bn and sales by 10.2 per cent to
Y268.2bn. Exports tumbled by 7.4 per cent.
In spite of the sharp plunge in pre-tax profits, Seiko's shares rose Y20 to
Y1,300 on the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday. Analysts said investors had
already discounted the slide and Seiko's shares were likely to excite buying
interest due to its forecast of pre-tax profits soaring 81.8 per cent to
Y2.5bn in the current financial year.
The company predicts sales will move 2.5 per cent higher to Y275bn in tandem
with an improving world economy.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: New orders down 27.6% at
debt-laden Kumagai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUMAGAI GUMI, the ambitious Japanese developer and contractor, has suffered
a 39.7 per cent slide to Y9bn (Dollars 81.81m) in pre-tax profits as its
leading banks intensify the restructuring of the company, which has debts of
Y738bn.
Sales for the year fell 5.8 per cent to Y1,078.6bn, but new orders were down
27.6 per cent to Y900.7bn in the same period, pointing to tough times ahead
for Kumagai.
Japanese contractors have reported a fall in orders due to a decline in
corporate capital spending and the domestic property market slump, but
Kumagai's position is made more complex by its exposure to lossmaking
ventures in the UK and US.
The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan is transferring the former head of its
London branch to Kumagai to head its international operations. He will join
an executive from Sumitomo Bank who is responsible for restructuring the
domestic business, badly bruised by the collapse of property prices.
Kumagai aims to sell Y300bn in properties over five years to reduce its
debt, but the poor health of the domestic and international markets has
meant few sales. Profits on its property business fell 69 per cent to Y4.3bn
last year.
The company must refinance Y64.2bn in warrant bonds this year. It made extra
profits last year by selling off long-term stock holdings which, on book
value, were down from Y35.3bn to Y16.7bn.
Kumagai forecast that sales would fall by about 10 per cent to Y900bn this
year, while pre-tax profits will slide 70 per cent to Y9bn and net profits
by almost 90 per cent to Y1bn. Kumagai is to move management staff to its
sales division, while directors would take a 20 per cent pay cut and
managers would have special allowances halved. It hopes to reduce its debts
by at least Y200bn in the next two years.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nippon Housing suffers Y45bn
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Housing Loan, the ailing Japanese property finance company, yesterday
reported a pre-tax loss of Y45.4bn (Dollars 413m), highlighting the need for
its recent rescue by the founding banks, which have slashed interest rates
on their loans to the institution.
The loss is the first since Nippon Housing was listed in 1984, when it was
lending primarily to new home-buyers.
However, in the late 1980s, the institution ventured into high-risk property
developments, leaving an estimated Y1,200bn in non-performing loans out of a
total portfolio of Y2,140bn.
Nippon Housing reported a net loss of Y55.6bn, compared with a loss of
Y6.5bn in the previous year ending in March, while its operating revenue
fell 40 per cent to Y131.3bn. The difference between its loan receipts and
repayment commitments was Y18.7bn, while it set aside Y27.1bn in loan-loss
reserves.
The company, which did not produce a forecast for the current year, is one
of eight troubled Japanese housing loan companies established by banks and
brokers when the leading banks were concentrating on corporate clients. All
were ambitious lenders during the late 1980s, when the banks became more
interested in home finance and they were forced to find new customers.
Two other housing loan companies, Sogo Jukin and Juso, which was formed by
seven trust banks in 1971, are likely to be weighed down for the next decade
by their non-performing loans even though their founding banks have agreed
to accept virtually no interest repayments on loans to the institutions.
The 65 founding banks at Sogo Jukin are expected to reduce their interest
rates to zero, while agricultural institutions, big lenders to the housing
loan companies, will take a less severe cut from about 6 per cent to 4.5 per
cent, essentially because of their political influence.
Nippon Housing, listed on the Tokyo exchange, is the only one of the eight
companies that is required to produce a full statement of accounts, but its
figures are likely to be fairly typical of the group.
Cash on hand was down 44 per cent on the year, while it sold half of its
investment stocks during the year and is showing a book loss of Y23bn on the
remaining stocks.

improving trend continues

<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transport group, stayed deep in the red in the nine
months to March, but its directors have pointed to an improving underlying
trend which continued in the current quarter.
The company said its net equity-accounted loss for the nine months had grown
to ADollars 92.04m (USDollars 63.5m) from ADollars 88.96m on revenue of
ADollars 4.07bn, down from ADollars 4.69bn.
However, at the pre-tax level TNT managed a turnround to profits of ADollars
4.2m from losses of ADollars 56.9m, largely reflecting lower interest and
depreciation charges. The interest provision fell to ADollars 69.9m from
ADollars 84.4m and depreciation was down to ADollars 74.8m from ADollars
107.2m.
A net abnormal loss of ADollars 50.5m against a loss of ADollars 10.8m
previously and a rise in the tax provision to ADollars 45.3m from ADollars
20.9m saw the bottom line slide into the red.
TNT directors said the result was influenced by seasonal factors and a
deepening recession in Europe. 'Despite these negative factors, the group
recorded a modest improvement in operating results,' they said.
'While the economic outlook worldwide is expected to remain difficult, it is
anticipated that the improvement in operating performance. . . will continue
for the last quarter.'
They said the GD Express Worldwide operation had continued incurring losses,
but a plan to achieve profitability within two years was attainable. They
said the company's domestic freight businesses in the UK and Italy made
excellent profit contributions, TNT Germany traded profitably, but Spanish
freight operations were hit by continuing recession.
TNT Canada lifted profits, while Awas, the aircraft leasing operation
jointly-owned with News Corp, made a reduced profit contribution. Directors
said abnormal losses mainly comprised a ADollars 52.5m provision for GD
Express, unrealised currency losses and tax changes.

SUMITOMO Electric, Japan's largest manufacturer of wires and cables,
yesterday posted a 15 per cent drop in parent pre-tax profits to Y30.4bn
(Dollars 276.36m) for the year to March from Y35.9bn the year before, on a
downturn in Japanese capital spending.
Sumitomo, which supplies wires and cables to NTT, as well as power companies
and automobile manufacturers, also reported a 5 per cent fall in sales to
Y761.2bn.
Sales for the year to March 1994 are forecast at Y760bn with pre-tax profits
at Y31bn, as the benefits of cost-cutting measures show through.

DIGITAL Equipment, the US computer group, is to open a wholly-owned
subsidiary in South Africa, AP-DJ reports from Johannesburg. The new
subsidiary, Digital Sales &amp; Services South Africa, will begin operations on
July 1.
Digital estimates South Africa's annual investment in information technology
is Dollars 1.7bn, making it the largest market in the world without a
Digital presence.
'Many of our major international customers operate here and they have asked
Digital to come and support them as we do elsewhere,' said Mr Alberto
Fresco, Digital Europe's vice-president.
Digital, the world's third-largest computer company, said it had been
monitoring the economic, political and social climate in South Africa for
two years and decided it was time to participate.
The new subsidiary would offer Digital's full range of open, networked
computer systems, services and systems integration for personal computers to
mainframes.
Mr Alan Peters of Digital Europe has been made general manager of the
subsidiary. The majority of employees would be South African.
Ms Sallie Crenshaw, Digital's international trade director, said the company
would begin with 50 employees, including four senior US-based Digital
managers who would help set up the local operation and develop their local
management replacements before returning to the US.
The company hoped to have 200 local employees by 1996. 'We hope this will
send a signal of commitment and confidence to other foreign investors
considering the South African market,' she added.

Motor downturn

<TEXT>
YAMAHA Motor, the motorcycle maker, unveiled a 33.7 per cent fall to Y4.97bn
(Dollars 45m) in pre-tax profit for the year to March, but would have
reported a far larger drop without a surge in demand from China and other
east Asian countries.
Sales for the year were 1.9 per cent lower at Y471.5bn, mainly due to a 11.2
per cent fall in domestic motorcycle sales. Motorcycle exports were 4.6 per
cent higher, but profits on those sales were eroded by the appreciation of
the yen during the year.
Exports accounted for 62.7 per cent of total sales, including those of
marine craft, up from 58.8 per cent in the previous period, and a sign of
the Yamaha's vulnerability to fluctuations in the yen's value.
The company's car engine business is still struggling, as sales during the
year fell to Y35.9bn from Y39.7bn, while sales of marine craft were down
10.6 per cent to Y96.5bn.
Yamaha forecast a 4 per cent rise in sales this year to Y490bn, as it
expects domestic sales to recover during the period, but it still forecast
another 9.5 per cent decrease in pre-tax profit.

parent pre-tax income

<TEXT>
TDK, the world's largest manufacturer of magnetic tapes, yesterday unveiled
a 43 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits to Y18.9bn (Dollars 171.8m) for
the year to March, in the face of a sharp downturn in the Japanese economy.
Sales dropped 10 per cent to Y367.3bn, while net profits fell by 43 per cent
to Y10bn.
In particular, sales of electronic materials and components were adversely
affected by the sluggishness of the Japanese economy and fell 10 per cent.
Recording media sales, meanwhile, slipped 9 per cent, due in part to a
decline in tape exports to Europe resulting from the opening of a new
factory in Luxembourg.
While demand from computer manufactures was buoyant, that from audio and
video manufacturers was very weak, TDK said.
Consolidated pre-tax profits fell 30.9 per cent to Y33.5bn - having also
been affected by the sharp appreciation of the yen - and growth in overseas
business was not able to offset the slump in Japan.
TDK expects parent pre-tax profits to increase marginally to Y19bn on sales
1.5 per cent up to Y362bn.

KMART, the Michigan-based retailer which has been struggling to improve
performance in the highly-competitive discount store market, yesterday
claimed that its Dollars 3bn store renovation programme was producing
results. It also acknowledged that it was considering selling minority
interests in some of its specialty store subsidiaries.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, told shareholders at the group's annual
meeting that annualised same-store sales growth from outlets which had been
overhauled was running at about 6 per cent. He also said that the group of
stores which the US retailer acquired in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was
being refurbished, and that 're-openings' were planned for next autumn.
The sales growth from the overhauled domestic stores is substantially better
than for the group overall. In the first quarter of 1993, when Kmart
reported an 80.7 per cent fall in after-tax profits, comparable store sales
in the general merchandise division rose 1.4 per cent.
Meanwhile, there was further evidence of problems in the US discount store
sector yesterday when Waban, the Massachusetts-based retailer, announced
that Mr John Levy had resigned as president and chief executive. Waban is
the smallest of the five major operators of 'warehouse clubs', the
ultra-cheap retail barns which have expanded hugely in recent years, but
whose future growth potential is now being questioned.
Wal-Mart itself was also active yesterday, launching a Dollars 1bn issue of
debt securities, according to reports in New York.

fall short

SHARES in Dell Computer tumbled more than 20 per cent yesterday after the
group reported first-quarter earnings well below expectations and said it
would not meet its full-year forecast. The shares fell Dollars 7 3/8 to
Dollars 24 3/4 on the Nasdaq market in New York.
Poor results from the notebook computer business were blamed for the drop in
net income to Dollars 10.2m, or 25 cents a share, from Dollars 19.8m, or 52
cents.
The company said significant costs associated with delayed and cancelled
notebook projects combined to lower pre-tax income by more than Dollars 20m
and earnings per share by as much as 35 cents.
Mr Bruce Sinclair, managing director of Dell in the UK, where sales and
profits grew strongly through the quarter, said the company had
underestimated the resources necessary to design and manufacture world-class
notebook computers.
Dell's problem is worrying because the notebook computer sector is
fast-growing and it has an excellent reputation for quality products. Taken
together with sharply rising costs, there are concerns senior management has
lost its sharp focus on the market.
Mr Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive officer, said the delays and
cancellations would continue to hit earnings over the next two quarters.
'As a result, we no longer expect to reach our earnings forecast of Dollars
3.30 for this fiscal year. But, because of the strong momentum in our core
desktop and server business, we believe we can achieve revenues in excess of
Dollars 3bn this fiscal year.'
Industry analysts felt Dell's problems may go beyond notebook computers.
They noted that costs were increasing - cost of sales grew from Dollars
270.1m to Dollars 559.2m - as the company expanded distribution worldwide at
a time of low profit margins for the personal computer industry.
An official at rival Compaq Computer said its notebook products were in
strong demand and the company expected to overtake Toshiba of Japan as the
number one supplier of notebook computers in Europe in the current quarter.
Dell's sales in the quarter rose 84 per cent to Dollars 672m despite the
notebook shortfall. Sales to leading corporate, government and educational
accounts more than doubled at Dollars 330m. Those to medium and small-sized
businesses and individual customers showed gains of 76 per cent to Dollars
259m.

HYDRO-QUEBEC, one of Canada's two biggest electrical utilities and a big

The first quarter usually provides most of the year's earnings because of
high industrial, commercial and consumer demand in the severest months of
winter. However Hydro-Quebec forecasts confidently it will earn at least
CDollars 760m for the full year, well up from 1992, despite the slow

The utility is 100 per cent owned by the government.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Court gives approval to E-II
reorganisation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE tussle over E-II Holdings, the bankrupt parent company which owns
Samsonite luggage, Culligan water treatment and McGregor menswear, ended in
the early hours of yesterday morning with a Manhattan bankruptcy court judge
approving the company's amended reorganisation plan.
E-II, which has had a complex history over the past five years, became the
centre of a struggle between two leading creditors - Mr Leon Black, formerly
a senior banker with Drexel Burnham Lambert, and Mr Carl Icahn, former owner
of Trans World Airlines and a corporate raider in the 1980s.
Mr Icahn opposed the reorganisation plan, arguing that it gave control of
the ongoing company to Mr Black at too cheap a price.
At the last minute, Mr Icahn offered to buy E-II for Dollars 1.18bn in cash,
and when that proposal was turned down, made (or arranged) offers for the
separate operating business-es.
Meanwhile, E-II and its advisers, having dismissed Mr Icahn's initial offer
last Friday, made last-minute amendments to its plan of reorganisation,
revising upwards their estimates of the company's value  - and thus
countering some of Mr Icahn's criticism.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Accounting change puts Varity
into deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY BENNALLACK-HART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VARITY, the US automotive, farm and industrial equipment maker, reported
first-quarter income of Dollars 11m before one-off charges of Dollars 146.1m
for changes in accounting methods. The group suffered a net loss of Dollars
2.4m in last year's first quarter.
Earnings per share were shown at 20 cents before the charge, with a loss per
share of Dollars 4.50 after the charge. Last time, the loss per share was 28
cents.
Sales fell to Dollars 645m from Dollars 823.8m, reflecting the disposal of
several businesses last year to reduce debt and fund future growth.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman and chief executive officer, said the disposals had
had an immediate impact on earnings. After reducing consolidated debt by
more than Dollars 800m last year, he said, interest expense was Dollars
10.7m in the quarter, down more than 70 per cent on last year.
He added that continuing robust US car production and worldwide acceleration
of ABS applications were 'favourable developments' for the group.
Kelsey-Hayes, the automotive components unit, reported sales of Dollars 302m
and operating income of Dollars 25m, up 39 per cent adjusted for disposals.
Massey Ferguson turned in operating losses of Dollars 2m on sales of Dollars
189m. Mr Rice said this was a respectable performance because the first
quarter was traditionally the weakest in the farm equipment sector while
Europe - Massey's main market - was down 10 per cent.
Perkins' operating income was steady in the quarter despite the recession in
Europe, while sales were down 13 per cent to Dollars 158m - although they
would have been unchanged after allowing for currency fluctuations.
Varity said order rates for shipment later in the year had improved
significantly on year-ago levels.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Korean companies, Korea Zinc and Samsung, have come to the rescue of
Curragh Resources, the Canadian zinc producer which filed for bankruptcy
protection last month.
Curragh said yesterday that it would receive CDollars 50m (USDollars 39.3m)
of new equity from the two Korean groups, subject to the completion of a
financial restructuring and several other conditions.
The Korean groups will own about 50 per cent of the restructured company,
although this would be cut to 43.5 per cent after the exercise of options by
other shareholders. Curragh said it was pursuing efforts to raise another
CDollars 25m of new equity.
The involvement of the Koreans means that Curragh's big zinc mine at Faro in
the Yukon, which is mothballed, will re-open in September.
The company and the Yukon government would also be committed to completing
the nearby Grum mine. Yukon would be required to provide 'long-term
competitive power rates'.
Other zinc producers have criticised the Yukon government's backing for the
Faro and Grum mines at a time when the world zinc market is heavily
over-supplied.
Curragh suffered a CDollars 66m first-quarter loss, on net sales of CDollars
20.4m.
Besides being hit by low zinc prices, the company has been battered by the
repercussions of an explosion at its Westray coal mine in Nova Scotia last
year in which 26 people were killed. It took a CDollars 23.9m writedown on
the investment.

<TEXT>
SAURER, the Swiss textile machinery and motor components group, said net
income jumped 68 per cent in 1992 to SFr21.4m (Dollars 14.54m), due to
improved operating results and the consolidation of new businesses.
Turnover more than doubled to SFr1.81bn following the consolidation of the
German Schlafhorst textile machinery group and the US metals company, Xaloy.
Textile machinery accounted for three-quarters of turnover.
At the operating level, the group turned round from a SFr85m loss to a
SFr55m profit.
Mr Melk Lehner, the chief executive, said the textile division operating
result improved by some SFr140m, mainly as a result of cost-cutting.
The motor components division, which makes transmissions for special
vehicles, reached break-even last year and would benefit this year from the
devaluation of the Italian lira.
Mr Lehner said the group was still aiming to acquire a 15 to 20 per cent
stake in Rieter, the Swiss textile machinery company. It now holds 14 per
cent.
Rieter said in a letter to shareholders in April that it intended to remain
independent.

HYDRO-QUEBEC, one of Canada's two biggest electrical utilities and a big
international borrower, posted CDollars 520m (USDollars 409m) net profit for
the first quarter, up 16 per cent from a year earlier. The group benefited
from rationalisation and lower interest rates.
The first quarter usually provides most of the year's earnings because of
high industrial, commercial and consumer demand in the severest months of
winter.
But Hydro-Quebec forecasts confidently it will earn at least CDollars 760m
for the full year, well up from 1992, despite the slow recovery.
The utility is 100 per cent owned by the Quebec government.
Last year's heavy rainfall refilled reservoirs after two lean years, so that
in the first quarter it was not forced to buy higher-cost power from New
Brunswick and Ontario to meet peak demand.
Industrial demand was strong, particularly from smelting and pulp and paper,
where operating rates were high. Exports of power to the US were up
slightly, while operating expenses overall fell 5.2 per cent. The 1993
investment programme totals CDollars 4.4bn.

ESSELTE, the Swedish office products group, yesterday reported profits after
financial items down 23 per cent to SKr114m (Dollars 15.61m) in the first
four months, compared with SKr149m in the corresponding period last year.
The group was hit by the economic slowdown in leading European markets, with
sales in some countries falling by as much as 15 per cent.
But Esselte said it still expected full-year profits to be ahead of last
year's SKr259m, due to the heavy currency losses and non-recurring
rationalisation charges which held back 1992 performance.
Preliminary figures for the first four months showed sales 14 per cent ahead
of last year's SKr3.34bn at SKr3.81bn. But the company said the real
comparable result was a fall of 6 per cent after the effects of last
autumn's heavy devaluation of the Swedish kronor was taken into account.
A bright spot was an upturn in the US and Canada, which account for 27 per
cent of group turnover. But there were declines in sales of up to 15 per
cent in leading markets, such as France and Spain, and 'a big question mark'
hung-over performance in Germany, the company added.
The group, which once employed more than 17,000 people, continued to shrink,
with the number of employees declining to 11,682 by the end of April.
'We are confident now that we have control over our costs. If the market
continues to go down, we can cut further, but when it goes up we believe we
are set to increase our market share,' the spokesman said.

Ford

DETERIORATING economic conditions in continental European countries mean
that Ford Motor no longer expects to be operating in the black in the area
this year, Mr Wayne Booker, head of the company's international automotive
operations, said yesterday.
Earlier this year, Ford had declared that its goal was to break even or
better in Europe in 1993.
This would reverse last year's losses, but in April the company announced a
first-quarter European loss of Dollars 82m.
Mr Booker, speaking at a New York press briefing, said that when the company
made its earlier projections it had not expected the current 20 per cent
decline in the continental vehicle market, due to slowdowns in all the
leading economies.
A mild recovery in the British economy, where Ford is the car market leader,
was not likely to offset the continental decline.
Ford now expected total demand in Germany to be around 3.8m units this year,
compared with nearly 4m in 1992 and the peak of 4.2m reached after
unifica-tion.
The company's results would also be affected by currency weakness in some
countries, notably Italy, where it has 12 per cent of the market share.
However, Ford expected to gain market share in Europe, due largely to the
introduction in March of its new medium-range car, the Mondeo.
Turning to Asia, Mr Booker said Ford might consider making a making a large
capital expenditure in China in two to three years' time.
One of the reasons the group had been reluctant to enter the market was the
lack of a local supplier base, but Ford's automotive components group
recently signed letters of intent with two Chinese automotive suppliers to
study possible joint ventures around Shanghai.
Ford is also expected to announce next month the names of the first of a
chain of dealerships it is establishing in China.

DEERE and Company, the tractor and heavy equipment maker, intends to reduce
its western European workforce by 25 per cent and to take an Dollars 80m
charge to second-quarter earnings to cover the restructuring.
The company reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 110.2m, or Dollars
1.44 per share, before the charge. Including the charge, Deere earned
Dollars 30.2m, or 39 cents, against last year's second-quarter results of
Dollars 44m, or 58 cents.
Deere intends to reduce its European workforce by 2,000 people in the next
few years, with about 1,200 of the redundancies to be recorded in 1993.
It has 8,000 employees in Europe, and makes agricultural machinery and
engines at plants in Germany, France and Spain.
Strong sales in North America offset weakness in Deere's European operation,
said Mr Hans Becherer, chairman. 'Excluding the restructuring charges,
results for the quarter were significantly better than last year as a result
of substantially improved North American operations.'
Worldwide sales and revenues increased by 13 per cent to Dollars 2.10bn in
the second quarter, from Dollars 1.85bn last time. Of the total, North
American equipment sales were up 20 per cent at Dollars 1.34bn, and overseas
equipment sales rose 3 per cent at Dollars 448m. Its financial services arm
had second-quarter sales of Dollars 295m, up 7 per cent over the second
quarter of 1992.
Worldwide production tonnage was up 7 per cent in the second quarter, and is
now projected to be 8 per cent higher for the year.
Deere said its new tractor line enjoyed strong sales in the second quarter,
but European results remained soft.
'Although reception of our new tractor line has been positive, industry
retail sales of agricultural equipment in Europe are expected to continue
the downward trend of recent years as European agriculture goes through a
period of fundamental change,' Mr Becherer said.
'As a result, our overseas margins continue under considerable pressure.'

MODO, one of Sweden's leading forestry groups, suffered a SKr200m (Dollars
27.39m) loss after financial items in the first quarter.
The group warned it would remain in the red for the rest of the year, even
if market conditions showed some improvement.
The company blamed the deficit on its French unit, which recorded a loss of
SKr310m, SKr180m more than a year ago, because of low prices and the
strength of the French franc.
By contrast, it noted that its Swedish operations were back in profit,
thanks to lower production costs and the kronor's depreciation.
The latest result is an improvement on the first three months of last year
when the group made a SKr244m loss after financial items.
But the group said that despite the weaker kronor, prices for many of its
products had fallen sharply as a result of last autumn's currency
turbulence.
'We believe prices have now stopped falling. Towards the end of the year the
market situation ought to start to improve, which should increase the
chances of lifting prices,' said Mr Bengt Lof, chief executive.
Sales in the latest period rose to SKr4.32bn from SKr4.19bn and operating
profit increased to SKr164m from SKr43m.
The company said it expected a negative result this year, despite SKr700m in
cost savings. Last year, the company suffered a SKr1.7bn loss.

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the leading US long-distance
telecommunications group, yesterday linked with Kokusai Denshin Denwa of
Japan and Singapore Telecom to create a formidable new competitor in the
fast-growing market for global business communications services.
AT&amp;T also wants to form alliances with European telecommunications groups,
but - in a move likely to put pressure on these companies - it said for now
it would go ahead with its own European system. It would be introduced in
1994 and involve spending Dollars 350m over five years.
Other leading telecommunications companies, such as British Telecom and MCI
Communications of the US, have been trying to build up their own global
networks, but AT&amp;T's deal is the most far-reaching pact yet announced.
It said yesterday that customers of its 'Worldsource' service would get
one-stop shopping for ordering, provisioning and maintenance around the
globe. Billing would be consolidated in a customer's choice of country,
language and currency.
The service will be available later this year in North America and the
Asia-Pacific region.
AT&amp;T is forming an association with KDD and Singapore Telecom, which expects
to spend over Dollars 100m to provide services to customers in the
Asia-Pacific region over the next few years.
AT&amp;T said Telstra, Australia's long-distance company, Unitel Communications,
a new Canadian long-distance company, and Korea Telecom also planned to join
the association.
While AT&amp;T has been in discussion with European telecoms companies, it has
yet to reach agreement with any on membership of the association.
It therefore intends to go ahead itself, and will add to its network
management centres in Britain and the Netherlands by setting up new service
systems in leading European business centres.

approach

<TEXT>
MR JOSE Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, General Motors' former global purchasing
chief, first approached arch-rival Volkswagen before Christmas last year,
according to Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman.
'He got in touch with me. I did not try to woo him,' Mr Piech said yesterday
in an interview with the Financial Times.
Mr Lopez, currently at the centre of a storm over alleged industrial
espionage, eventually quit GM and joined VW in mid-March.
'We got to know each other and discovered we thought in similar ways,' Mr
Piech said.
Mr Lopez's move had nothing to do with money, Mr Piech said. 'He has less
income now than he had before.'
The timing and the nature of the contacts between the two men, around six
months after Mr Lopez was promoted to the top ranks of GM in the US, puts
paid to speculation that he was lured away by Mr Piech.
It suggests that Mr Lopez was planning his defection over an extended
period. He was followed by seven former colleagues, who are due to appear in
court in Frankfurt today to challenge a legal attempt by GM to prevent them
from continuing to work for VW for up to one year.
The court case is one of several launched by GM and Adam Opel, its German
subsidiary, based on their belief that Mr Lopez and his team took secret GM
documents with them when they left Detroit.
Mr Piech disclosed yesterday that VW had already successfully fought several
legal skirmishes with GM. 'We have four rounds behind us and VW has made no
mistakes.'
The VW chairman, who on Monday broke his recent silence with a statement
supporting Mr Lopez, said any possible legal charges would be answered in
court.
Mr Piech dismissed suggestions that VW's actions in hiring away Mr Lopez and
his seven colleagues from GM had caused widespread dismay in German
industry, and was at odds with the style of German business.

investors.
The swap, which involves Gesparal giving four shares for every five
investment certificates, and two shares for five voting right certificates,
comes amid speculation about the long-term ownership of L'Oreal.
Gesparal, which controls L'Oreal with a 55 per cent holding, is
majority-owned by Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, daughter of L'Oreal's founder.
Nestle, the Swiss foods group, owns the remaining 49 per cent.
Yesterday's share swap, which involves Gesparal buying 2.9m investment
certificates and 95,000 voting right certificates, is meant to modernise
L'Oreal's share structure.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Tougher competition hits profits
at NTT

<TEXT>
NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), Japan's privatised telecommunications
group, suffered a 29 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits, to Y247.2bn
(Dollars 2.25bn), for the year to the end of March. It said it faced intense
competition from newer entrants into the domestic telecommunications market.
The company came under increasing pressure from its competitors, forcing the
group to reduce some long-distance inter-city rates to maintain market
share.
Competition has been especially intense in the profitable routes between
Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, where new private telephone service companies
already have more than 50 per cent of the market.
The effect of NTT's rate cuts showed through in its operating revenues,
which fell to Y5,892bn, down 2.7 per cent from the previous year.
Meanwhile, the weakness of Japan's economy led to a slowdown in telephone
subscriptions, NTT said.
In the face of a difficult business environment, the group has had to
maintain capital investment at high levels to modernise the telephone system
and invest in remote areas.
NTT's parent results were also affected by the separation of its mobile
communications business - one of the most profitable for the group - into a
separate company. This contributed to the overall fall in its operating
revenue.
In an effort to trim costs and raise profitability, NTT announced earlier
this year it would reduce its workforce by 30,000 over the next three years,
and cut its retail outlets by one-third. It is slashing management bonuses
and cutting recruitment by one-third.
NTT has also applied to Japan's ministry of posts and telecommunications for
permission to raise its phone rates.
NTT is forecasting a further fall in pre-tax profits, to Y149bn, in the
current year.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: SE Banken aid still under review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish government said yesterday negotiations on a rescue package for
loss-burdened Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken were continuing, despite market
speculation that the bank might not need state assistance following its
improved first-quarter result.
'They have handed in a formal application for support (last December) and
their application has not been withdrawn. That is where the issue stands,'
said Mr Stefan Ingves, director-general of the Bank Support Authority, the
state body set up to tackle the country's banking crisis.
The government announced in February it had concluded that SE Banken, which
suffered a SKr5.37bn (Dollars 735.6m) operating loss last year, required
state support. Mr Ingves said the situation had not changed as a result of
SE Banken's quarterly results, which showed a sharp cut in losses and a
shrinking of its portfolio of non-performing loans.
However, he declined to comment on the likely extent of the assistance, or
say when negotiations with the bank would be completed.
SE Banken's shares have risen more than five-fold in value since the
publication of its first-quarter figures at the end of April. Yesterday, the
most-traded A shares closed at SKr38.5, up SKr1 on the day. An important
factor fuelling the surge has been speculation that the requirement for
state aid would be limited, or even eliminated.
The bank repeated its own warning that its loan losses remained very high,
and that 'great uncertainty' continued to cloud the outlook for the full
year. Mr Bjorn Svedberg, chief executive, has said he hoped an outline
agreement on government support would be reached before the midsummer
holiday.
Mr Ingves said it was still to early to say what the banking crisis would
finally cost the government. So far, the state has put up SKr67.5bn in a
mixture of loans, guarantees and equity injections. It now owns Gotabank and
Nordbanken, two of the country's four principle banks.
He said it would take until the end of the year to strip out all the bad
loans - mostly to the commercial property sector - from Gotabank into a
legally separate 'bad bank', leaving the remainder to be re-privatised in
one piece or broken down into units. The government has already distributed
an investor memo for the sale of Gotabank, eliciting 20 expressions of
interest from Swedish and foreign investors.
Mr Ingves said Gotabank had used up about SKr6bn of the SKr10bn advanced to
it in guarantees. 'It is going to cost a lot of money,' he said. 'The
government is not going to get all its money back.'
He said he did not anticipate selling off Nordbanken at least until next
year. The bank support authority has already stripped out SKr50bn in bad
loans from the bank, allowing it to show a first-quarter operating profit
following a SKr16bn loss in 1992.

FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hermes to offer 4% of shares to
public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERMES, one of France's most famous luxury goods groups, yesterday finalised
plans to go public by floating 4 per cent of its shares on the Paris second
market at FFr300 each.
The flotation, which values the group at FFr3.2bn (Dollars 580m), will
involve the sale of 425,000 shares. The founding family's stake in Hermes,
best-known for its silk scarves and classic Kelly bags, will fall from 90
per cent to 81.4 per cent.
Hermes was founded in the 1830s in Paris as a manufacturer of horse
harnesses. The business has been run by the Hermes family since, but was
given a new lease of life under the management of Mr Jean-Louis Dumas in the
flourishing luxury goods market of the 1980s.
The luxury business has since slowed down, reflecting the economic pressures
of recession.
Hermes has emerged unscathed, mainly due to its skill at emphasising its
classic styles and hand craftsmanship. It saw net profits rise from FFr121m
in 1991 to FFr176m, on sales of FFr2.46bn, in 1992 and anticipates a modest
increase to FFr180m for 1993.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMAX and Cyprus Minerals, two of North America's largest integrated mining
companies, have agreed to combine most of their core operations to become
Cyprus-Amax.
The new company will have assets of about Dollars 5bn and total revenues of
Dollars 2.8bn, on the basis of 1992 figures. It will be the second-largest
copper company and the second-largest coal company in the US.
Prior to the merger, Alumax, Amax's big aluminium producing subsidiary, will
be spun off to Amax shareholders as an independent company. Amax will also
distribute a 28 per cent interest in Amax Gold to Amax shareholders.
About 32 per cent of Amax Gold is held by the public. Amax Gold had year-end
reserves of about 8.6m ounces.
The deal comes in the wake of Amax losses for 1992 of Dollars 148m, or
Dollars 1.71 per share, before special charges, on sales of Dollars 3.7bn.
The company passed its June dividend. Alumax, which produces two-thirds of
Amax's revenues, had a first-ever operating loss of Dollars 51m.
Mr Milton Ward, Cyprus president, estimates the merger will allow the
combined operations to make annual cost-savings of more than Dollars 100m.
As well as share positions in Alumax and Amax Gold, Amax shareholders will
receive one Cyprus share for each five Amax shares held, subject to
adjustments for price fluctuations in Cyprus stock. At the end of April,
there were 87.9m Amax shares and 47.3m Cyprus shares outstanding.
Cyprus-Amax will assume about Dollars 1.2bn of Amax's long-term obligations,
leaving Alumax with about Dollars 800m of Amax's remaining debt.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Regional advertising helps Metro Radio rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METRO RADIO Group, the USM-quoted local radio station operator, reported
pre-tax profits up 19 per cent at Pounds 797,000 for the half year to March
31, against Pounds 670,000.
Local and regional advertising revenue was up 21 per cent but was offset by
a 10 per cent fall in national advertising revenue. Overall, advertising
revenue rose 11 per cent to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 5.95m).
Mr John Josephs, managing director, blamed the national fall partly on the
receivership of Crown Communications, parent of Independent Radio Sales,
Metro's national sales agency. He hoped the sale of IRS, now under
negotiation, would resolve this problem.
Misplaced gloom among London-based clients about economic prospects outside
the south east was also a factor, he said.
Turnover rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 8m (Pounds 6.96m). Earnings per share
advanced 19 per cent to 3.13p (2.64p). The interim dividend is being
maintained at 1.5p.
He confirmed the Tyneside-based group was considering applying for the newly
advertised Scottish regional licence.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help Readicut jump 63% to top
Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
READICUT International, the household textile, carpeting and yarn company,
yesterday reported increased profits, but said UK economic recovery remained
'patchy'.
Pre-tax profits increased by 63 per cent to Pounds 19.2m in the year to
March 31, but were distorted by one-off exceptional items. Excluding
exceptionals from one-off disposals and closures, profits increased by 11
per cent from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 15m.
Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, said the company's main UK markets were
'up and down' and predicted slow recovery in the US. 'The rest of Europe is
still going down,' he said.
Turnover increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 234.8m, of which Pounds 10m
stemmed from exchange rate gains. The company is considering switching from
year end to average exchange rates.
Operating profits increased by 7.2 per cent to Pounds 17.3m, reflecting
continued cost cutting. There were redundancy costs of Pounds 750,000 as
staff numbers fell by 84 to 3,800.
Capital expenditure increased more than Pounds 4m to Pounds 11.8m against
depreciation of Pounds 8.6m. Spending is expected to increase again this
year to Pounds 14.8m.
The company sold Russells Rubber in February, leading to an exceptional
profit of Pounds 4.2m, and a cash benefit of Pounds 8.5m. This reduced net
borrowings from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 1.8m, while gearing fell from 19 per
cent to 2 per cent. Interest costs fell to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 2.67m) helped
by lower interest rates.
Earnings per share, helped by a lower tax rate, increased 84 per cent to
7.5p (4.07p). The company proposed a maintained final dividend of 2.81p, to
make an unchanged total of 3.44p.
COMMENT
Even without the flattering effects of FRS 3, these were very good results
from Readicut. Taking out the exceptionals, and remembering the prior year
was helped by a one off insurance payment, the company managed to increase
profits despite recession and nearly Pounds 1m in extra net costs. These
included the redundancy payments and start up costs for a new Belgium
factory, making car boot carpet for the European Ford Mondeo, which is
likely to make a sizeable contribution this year. Aside from the results,
Readicut has a strong balance sheet and has maintained capital spending
throughout the recession. All of which is wonderful news for shareholders
who bought last summer, when the shares hit 63p. With the price now up to
98p, on more than 16 times next year's forecast earnings, the shares are
well valued.

growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BELLWINCH, the Wembley-based builder, is calling for Pounds 6.5m via a fully
underwritten placing and open offer of 27.4m new ordinary shares.
The money raised will be used to replenish the group's land bank and to fund
its working capital requirements in developing new sites with the object of
'progressively increasing the level of annual sales.'
The shares are being placed with Credit Lyonnais Laing and are subject to a
clawback by qualifying shareholders on a 5-for-3 basis at 25p per share.
Credit Lyonnais Laing does not intend to apply for its entitlement under the
open offer and is placing its existing holding of 494,262 ordinary shares,
acquired in December 1991 at the time of the group's financial
reconstruction, with an institutional investor at 25p each.
On current trading, Bellwinch directors said that since the middle of
January the market in house sales had improved, benefiting from low mortgage
rates and a ratio of house prices to earnings lower than had been
experienced since the 1960s.
They believed that public confidence had begun to increase and that
stability would return to the market place for housing during 1993, with
some small increases in selling prices during the second half.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Taskforces that face a competitive
challenge - Lucas Industries lifts a page out of Japan's methodology of
manufacture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST some employees of Lucas Industries have allowed themselves a wry
smile over suggestions that the Birmingham-based engineering group is a
prime takeover target for predators such as BTR, the acquisitive industrial
conglomerate.
For the 400 people working in Lucas's engineering and systems business have
been involved in teaching best manufacturing practice to a host of the UK's
blue-chip companies - including BTR. Lucas got into this area in the early
1980s, when the shock of recording its first losses forced the group to look
afresh at how it made components for the motor and aerospace industries.
From a handful of people looking at improving Lucas's performance, the
engineering and systems business has developed into a separate company
within the group, with annual sales of Pounds 23m and customers which
include Rolls-Royce, British Aerospace and Unilever.
Mr David Friday, director and general manager of Lucas Engineering and
Systems, said his company had decided in the early 1980s that it needed to
do something fundamental to study markets outside the UK and Europe -
particularly Japan.
He said: 'We didn't understand then that the Japanese were concentrated on
the methodology of manufacturing - we were spending just as much. There was
a lot of hoo-hah about robots - by and large, it was much simpler.'
Lucas now preaches what has become the accepted wisdom on how to achieve
international competitiveness, often based on the performance of leading
Japanese competitors, which doubles the sales per employee achieved in the
west.
Just-in-time manufacturing can treble stock turnover. Product costs are
estimated to be 30 per cent lower and manufacturing lead times 50 per cent
shorter as a result of concurrent engineering techniques and better
management structures. The emphasis of Japanese businesses on quality means
that their defects are measured in parts per million, rather than percentage
figures as in the west.
Central to Lucas's approach is challenging the western approach which
divides companies into separate functions - such as sales, distribution and
production. Instead, the Lucas approach identifies logical processes and
units, which can eliminate duplication and allows each to focus on optimum
performance.
Traditionally in the UK, products are first designed in isolation and then
designed for manufacture, resulting in production problems, frequent
redesign, introduction delays and higher manufacturing costs. Concurrent
engineering combines product and manufacturing design in one integrated
process, with the product designed from the start for the simplest, least
expensive, production process.
Lucas still regularly sends engineering systems experts to Japan on study
tours. Mr Friday said, resignedly: 'The Japanese are very free and open
about the process. They've learned that no matter what they tell us, we
don't do it. Brits coming back fixated on quality circles, uniforms and PE -
the trouble is, it's all the other things as well.'
Despite this strong theoretical underpinning, Mr Friday's approach is
intensely practical: 'Our fundamental principle is to encourage businesses
so that they have the capability themselves. I don't even like the term
'consultants': we are implementers, doers - we're not in the business of
writing big reports and then leaving businesses with them. We don't write
reports, we work.'
Lucas reckons it takes between two and three years to complete what it
describes as a 'step-change' in a company's operating methods, although some
achieve it in less. Some external clients bring Lucas in to do just the
initial overall plan.
The primary focus is on establishing taskforces - normally one or two, but
some companies have had as many as 18. They are full-time,
multi-disciplinary teams of six people - only one a Lucas consultant, who
will not be the leader. Taskforce membership should be a real cross-section
 -perhaps a machinist, foreman, engineer, quality assessment expert and a
production engineer, including trade unionists.
Mr Friday tells senior managers: 'These need to be your best people - give
us your worst and you'll get the sort of business you have now.' Combined
with a widespread educational programme, the taskforces must set clear and
achievable targets - such as on stock turn, lead times. They hold weekly
reviews of progress and monthly reviews with the general manager.
Despite having completed more than 600 projects, Lucas claims it has never
had any group of people who have blocked a restructuring. Mr Friday said: 'I
can show you men who have resigned as shop stewards because they saw the
logic of what we had to do. 'You can't cloak it if a company's workforce
needs to shrink. It just means you have to set it up properly - we're not
prepared to work for a client for more than one or two weeks if they're not
prepared to tell employees what is going on.'
Inevitably, private-sector clients of Lucas are reluctant to talk about what
benefits they received. However, Parcelforce, the Post Office subsidiary,
called Lucas in to help co-ordinate an efficiency programme which yielded
savings of Pounds 80m - some Pounds 10m above target.
Mr Friday said that Lucas also does consultancy work for banks and the NHS -
indeed any organisation which can benefit from a 'process' approach. About
25 per cent of the business's work now comes from outside Lucas, and the
proportion is increasing steadily.
The Lucas consultants, based at Shirley, near Birmingham, acknowledge that
it is not always easy to go into companies at a time when their own parent
is the City's favourite takeover candidate, following a collapse in profits
and a botched boardroom succession.
Mr Friday said that despite these recent troubles, the Lucas name was still
widely respected in manufacturing circles: 'People know that when we talk
about how to make things, we can actually do it.'
Perhaps ominously for Lucas, Hawker Siddeley was another name famous in the
annals of British engineering. BTR joined Lucas's client list after being
impressed with the work which the Lucas consultants were doing at Hawker,
which BTR swallowed in a Pounds 1.5bn hostile takeover at the end of 1991.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Cosalt tumbles into the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cosalt saw a Pounds 1m downturn to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 220,000 for the
half year ended February 28 1993, and is cutting the interim dividend from
4.25p to 2.125p.
Mr Edward Brian, chairman and chief executive, said there were signs of
improving business and expected trading in the second half 'to be much
improved.'
Profit for the 1991-92 year was Pounds 1.88m.
The group's interests cover fibres, workwear, holiday homes, and safety and
protection. Turnover fell 18 per cent to Pounds 34.3m, and the operating
profit of Pounds 309,000 (Pounds 1.31m) was offset by interest charges of
Pounds 529,000 (Pounds 527,000).
Losses per share worked through at 1.64p (earnings 4.52p).

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: GA in US link to form telephone-based
broker - Joint venture to have Pounds 400,000 initial share capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL ACCIDENT, the Perth-based insurer, is linking up with Rollins Hudig
Hall, the US insurance broker, to form a new telephone-based insurance
broking company, underlining increasing competition in the motor and home
insurance market.
SelectDirect, which will open for business in July, is seen as a response to
the rapid growth of 'direct writers', which sell personal lines insurance by
a combination of mass media advertising and telephone sales.
It will resemble telephone-based brokers such as AA Insurance and Swinton
Insurance, the Sun Alliance subsidiary, but the new company will not have a
branch structure or high street presence and aims to achieve a much lower
cost base than these rivals as a result.
Mr Peter Friend of RHH, who is to be managing director, says that
SelectDirect will operate in much the same way as direct writers but will
offer customers a choice of insur-er. The company will make maximum use of
advanced computer and telecommunications technology.
'The creation of SelectDirect is further evidence of our determination to
keep fully abreast of developments in our industry. 'Personal lines' has
been an area of great change in recent years,' Mr Friend said.
Direct writers such as Direct Line, Churchill and The Insurance Service have
steadily increased their share of the motor insurance market in the past
three years. Direct Line insures more than 900,000 motorists and expects to
be the biggest motor insurance company in the country by the end of the
year.
GA's own direct writing subsidiary, GA 1-2-1, has also made inroads into the
motor insurance market since its launch in 1989.
Mr Bob Newton, assistant general manager of GA (UK), said: 'Combining our
tele-marketing skills and experience with the insurance broking skills of
RHH is a natural and powerful next step.'
RHH and GA will each have a 50 per cent share in the new company, which is
understood to have an initial share capital of Pounds 400,000.
It will be based in East Kilbride in Scotland and create about 60 new jobs
by the end of its first year.
RHH intends to place all its personal lines business in the company, while
GA is expected to underwrite only a portion of the business broked by the
new company.
The venture hopes to obtain some Pounds 5m in brokerage commissions within
three years.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Move that signals end of a takeover chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTURE of Mr Brian McGowan as chief executive of Williams Holdings,
the once acquisitive conglomerate, will cast nothing but gloom over any
merger and acquisition department still hoping for a return of the 1980s
mega-bid.
If an acknowledged takeover expert hangs up his slide rule and goes fishing,
M and A may be entering a deeper depression than those who live off it had
suspected.
Mr McGowan's departure - consistent though it was with his expressed wish to
retire early to farm and fish - may be the full stop at the end of this
particular takeover chapter, bankers and industrialists said yesterday.
'These things go in phases,' Mr McGowan said. 'The glory days ended in 1973
and did not start again for 10 years. The market is up with the game and I
do not see much that is undervalued.'
Not only are companies better managed now, at the end of a recession, but
much of the fat that developed in companies at the end of the 1980s bull-run
has already been cut out.
Doubts about valuation are shared by Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of
Tomkins, which until it bought Ranks Hovis McDougall last year had not made
a UK acquisition since 1986.
'I have been saying prices are outrageously expensive since 1987,' Mr
Hutchings said. 'We have done only four deals in six years and we have
looked at thousands.'
Tomkins paid 14 times earnings for RHM - a price Mr Hutchings has yet to
convince the market was not too high. What is clear, however, is that the
price of other companies considered as potential takeover targets - notably
Hillsdown and Glynwed - are even more highly rated now, having risen by over
50 per cent in the last six months.
Acquisitive companies also have to contend with the looming changes in the
accounting environment which will reduce the scope for taking provisions
against the balance sheet. 'The reality of the short term effect of
acquisitions will be very much more obvious in the profit and loss account,'
says Mr Richard Rae, analyst at Hoare Govett.
Price and the Accounting Standards Board's changes may already have pushed
some conglomerates towards asset purchases.
Nevertheless, there is no shortage of companies known to be seeking the big
acquisition. Chartered Consolidated has made no secret it is looking to
spend the sale proceeds from its stake in Johnson Matthey. And MB Caradon,
though not strictly a conglomerate, is equally well armed after the sale of
its stake in CMB.
Life may be easier for acquisitive companies fishing in smaller ponds,
though they will not avoid the ASB's new rules. Wassall, the up and coming
conglomerate rated on a prospective multiple of 22, is one group with a high
rating and shareholder backing for a move.
Some merchant and investment banks have already anticipated a lull in
takeover activity. But whether arranging bolt-on acquisitions, vendor
placings, IPOs, rights issues and the odd restructuring is going to fill the
gap left by takeovers remains to be seen.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: When the life of Brian becomes less fun -
Williams' strategy after the departure of its chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN A conglomerate loses its chief executive because he cannot see much
scope for future big acquisitions it raises some awkward questions for the
group, not least about its future strategy.
Williams Holdings has made no secret of its view that hostile bids have
become almost impossible to pull off since it lost its bid for Racal
Electronics at the end of 1991.
But the industrial conglomerate has always held out the possibility of
returning to the takeover trail when the opportunity presented itself.
Mr Brian McGowan, who yesterday confirmed that he was stepping down as chief
executive, believes that route has now been shut off to Williams for the
foreseeable future. 'Big mega bids are out for the time being' he said
yesterday. 'From an enjoyment point of view its less fun carrying on as you
are than smelling the grease paint of a potential target.'
While Mr McGowan had privately made clear to his colleagues that he would
probably resign in two years time on his fiftieth birthday, his decision to
go by the end of December was born out of a frustration that there are
unlikely to be any big deals for the next few years.
Last year's negotiations with Thorn EMI brought this view to a head.
Williams entered into negotiations with Thorn over buying its defence,
lighting and security business for Pounds 300m.
When news of the talks leaked in the summer, Williams' share price
immediately fell to under Pounds 3, below which the management believed it
was no longer possible to fund such an acquisition by way of a share offer.
And since it did not have the cash to buy the businesses without
significantly increasing borrowings, it just settled for Thorn's fire
extinguisher business for Pounds 41m.
For Mr McGowan the failed Thorn negotiations were all too reminiscent of
what happened during its hostile bid for Racal. Williams' original Pounds
750m share offer fell more than Pounds 100m as the group's shares sliped
from 360p to a low of 287p during the battle.
After losing Racal, its third failed hostile bid, and no longer able to
finance medium sized deals with its shares, Mr McGowan says the future
strategy will be on looking for small infill acquisitions.
This was in marked contrast to its earlier strategy when it accumulated such
famous businesses as Yale locks, Rawlplug, Polycell and Valor Heating.
'That type of growth is no longer possible' said Mr McGowan ruefully. 'The
fat targets of the eighties are gone and the institutions are no longer so
willing to back big acquisitions'.
Mr McGowan still believes that UK managers may get 'weak and sloppy' again
in the future, making big acquisitions easier, but he is not prepared to
wait for those days to come back.
His long-time partner Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, who founded the group with Mr
McGowan in 1982, does not contradict his chief executive. For the next 18
months he says Williams will be a conventional, if somewhat boring,
conglomerate to meet the needs of the nineties. Williams will be
concentrating on organic growth and small bolt-on acquisitions.
With Mr Roger Carr, managing director, responsible for the day-to-day
running of the businesses, Mr Rudd says there was simply not enough work to
keep three senior executive directors busy. Thus no one will replace Mr Carr
when he takes over from Mr McGowan as chief executive at the beginning of
next year.
Mr Rudd believes he has the depth of management in place to successfully
turn around an underperforming company. 'But I am not prepared to put the
group's resources behind a deal which can depend on the decision of a single
fund manager' he said.
Furthermore, the group's decision, announced at yesterday's annual general
meeting, to take reorganisation costs of acquired companies through the
profit and loss account could make acquisitions still less attractive for
Williams.
All of these factors have been underlined by Mr McGowan's decision to
retire. But Mr Rudd argues that many other conglomerates, such as BTR and
Hanson, are in the same position.
Faced with a problem of where its next acquisition was going to come from,
BTR recently surprised analysts by signing joint ventures with two Chinese
provinces which will entail an investment of more than Pounds 100m.
Many conglomerate analysts yesterday seized on the Chinese deal as evidence
that BTR attaches as much importance, if not more, to organic growth and
agreed deals as it does to big hostile bids.
A simular pattern has emerged at Hanson. The new management recently
underlined its belief that organic growth and small bolt-on acquisitions
provide the greatest opportunity for growth than big takeovers.
Although BTR's message has generally been well received in the market,
partly because it has stressed the need for managing companies for some
time, Hanson's change of heart over making big acquisitions has led to a
number of critical reports by stockbrokers.
Indeed, Williams' two brokers, Warburg Securities and Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, recently published a sell and hold note respectively on Hanson,
questioning whether it could sustain its growth without another big
acquisition.
Williams' advisers argue that the company has nothing to fear from Hanson's
experience because it has always modelled itself more on the lines of BTR.
They took heart that the group's shares only fell 10p yesterday to 310p. One
of its financial advisers said: 'Williams has been stressing its ability to
run businesses for some time. Mr McGowan's resignation underlines the change
in the group's strategy from an acquisitive conglomerate to a more prosaic
company managing industrial businesses.'
This view is echoed by Mr David McErlain, a close business friend of Mr
Rudd. Mr McErlain, former chairman of Anglo United, which took over Coalite,
the smokeless fuel business, in a leverage bid in 1988, believes Mr
McGowan's departure will give Mr Rudd a 'new lease of life' to focus on his
businesses, while developing a new partnership with Mr Carr.
But even Mr Rudd cannot disguise his hope that the glory days of the
eighties might return again, allowing him to make the type of takeovers that
within ten years took Williams from a shell company into the FT-SE 100 share
index.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fairline back to interim surplus with
turnround to Pounds 0.16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAIRLINE Boats, the luxury powerboat maker, yesterday announced a return to
pre-tax profits of Pounds 161,000 at the half-way stage from losses of
Pounds 613,000 a year earlier, benefiting from the devaluation of sterling.
The shares closed down 42p at 390p reversing a 44p rise on Monday following
favourable press comment in the weekend press.
Mr Sam Newington, chairman, said the figures reflected both lower
development costs and the publicity value of devaluation among overseas
buyers: 'When sterling devalues it's news. Our customers know our boats will
be cheaper.'
He expressed concern, though, about Fairline's main European markets. 'We
expect to see some recovery in UK sales although it will be difficult to
maintain export momentum to other European countries.'
Turnover, of which about 85 per cent was overseas with Germany as the main
market, rose to Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 12.3m) in the six months to end-March.
Direct exports, some 70 per cent of total turnover, were up by 45 per cent.
The UK distributor also sells to overseas customers. Home sales were down 15
per cent.
Fairline said the European Community's January 1 extension of VAT on its
exports had not yet affected the market. It feared the proposal move to
claim some VAT on boats sold up to eight years ago, could depress prices in
the secondhand market, which might have a knock-on effect on upgrade trade.
The company had about Pounds 1.2m in net cash and trade debtors of Pounds
2.4m in March. It generated between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 500,000 cash
in the half year and has now paid off almost all of a low interest Pounds
1.65m EC loan, leaving negligible borrowings.
In January it launched the Targa 38 and plans a 28-footer next January. The
company said it hoped to sell the smaller boats on the back of the
established brand name of the bigger boats it has developed.
The board declared a maintained interim dividend of 3.575p and earnings per
share were 3p against losses of 11.8p.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RTZ arranges second enhanced scrip dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ Corporation, the mining group, yesterday became the first company to
announce that it had arranged a second enhanced scrip dividend, which will
be offered on the company's interim dividend for this year.
The company, which had already used the enhanced scrip scheme for its final
dividend last year, is also bringing forward payment of the interim from
December to August. To take full benefit of the scheme the size of the
interim and final dividends will be reversed.
RTZ yesterday declared an interim of 13.5p with an enhanced scrip
alternative of 20.25p. BZW, which designed the enhanced scrip scheme, will
make a separate cash offer at 98 per cent of the enhanced scrip's value,
equal to 19.85p.
In previous cases, BZW made a 95 per cent cash offer, but then faced
competition from Swiss Bank Corporation, which offered 98 per cent on
schemes arranged for BAT, Redland and BICC.
Assuming a 90 per cent take up of the issue, as achieved last time, RTZ will
eliminate Pounds 33m of unrelieved advance corporation tax and will have
substantially cleared its unrelieved ACT problem.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Community care spending helps Tunstall
advance to Pounds 3.17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUNSTALL GROUP lifted first half pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.55m to Pounds
3.17m, thanks partly to higher spending by local councils under the
government's community care policy.
The shares surged 34p on the announcement to close at 447p.
The group, which supplies emergency communication and security systems,
improved turnover to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 19.6m) in the six months to
end-March, which coincides with the local authority year-end.
Tunstall Telecom achieved Pounds 750,000 in sales of communications and
management control centres for community care administrators. It also won
'major orders' worth Pounds 800,000 from councils to cover requirements for
emergency communications devices for community care patients now living
outside hospitals.
More than 60 per cent of sales went to the UK public sector and Tunstall
said it expected to double sales of hospital communication and security
products in each of the next few years, from a low starting point.
Overseas sales improved Pounds 2.3m to some 22 per cent of the group's total
turnover, against 20 per cent at the September year-end. Tunstall ComSystem,
a German hospital communications subsidiary, had been 'temporarily slowed'
by the downturn in Germany, but its market was under-developed. The group
aims to establish a European network of associated companies and
subsidiaries.
Tunstall Electrics contributed Pounds 2m against Pounds 400,000 for the last
full year, stemming from contract manufacturing, although it continued to
fulfil its role as a supplier to group companies. One analyst pointed out
that 60 per cent of that turnover was to one company, Pace, the consumer
electronics maker.
Net interest payments were Pounds 148,000 (Pounds 89,000). Tunstall had
Pounds 5.2m cash at March 31, up Pounds 900,000 on the year-end.
Earnings per share moved up to 13.3p (10.2p) and the interim dividend is
lifted from 2.25p to 2.5p.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: PhoneLink checks into USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNLISTED Securities Market yesterday gained its first recruit since its
reprieve from closure when PhoneLink, a Birkenhead-based computing services
company, placed 8.9m shares at 155p a share, valuing it at Pounds 55m.
Now three years old, PhoneLink has developed a novel technique for
extracting information from commercial computer databases quickly and
economically. Mr John Lyon, commercial director, said the decision to go to
the USM had been made because the company could not yet meet the financial
criteria for a listing.
The placing, by Allied Provincial, of about 25 per cent of the equity raised
Pounds 9.9m net of expenses. The shares were placed with a group of
institutions each of which now holds less than 3 per cent of the total. Mr
Trevor Burke, PhoneLink's founder and chief executive and his wife Heather,
client services director, will each receive Pounds 1.3m as a result of the
flotation. Mr Burke retains a 52.5 per cent interest in the company.
PhoneLink intends to use the funds raised to improve the company's
Birkenhead site and to buy a second production site. It estimates this will
cost Pounds 5.1m. Some Pounds 600,000 will be spent on developing existing
business and the rest will be used to promote and market Tel-Me, the
company's flagship product which will be launched in the first quarter of
1994. In the year to March 31 PhoneLink's turnover amounted to Pounds
923,000. Pre-tax profit was Pounds 31,000 after writing off development
expenditure of Pounds 414,000.
PhoneLink's revenues to date come from Datacare, a service based on its
information retrieval software used for the automated bulk retrieval of
telephone numbers by banks and utilities among others.
A second application will be BT Teledirectory which will enable BT customers
to obtain telephone numbers from a personal computer attached to PhoneLink's
system.
Dealing in the shares begin on June 1.

FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brake Bros makes biggest buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAKE BROS, the supplier of frozen and chilled foods to the catering trade,
has acquired Country Choice Foods (Group), a supplier of frozen bakery
products, for up to Pounds 14m, its biggest acquisition to date.
The initial consideration is Pounds 10m to be met by the allotment of 2.06m
new shares. Further consideration, up to Pounds 4m, depends on CCF's trading
results for the year to February 28. It will be satisfied either by the
issue of five-year loan notes or the allotment of up to 1m shares, or by a
combination of both.
Mr Frank Brake, managing director, said although CCF related to Brake's
existing businesses, it was 'another niche' for Brake which is especially
strong in seafood, fish, prepared meats and poultry products. It will
continue as a stand-alone operation, he said. There would be no
rationalisation or closures as a result of the acquisition, though there
would be synergies on the buying side.
CCF is based in Orpington, Kent, while Brake is just along the motorway at
Ashford.
CCF operates from eight depots across the UK, made pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.55m in the year to February 1993 on turnover of Pounds 40m, and at its
year-end had net assets of Pounds 1.39m. It is headed by Mr Ken Manley as
chairman and his brother Stephen as managing director. Both will remain at
CCF, as will its other directors. Mr Ken Manley will become a non-executive
director of Brake.

FT  26 MAY 93 / The debt burden of property high-flier: Why the banks
decided the time had come to shoot down a crippled Speyhawk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago, Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman of Speyhawk and one of the best
known figures in the UK property industry, made a light-hearted reply to a
speech by Sir John Quinton, then chairman of Barclays, about the banks'
attitude to troubled property companies. 'Sir John,' he quipped, 'we owe you
more than we can ever repay.'
The joke has now acquired a hollow ring. Barclays, which is Speyhawk's main
lender, yesterday put the company into receivership. The company's 46
domestic and international banks are owed more than Pounds 350m, which is
secured on assets worth an estimated Pounds 200m.
At a fraught meeting on Monday the banks unanimously rejected a last-ditch
plea from Mr Osborne to give the company more time. Mr Osborne said
yesterday that he was 'gutted' by their decision. 'It came as a devastating
blow to me,' he says.
The blow was all the more severe because Speyhawk has been in restructuring
talks for nearly two years and Mr Osborne has long believed that a deal was
within reach. A restructuring agreement in which the banks agreed to
subordinate part of Speyhawk's debt, has been in the hands of lawyers since
Christmas Eve.
But the banks say that the restructuring package was never as secure as Mr
Osborne thought, 'It was a question of developers' optimism versus bankers'
realism,' one said.
The difficulty partly arose from conflicts of interest between the banks,
the loans of which were secured on different assets.
But the banks say their decision mainly stemmed from a growing unease about
the deterioration in Speyhawk's position. Asset values have been under
increasing pressure, particularly in the City. 'It (supporting Speyhawk) was
not really sustainable any more' says Barclays.
This is the first high-profile property receivership this year, but it
follows a well-established pattern. Development companies like Mountleigh
and Rosehaugh, which collapsed last year, shared Speyhawk's fundamental
predicament. They lacked a cushion of rental income, making them reliant on
sales to cover interest costs. The property downturn has hit unlet buildings
and development properties particularly badly, resulting in huge falls in
asset values.
Speyhawk was never one of the largest development companies, but it was
always one of the best known. It was set up by Mr Osborne, a former
chartered surveyor with Middlesex County Council, in 1980 with the intention
of developing buildings to sell to institutions. In 1981 it became the first
of this new breed of merchant developers to join the stock market.
The company built a number of high quality developments including the Thames
Valley Park near Reading, Cannon Bridge (a building over the City station
partly let to the LIFFE market), and Exchequer Court, a City office building
that was badly damaged by the 1992 bomb in St Mary Axe.
Its value peaked in 1987 at Pounds 140m, after which the combination of the
stock market crash and increasing nervousness about property companies
eroded its value. But in mid-1990, it looked as though a takeover would come
to the rescue of the company's shareholders.
Nordstjernan, a Swedish property and construction group trying to increase
its exposure to UK property, entered bid discussions. But the Swedish group
withdrew in August 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait.
After that, there was no escape from the pressures of rising interest
charges and falling trading profits. Its high gearing, its concentration on
London and the south-east and the large proportion of development sites and
unlet properties magnified the impact of the market's decline.
Speyhawk's banks argue that the picture remains unremittingly bleak.
Although there has been an upturn in much of the property investment market,
the change of fortune does not apply to much of Speyhawk's property. There
is a two-tier property market, which has left unlet property as out of
favour as it has ever been.
The decision to put the company in receivership did not merely stem from the
bleakness of Speyhawk's position, however. 'It was a combination of the
banks thinking what is the point of going on because we will lose so much
anyway, the difficulty of reconciling how the package is put together and
concern about the costs and commitment of the management,' says one banker.
The question now taxing the property industry is whether Speyhawk's
receivership has implications for other property companies that are
supported by the banks.
Mr Osborne believes it heralds a change in attitude by the banks. 'The whole
climate has changed,' he says. 'The banks are now making profits so they can
make provisions.'
He adds that the banks are no longer prepared to shoulder the additional
workload of a workout compared with a receivership.
Many commentators believe that lenders are more prepared to dump property on
the market because the property market is showing the first sign of a
recovery, albeit a fragile and narrowly-based one.
'The banks are more likely to pull the plug as the market improves and they
look to get their money back,' says Mr Mike Riley, head of Chesterton's
financial services division. 'There will be more receiverships to come.'
But bankers deny that Speyhawk's receivership is the start of a trend in
which the banks become increasingly aggressive. 'We don't see crystallising
losses as in anyone's interests,' says Barclays. 'Receivership is the last
resort.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / Argyll ahead 14% to Pounds 417m for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGYLL GROUP, the UK's third largest food retailer which runs the Safeway
and Lo-Cost/Presto chains, yesterday reported a 14 per cent gain in
full-year profits.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 417.3m in the 53 weeks to April 3,
compared with Pounds 364.5m in the previous 52 weeks on sales which grew 10
per cent to Pounds 5.54bn.
After adjusting for the extra week and disposal of the group's drinks retail
businesses in mid-1991, sales increased 9 per cent.
Argyll's results, described by Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, as 'very
respectable in a tough market,' follow similar profit gains at Sainsbury,
and are better than Tesco's results.
Group operating profits climbed 18 per cent to Pounds 387m as the operating
margin widened to 7.4 per cent from 6.9 per cent. They were underpinned by a
22 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 336.2m from the Safeway
stores on sales that grew 13.3 per cent to Pounds 4.42bn. Safeway's
operating margin increased from 7.5 per cent to 8.1 per cent.
New Safeway stores and less store closures contributed 8.8 percentage points
of the sales gain, with 2.3 percentage points coming from existing stores
and the balance from the additional trading week. Inflation was 2 per cent.
Group capital expenditure totalled Pounds 611m, including Pounds 393m spent
on opening 26 new Safeway stores and acquiring four others making a total of
345. The group ended the year with net debt of Pounds 42m and gearing of 3
per cent, compared with net cash of Pounds 199m a year earlier.
This year 24 Safeway stores are due to open at an average cost of Pounds
16.5m each.
Overall capital spending is projected to increase to a peak of Pounds 650m.
Interest income declined to Pounds 28.2m (from Pounds 33.5m) and included
Pounds 2.6m in dividends from its shareholdings in two continental European
retailers, Ahold and Casino.
Earnings per share grew by 12 per cent to 27.1p (from 24.2p) and a final
dividend of 7.35p (against 6.55p) will lift the total payout 12 per cent to
10.9p (from 9.75p).
Commenting on current trading, Sir Alistair said Safeway sales in the first
six weeks were 14 per cent ahead of last year, including existing store
sales growth of 2 per cent.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Virgin Music puts Thorn EMI ahead to Pounds 289m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORN EMI saw full-year pre-tax profits almost double to Pounds 289.9m from
Pounds 147.9m, aided by a strong contribution from its newly-acquired Virgin
Music Group.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, said despite an improvement in the UK market
the recession appeared set to continue in continental Europe and recovery in
the US seemed at best gradual.
The pre-tax figure was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 51.9m in
the latest year and Pounds 88m a year earlier. Operating profit rose 34.9
per cent to Pounds 379.3m in the year to March 31 1993, including Virgin's
10-month profit contribution of Pounds 53.1m. Turnover was up 12.6 per cent
to Pounds 4.45bn. Earnings per share was 45.3p (against 22.5p a year
earlier) before exceptionals. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding
exceptional items, rose from 42.7p to 53.9p. The final dividend is 23p,
bringing the full-year payment to 32p (from 30.1p).
The group, whose interests include music, white and brown goods rental,
light fittings, defence and security, reported under the FRS3 standard, with
the previous year's figures restated.
Sir Colin said the group did not expect to be affected by a Monopolies and
Mergers Commission inquiry into UK compact disc prices. 'We don't expect to
lose it. We welcome it because we can get the matter sorted out for once and
for all,' he said. Sir Colin said the integration of Virgin's manufacturing
and distribution into Thorn EMI would be completed next year. The music
division's operating profit rose to Pounds 196.9m (from Pounds 125.1m).
Rental operating profit increased to Pounds 115.3m (from Pounds 105.9m),
lighting was up to Pounds 15.2m (from Pounds 12.6m) and the HMV music
retailing chain rose to Pounds 2.6m (from Pounds 1.3m).
Profit at Thorn Security and Electronics plunged to Pounds 1.5m from Pounds
13.2m. Sir Colin said management deficiencies, since corrected, had also
resulted in cost overruns on three defence contracts. He said Thorn still
hoped to sell its defence business.
Exceptional items of Pounds 51.9m included a Pounds 21.1m profit of the sale
of the fire appliances division to Williams Holdings. This was offset by a
number of charges, the biggest being a Pounds 62.6m write-down relating to
Thames Television, which has been sold to Pearson, publishers of the
Financial Times.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Boots to open outlets in Sainsbury stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, Britain's largest chemists chain, is to open pharmacies and drugstore
outlets in stores owned by J. Sainsbury, the country's biggest food
retailer.
Boots will open outlets in seven Sainsbury superstores in southern England
in July for a trial expected to last several months. The companies said that
if the arrangement was successful it would be extended to other Sainsbury
sites.
This will be the first time that Boots, which operates about 1,100 high
street shops, has established outlets in stores belonging to another
retailer.
Sainsbury in the past five years has opened a few of its 330 supermarkets to
12 shops operated by Sketchley, the dry cleaners, and five belonging to
Lloyds, the second biggest chemists chain.
Sainsbury has also been gradually expanding its supermarket operations to
non-grocery products, including petrol, tobacco, newspapers and cut flowers.
Last month, it launched a magazine, which is on sale at its supermarket
check-outs.
Boots said its planned pharmacies would dispense privately-prescribed
medicines, and that it was seeking licences to enable them to dispense
National Health prescriptions.
The outlets, each of about 200 sq m, would also sell a range of toiletries,
cosmetics, baby products, special foods and film developing services similar
to those available in Boots' smaller shops.
Sainsbury, which proposed the collaboration to Boots, already stocks several
of these product lines in its stores. The two companies said they expected
to compete on price promotions and special offers.
Boots said it would judge the trial on the returns earned by the outlets and
whether they affected sales in its existing local shops. Sainsbury said it
would employ a range of criteria to measure the response of its own
customers.
The new outlets will open at Sainsbury stores in Camberley, Dulwich, Hemel
Hempstead, Ipswich, Poole, St Albans and Sevenoaks.
Tesco, Britain's second largest supermarket chain, began opening in-store
pharmacies in 1981 and now has more than 50. About half belong to Tesco.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Volkswagen says its car operations are close to break-even
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, the troubled German carmaker, is close to staunching the losses
in its core VW car division.
The VW brand operations accounted for around two-thirds of group turnover
and were already operating close to break-even in April and May, Mr
Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW group management board said yesterday.
The Volkswagen parent company mad a loss of DM578m (Pounds 230m) in January,
when the VW division was forced to implement extensive short-time working
and make provisions for significant job cuts.
Mr Piech said VW parent company losses had been reduced to an estimated
DM325m in February and trimmed to DM40m in March.
The VW division had cut 31 days of production in the first half of this
year, but was reducing vehicle stocks. Mr Piech said he was hopeful of
resuming full production after the summer.
He saw no reason to change his earlier forecast that the group would achieve
a small profit for the full year despite its DM1.25bn first-quarter loss.
Mr Piech said the first signs were appearing of a fragile recovery in demand
in the German new car market. Prices were improving in the used car market
and new orders had risen over the past three weeks.
Mr Piech said Volkswagen had failed 'to prepare for bad times' in the
previous eight years of rising car sales in Europe.
'We came into this crisis needing to produce at 100 per cent of capacity
just to break even, depending on the plant,' he said.
He added the company's goal was to reduce the break-even level to '70 per
cent of capacity or better,' but it could take six years to achieve this
target.
The 'drastic measures' taken since January had reduced the break-even level
to 85-90 per cent, but the company was still only using around 78 per cent
of its available capacity.
'My first task is to get into the black by the end of the year even with
this level of capacity utilisation, to bring the break-even down from 100
per cent to under 80 per cent,' he said.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Steinkuhler quits IG Metall over share dealing allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Franz Steinkuhler, Germany's most powerful union leader, yesterday
resigned as head of more than 3m engineering workers over allegations of
insider share-dealing.
His decision was greeted with relief by Germany's financial establishment,
fearful of the international reaction to evidence of unrestricted insider
trading on German stock exchanges, but with regret in the trade union
movement.
The resignation was an-nounced in a brief statement read out by an official
at the Frankfurt headquarters of IG Metall, Germany's largest trade union.
'I am going, but IG Metall will remain,' Mr Steinkuhler declared,
acknowledging his 'infinite sorrow' at quitting when times were already
difficult for the union, and likely to get even more difficult 'because of
my own mistakes'.
Insider dealing is not legally restricted in Germany, but Mr Theo Waigel,
the finance minister, has promised to draft legislation by the summer which
will include both fines and jail terms for offenders.
The move represented a sudden change of heart from Monday, when the
engineers' leader, a popular and charismatic figure throughout the labour
movement, offered his resignation - but also appealed for support from his
colleagues to stay on.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, his deputy and probable successor, insisted that the union
executive did not call for his resignation, and Mr Steinkuhler said his
decision was taken 'against the advice and pleas of many colleagues'.
Earlier, the union leader had admitted speculating in the shares of
companies connected to Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial group, on
whose supervisory board he sits. He admitted buying shares in Fokker, the
Dutch aircraft manufacturer, shortly before its takeover by Daimler's
Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary was confirmed.
He also confirmed that he had bought almost DM1m (Pounds 390,000) worth of
shares in Mercedes AG Holding, the Daimler holding company, on the eve of a
decision to swap its shares for those of Daimler, causing a sharp jump in
the share price.
'His resignation is a logical consequence of what he has done,' said Mr
Rudiger von Rosen, chief executive of Deutsche Borse, the German stock
exchange. 'This does not mean he was guilty of insider trading. But it is
clearly wrong for people in this position to speculate in the shares of
companies with which they are associated as members of supervisory boards.'
Mr Steinkuhler had already announced his intention to suspend his membership
of the Daimler supervisory board until the outcome of an inquiry by the
insider commission of the Frankfurt stock exchange, which he has asked to
investigate his own case in particular.

<TEXT>
MR CESARE ROMITI, chief executive of the Fiat group, is being formally
investigated by Milan magistrates for alleged corruption and illicit
financing of political parties.
Mr Romiti, the most senior management figure in the Turin-based auto group
below Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman, was reported to have been placed on
the list of those under investigation on May 18.
Although not officially confirmed, the news comes from leaks from the Milan
magistrates' office which have been accurate over the 15 months of
corruption investigations.
Twelve executives in the Fiat group have been arrested and given testimony
to Milan magistrates in the past year. The involvement of Mr Romiti, aged
69, in the investigations into illicit funding of Italy's political parties
through kickbacks on contracts is a big blow to the prestige of the motor
group.
It also raises questions over how much longer Fiat will be able to retain
its existing management structure, which was reorganised only six months ago
to take account of Mr Agnelli's plans to step down in 1994.
The news drove down the share price of Fiat and most of its subsidiaries on
the Milan stock exchange. Fiat was fixed at L6,546, down from L6,575 on
Monday, before falling further to L6,400 after hours.
The group, which will announce its 1992 results next week, is expected to
report net profits fell by more than half to about L500bn (Pounds 219m) Fiat
warned yesterday it may have to cut more jobs.
Mr Romiti last month handed in a dossier of Fiat's relations with political
parties over the past decade. Unlike Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of
Olivetti, he did not assume personal responsibility for any of the alleged
kickbacks.
It appears the magistrates, after cross-checking, believe Mr Romiti has more
to tell and some of his testimony conflicts with statements by his managers.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Lloyd's urges Names to settle grievances through
negotiation: Insurance market chief hopes investors will 'give peace a
chance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY Lloyd's Names were yesterday urged to 'give peace a chance' and
participate in new negotiations to achieve an out-of-court settlement to the
legal actions dogging the insurance market.
The call was made by Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, who was presenting
Lloyd's new business plan to an audience of some 2,800 Names  - the
individuals whose assets provide Lloyd's capital - at the Royal Albert Hall
in London.
Emphasising that it was impossible 'not to be moved' by the fate of many
ruined Names, Mr Middleton said: 'We are not made of stone but we are not
made of money either.' The atmosphere at the meeting, however, provided
indications that a deal might be hard to achieve. Platform speakers were
heckled and the audience demanded a minute's silence for those Names driven
to suicide by their losses.
Mr Middleton said Sir Michael Kerr, a privy councillor and former High Court
judge, had agreed to chair a panel to assess the relative strength of Names'
claims.
Sir Jeremy Morse, former chairman of Lloyds Bank, will chair a second panel
to investigate the financial contributions that might be available for a
settlement. 'Sir Jeremy will have absolute access to the financial knowledge
of the society,' Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said. Lloyd's will hope
to persuade errors-and-omissions insurers - which cover Lloyd's agents
against legal awards - to contribute to a deal, while further cash might
come from Lloyd's central fund.
That meets insurance claims when Names cannot fulfil obligations. A
settlement is seen as vital to Lloyd's business plan, published last month.
The plan aims to cut costs, restore profitability and attract new capital.
Lloyd's hopes to make an offer by the end of September to many Names taking
legal action. However, both Mr Middleton and Mr Rowland emphasised that only
limited funds could be made available and that the effort would concentrate
on claims on E&amp;O policies that affect the 1989, 1990 and 1991 years. Lloyd's
also had to take into account the interest of Names who are members of
syndicates underwriting E&amp;O policies, Mr Middleton said.
A market committee reported last month that E&amp;O funds of Pounds 690m to
Pounds 940m might be available for syndicates which participated in the
so-called 'spiral' - the business of reinsuring catastrophe losses of other
syndicates and companies. This compares with Names' losses of more than
Pounds 1.8bn.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action group, which
represents the biggest group of loss-making Lloyd's Names, said his group
would press on with litigation.

FT  26 MAY 93 / MacGregor guarantees future of discount rail fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of Tory revolts yesterday forced a series of government
concessions on British Rail privatisation - including legal protection for
discount fares for the elderly and young, and extra measures to protect
against big fare rises.
As ministers won Commons approval with a majority of 15 for the
privatisation bill, the government also pledged to help ensure the survival
of the London travelcard.
However two Conservative MPs voted against the government on a proposal to
allow BR itself to bid for franchises - a move again rejected by Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary.
The climbdowns, which were more extensive than expected, came after two days
of talks between Mr MacGregor and Conservative MPs worried about the impact
of BR privatisation on voters in their constituencies.
Under an amendment to be made in the House of Lords, private companies
bidding for franchises will now have to continue the discount fare schemes
for the old and young - although not for families - offered by British Rail.
The bill already required franchise operators to give discounts to the
disabled.
Mr MacGregor said he would also tell the new director of franchises that
private rail operators should be required to continue travelcards that cover
other transport systems, as well as rail in London and other cities.
Under another amendment to be made in the Lords the director of franchises
will have the power to judge what are reasonable fares - a concession
described by Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, as a
'spectacular reversal' that would mean the franchise director, not markets,
setting ticket prices.
Mr MacGregor said that current discounts for the elderly and young people
were not statutory but were regarded by BR as 'primarily marketing
incentives'. They were likely to continue and expand after BR privatisation.
Sir Keith Speed, the Tory MP for Ashford who led the revolt, said he was
'totally content' with Mr MacGregor's announcement on concessionary fares.
Mr MacGregor was later forced on the defensive as he sought to block a
Labour amendment to allow BR to bid for franchises.
Some Tory rebels were satisfied, however, with an assurance that guidelines
for awarding franchises will be rewritten to put more emphasis on motivating
BR managers.
Further slight comfort for BR managers came as Mr MacGregor said they would,
in effect, be able to compete with private bidders by improving their
performance, so no bid was regarded as better value.

FT  26 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems Mr Brian McGowan, Williams Holdings' chief executive, wants to
spend more time with his fishing rod. His decision certainly suggests that
life in City mergers and acquisitions departments will continue to be dull.
It also raises awkward questions for Mr Nigel Rudd, Williams' chairman, who
is arguably even more of a fan of bids and deals. The company may say that
potential targets are too expensive and that organic growth is its chosen
route, but that is to make a virtue of necessity. Williams' lowly rating
hardly permits a paper bid while gearing constrains cash offers.
Organic growth, however, will be equally hard to come by. Many of its
businesses flower late in the economic cycle, while at a trading level cash
has flowed out of the company in each of the last three years. Above average
growth to restore the company's premium rating looks unlikely. The
uncharitable may feel that it is just as well Williams has turned its back
on contested bids, since it has failed too often. The reality is that
conglomerate sharks need to keep moving forward if they are to thrive.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of receivers at Speyhawk will send shivers down the spines
of struggling property developers but is unlikely to scare them rigid. The
decision seems to owe more to the particularities of Speyhawk than a sea
change in policy by the banks. In truth, it may reflect little more than a
loss of patience with a company which has long been technically insolvent
and recently revealed a further downward lurch in asset values.
Nevertheless, the timing still looks odd in light of the hazy upturn in the
property market. Speyhawk's property portfolio may be among the last to
benefit, given the company's habit of building speculative developments in
south east England. It seems improbable, though, that even bankers would be
so rash as to kill any recovery stone dead by prematurely dumping properties
on the market.

FT  26 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Argyll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fall in Argyll's share price in response to a 14 per cent increase in
full year profits is typical of its harsh treatment at the hands of the
market. Having underperformed the plummeting food retailing sector by 10 per
cent since the turn of the year the company might have expected as much.
There seems little hope of closing the rating gap on J. Sainsbury.
Argyll has not won friends in a nervous stock market by increasing capital
expenditure again this year. Yet by planning to increase space annually by
around 7 per cent, it is only keeping pace with the best of the competition.
And its cost per new store remains well below Sainsbury, despite an increase
in the average last year thanks to a concentration of new openings close to
London.
True, Safeway's own-label products account for a lower proportion of sales
than Sainsbury. If that makes it more vulnerable to the cut-priced branded
goods offered by discount retailers, Argyll's rating might be expected to
suffer. But with few signs of slippage in yesterday's figures, it is hard to
avoid the conclusion that the market is trying too hard to find reasons to
sell.

FT  26 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone anticipating radical proposals from Mr Andrew Large's review of
investment regulation will be disappointed, or perhaps relieved. But it
still requires an act of faith to believe the two-tier system of statutory
and self-regulation can be made to work by sharpening the regulatory style.
Mr Large is surely right that the Securities and Investments Board must, as
lead regulator, spend more time supervising the self-regulatory
organisations and less on detailed rule-making. Even so, the onus will be on
Mr Large to stamp out the mentality which places greater emphasis on
standard-setting than enforcement.
The price of avoiding fresh legislation may be wider market supervision.
Keeping the lid on insider dealing and market manipulation will probably
involve extending trade reporting to areas currently beyond the reach of the
regulators. The proposed central database for trade reporting might, for
example, extend to over-the-counter derivatives. These free-wheeling areas
of the capital markets will need convincing that such a measure is not the
thin end of the regulatory wedge. With the Taurus fiasco in mind, the City
will equally require assurances that the project is not another
technological white elephant.
Whether a tough new attitude at SIB will extend to other areas of the market
remains an open question. A less indulgent view in matters of market
transparency will not win friends in the industry.

FT  26 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Thorns in the side
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market is unsure whether to be seduced by Thorn EMI's big idea.
The company is currently suggesting that substantial value can be realised
from rationalising Thorn's sprawling interests. That would leave a a
finely-focused music and rentals business. Thorn's latest results certainly
highlight the charms of its core companies. Boosted by Virgin, the music arm
lifted operating margins 2 percentage points to 13 per cent, contributing 52
per cent of Thorn's Pounds 377m of trading profits. Shorn of its peripheral
businesses, Thorn's share rating should theoretically soar towards the
heights commanded by pure music companies, such as Polygram.
But it would not do to grow too excited. Thorn's remaining business laggards
are suffering badly and may yet inflict more pain. Profits in the defence
arm have all but collapsed. Rumbelows remains troublesome and, though
improved, the lighting business is still limping. These interests may well
keep Thorn's share rating pegged to the market average for a while to come.
The longer term worry, however, is that grand plans too long in gestation
have a nasty habit of going out of fashion before fruition - as ICI's
experience suggests. The current regulatory interest in UK CD prices may
prove no more than a minor irritant; nevertheless, it could presage greater
pressures to come. The regulator's visible hand may well fail to cut the
music industry's fat margins; the market's invisible hand, though, may wield
a sharper knife.

At least Commons speaker Betty Boothroyd is assured of the best of advice
while pondering how to respond to Sir Hal Miller's explosive remarks to the
arms-for-Iraq inquiry. Her secretary, Nicolas Bevan, is the very same civil
servant who, as an MoD official, testified to the cross-party trade and
industry select committee on the same subject in 1992.
Then he made the important revelation that ministers were not informed of an
official demarche to the Belgian government in December 1989 over a contract
won by the Belgian company PRB to supply the propellant for a high-velocity,
long-range gun to Iraq. The committee later said it was 'astonished'
ministers were not informed.
From Bevan, who became speaker's secretary earlier this year, emanated
arguably the most consummate piece of civil service-speak heard during the
committee's evidence-taking.
Asked whether British Intelligence might have discovered that a 'massive
gun' had been set up on a hillside in Iraq, he replied: 'Well, it is always
unwise to rule out anything.'

With Peter Sutherland, Ireland's former EC commissioner, seemingly bagging

more active chairman than his predecessor and there is no obvious successor
with the same political connections - unless AIB were to poach Ray MacSharry
from rival Bank of Ireland.
One possibility is that Gerry Scanlan, AIB's chief executive, takes the job.
He retires in less than a year's time and is already deputy chairman.
However, this would be a break with tradition and the smart money in Dublin
is on industrialist Jim Culliton, 58, adding the chairmanship to his growing

The apparent end of the long search for Gatt's next director-general is bad
news for Julio Lacarte-Muro, Uruguay's 75-year-old chief trade negotiator.
Despite his age, he had thrown his cap in the ring and, given that Peter
Sutherland is almost 30 years younger, it looks likely that Lacarte-Muro
will never perform the job he seemed made for.
The spry Uruguayan, who plays tennis four times a week and shows no sign of
slowing down, beats the competition hands down in terms of Gatt experience.
He was in on the negotiations which established Gatt in 1947, becoming
deputy executive secretary of the organisation at its inception.
During three tours of duty as Uruguay's Gatt ambassador in Geneva, he has
been chairman of Gatt's governing council and of the contracting parties
(members). He has taken part in all eight trade liberalising Gatt rounds,
and, of course, was instrumental in persuading Gatt members to choose Punta
del Este - the fashionable seaside resort where he has a holiday home - to
launch the present Uruguay Round in 1986.
In or out of the top job, Lacarte-Muro has a long-standing personal interest
in one aspect of the current weary round - the proposed creation of a
powerful Multilateral Trade Organisation. An International Trade
Organisation was the centrepiece of the 1948 Havana Charter which
Lacarte-Muro helped draw up, only to see it vetoed by the US Congress.

Even if some of Lord Hanson's corporate rivals do not regard this as another
sign that Britain's number one predator is taking his eye off the ball, the
other hostelries he frequents, such as Harry's Bar, Mark's Club and

swallow the latter's conspiracy theories about Rowland.
Indeed, one of the reasons that people seem to be able to say all sorts of
outrageous things is because Rowland has never been known to sue for libel.
Is it pride, or anxiety about what he might be asked if he was to be

FT  26 MAY 93 / Big test for Large ambition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPORT on UK financial services regulation published yesterday by Mr
Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, has as its
subtitle the phrase 'Making the two tier system work.' That may also be its
epitaph. By exploring what it will take to make the current system of
regulation work, Mr Large has cast a vivid light on the difficulty of the
task.
The upper tier to which he refers is the SIB. The second tier is its
alphabet soup of 'practitioner-based' self-regulatory organisations such as
SFA, Lautro, Imro and Fimbra.
Mr Large is open in his criticisms of the way these bodies have worked in
the past. He believes that in the early years, too much attention was
focused on rule-making. The second phase of the SIB's history - a more
relaxed approach to regulation known as the New Settlement - delivered less
than it promised in the way of lightness of touch, while failing to keep the
SROs up to the mark.
The SIB also allowed itself to become a rival to the SROs, by directly
supervising too many financial services businesses which preferred to deal
with it rather than one of the SROs.
Performance standards
'The question is not whether there should be change,' says Mr Large, 'but
what changes should be made.' He therefore proposes to change the SIB's role
to one of setting performance standards for its flock of SROs, and of
watching over them in a 'more exacting' fashion, while withdrawing as much
as possible from the business of direct regulation.
This approach lays bare the tension at the heart of the regulatory system,
between protecting the public interest and leaving the industry free to
grow.
Mr Large is cranking up the tension by stressing the SIB's unalloyed
commitment to its public interest role and by promising to keep the SROs on
a tighter leash. He says the SROs will welcome the clearer standards to
which they will be kept, and will relish the challenge posed by the SIB's
willingness to move into their patches to pick up on any derelictions of
duty.
Maybe. It is just as likely, however, that the process of setting standards
and establishing a new relationship between the SIB and the SROs will usher
in a new period of navel-gazing, negotiation and backbiting inside the
regulatory system. Such a process would divert attention from what Mr Large
rightly stresses as the main priority - the enforcement of the public
interest in investor protection.
Many risks
His answer to this worry is, in essence: trust me. He is aware of the risk,
he says, and will not let it happen. In any case, what is the alternative?
No one wants the upheaval involved in a whole new regulatory system; and the
'single-tier' option (in which the SIB would subsume the SROs) would still
need the sort of relationships now to be developed. If in the end, the
two-tier system fails, then the new single-tier regulator can be based on
the structure and attitudes now being sought.
Given the patent lack of political enthusiasm for new legislation, this may
be a realistic view. It is none the less a disappointing one. A more radical
approach to separating out the regulatory system's four tasks - the
detection of fraud; the protection of consumers against unscrupulous selling
practices; the prudential supervision of financial services business; and
the enforcement of 'fair dealing' in professional markets - would have been
welcome.
In the absence of such an approach, too much of a burden falls on Mr Large's
good intentions. Still, they are not a negligible force. He has already
demonstrated them by telling the proposed new retail SRO, the Personal
Investment Authority, to pull its socks up, and he seems prepared to take a
tougher line with the insurance industry than his predecessors. Also, he has
some challenging ideas: on plea-bargaining, on the need for a 'central
policeman' for the enforcement of securities law and on the impact of
changing market structures.
Mr Large has chosen to stake his success not on his skill in drawing new
structures, but on his ability to deliver within the existing one. The test
lies ahead.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Job creation in France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN THE limits allowed by its adherence to a firm exchange rate, the new
Paris government of Mr Edouard Balladur is at least trying to coax life into
the recession-bound French economy. Mr Balladur's first two months in office
has coincided with disturbing signs of deterioration in the real economy,
but a strengthening of financial market confidence.
Mr Balladur is trying to use modest fiscal means to prepare the way for
recovery, in a year expected to show the first economic contraction since
1975. But budgetary tinkering is likely to have a minimal impact on the
outlook for growth and employment. He must also tackle deeper-seated
impediments to job creation in the French economy.
The scale of the French employment problem is widely recognised. As the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has pointed out,
France's unemployment record since the first oil shock in 1973 has been the
worst of any large OECD country. Employment expansion during the period of
economic buoyancy of the 1980s was less than in any other member of the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries. French civilian employment
regained its 1974 level only in 1988. Unemployment has been on the rise
since the end of 1990. Furthermore, the country's record in long-term
unemployment and youth and female employment is comparatively poor.
Bond issue
Despite France's success in reducing growth in domestic unit labour costs,
French companies now face a fresh squeeze on competitiveness caused by the
European devaluations since last autumn. The government believes that the
unemployment total, currently 3.1m, could rise by a further 350,000 by the
end of the year.
In an attempt to limit the political costs of unemployment, the government
on Monday announced a FFr40bn bond issue to help finance extra
infrastructure spending and work schemes. The amount is relatively small,
however, especially compared with the overall 1993 budget deficit of
FFr410bn (including the social security and unemployment funds), to which Mr
Balladur recently claimed France was heading. Nevertheless, the move softens
the effect of deficit-cutting measures outlined two weeks ago. It was
pounced upon yesterday by the Socialist opposition as evidence that the
government was backing away from earlier promises of rigueur.
Monetary policy
On the monetary front, the Banque de France has this week managed to achieve
a further downward nudge in short-term French interest rates, to slightly
below the level in Germany. If the foreign exchange market's new-found
scepticism about the D-Mark's stability proves durable, the Banque de France
may be able to widen this gap in its favour. The new French base rate of 8.8
per cent is, none the less, nearly 7 points above the inflation rate - a
heavy burden on enterprises, especially while Europe remains in the doldrums
and demand for French exports remains depressed.
Mr Balladur needs to go beyond the monetary and fiscal steps so far
announced. The exceptional burden on employers created by direct finance of
the welfare state through large social security contributions gives French
companies a particular financial incentive to minimise employment. Mr
Balladur has already proposed reducing this tax on employment by shifting
some financing of social security and unemployment funds away from payroll
contributions towards general taxation. The initial move, however, is
modest, with the planned shift limited to only FFr4.5bn this year.
If he decides to accelerate changes in this direction, Mr Balladur can rely
on support from the EC. The European Commission's 'framework for
employment', expected to be adopted today, sets out a path which it hopes
will lead to higher employment by cutting employers' social security
contributions and promoting part-time employment.
Mr Balladur's manoeuvering room is painfully small. By indicating his
interest in reforming the country's system of payroll taxes, he has made a
start towards putting job creation on to the agenda. But he needs to go
further. Most of the EC needs to accompany him.

FT  26 MAY 93 / The man in the middle: John Major expresses his convictions
on inflation and Europe, and refuses to be politically pigeon-holed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An hour spent with John Major is an hour spent in middle England. At the end
of an internecine year, which ended with his party's 'bloody nose' in the
Newbury by-election and which has now given way to torrid speculation about
an imminent cabinet reshuffle, Mr Major is visibly tired.
So, has he spent the whole day poring over ministerial possibilities? No, he
has been to the Chelsea flower show. What will he be doing after the
interview? Talking to BBC television's Bookmark programme about his
favourite author, Anthony Trollope, the 19th-century master of middle
England's social and political life. And what is that hanging over the
mantelpiece in the prime minister's study? A portrait of W G Grace, the
legendary England cricketer, recently shipped from the National Portrait
Gallery on Mr Major's personal instructions.
The prime minister's affection for a Britain of country lanes, warm beer and
village cricket grounds is evidently more than a speech-writer's device to
reassure doubters about his 'heart of Europe' strategy. It is, indeed, the
softer side of a politician best known as he rose through the ranks for his
love of policy detail and the tactical machinations of the whip's office.
Once the interview is rolling, however, it is not long before he is delving
through a thick file, pouring out comparative international economic
statistics. We begin with the robustness of the economic recovery. Is he
sticking to the Treasury's forecast of 1.25 per cent growth this year?
'I'm not going to change the Treasury forecast in an interview . . . but I
would be very surprised if the forecast is not met this year.' He promises
not to quote figures, before reciting pages of them: on inflation (a 30-year
low), unemployment (falling for three months), manufacturing productivity
('a record high'), industrial production (up 1.6 per cent on a year ago),
and the statistical coup de grace: a list of 'quite startling' international
comparisons of peak-to-trough declines. In industrial production. Britain's
7.6 per cent looks good alongside Germany's 12.3 and Japan's 11.5, although
it is steeper than France's. He concludes: 'We are in a position where we
can move into a period of steady and sustainable growth. I emphatically do
not want a sudden, short-term sharp burst of activity.'
But what about the public finances, in this slow growth scenario? With
public spending back to 45.5 per cent of gross domestic product, won't
spending have to be cut back well beyond planned levels?
The prime minister points to the effects of recession on tax receipts and
social security benefits. Just as the huge surplus of the 1980s was
'something of a surprise', so now the pendulum had swung back dramatically.
With a jab at critics inside his own party, he insists: 'This is not a
runaway spending spree by government.' During the recession, he thinks it
was right 'to protect the people who are hurt and to protect some of the
public sector and infrastructure programmes'.
The spending review being conducted by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary
to the Treasury, is not mainly concerned with this cyclical problem. 'We are
doing what I thirsted to do when I was chief secretary, to look not just at
the annual increase in public expenditure but to strip down below the
baseline, right to the very roots, programme by programme.'
With scare stories almost daily about where the axe will fall, the concern
has arisen that Mr Major may be preparing to work around his carefully
worded manifesto commitments to attack welfare state provisions for those
with modest incomes, especially pensioners.
'You touch on one of the most important things and where so much of the
concern is apt to arise. We do have a particular concern for people on
modest incomes who worked through their lives to provide for themselves
rather than depend on the state. . . . That is why I am saying that we have
to select priorities. . . . If we do not do so, then taxes will rocket.' So
will he stick to the spirit and the letter of the manifesto? 'Of course.'
Does that mean the Portillo review will not question the principle of
universality which underpins so much of the British welfare state? 'There
are areas where we will look at universality, yes.'
Confusing? Well, perhaps it could hardly be otherwise, since nobody can say
how much of the budget deficit is cyclical or structural and how it will
respond as the economy recovers. 'I wish I knew,' says the prime minister.
Given that he does not, when will Mr Portillo's digging to the very roots
actually make a difference? Certainly not in the next two to three months.
The questions 'are very fundamental and they will take rather a long time'.
In the short term he cannot avoid taking a view on public-sector pay. Is Mr
Major tempted to extend the 1.5 per cent ceiling of the past year? 'We will
be discussing that in the very near future,' he says. What about a freeze?
Straight bat: 'We will be discussing it in the near future.' What about
taxes? Would he be prepared to put them up, rather than impose sharp
restraints on expenditure? 'It is principally a public-expenditure problem
rather than a taxation problem and it is at public expenditure that we must
look first.'
If that does not quite echo the spirit of Thatcherite low-taxation rhetoric,
it may be because Mr Major acknowledges more readily that under the
Conservatives the burden of taxation has been shifted rather than eased.
A subject on which he does speak with passion, however, is inflation. In
mentioning the businessmen who tell him that a little inflation will be all
right, he comes as close to thumping the table as his nature allows. 'We
could have blinked on inflation on a number of occasions. If we were
prepared to sacrifice potentially a general election by not doing the easy
and popular thing to get inflation down, it is not likely that we would let
go of it now.'
This too is his answer when asked about the case for an independent central
bank, as a more credible guardian of stable prices. 'What matters is the
determination of the people responsible for the policy in keeping inflation
down. We are determined.'
Until last September, of course, Britain's anti-inflationary anchor was the
exchange rate mechanism. Now that the EC has concluded that there are no
fault lines, does that mean Britain will stay out? 'We won't start
contemplating going back into the ERM until Britain's economy is more in
step with the rest of Europe. . . . Above all we would need economic
conditions in Germany and Britain to be much more closely in line.' Does he
expect to lead Britain back into the ERM during his premiership? 'I don't
know.' Does he still think there are fault lines? He does. 'As people's
ambitions stretched out towards a single currency, the ERM became rigid to
the point of inflexibility.'
Turning to his agenda for the EC, at next month's Copenhagen summit, Mr
Major focuses upon enlargement talks with the Efta countries. 'I want to
give that a big push. That is pivotal to the future of the way I see the
Community, to have the Eftans in place as members before any further
consideration is given to institutional change in the Community.'
These new members - Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria - 'are countries
with a greater affection for free trade than some that are already in there.
Also you have four countries that will be net contributors to the budget.
For the first time since the Community was established, you begin to see a
balance in members between net contributors and net recipients. You begin to
change the culture of the Community. That is a principal aim.'
He is also interested in the Community's growth initiative, though not as an
expenditure-driven exercise. He makes three points: the need for more
deregulation, greater subsidiarity and a determined effort 'to make sure
that barriers to the single market genuinely are removed and that subliminal
barriers aren't erected by our partners'.
In the longer term, in the run-up to the EC's proposed intergovernmental
conference in 1996, he does recognise the case for institutional reform. 'I
don't believe many people are satisfied with the accountability of the
Commission. When people say they don't like Europe, what they mean is that
they think the Commission is overweening and overpowerful.' He also wants
the EC to examine 'the role of national parliaments and the European
parliament, to make sure that that is properly in kilter and that they have
the appropriate responsibilities. We also need to look at the role and the
operation of the European Council.' There will, he says, be 'fierce
discussion and squabbles' about these matters, but he considers enlargement
a certainty and with it 'an opportunity to introduce a much greater degree
of flexibility into the European Community.'
There have been signs recently that the Foreign Office has been toying with
a more favourable attitude towards a Community of 'variable geometry' or
'multi-speeds', perhaps even accepting the fact that Britain may settle for
a medium-speed lane. Mr Major professes himself 'pretty sceptical about how
that would really work.
'With regard to variable speed, the social chapter to an extent has done
that. . . . To what extent they will actually proceed with the social
chapter without the British, I don't know. There may be areas where we will
have disuniformity, a form of variable geometry, but I don't know how far
you could carry that and it still be a credible Community. I'm not saying it
can't be done. It's easier to talk about in the abstract than in detail.'
It is all very well, though, to talk about an alliance with the Eftans. What
about Britain's relations with Germany and France, the motors of the
Community?
He considers Germany a significant ally on subsidiarity and enlargement, but
then slips into rhetoric rather than realpolitik. He thinks the Maastricht
debate across Europe should serve as a warning of the distance between
politicians and public. 'If the European politicians don't understand that,
they are heading for very big trouble.'
If he has big challenges before him in Europe, he also has severe
difficulties to his rear, following the Maastricht debate. Discussing the
political diversity of his own party, he comments that it is 'a pretty broad
church . . . and I hope we will keep them all in it.'
But people are puzzled. In his cabinet, he has Thatcherite radicals and
avowed consolidators. Which is he? It is easy to mislead in answering this
question, he suggests, and offers the following: 'When I see something that
I believe is wrong, I will want to change it. Where I see something that
operates broadly with the grain of the British instinct, I won't want to
change it.' Surprisingly, he cites the fiery and philosophical Enoch Powell
as an example of an unclassifiable politician from his own party. He too
resists classification. When he wants change, it is not 'through some
ideologically-driven motive'.
For example, he wishes to semi-privatise the railway only 'because British
Rail is deeply inefficient'. He thinks the improvement of a privatised
Docklands Light Railway shows the potential. 'I want something that works,
something that is efficient. If that is radical, I would just say it is
common sense.'
To those who see him as a political weathervane, a leader without authority,
he returns to his proudest accomplishment: suppressing inflation, even
through an election campaign. To that he adds Maastricht, on which he
spurned the lure of 'cheap popularity' which ditching the treaty would have
brought. He acted 'because I believed it was right . . . so that Britain has
the appropriate authority in Europe to shape the future of the EC and not be
shaped by the future of the EC. The record shows that I would not shift the
view that I thought was right. I don't think that argues anything other than
conviction politics.'
One subject he will not discuss is the looming cabinet reshuffle. There's
something else he won't do. He is asked what he has learned from the last
year and spots at once the reference to his chancellor's taste in popular
music: 'Qu'est-ce que vous regrettez, Mr Major?'
'I am not going to reply in French. I have at least learned that,' he
laughs. He says he has mainly learned about life with a small majority. As
for regrets, they all concern the economic pain individuals have suffered in
the battle against inflation. 'I do not think that was wrong, it was
inevitable, but I do regret the fact that many people were hurt while we did
it.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / One firm hand on the tiller: F W de Klerk outlines his
objectives in South Africa's negotiations for a new constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS, MICHAEL HOLMAN and PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr F W de Klerk, the South African president, is not about to hand over
power to a majority-rule, winner-take-all black government - not now, not
ever.
As the country's constitutional negotiators rush headlong to announce a date
for the first multiracial elections, they would do well to remember Mr de
Klerk's bottom line, made clear again yesterday in an interview with the
Financial Times. He will only share power, not abandon it altogether; and
the National party (which is now open to all, though it remains
white-dominated) must be given what amounts to a veto on significant
decisions within a coalition cabinet based on power-sharing.
Mr de Klerk refuses to use the word 'veto', rightly concerned that his
opposite number, Mr Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress, could
never accept an overt white veto over the decisions of a black-dominated
cabinet.
But since the day in 1990 when Mr de Klerk announced he would end exclusive
white rule, he has never abandoned his guiding principle - that minority
parties must be guaranteed a large measure of power in the new South Africa,
meaning in practice that the National party must be promised a share of
power, or there will be no deal. His oft-repeated vision of a happy
multiracial future for South Africa is based firmly on the reality that
whites - through the National party - retain a share of power for the
foreseeable future (providing they have a minimum level of electoral
support).
This fact does much to deflate the optimism generated over the past few
weeks by the 26 parties negotiating South Africa's new constitution. They
have promised an outline constitutional deal by next week - in time to meet
their self-imposed deadline of June 3 to set a date for multiracial
elections. But they have yet to resolve the most fundamental constitutional
issue of all: where will the real power lie in the new South Africa?
True, much progress has been made on this issue over the past year, as the
gap has narrowed between the ANC's demand for majority rule and the National
party's offer of power-sharing. The ANC has agreed to a coalition cabinet,
based on electoral support, to rule for five years after the first elections
(due to take place next year); and it has conceded that some decisions
should be taken by consensus.
But ANC officials have so far offered to seek National party agreement only
on the most important issues, such as the decision to declare war or a state
of emergency, while Mr de Klerk insists on consensus on a broader range of
issues. And, crucially, the ANC insists that power-sharing must be
voluntary, not entrenched in the constitution. The National party is
concerned that that ANC would not honour a voluntary agreement, once it had
finally tasted power (especially if it wins a large majority of the national
vote).
In yesterday's interview, Mr de Klerk made his demands clear: 'We are
talking about the need in a government of national unity - with regard to
fundamental issues - for the country to be governed on the basis of
consensus between the main role players.
'With regard to matters of average importance, one can always have an
agreement as to how differences between them can be settled. But with regard
to the fundamentals, there needs to be consensus.'
Mr de Klerk protests that the concept of consensus - which he defines as a
'meeting of the minds' through negotiation - is 'psychologically and
philosophically different' from a veto. But consensus can only be declared
where no leading party dissents; and Mr de Klerk's opponents find it
difficult to distinguish between enforced consensus and veto.
What will concern them even more is Mr de Klerk's insistence that
multiracial power-sharing must be a permanent principle of government in
South Africa - despite the fact that three-quarters of the population is
black, and that black leaders are prepared to countenance only a limited
period of power-sharing.
'We definitely believe that in a final constitution . . . the principle of
power-sharing must be part of it,' says Mr de Klerk. He concedes that
power-sharing need not be achieved 'in exactly the same way that it is
achieved in a government of national unity'. But the sharing of power
inherent in an electoral system based on proportional representation and on
maximum devolution of power to regional governments would be insufficient.
'There must be, to our minds, the limitation of power of any government also
when it comes to the executive, not to such an extent that it must be a lame
duck government, but to ensure, as the founders of the American constitution
(did), that there won't be misuse of power.'
It requires a leap of faith to believe that the ANC will accept such limits
to majority rule - that it will sign away its right ever to rule South
Africa on its own. ANC officials categorically reject permanently entrenched
power-sharing, and insist that even within the first multi-party cabinet,
consultation with other leaders must be voluntary.
They may eventually accept Mr de Klerk's proposal for an inner cabinet,
formed by leaders of parties with large electoral support (the ANC, NP,
Inkatha Freedom party, and possibly others); but it is hard to see the ANC
agreeing to entrench this in a constitution.
It is especially difficult to see how big issues such as power-sharing -
along with devolution of power to regions, and the mechanism for writing a
new constitution - can be resolved in the eight days left before next week's
deadline in the constitutional talks.
But Mr de Klerk remains optimistic: 'The negotiation is progressing well in
this regard (power-sharing),' he said, adding 'I believe that a settlement
and an agreement on how you structure a government of national unity will be
achieved.'
On the issue of devolution of power to regions, of crucial importance to
parties such as the Inkatha Freedom party, the president seemed confident of
early resolution: 'I think common sense is prevailing. I've never worried
about the possibility that on this issue we won't make progress,' he said,
noting that Inkatha is 'well on board' the constitutional talks at the
moment.
Mr de Klerk expressed little concern over other potential threats to the
progress of negotiations, whether from the right-wing Conservative party or
a potential alliance between the Conservatives and the Inkatha Freedom
party. The CP had split, he said, and its moderate offshoot, the Afrikaner
Volksunie, would continue to grow at the Conservatives' cost. He discounted
fears of an alliance between the IFP and the Conservative party, because of
the CP's demand for a racist white state, a demand opposed by Inkatha.
Similarly, the threat of the 'lunatic fringe' of radical black and white
supremacists was overestimated. They were receiving 'too much attention', he
said, adding that 'the overwhelming majority of all South Africans are . . .
reaching out towards an agreement that can bring stability and hope . . . an
agreement which builds a bridge between, on the one hand, the need for
security among those who have much to lose and the need for opportunity for
those who have backlogs to catch up with.'
Only time will tell whether Mr de Klerk's optimism is justified, though he
may be more worried than he lets on. But his determination to fight his
corner in the constitutional battle - to fight simultaneously for the
moderate South Africans he hopes to represent in the next election, and for
the Afrikaners he represents by birth - cannot be doubted.
'I'm committed to ensuring that the only workable alternative will be in
place. We cannot afford to experiment with anything else,' he insists. 'I do
not intend to sign a bad agreement'. And if the ANC, or any of the other 24
negotiating parties, believes he will, they had better think again.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Letter: Expensive policy on older unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ELIZABETH DRURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'The mystery of a shrinking dole queue in a sluggish
market' (May 20), highlights the removal from the unemployment statistics of
unemployed men aged over 60.
This phenomenon, targeted at older unemployed persons, is widespread across
Europe. Automatic (pre-retirement) benefits are paid, without the need to
register for work, to the unemployed aged over 55 in Belgium, Denmark,
France, Ireland and the Netherlands; and to those over 58 in Germany. The
Spanish unemployed have to take an early pension at 60, which entails a
permanent 40 per cent reduction in their old age pension. No official
statistics are recorded of these 'hidden unemployed', but the numbers across
Europe must now be significant.
Another 'new' UK policy of encouraging the unemployed to register for sick
benefits is also based on common practice on the Continent, where many older
workers 'retire' from about 55 on invalidity pensions. In the Netherlands,
early disability pensions are the main type of early retirement, and minor
disabilities are sufficient to qualify, since labour market conditions form
an integral part of the criteria.
The combination of these measures produces relatively low official
unemployment rates for older workers across Europe. This has allowed
governments to give lower priority to combating unemployment among over-50s.
But in view of demographic trends which will increase the numbers of older
workers in the next century, this could prove an expensive and short-sighted
policy.

seriously' (May 11), builds a hypothesis on the foundation that UK
manufacturing industry is undervalued and that the engineering profession is
both underrated and underesteemed. It goes on to explore whether a single
engineering institution and a centralised system to accredit courses would
sharpen the image of engineering and then improve UK industrial performance.
Through a structured and representative attitude survey, chemical engineers
have recently taken a view on the features they wish to see in a unified
profession. Less than 5 per cent of chemical engineers support, as a
preferred option, either a single engineering institution or a
centralisation of authority in the new relationship between a reformed
Engineering Council and the institutions.
We want real partnership with a central body which would then act primarily
as a public relations focus for the profession as a whole. This is, in fact,
the very proposal which was put forward by the presidents of the civils,
mechanicals, electricals and chemicals in their November 1992 input to the
Fairclough inquiry on the unification of the engineering profession. It
remains an attractive alternative to the vision presented in the Fairclough
Report, 'Engineering into the Millennium'.
Much has been made of the need for more 'interdisciplinary' abilities in
engineering. Success in interdisciplinary areas is not about training each
individual with some kind of multidisciplinary tool kit, but rather about a
high level of disciplinary specialisation. What we need are first-rate
groups of specialists able to appreciate each other's contributions and make
effective contributions as a team.
Further, it is simplistic to see different branches of engineering as being
any more closely related than are the science disciplines of physics,
chemistry and biology on which engineering builds. We hear no corresponding
call for a single science institution, nor do we find a single institution
representing engineering in, say, the US or Japan. Indeed, as in the UK,
these nations enjoy flourishing individual societies of chemical engineers.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Letter: Point missed on role of Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MAX WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Ansel (Letters, May 19) fails to appreciate the vital role that
Training and Enterprise Councils are performing and the level of commitment
of their directors and staff. Tecs organise training for the many young
people who do not wish to continue in full-time education, but who need
job-related vocational training, leading to a national qualification. In
Hampshire at any one time we support the training of some 6,500 young
people.
Through their private-sector directors, Tecs have a unique insight into the
needs of employers. At the same time, they have detailed knowledge of the
labour market. Drawing on this insight and knowledge, Tecs are well placed
to ensure that the training provided is in line with both the needs and
aspirations of the individual and the requirements of the labour market.
The work of Tecs in organising job-specific development of young people
complements that of further-education colleges. Tecs have productive
relations with the further-education sector, providing strong links with
employers and support in widening the application of National Vocational
Qualifications.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Letter: First define money supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R A LEDINGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Before the Bank of England develops even more sophisticated measures of
money supply, should it not be more precise in defining that which is being
measured? ('Bank may use new measure of money', May 17).
An increase in interest rates (ie price) tends to reduce the 'supply' of
money. Either money reacts in exact opposition to market forces, or M1 to M4
reflect money demand not money supply. In a closed economy, there will be a
distinct correlation between retail money supply and money demand. In the
UK's deregulated financial markets, with cross-border, cross-currency access
to funding and derivative markets, such a correlation is far from certain.
Should we not be considering more sophisticated direct measurement of money
demand? There could be two basic measurements, MD1 could aggregate
short-term borrowings at variable interest rates (credit card balances) and
MD2 could aggregate long-term borrowing at variable interest rates
(mortgages).
MD1 would serve to measure the effect of short-term interest rates on the
dynamics of the economy and MD2 would serve to remind us of how we got into
the mess in the first place.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Personal View: Britain wrong on human rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY LESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
September 3 is the 40th anniversary of the coming into force of the European
Convention on Human Rights. There is much to celebrate. The convention is
the jewel in the crown of the Council of Europe, an enlightened instrument
for the collective enforcement of fundamental human rights.
But a cloud hangs over the festivities, for the convention system is in
danger of collapse, and the British government is hampering the reforms
needed to save it.
The crisis concerns the convention's enforcement machinery - the avenue for
individuals to take their cases to the European Court of Human Rights at
Strasbourg if their rights have been violated. The facts speak for
themselves. It typically takes between five and six years from the time when
an individual complains to Strasbourg until the court gives judgment. Since
the claimant must have exhausted all effective remedies in his or her home
country before complaining, the subject matter of the complaint may be six
or more years old before it even reaches Strasbourg.
A period of some 10 or more years in which to obtain a remedy for a
violation of fundamental human rights is grossly excessive and constitutes a
denial of justice. If a contracting state permitted delays of this length in
national legal proceedings, it would be in manifest breach of article 6 of
the convention.
These problems will become even worse. From 1960 to 1983 the court gave a
total of 76 judgments. In 1989 and 1990 alone the court gave 53 judgments.
Within the past five years, the number of complaints made to Strasbourg has
trebled. Five years ago, about 2,000 complaints were received annually;
currently some 5,500 complaints are being received each year, and there is
now a backlog of about 2,500 applications.
The convention was conceived when the Council of Europe consisted of 10
member states. Future enlargement of the council to 35 or even 45 member
states threatens its very existence as an effective enforcement mechanism.
Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland have recently accepted the right of individual
petition under the convention. Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia - the newest
members - will doubtless follow suit. The list of new democracies from
central and eastern Europe applying for membership includes Albania,
Belarus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Moldova, Romania, Russia,
Slovakia and Ukraine.
A conservative forecast, based upon present experience, suggests that the
number of complaints and registered cases is likely to double, if not
treble, within the reasonably foreseeable future. The existing machinery
cannot conceivably cope, and tinkering or half measures will not be enough
to enable it to do so.
Since 1985, two main reform proposals have been developed. First, there is a
plan, supported by two-thirds of the member states of the Council of Europe,
including France and Germany, to create a single, full-time European Court
of Human Rights in place of the present two-tier system. This court would
take over and absorb the functions of the Commission of Human Rights, which
currently decides whether complaints are admissible.
Second, there was a scheme put forward by the Netherlands and Sweden for a
two-tier jurisdiction, with the commission operating as a court of first
instance and the court acting as an appeal tribunal, subject to leave being
granted.
The case for a permanent and full-time court is cogent and compelling. A
two-tier modification of the present system would not tackle the central
weaknesses. It is likely that recourse to the second stage would become the
rule, not the exception; and there would be continuing problems of wasteful
duplication and unreasonable delay. Realising this, Sweden and the
Netherlands have abandoned their two-tier scheme and now support the
establishment of a single permanent court.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the UK government has procrastinated and
prevaricated. At first it argued that there was no need to reform the
present system in any significant way and that increasing resources would be
sufficient. Now Britain professes support for reform but is backing the
cumbersome and inefficient two-tier system.
We all rejoice at the emergence of the new democracies of central and
eastern Europe. It would surely be more fitting for the UK government to
give a high priority to strengthening the effective legal protection of
human rights in those countries and at home. The UK is now as isolated on
this issue in the Council of Europe as it is on the Maastricht treaty's
modest agreement on social policy.
What matters now is that the necessary political support should be mobilised
in Britain and across Europe to enable the court to meet the needs of the
peoples of Europe. Otherwise, the convention system will soon collapse under
its own weight.
It is vital that a new protocol amending the convention system is agreed
when the Council of Europe's governments meet in Vienna in October. The UK
government should give unequivocal support for a single and effective
permanent European Court of Human Rights. Britain should be in the vanguard
of the reform movement together with its European partners, rather than
seeking political compromises to limit or dilute those reforms through a
combination of English insularity and bureaucratic narrow-mindedness.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CAMPBELL DUNFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was astonished to read the comments by Professor Patrick Minford in
Peter Marsh's article 'Salmon succeeds beer and sandwiches' (May 24). If an
adviser to the Treasury can state, 'People from business are invariably a
nuisance when it comes to talking about the economy', it explains much about
the malign neglect and ignorance which our manufacturers have had to endure
for many years.
Does the professor believe that wealth is created from thin air, and where,
if not from taxed wealth, does this bemused academic's salary come from?

Potentially such a good night's viewing that even the well-written and
finely acted Brookside (Channel 4, 8pm) may find itself losing a few
viewers.
ITV continues to show signs of desperation, scheduling the European
champions' cup final (ITV, 7.10pm) at an hour when it hopes to tempt
floating viewers away from a run of excellent prospects elsewhere.
No chance. I was weaned on Gunsmoke (BBC2, 6.50pm) and Marshal Matt Dillon
(played by James Arness) was an early and lasting icon. The series
originally ran for 20 years, between 1955-75. Let's hope the repeats get as
long a run this time round.
Following Mr Dillon, BBC just gets more absorbing. Open space (BBC2, 7.40pm)
talks to prisoners on Death Row in Trinidad, part of the crime and
punishment season.
But unfortunately the BBC goes in for its own crazy scheduling around peak
viewing, with two challenging programmes jostling for attention. There's a
chance to see Country (BBC2, 9pm), the Trevor Griffiths play; half an hour
later Inside story (BBC1, 9.30pm) promises an investigation of Tiny Rowland.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Arts: La Boheme - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After almost 20 years of pretty well constant use this production of La
Boheme has survived remarkably intact. The scene outside the gates of Paris
is as evocative as ever, although the sudden downpour of snowflakes as the
lovers start upon their parting duet is rather abrupt  - one imagines
stagehands in the wings shouting 'Cue snow]'.
Casts good and bad, Italian and otherwise, have passed through it. This one
was not bad, but definitely otherwise; there was not an Italian to be heard.
In an opera which entered the international repertoire virtually as soon as
it was written, this might not seem to matter, but there was an above
average proportion of accents hard to understand and vocal mannerisms that
tried to sound Italianate, but failed.
The tenor is Jerry Hadley (except the last performance). He is a very fine
singer, the voice firm, well-produced, clean and clear. But I did not
believe in his Rodolfo for a moment. His first earnest glare into Mim's eyes
would surely have been an off-putting start to a relationship and the fussy
acting did not ring true. The voice is not large enough, juicy or emotional.
It is not his best role.
His Mim is the Australian soprano Deborah Riedel, who is not very
individual, but makes one feel that she means what she sings. Her portrayal
is honest, each phrase given just the right colour, including a special
limpid softness that can bring a tear to the eye.
There is no question of her competing as a personality with Karita Mattila,
who provides a class act as Musetta. This is no low-grade tart, but a
sharp-witted girl-on-the-make, who has learnt a thing or two from draping
herself on rich lovers' arms, not least how to sniff out an expensive wine.
She sang her music confidently, with lots of panache. Anthony Michaels-Moore
is again a warm-hearted Marcello. Peter Sidhom is the Schaunard, and Mark
Beesley the Colline.
A slowish tempo at curtain-up announced a conductor with ideas of his own,
confirmed when the second act shot off at such a speed that the chorus was
hard put to keep pace. Daniel Oren, a well-known figure in Italian
opera-houses, was making his Royal Opera debut and did so to highly
energised orchestral playing. At first his dynamism seemed invigorating. By
the end, the many extremes of tempo and abrupt reversals of direction merely
tried one's patience.
Further performances until June 18

FT  26 MAY 93 / Arts: The Golden Palm is torn in two - No one can argue with
this year's winners at Cannes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been quite a Cannes. Changeable weather brought scattered showers,
sunny intervals and billowing white soap-suds. These last cascaded from the
Palais roof in honour of Sylvester Stallone's arrival with his Alpine action
thriller Cliffhanger. Havoc was created on the Croisette as the
pseudo-snowflakes gradually turned to sudsy slush. But Cannes always turns
to sudsy slush at the close. The old celebrities are wheeled out to to
donate Golden Palms; the winners respond with arias of pretend surprise; and
crocodile tears are wept by all at the end of another tiring and frequently
tiresome junket.
But wait. This year everyone did seem to enjoy Cannes. The competition was
as lively as I can remember. No four-hour Greek movies about alienated
beekeepers: the worst ordeal was bumping into Splitting Heirs again and
watching it turn on a slow spit of condemnation by the world's press. So
much for Eric Idle's remark about 'snotty British critics'.
As for the prizes, who could quarrel with a Golden Palm torn in two and
handed to Jane Campion's The Piano and Chen Kaige's Farewell To My
Concubine? The Australian film is a dazzling tale of passion and puritanism
at violent odds in an Edenic wilderness. The Chinese film brings 50 years of
traumatic national history to life and gives the pageant a human pulse in
its story of two love-crossed Peking Opera performers.
Meanwhile Britain's Naked won a Best Director and Best Actor prize for,
respectively, Mike Leigh and David Thewlis. Wim Wenders won Special Jury
Prize for his long, ambitious and ever so slightly cuckoo Faraway, So Close.
And the only major injustice was that Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About
Nothing went prizeless, though it probably gave more people at Cannes more
pleasure than anything since the invention of alcohol.
Back in the viewing-rooms the final days were the usual rush of movies,
cross-cut like a Keystone comedy by the accelerated viewing schedule. (Must
catch all those grapevine recommendations.) So one came out of Canada's I
Love A Man In Uniform, all about a TV actor who dresses as a cop and shoots
up Toronto, only to run straight into Hollywood's Falling Down, in which
Michael Douglas dresses as a yuppie and shoots up Los Angeles. One laughed
happily at Desperate Remedies, a camp New Zealand melodrama crossing the
costumes of The Wicked Lady with the winking excess of Strictly Ballroom,
only to have the smile steam-ironed off one's face by Australia's
stultifying Broken Highway (Down Under attempt to do Tarkovsky).
Next one experienced gentle catatonia at the new Hou Hsiao-Hsien from
Taiwan, an austere epic of family life and political history called The
Puppetmaster, followed by the jangling overkill of Elaine Proctor's Friends.
This last, a British-co-funded production about three ex-university female
pals in South Africa, is notable mainly for the performance as a white
radical hellraiser of Australia's Kerry Fox (An Angel At My Table). Fox
smashes us straight in the face early on with her neurotic power, but then
just goes on smashing. 'Once more, darling, with less feeling' should have
been the director's advice to his star.
Finally we saw two movies that stayed rather than melted in the mind or
caused superficial mayhem there. One was Ken Loach's Raining Stones, a
recession comedy set in a North England racked by daft entrepreneurialism
and doleful wit. (More when it comes to England.) The other was Tian
Zhuangzhuang's Blue Kite from China, shown out-of-competition in the
Directors Fortnight.
This is another Eastern film playing private lives against public history.
But its plainspun pathos is more touching than The Puppetmaster, the
tensions it depicts between political events and family emotions more subtle
than Farewell To My Concubine. As an unseen narrator's voice recalls his
boyhood, we watch three generations of parents and step-parents, aunts and
uncles, friends and enemies traversing 30 years of purgatorial Maoism. They
struggle to keep happiness intact in an age of political informers,
Communist 'consciousness-raising', rural exile and dawn raids by Red Army
thought-police. The movie seldom leaves the domestic arena - kitchens,
bedrooms, meal-tables - yet an entire social-political history is written
into the minutiae of setting and behaviour.
For making this document about life under Mao, Tian Zhuangzhuang was denied
a visa to attend the Cannes festival. More, even before Cannes the movie had
to be completed and edited in Japan by others under the detained Tian's
remote-control instructions. For those who doubt the beneficial role of
international film festivals, here is one radiant reason why we need them.
Would this brave movie otherwise have been seen by anyone - let alone by
critics, distributors and fellow film-makers from every part of the world?

FT  26 MAY 93 / Arts: Horvarth's 'Oktoberfest' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Odon von Horvath was born in 1901, in what was then the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, later Yugoslavia. And, though he died in 1938, his plays express
with brilliant humanity and vision the break-up of old Europe, the ills of
nationalism, the class system, unemployment, poverty, and police rule. Tales
from the Vienna Woods, Don Juan Comes Back from the War and Figaro Gets
Divorced have been shown here to great effect. Figaro Gets Divorced, in
fact, is a modernist classic that should be widely performed.
Now one of our fringe companies, ACTreact (formed in 1990) brings us the
British premiere of Horvath's 1931 Kasimir und Karoline - or, in this
version, Oktoberfest. Munich's annual Oktoberfest - a fun fair, market and
showground - is the locale; and the play turns out to be a German
counterpart to the Rodgers-Hammerstein Carousel. The dominant image is the
funfair's helter-skelter, and, as in Carousel, unemployment, theft, murder,
sex and violence are disturbing presences behind the festival. Unlike
Carousel, there is here no moral uplift; at the Oktoberfest you may well
walk alone.
Kasimir has just become unemployed. He demands of his girlfriend Karoline
that she show him the same loyalty as before, but she insists that she can
no longer commit herself to him so unquestioningly. His jealousy, and her
need to be independent and to do better for herself are both acutely,
painfully, depicted. She wants to keep riding the helterskelter; he can't
afford it. They break up, and he finds himself with pals who try to draw him
into crime, while she gets caught up with rich old men.
Kasimir and Karoline are the flotsam and jetsam of this harsh world. When
they meet again, at the play's end, they are both more vulnerable, both
shocked by all they have seen - but it is too late for them to start again.
And theirs are just two stories among several. The play shows us equally
clearly the lives of the people with whom they get swept up, and it shows us
a society shaped by economic depression. You remember a whorl of remarks
like 'Any intelligent person would be a pessimist,' 'There's no such thing
as a bad person,' 'Unemployment is to blame,' 'People are so nervous
nowadays,' 'I thought that I could see a better future' without remembering
who said each one.
The ACTreact staging, directed and designed by Kevin Knight, gives you the
play (though Knight's translation with Hans Rausch has a few obscenities
that sound mighty anachronistic). The revolving set makes a rather slow
helterskelter, but it occupies so high a proportion of the stage space and
revolves so frequently that the wheeling motion becomes an unmissable
metaphor, and makes Horvath's Oktoberfest as memorable an image of life as
Thackeray's Vanity Fair.
The acting and pacing are too muted; and (as in Carousel) there are several
too many Eloquent Silences. But the large cast (15) nonetheless make the
play absorbing, and catch the tender humanity that underlies Horvath's bleak
and acute view of things were in 1931; and are again today.
At the Lyric Studio, Hammermith, until May 29

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the moment that Mrs Thatcher instigated the process that culminated in
the 1990 Broadcasting Act, Britain's television current affairs community
sensed conspiracy and crisis. The argument ran as follows: irritated by
programmes such as Thames's Death on the Rock in 1988, the Thatcher
government set out to 'tame' the BBC by installing new management and to
distract ITV with a sweeping deregulation designed to force it to target
ratings and profits rather than politicians.
Even though the final version of the Broadcasting bill preserved much of the
ITV regulatory system, fears remained high. Now, it was said, the unequal
outcomes of the ITV franchise round would so impoverish the network that
difficult, unpopular current affairs would give way to gameshows, soap
operas and movies.
Alongside this debate ran another, fuelled by the clash between John Birt,
now director general of the BBC, and his opponents. Birt, through his work
in the 1970s on Weekend World, a current affairs show made by London Weekend
Television, and a couple of essays, argued that television should strive to
analyse the world, rather than being fixated by arresting images of
conflict, violence and emotion. This was Birt's 'mission to explain.'
Birt's opponents replied that this approach would lead to dull, cerebral
over-schematic television which few would want to watch. More subtle critics
pointed to the place of film-makers' logic in current affairs documentaries;
the way that a shot or visual reference can lead to another, communicating
more effectively than Weekend World type reasoning. Birt's view, some said,
was essentially 'anti-televison.' His most passionate enemies said he wanted
to kill off a rival tradition of narrative investigations. Birt has
therefore been accused of providing cover, both in a managerial and
programme philosophy sense, for those who wanted to tame the BBC.
As I sat through several hours of videotape at the weekend, I asked myself:
has this apocalyptic future revealed itself? Has the combination of Mr Birt
and the Broadcasting Act put TV current affairs on its deathbed?
In terms of quantity, the answer is decisively No. Since 1988, the BBC has
become a current affairs factory, adding to the long-established Panorama,
Question Time, Newsnight and the Money Programme programmes like Assignment
(foreign subjects, authored documentary style), and Public Eye (domestic
subjects, shorter documentary approach). On Sundays, it now even schedules
political interview programmes against itself, as Breakfast with Frost
precedes On the Record. What with Walden perorating away on ITV as well,
there are hardly enough politicians to go round.
Channel 4, which is irritating everyone in ITV by grabbing too much
advertising, persists with its successful mix of continuity and raw
experiment. Channel 4 News remains consistently first-rate. Dispatches, a
current affairs series of independent-produced documentaries, is solid and
sometimes better than that.
On ITV's channel 3, the franchise round swept away Thames and with it This
Week. An important casualty, it has been replaced by a prime-time mix of 3D
and Storyline, which are themselves to be succeeded this autumn by the
ambitiously named The Big Story.
Granada's World in Action, which has won a reputation over three decades for
inquiring, trouble-stirring journalism, is still there. Its audience is up
from less than 6 million five years ago to an impressive 8m to 9m this year.
It has just been booked for another prime time run in the autumn. At the
BBC, current affairs ratings since the Broadcasting Act are also more or
less stable. For the general current affairs programmes, old truths hold
good: programmes on foreign subjects are less popular than domestic themes.
Nor does this represent a complete account of current affairs. It does not
include new offerings like Street Legal, Channel 4's law programme, or the
chaotic but watchable LWT Sunday Supplement, where Edwina Curry fails to
control exchanges between a studio audience and a Sunday newspaper editor.
Nor does it weigh in the balance such ambitious projects as last week's
Crime and Punishment on the criminal justice system or Gimme Shelter on
housing. If this is the death of current affairs, then I'm Joan Collins.
But, ah, say the worriers, there may not be a problem (yet) of quantity or
ratings, but what about the quality? There is space to cite only a few
examples.
David Leigh's Storyline, debunking the evidence that MI5 bugged the royals,
was well-reported and argued with, dare one say, a Birtian clarity.
Panorama's report on pressures in Britain's Asian community - Underclass in
Purdah - swept away a stereotype as only the best television can. I had not
seen or read anywhere else what World in Action told me about Combat 18, a
British far-right band of thugs with links to the Ku-Klux-Klan and the
Ulster Defence Association. Public Eye told me things I did not know about
the US groups involved in privatising British prisons. In recent months
current affairs has tackled the monarchy, school tests, truancy, the old,
prisons, Tory aid for the Bush campaign, tuberculosis, drugs, homelessness,
bank charges, coal, oil spills, crime, arms dealing and the ambulance
service, to mention only a few.
Television has also ignored ratings and stuck ruggedly to reporting events
in Bosnia: both Dispatches and Panorama have made gripping contributions in
recent weeks. Martin Bell's Panorama was particularly telling because Bell
is no Birtian theorist, but was able by the sheer authority of his reporting
to communicate in his characteristically terse style exactly what he thought
we ought to think about the story he has reported with such distinction. For
Assignment, William Shawcross contributed a fine film on Cambodia. Those who
have followed On the Record this year will have emerged with insight into
most of the big, running political dramas. The Money Programme needs a
face-lift and has a less sure touch about identifying the biggest stories,
but remains commendably purposeful. I particularly enjoyed a recent film
about the battle for control of Clark's, the shoe company.
This is not to say that everything is wonderful. I was irritated by the
one-dimensional argument of last week's Panorama on working conditions; a
40-minute programme ought to have delved deeper than this caricature of
wicked employer versus exploited worker and supportive trade union in
explaining the important changes taking place in the UK labour market.
Public Eye's programme on alternative medicine was too close to the 'let's
blame the authorities for everything' school of TV journalism. Surely
consumers should be expected to take some responsibility for their choices?
The same programme's enjoyable film on dog dirt could have done with more
supporting facts about the scale of the medical problems and the reliability
of the evidence.
It is also true that there are plenty of dull editions of all these current
affairs programmes and that hum-dinging, government-shattering scoops are
elusive; the truth is, they always were. Perhaps a government as hobbled as
Mr Major's is beyond the target range of TV current affairs: by the time you
have commissioned the film crew, the policy you were out to expose has been
reversed.
It may also be that recent institutional changes in television will
eventually weaken its journalism. Although the BBC seems to have won its
case for a comfortable status quo on funding, the full effects of the new
ITV regime have yet to work through; a wave of mergers seems likely to be
the next big shift. Another fear is that independent production houses will
provide an insufficiently safe haven for adventurous journalism, although
this ignores Channel 4's experience and the fact that many adventurous
journalists continue to choose to work for independents. Nor should it
follow that a more competitive and diversely-owned commercial TV industry
will yield less or even less good current affairs. Apart from anything else,
factual programmes are cheap, compared with, say, drama.
Good journalism, especially work which involves months of digging, does
benefit from an institutional framework which is free from undue political
influence, strongly managed, reasonably settled and decently funded. But it
also needs vigorous competition and change, because without it journalists
become pompous and self-satisfied. I cannot see the evidence that the pace
of change just now is too rapid.
Christopher Dunkley is on holiday. Ian Hargreaves is the FT's deputy editor.
From 1987-90 he worked for the BBC, becoming director of news and current
affairs.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: The high cost of cleaning up -
Drax has ambitious plans to reduce its emissions, but they may be a red
herring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next September, engineers at Drax in North Yorkshire, Europe's largest
coal-fired power station, will commission one of the most ambitious
environmental clean-up projects in the UK.
The exhaust gases from the first of the station's six 660MW generators will
be diverted from the chimney stack into a cavernous rubber-lined steel
chamber where they will be sprayed with a mixture of water and limestone.
That slurry will absorb 90 per cent of the sulphur dioxide from the gases
before they are passed back to the stack and emitted to the atmosphere.
During the following three years, the station's other five units will
receive flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plants of their own, so that by 1996
Drax should be able to shrug off its notoriety as Europe's dirtiest power
station - though at a considerable price. The clean-up will cost National
Power, Drax's owner, more than Pounds 700m.
The start-up of Drax's FGD plant will doubtless be hailed by the government
as an important advance in its efforts to clean up Britain's power stations
 -and meet its international commitments on acid rain. But while the scale
of the project is impressive, it could turn out to be something of an
environmental red herring.
For one thing, only one of Britain's other 30-odd coal-fired power stations
is having FGD fitted (Ratcliffe in Nottinghamshire owned by PowerGen). And
for another, it looks increasingly as if other means than FGD will be used
to achieve the bulk of the intended reduction in harmful emissions. Changes
in fuel use, rationalisation of the bloated power station network and
advances in fuel-burning technology are likely to play a much larger role.
At the international level, the EC's Large Combustion Plant Directive of
1988 sets targets for reduction of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide
emissions (known in the business as sox and nox).
The UK successfully negotiated more lenient targets than continental
countries because of the exceptionally large size of its power stations and
the high sulphur content of British coal. From a 1980 baseline, it has to
cut sox by 60 per cent by 2003 and nox by 30 per cent by 1998.
In both cases, reduction targets for other leading EC members are 10
percentage points higher.
In addition, the UK's Environmental Protection Act requires power stations
to control pollution using the best available technology, not entailing
excessive cost (BATNEEC). Just before Easter, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of
Pollution issued a set of EPA authorisations for power plants intended to
achieve a steady reduction in sox and nox by the year 2001 and meeting the
EC targets.
Unlike previous controls, which gave each generating company a 'bubble' of
emissions which it could share out among its power stations as it wanted,
the HMIP's new authorisations will impose limits on individual stations as
well. That is mainly to bring emissions down faster at stations which are
sensitively placed, such as those in the Thames Valley or close to the Welsh
hills or the Pennines. Drax, located near Humberside, where the prevailing
winds carry its emissions out to the North Sea, gets more lenient limits.
But the overall effect of this will be to reduce the generators'
flexibility, so the new rules effectively represent a tightening of
standards.
The generating companies have a year to come up with plans to meet the new
requirements, but it is already clear that an acceleration of FGD
installation is most unlikely. Roger Witcomb, the director of corporate
planning at National Power, says generators have the alternatives of running
a power station less intensively, or simply closing it down and switching to
cleaner fuels.
The choice will depend on many factors, one of the main ones being the large
cost of FGD. Apart from the expense of the installation itself, FGD actually
reduces the efficiency of a power station as it needs a lot of electricity
to run.
Drax's FGD will add 0.6p to the cost of a kilowatt hour of electricity,
nearly 25 per cent of the price that electricity fetches in the wholesale
pool.
(There are cheaper methods. ScottishPower may clean up its Longannet station
on the Firth of Forth with sea water, but this is not an option available to
inland stations.)
FGD also carries an environmental cost. By adding to power demand, it pushes
up emissions of carbon dioxide. It also increases the quarrying of
limestone, and produces waste material which has to be disposed of (it will
be buried at Drax).
In fact, the economic and environmental case against FGD is becoming much
stronger. What may tip the balance decisively is the growing availability of
natural gas as an alternative to coal.
For the price of its Drax FGD plant, National Power could have built two
1000MW gas stations which were not only thermally much more efficient but
whose emissions were minimal.
Michael Reidy, corporate affairs director of PowerGen, describes FGD as a
'negative investment' compared with the 'positive' opportunities available
for investing in new environmentally friendly plant.
PowerGen has not turned its back on FGD, he stresses (it has plans pending
for an installation at its Ferrybridge station in West Yorkshire), but 'we
will address negative investments when we have to.'
Ian Preston, chief executive of ScottishPower, is more blunt about it. 'We
will not invest in FGD if we can avoid it, ' he says.
He would far rather see alternatives, such as tradeable pollution permits,
recently introduced in the US, which would allow him to take advantage of
the fact that Scottish coal has a lower sulphur content than English. He
would 'sell' his pollution rights to English generators who needed them
more.
All the generating companies are playing their cards close to their chests
as they digest the implications of the new HMIP authorisations. But the
broad message is clear. Only a few large power stations with long, active
lives ahead of them will justify the cost of FGD. Old, inefficient stations
face closure and the rest will be managed in a variety of ways, such as
burning cleaner coal or operating fewer hours.
'There's a huge overhang of capacity in the market,' Witcomb says. 'Only big
plant will be left by the year 2001.'
The effect of this on the structure of UK power generation is becoming
evident. The economics greatly favour gas over coal, and are encouraging a
surge in gas-fired capacity which could replace as much as half the present
coal-fired plant by the end of this decade.
That may be bad news for the miners, but it will lead to marked reductions
in sox and nox - and also of carbon gases for which there is, at the moment,
no commercially viable method of extraction.
The new economics is even giving encouragement to the nuclear power industry
which produces no gaseous emissions. The government will be embarking on a
review of the nuclear industry later this year.
Whether all this activity actually produces a sufficient cut in sox and nox
to restore the environment, rather than merely to meet legal targets, will
continue to be a matter for debate. Fiona Weir, a clean air campaigner at
Friends of the Earth, says that HMIP's new authorisations were a 'missed
opportunity' to accelerate the drive to reduce acid rain. Britain is only
doing the minimum necessary to meet standards which are generous anyway, and
HMIP is not enforcing the introduction of the best clean-up technology.
The power industry, which still disputes the link between its emissions and
the damage allegedly caused to lakes and plant life, says it is doing more
than required.
Whatever the case, the EC is expected to tighten up the emission reduction
targets when it meets to review the LCPD next year, and so the pressures
will increase.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Body Shop treads thin green
line - The UK-based retailer has set a fresh standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop irritates the cynics, but its latest environmental report may
soothe many of its greener observers.
The second edition of the UK-based retailer's 'green book', published this
week, is an uncommon attempt to push corporate accountability into less
conventional areas.
It treads a fine line: part propaganda; part political tract; and part
relatively objective, if incomplete, profile of the company's activities and
effects.
About 5,000 copies of the colourful 30-page guide have been produced for
distribution to shareholders and other interested groups. They list the
company's future targets and current performance on topics such as energy,
waste and 'product stewardship'.
'We want people to see environmental reporting as fun and accessible, as
well as not being difficult for companies to do,' says David Wheeler,
general manager for environment, health and safety. 'We want this to be a
normal part of our annual reporting process, and we hope that others in the
retail sector who make green claims will follow. They have nothing to lose.'
While companies are increasingly producing environmental reports, few do so
to rigorous criteria, are comprehensive, or allow meaningful comparisons
between sites and the past. Fewer still are independently verified. Body
Shop goes some way to meeting these points.
A statement from the board at the start says it plans to review the
company's investment and pension arrangements during the coming year on
environmental and social grounds. It also plans to make new investments in
on-site waste-water treatment and plans to change its in-store refill
service during 1993-94.
There are some interesting disclosures, not least that Body Shop expects
soon to proceed with the construction of a wind farm in Wales in conjunction
with National Wind Power, which would eventually match the company's energy
requirements throughout the UK.
There is a clear set of targets at the start of the report for the end of
this year and up to next February. These include eliminating the use of PVC,
reducing the impact of packaging and conducting environmental reviews in all
subsidiaries and overseas franchises.
But several of these targets are not quantified. That will make comparisons
difficult. The issue crops up throughout the report. Electricity and gas
energy consumption on a range of measures are only shown for last year, not
the year before, for instance.
Body Shop's first green book had a verification statement from Arthur D
Little, an environmental consultancy, which agreed to offer the service at
cost price. This year it employed Environmental Resources Limited (ERL), for
a fixed fee of Pounds 4,000; again hardly enough to be profitable. Richard
Cane, one of the ERL consultants involved, says there were six people-days
spent on site interviewing more than 30 Body Shop employees, inspecting
documents, and making random visits. A further four days will be spent on a
detailed report for management.
The verifiers are pioneers groping around in the dark with few guidelines to
help them form a view. They drew up a six-page checklist based on elements
mentioned in the EC's ecological management and auditing scheme, launched
earlier this year.
The one-page verification statement included in the report veers away from
the objective into the idiosyncratic and even the self promoting: 'In our
professional judgment the Body Shop can consider itself an industry leader
for its initiatives,' it concludes.
It is at least informative and individual, in stark contrast to the standard
wording of the auditor's report in companies' financial statements. It is
also partly critical, highlighting issues requiring further attention, such
as greater documentation of procedures, responsibilities and training needs.
There are still weaknesses in the green book. But Body Shop has pushed the
boundaries of reporting beyond those adopted by most of its rivals.

The former managing director of Air Europe is to be managing director of the
newly formed resources, engineering and services directorate of the BBC.
Rod Lynch, 44, will take over from Bill Dennay, who has overseen the
creation of the new directorate and retires at the end of this month after
37 years at the BBC.
Lynch is currently sales and marketing director with Forte Hotels.
He will have a seat on the BBC board of management and will report to Bob
Phillis, deputy director general of the Corporation.
Phillis said yesterday Lynch would bring 'a wealth of broad commercial
experience'.
Lynch had 20 years in the airline business, 18 of them at British Airways.
The new resource directorate brings together all the separate business units
created under Producer Choice - the system which gives BBC producers the
right to buy services in the outside market if they want to.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Anthony Cleaver, part-time chairman of IBM UK, will take on the
chairmanship of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) from July
on the retirement of John Maltby, the former chairman of Burmah Oil, who has
served his three-year term.
The UKAEA, which trades as AEA Technology, is a candidate for privatisation.
The DTI has already asked merchant bank BZW to examine the feasibility of a
transfer into the private sector - which would not happen before 1995.
The agency's orientation is considerably more commercial than when
mechanical engineer Maltby arrived describing himself as a 'dirty-handed
businessman whose job is to make money'. For the year ended March 1992, it
announced a profit of Pounds 16.8m, following a Pounds 40m loss for the
previous 12 months.
Sir Anthony, who joined IBM UK in 1962 after taking a classics degree from
Oxford, was chief executive from 1986 to 1991 and has been chairman since
1990.
Much of AEA's energy is devoted to helping companies adopt and exploit
innovative technologies - often transferring technologies developed
specifically for the nuclear industry to other kinds of business. Observers
comment that Cleaver's experience at IBM, where there has been a shift from
straight selling to customer service and joint problem-solving, should be an
asset.
Cleaver's prominent advocacy of green business practices should also boost
AEA's efforts to develop environmental expertise which includes a programme
to advise governments on renewable energy sources.
In view of restricted government funds for nuclear research and development,
AEA aims to increase the non-nuclear side of its business - presently at
about 35 per cent of turnover - to about 50 per cent by the mid-1990s.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Management: NatWest publishes its principles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strongly worded 10-page document has been sent to more than 90,000
National Westminster Bank employees in the last few weeks. It lays out the
details of one of the more ambitious codes of conduct so far launched by a
British company.
It says NatWest's priorities are integrity in its dealings, delivering
customer satisfaction and creating opportunities for staff. It touches on
conflicts of interest, criminal activities and accepting entertainment.
It is, as Neil Hartley, one of the executives most involved in its
development, says 'like putting up a white backcloth against which you can
measure everything.'
NatWest first published a 'set of principles' in 1986. When it restructured
in 1990, it decided to revise the guidance. Hartley insists that the changes
were not triggered by the Blue Arrow affair.
At a time when the aim was to 'empower' more managers and decentralise
control, Hartley says that there was an ever greater need to maintain a
'bedrock' of common NatWest culture.
A senior group of executives began working on the new code in the autumn of
1990. 'There was an air of anticipation that the whole thing could be agreed
and implemented within three months,' says Hartley. 'It took us over two
years.'
He says the previous principles were in parts contradictory and generally
difficult to implement. They gave no idea of the bank's priorities. 'They
could only work in an organisation driven from the top,' he says.
NatWest hired John Drummond, head of Integrity Works, an ethics consultancy
based in London, to help develop the new code. Drummond stressed three
points: the need for commitment from the most senior levels in the bank; to
involve as many people as possible in the drafting process; and to make it
clear that the code would be monitored and enforced.
More than 600 people were consulted during 1991 at all levels in the
company. Discussion continued in 1992 as more reorganisation delayed the
formal launch of the new code.
'There was very little scepticism,' Drummond says. 'The fact that
organisations present themselves as ethically mute is irrelevant. People are
very interested in talking about ethics.'
Consultation lead to several changes. The tone became less intimidating.
Accountability was increased with an annual report to the board on progress
with the code.
A confidential hotline was launched to help with enforcement, which has
taken more than 60 calls since it opened in April.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Management: The moral maze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over 500 business ethics courses are currently taught on US campuses. More
than 25 textbooks and three academic journals are dedicated to the topic.
And at least 16 business-ethics research centres - and several university
chairs - have been established.
Despite significant interest in the subject, though, managers in the US are
probably bewildered, claims Andrew Stark, an assistant professor at the
University of Toronto writing in the May-June issue of the Harvard Business
Review.
Stark says it is not that managers dislike doing the right thing: over the
years the problem has been an absence of practical advice on grey areas and
how to cope when competitive and institutional pressures lead the well
intentioned astray.
The old corporate social responsibility approach, he explains, held that the
market would ultimately reward ethical behaviour. When it was clear that
ethics and interests did come into conflict, though, academics became mired
in absolutist notions of moral philosophy. Scholars too often took an
unrealistic line, suggesting that a manager's motivation could either be
altruistic or self-interested, never both.
Stark says professional ethicists are now starting to address the moral
dilemmas that managers face on a daily basis. A new business ethics is
emerging that acknowledges and accepts the messy world of mixed motives,
where moderation, pragmatism and minimalism are legitimate concepts. He
cites - approvingly - the former chairman of the Stride Rite Corporation, a
Dollars 500m (Pounds 333.3m) US manufacturer of children's shoes which
combines a 'long-standing, quasi medical dedication to foot care' with
shrewd marketing (appealing designs and boutiques). Refusing to be drawn
into the 'ethics versus bottom line' conundrum, he is quoted as saying:
'We're unashamedly out to make a profit and we're very much concerned about
(children's) health. . . We run the business on both concerns'.
A fuller article on business ethics in the US - featuring the Nynex
telephone company - appeared on this page on May 14th.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Management: Laying down a code of honour - In the wake of
scandals, bribery and corruption European companies are trying to become
more ethical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN, CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES, TOM BURNS, LUCY KELLAWAY and
DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's corruption scandal - which moved to the telecoms sector last week -
has highlighted the risks for senior executives of bribing their way to
bigger profits. But the problem is not just one for individuals and the
courts. The recent series of arrests in Rome and Milan has demonstrated the
damage which can be inflicted when internationally respected corporate names
are dragged through the dirt.
While Italy may be the most topical case, corruption and how to prevent it
are important issues elsewhere in Europe too. In Britain, for example,
Stanley Kiaer of the Institute of Business Ethics believes the number of
misdeeds may have increased slightly during the recession as the lax ways
practised during the 1980s came unstuck. But he argues that the long-term
trend is for companies to be more ethical.
Recent corporate scandals such as the dirty tricks campaign waged by British
Airways against its smaller rival, Virgin Atlantic, have caused a shudder to
run through British boardrooms. There is now a growing awareness of the
impact of such revelations on staff morale and on relations with the outside
world.
According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Business Ethics last
year, 30 per cent of large companies had such a code; many more were
considering adopting one.
Fear of scandal is not the primary impetus, according to the experts. Other
surveys show that customers place high importance on the reputation of their
suppliers, that employees want to be treated fairly and that shareholders
want greater accountability.
Banco Bilboa Vizcaya, BBV, is not the only Spanish institution to have been
caught out in allegedly corrupt dealings with the government - but so far it
is the corporation that has most publicly sought to make amends. Its recent
publication of a code of conduct for senior executives was a highly unusual
step for a Spanish company.
Judicial investigations into what is known as the Filesa case, after the
apparently bogus Barcelona-based consultancy company controlled by Socialist
party members, have suggested that BBV paid close to Pta200m (Pounds 1m) to
Filesa before the 1989 election.
Taking the blame was the easy part for the bank. It placed it squarely on a
past, and now dead, chairman who was known for his friendly relations with
the socialist government. Present chairman Emilio Ybarra told the bank's AGM
that when his predecessor ordered the payment for the Filesa reports; 'It
was because he thought them opportune and convenient'. Ybarra left the
matter at that.
The ethical code is a 12-page document that deals with confidentiality,
conflicts of interest, lending policies and related issues. It does not
mention the Filesa scandal. But it specifically calls upon BBV's senior
executives to refrain from any action involving the bank group in which,
directly or indirectly, they might have particular interests.
If preoccupation with business ethics is new to Spain, the same cannot be
said for Scandinavia. Sweden takes the problem seriously enough to have set
up a special body to help tackle it. The Institute against Corruption, which
keeps companies up to date about codes of practice and legislative changes,
was established in 1923 and is backed by organisations including the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and the Swedish Federation of Industries.
'Inside Sweden serious bribery, involving thousands of kronor, is unusual
both in the public and the private sectors', says Thorsten Cars, the
institute's chairman. 'But there is a feeling that the problem is getting
worse at another level in that Christmas gifts, study trips and business
entertainment are getting more lavish,' he states.
Recent attention has centred on 'buddy loans' - where banking executives are
offered inducements from clients seeking big loans. Cars said legal cases so
far indicated the problem involved those at middle management levels rather
than top bank executives.
Recent German corruption cases have largely tainted the country's
politicians. Quite apart from that, however, the brutal tactics increasingly
used by companies in the recession have led to talk of a 'moral crisis' in
German industry and widened the debate on ethics.
For example, the case of Jose Ignacio Lopez, recently recruited to
Volkswagen from rival General Motors and accused of unfairly trying to poach
former colleagues, has raised the question of what is acceptable corporate
behaviour.
'At a time when companies are fighting a desperate battle to restore
profitability, ethical considerations are not the first priority,' says
Gertrud Hohler, the Berlin-based communications guru who advises many large
German companies. 'His (Lopez's) tactics have unleashed great indignation,'
says Hohler, 'but at the same time his hardness and his relentlessness
convince many that he is exactly the right man for the job.'
Count Augustinius H. Henckel-Donnersmarck, a Dusseldorf-based monk who
advises on ethical issues disagrees. He told Wirtschaftswoche, a weekly
business magazine, that Lopez's tactics threatened to undermine capitalism.
'Management immorality begins at the very point where managers stop
fulfilling their obligations to other members of society,' he said.
The French, meanwhile, appear to be displaying their customary sang-froid.
Every local businessman knows what 'fausse facturation' means - inflating
invoices with the extra going to line the pockets of national or local
politicians who award contracts. But none will admit their companies need to
take any special measures against it, beyond what already exists in French
law.
Since 1988, France has had legislation providing for some public funding of
political parties' or candidates' expenses, and limiting the amount which
companies can give. A company cannot provide more than 10 per cent of a
parliamentary candidate's expenses, up to a limit of FFr500,000 (Pounds
60,000). Any such gift must also be reported.
This mixed regime of public funding and private disclosure has not, however,
prevented some recent scandals, with companies conniving at false billing in
the interest of winning favour and/or contracts from politicians, mainly at
the local level. It is the construction industry which seems most prone to
the temptation.
The tendency is to blame the politicians for soliciting bribes rather than
companies for giving them. As in Germany it is the former who have been
prosecuted, not the latter.
'No special code of conduct for companies exists at the national level',
said an official of the Patronat employers federation, adding he knew of no
company which had instituted formal anti-bribery rules.
Bouygues, France's biggest contractor, said it had no code of conduct. 'The
idea of voluntary rules going beyond what is in the law is very
Anglo-Saxon', said the Patronat official. 'We regard state control as
sufficiently tough for companies not to have to make any special effort to
sensitise their employees to it.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / People: Fyfe in line to head Devro
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Devro International, the maker of edible sausage skins, is to announce the
appointment of David Fyfe as chief executive designate when it produces a
pathfinder prospectus later this week ahead of a stock market flotation.
Fyfe resigned last week as managing director of a division of Hickson
International, the specialty chemicals group, where he had been hoping for a
main board position.
Hickson chairman Dennis Kerrison said his departure was amicable. Fyfe was,
however, unlikely to make it to board level early as the board was stable
and set up like a continental supervisory board.
Fyfe will be in line to take over from Frank De Angeli, Devro's chief
executive, who is 68. Devro is expected to be valued at about Pounds 170m.

FT  26 MAY 93 / People: Padovan takes chair at Gardner Merchant
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Padovan is kicking off the Season in suitable fashion, by accepting the
non-executive chairmanship of the larg-est contract caterer in the UK and
Europe, Gardner Merchant.
Gardner Merchant, which was the subject of a Pounds 402m management buy-out
in January, caters for a multiplicity of functions, ranging from Ascot and
Royal garden parties to the Derby.
It also serves 74 of the FT-SE 100 companies. Padovan, 55, was off to the
Chelsea Flower Show this week in the course of his first official function
for Gardner Merchant.
But it is for his City know-how, rather than social graces, that the former
deputy chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd has been hired. The company has
set its sights on a stock market listing, possibly towards the end of 1994.
'We have sold more contracts in the first two months of this year than
during the whole of last year,' says Garry Hawkes, chief executive. He was
referring to the days when the company found itself diverting resources to
negotiations with Compass catering group, which in the end failed to buy
Gardner Merchant.
Gardner Merchant has made particular progress in the public sector.
It recently won contracts for the World Bank in Wash-ington DC, London
Under-ground, and the Hong Kong airport construction site.
Padovan's other activities include the chairmanship of AAH Holdings, as well
as non-executive directorships at Tesco, Whitbread and Hartstone and at a
few private companies. He is also an adviser to BZW, where he was deputy
chairman between 1989 and 1991.
He says he will be 'rationalising one or two' of his portfolio of
directorships and advisory posts.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Jobs: Pen-pushing largely written off - Readers vote
overwhelmingly in favour of encouraging students to work on word-processors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOULD readers who were not in the congregation four weeks ago, kindly pardon
the Jobs column while it says something to one Shirley Anderson then
present? Thank you. O K then, here goes:
What? Me? Rude? Rubbish]
Which said, I owe the innocent majority of you an explanation of what
provoked the outburst.
Ms Anderson is one of several dozen who responded to my sermon on the day
concerned, which was about getting the evil eye from a conference audience
at Nottingham University. My offence was to question whether higher
educational institutions are right to deter the use of word-processors by
their students, pressing them to write their essays and such in long-hand.
That strikes me as mistaken. No doubt schools let alone universities should
ensure their charges are good enough at handwriting to use it in framing the
short communications for which it remains a necessary skill. But it is a
different matter to require students already at degree level to churn out
thousands of words by hand. Pen-pushing at such length is now an obsolescent
ability, and students would be better occupied strumming the keyboards they
will increasingly have to use in earning a living.
Shirley Anderson dissents. In particular, she suggests that I earned the
evil eye by behaving rudely: 'You effectively told your audience that their
point of view was so old-fashioned it wasn't worth discussing.'
That is hard to accept. While I might have been controversial, I find it no
easier to see myself as being rude than academics would to view themselves
as clinging to convenient customs regardless of their students' best
interests.
But if it so happened that I seemed rude, then it is a mercy that the
conference audience isn't here to see the bulk of readers' replies on the
issue. For of the 74 responses, 69 agree that the use of word-processors
should be positively encouraged by higher educational institutions, often
accusing same of unworthy motives in resisting the change.
True, upwards of 30 of you think the switch should not be immediate. The
reason given is typically that, since protracted pen-pushing requires
practice, students should be obliged to keep their fists in by handwriting
essays until such time as word-processors can be used in taking university
exams.
Even so, approaching 20 others see no reason why examinations can't be done
on word-processors right now. 'Admittedly it's a development that would cost
money,' says one. 'But even if it couldn't be found by disposing of
un-productive staff, at least heads of universities could get off their
bottoms and trek round computer companies. I'll bet they could be levered
into offering good deals.'
To my eyes, that proposal looks well worth a try. After all, there would be
no need for universities to supply hardware to all of their students - only
to those who, not having their own, still wished to use one in preference to
a pen.
Nor do I see sense in the claim made by two of the dissenters that making it
optional to use a word-processor in examinations would be unconscionable,
because it would discriminate unfairly against students from families too
poor to have one in the home.
I remember seeing a research report some time ago (though I sadly cannot lay
my hands on it now) indicating that one of the factors most strongly linked
with success in exams is clarity of handwriting . . . which helps to explain
why some pukka schools train pupils to write a readable fist. Hence there's
surely good reason for allowing those who've lost out on the pen to gain on
a word-processor.
NOW to the table below, which looks to contain a worrying message for motor
companies. As on previous occasions, it gives indicators of prevailing pay
levels in City of London banks as revealed by Day Associates' latest survey
based on data from 121 employers, and including 293 jobs from general
manager to tea lady.
Since I have room for only 17 of them, anyone wanting more information will
need to obtain the full report from Joe Clark of Day at Suite 2.31, 75
Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel (0)71-375 1397, fax (0)71-375 1723. The
price is Pounds 141 to concerns taking part in the survey, and Pounds 220 to
others.
The table's first four columns of figures cover basic salaries. The lower
quartile refers to the person a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of
all in the same type of job, the median to the person mid-way, and the upper
quartile to the one a quarter down from the top. Then comes the average
salary, followed by the percentage of it typically received as an added
bonus.
Lastly come the percentages with a car, and its average price thereof -
which suggest that in the City at least, cars are fast being withdrawn and
replaced by allowances. Mr Clark reckons the typical allowance, at about a
third of the price of the vehicle given up, is less than the benefit of
keeping it. 'But people I've talked to don't seem to mind,' he says,
'despite being bankers.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Reshuffle fever breaks out - Philip
Stephens tastes a tangible atmosphere of anticipation over early changes to
the cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TIDAL wave of reshuffle speculation swept through the bars and lobbies of
Westminster last night as ministers and MPs prepared for their Whitsun
break.
With Mr John Major insistent that the outside world would be given no
advance warning of any shake-up, senior ministers joined political
journalists in the latest game of rearranging the place mats around the
cabinet table.
A signal from Downing Street early in the day that ministers could depart
for a well-deserved Whitsun break without fear that their P45s would follow
in the post initially brought a collective sigh of relief.
Mr Norman Lamont, the beleaguered chancellor, was said to be heading for a
spot of rest and recuperation at his Dorneywood country house.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, was taking time
off from the political storm over his public-spending review to plan
tonight's celebrations of his 40th birthday.
But politics is never that simple. As the night wore on - and the wine
bottles emptied - it dawned on Mr Major's loyal generals and lieutenants
that the message from Number 10 had not been entirely unequivocal.
For all the prime minister's insistence that he will not be bullied by the
media, it is common currency at Westminster that his closest political
advisers want him to move Mr Lamont from the Treasury. Nothing personal, you
understand, but the chancellor has been at the scene of too many accidents.
So relief at the prospect of a stress-free week soon gave way to suspicion
that Mr Major might have outsmarted everyone. He could plan the reshuffle
next week and spring his surprise when ministers and MPs return on June 7.
What better way to start the second half of the summer term. It might even
help him win the Christchurch by-election.
It must be a real possibility - though the few in the know will not yet
venture it as a probability.
The prime minister's thoughts on cabinet changes - will he, won't he - are
the closest thing in this post-cold-war era to a state secret. The chief
whip might know, possibly the party chairman. But their lips are sealed.
Late last night came the real panic. If the Mr Major was serious about
changes might he not startle us all by choosing his new team this week?
Well, suggested Downing Street, probably not. For one thing he will be
spending most of Friday with President Francois Mitterrand in Paris. On
Sunday he has a long-standing engagement with the Queen. Back to square one.
Not quite, perhaps. Good governance, as it was once called, demands that Mr
Major will soon have to put his ministers - and us journalists  - out of
their misery.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords to face pressure on EC bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORCE of convention in the House of Lords is being invoked by ministers
as they seek to secure the Maastricht Bill's swift and safe passage through
parliament in the next two months.
Government business managers have drawn up a provisional timetable, which
would mean that the legislation was passed and the pre-ratification social
chapter debates took place before MPs and peers dispersed for the summer,
probably in late July.
But the plans depend on Euro-sceptic peers of all parties keeping within the
traditions of the Lords.
Ministers believe that rebels will not make interminable speeches or put
down vast numbers of amendments because such tactics would alienate
potential dissidents who might well regard them as abuses of the Lords'
relaxed procedures.
But there is the scarcely veiled threat that the government could make the
House sit into the early hours of the morning to get through the business -
'the traditional way of damping enthusiasm', one minister said.
Ministers have already begun seeing backbenchers, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, is to meet Tory peers before the Lords embarks on the
committee stage. The Lords will hold a general two-day debate on the bill
immediately after the Whitsun recess.
Peers will then have four days for the committee stage of the bill, two days
for the report stage, and one to give the bill a third reading.
Lady Thatcher is expected to make no more than a couple of high-profile
speeches during discussion of the bill, but other Euro-sceptics - for the
moment at least - are intending to put down hundreds of amendments.
Most attention is likely to focus on the social chapter and on the
referendum campaign.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers suffer leasehold defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLAT OWNERS in cathedral closes are to be excluded from the government's
controversial plans for leasehold reform, after ministers were defeated in
the House of Lords yesterday.
In their final debate on the housing and urban development bill, peers voted
by 123 to 107 to support a move by the Earl of Kinnoull, a Tory backbencher,
to exclude holders of long leases on properties within a cathedral precinct
from benefiting from the reforms which increase tenants' rights.
Just two weeks ago the government suffered a similar rebellion when its own
peers managed to exclude some 60 stately homes from the plans enabling
leaseholders to buy the freehold of their prop-erties.
Though neither revolt is significant in terms of the overall thrust of the
reform, each highlights the consistent and heartfelt opposition to the
proposals within Conservative ranks. The Duke of Westminster left the Tory
party over the issue.
Although attacks on the reforms have come both from those supporting
landlords' interests and those campaigning for a further extension of
tenants' rights, the two sides have often cancelled each other out, enabling
the government to avoid further set-backs.
The Lords provided a vivid example of this yesterday in a rare tied vote
over an attempt to increase the number of leaseholders who would be eligible
for the reforms. Under Lords procedures, the deadlock means that the
proposal, which attracted 131 votes for and against, is lost.
in spite of the bill's troubled passage through parliament, the only
remaining stage is for the Commons to discuss the changes made by the Lords.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rebuff to Smith on block vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR LEADER Mr John Smith suffered a setback yesterday at the MSF
technicians' union conference when delegates rejected the use of the
principle of one-member, one-vote instead of the union block vote for the
selection of Labour parliamentary candidates.
Mr Smith had spoken at the conference the day before, defending the proposal
for one-member, one-vote. Its rejection is a particular blow because it
suggests that his efforts last week to avert the prospect of a confrontation
with the unions over the issue are fail-ing.
At last Wednesday's meeting of Labour's ruling national executive committee,
Mr Smith proposed softening the original proposals by suggesting individual
union members should receive full party membership for a reduced rate.

<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday sought to inflict the maximum political damage over the
Treasury's scrutiny of the welfare state by challenging this week's
assurance by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the exercise would
respect the spirit and the letter of the Tory general election manifesto.
In rowdy Commons exchanges, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader,
contrasted statements made by Mr Major in an interview with the Financial
Times published yesterday with actions already taken by the government.
She said pledges not to increase National Insurance contributions, not to
extend value added tax and to maintain tax relief on mortgage interest had
been broken.
But her attack was rejected by Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons,
who insisted: 'This government is approaching its difficult task in a
responsible and considered way.'
Mr Major had made the position 'absolutely clear' in setting out the
government's intention to review public expenditure against the background
of 'the pledges we have made and the need to protect the most vulnerable.'
Mrs Beckett scoffed at ministerial claims about the government's readiness
to take tough decisions. 'When is the government going to make the tough
decision to admit even the smallest share of the blame for the state to
which this country is being reduced, never mind the price it is asking the
British people to pay.'
The most fundamental problem Britain faced today was that it had a
government whose 'dishonesty is exceeded only by its incompetence,' she
said.
Joining the attack, Mr Peter Mandelson, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, said
if the government introduced 'hotel charges' for hospital patients it would
destroy the principle that the National Health Service should be free at
time of need and at point of use.
Mr Newton answered by quoting the undertaking in the Conservative election
manifesto that 'need, not ability to pay' would remain the basis on which
care was offered to all in the NHS.

THE British government outlined its latest blueprint for the political
structure of Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic's government in Dublin
yesterday.
But no new initiatives emerged from the ministerial meeting that might
kick-start the stalled round-table political talks.
It had been hoped that yesterday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference
might give a fresh momentum to the talks process now that the province's
local elections are over.
But Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the UK
government's proposals were still incomplete and would only be presented 'as
and when the talks resume'. He said the British blueprint would not be 'an
agreed paper between the two governments'.
Mr Dick Spring, the republic's foreign minister, said he was satisfied that
there would be further consultations between before the British paper was
completed.
The province's political parties abandoned negotiations last November
without agreeing new political structures. The refusal by the hard-line
Democratic Unionist party to sit at the table until the Irish Republic
relinquishes its territorial claim to the province continues to be the main
hurdle to further progress.
Sir Patrick said yesterday that articles two and three of the Irish
constitution, which set out the republic's territorial claim on the
province, were 'a significant factor' blocking progress.
Mr Spring reiterated his government's position that he would not accept
preconditions and issued a plea to unionists. 'Why not come and talk?' he
said. 'It doesn't help anybody to set out preconditions. We are available
for dialogue.'
Both ministers said they intend to initiate private meetings with the
leaders of Northern Ireland's main political parties in an attempt to
establish the basis for fresh talks.
Sir Patrick welcomed the moves by the republic to amend extradition
legislation 'to close loopholes that have recently been opened up by
judicial decisions'. The question of internment, demanded by unionist
leaders in the wake of the IRA's latest bombing offensive in Northern
Ireland, was not discussed.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM SAINSBURY, the industry minister, was warned yesterday that there is
growing concern at the uncertainty hanging over Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipbuilder which went into receivership nearly a fortnight ago.
Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of Tyne and Wear Development Corporation,
told Mr Sainsbury at a meeting in London that a rapid response from the
Ministry of Defence on whether work could continue beyond Friday on
outfitting three frigates was vital to maintain cashflow.
Continuing work on the frigates offers Swans a chance of winning new orders
and finding a buyer as a going concern.
Negotiations between Price Waterhouse, the receiver, and the MoD are
continuing. 'Time is perilously short,' Mr Balls said after his meeting with
Mr Sainsbury - who visits Tyneside today.
The development corporation is backing calls for Swans to survive as a
shipbuilder. Mr Balls said that Mr Sainsbury had said demands for the
company, currently designated a warship yard, to be given access to
Intervention Funding so it could pursue merchant vessel orders were being
'closely examined'.
According to research released yesterday, Swans owes almost Pounds 1m to
direct suppliers in North Tyneside alone. A survey by North Tyneside
council's economic development service of 40 of the company's 44 direct
suppliers in the borough says they employ 1,542 people; businesses
representing 70 per cent of these employees said they face a significant
impact if Swans closes.
The research, the first attempt to quantify the knock-on effect of Swans'
possible demise, reveals that it owes Pounds 904,000 to 31 of the companies;
some of the other nine, who declined to disclose financial details, are also
believed to be owed substantial sums. Of the 40 surveyed, 82.5 per cent said
they were owed money.
Most said it was too soon to quantify job losses if Swans closed. But one
business, a supplier to since 1937, planned to cut 10 jobs immediately.
The report, Cutting the Supply Line, says job losses are likely in
high-technology supply companies in sectors such as hydraulic equipment,
cabling and marine engineering. In total, it says, Swans has 140 direct
suppliers in Tyne and Wear and many local companies supply them.
It remains unclear when an announcement will be made about the frigates.

FT  26 MAY 93 / ITC to examine Tyne Tees again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission is to review Yorkshire-Tyne Tees
Television's performance at the end of this year to make sure that the
merged ITV company is carrying out its licence obligations.
The decision follows an investigation launched amid fears that the merger
was undermining the the company's ability to act as a separate broadcaster
in north-east England.
In a letter to Sir Derek Palmar, the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees chairman, published
yesterday, Sir George Russell, ITC chairman, makes clear that the commission
has insisted on a restructuring of the company to emphasise the separate
identity of each region.
Under the new structure there will be no group director of programmes.
Instead Mr Clive Leach, group chief executive, will work with Mr John
Fairley, managing director of Yorkshire, and Mr John Calvert, managing
director of Tyne Tees.
The commission has accepted the arrangements put in place because they
provided 'a clear and unambiguous chain of programme commissioning and
production, together with editorial and scheduling responsibility within
Tyne Tees'.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.

BRITISH investors have expressed interest in taking a stake in Newspaper
Publishing, owner of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday.
Preliminary contacts have been made with Newspaper Publishing's merchant
bank SG Warburg and with Schroders, advisers to the company's principal
shareholders El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy. A UK investor's
stake of 10 per cent to 20 per cent would counterbalance the Spanish and
Italian stakes of 18.3 per cent each.

</HEADLINE>

DEVELOPMENT benefits sought by local authorities in return for granting
planning permission often go beyond government guidelines and are not
subject to sufficient public scrutiny, says a study published today by the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation.
It warns that the 'integrity of the planning system could be undermined if
arrangements come to be seen as a way that developers buy permission from
the council'.

THE government substantially achieved its objectives when it sold the
short-term insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department to
NCM, the Dutch insurance company, the National Audit Office says in a report
published today, John Willman writes.
The public expenditure watchdog says the sales proceeds of Pounds 20m were
reasonable in the circumstances. The direct expenses - Pounds 6.7m -
reflected its complexity.
The NCM bid was the lower of the two bids received for the sale - the
government was offered Pounds 25m by Generali, the Italian insurer.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Scots Office to review verdict of 'not proven'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTTISH OFFICE is to review the passing of 'not proven' verdicts which
are used in Scottish courts when juries do not wish to find an accused
person either guilty or not guilty.
The review, announced yesterday by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary,
follows increasing public concern about the verdict, culminating in a
60,000-signature petition seeking its abolition. A private member's bill to
abolish the 'not proven' verdict has been put down by Mr George Robertson,
MP for Hamilton and a Labour frontbench spokesman on European affairs.
Since 1728, juries in criminal trials in Scotland have been able to choose
between returning verdicts of guilty, not guilty and 'not proven'. A 'not
proven' verdict counts as an acquittal and, like a not guilty verdict, means
the accused cannot be tried again for the offence.
It is said officially to be appropriate when the prosecution has not proved
its case beyond reasonable doubt and where the jury is not prepared to say
that the accused is innocent. But the family of a Glasgow girl who was
murdered last year started campaigning for the abolition of the verdict
after the man accused of murdering her walked free after a 'not proven'
verdict was returned.
Mr Lang told the Scottish grand committee in the Commons that he would
review the verdict as part of a wider look at the functions of the jury in
criminal trials. The review will also look at jury size and the size of the
majority needed for acquittal.
Scottish juries consist of 15 jurors and are allowed to reach a verdict by a
simple majority immediately. In England and Wales, juries can reach a
majority verdict only after telling the judge that they cannot agree on a
unanimous verdict. The criminal justice system in England and Wales is being
examined by a Royal Commission. Scotland has a separate legal system and
judicial procedure.
Mr Lang said he would soon propose ways of reducing the waste of time for
witnesses who attend trials that do not take place or who give evidence that
is not contested.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Strengthen NHS buying power, says watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRUCTURAL changes to create stronger purchasing power in the National
Health Service's internal market are advocated by the Audit Commission
today.
Since the reforms took effect two years ago, most attention has been given
to the establishment of trust hospitals and other developments on the
provider side of the internal market's purchaser-provider split. The
government is trying to switch the emphasis to the purchaser side and stress
the importance of successful commissioning of services to give the
market-based reforms full effect.
The commission supports the concentration on purchasing. It says district
health authorities, freed from running hospitals, have a 'great opportunity
to alter the pattern of healthcare provision'.
District health authorities and general practitioners in fundholding
practices purchase hospital provision, while family health service
authorities are responsible for primary care services. Districts spend about
Pounds 25bn a year in England and Wales, and family authorities more than
Pounds 7bn.
District authorities and family authorities cannot combine under present
law. The commission says: 'Legislation is required to allow the formation of
single, comprehensive commissioning authorities.'
The reforms are forcing purchasing authorities to make more explicit
decisions about spending priorities, opening up a debate about the way in
which health service resources are rationed.
Authorities must, says the commission, be able to explain how spending
priorities are reached. 'Positive decisions about what to commission should
be openly set alongside any decisions about what is unaffordable.'
GP fundholders have independent purchasing power on behalf of their
patients. The commission says that, while they had made rapid innovative
progress and exercised considerable influence on hospitals, there was no
guarantee that their activities would be consistent with local district and
FHSA policies and it was 'not clear that they are being held sufficiently to
account'.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Power group promises telecoms price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL GRID Company gained a government licence yesterday to build a
public telecommunications network in competition with British
Telecommunications and Mercury, and promised to start a price war as early
as next spring.
Energis, National Grid's new telecoms subsidiary, intends to use its pylons
to install a fibre-optic telecoms network between Britain's leading towns.
It plans to have a network covering 17 of the 23 biggest towns and cities in
England and Wales operating by next April. It talked yesterday of prices
about 15 per cent lower than those of BT and Mercury.
Scottish Hydro-Electric also gained a licence yesterday. It too intends to
use its network to offer phone services, but is looking for a joint venture
partner to undertake the telecoms side of the business.
Businesses will be the main beneficiaries of the increased competition at
first, but Energis intends to market to residential customers from the
outset. Energis is budgeting to spend Pounds 100m on its fibre-optic network
in the next year. Although its pylon network does not extend to Scotland, it
is looking for arrangements with Scottish carriers - including
Hydro-Electric - to provide a network north of the border.
Energis is negotiating to connect with BT's local network to take calls the
last part of the way to businesses and private customers. It is also
starting connection talks with cable TV companies, 58 of which are building
local telephone networks in conurbations. This could enable it to bypass BT
in much of the country.
Mr Gordon Owen, Energis chairman, predicted that the company would soon be
'the third force' in UK telecoms. 'This is a significant milestone in our
plans to use the electricity industry to offer a full range of residential
and business services to UK communications customers.'
Four public network licences have been granted since the government decided
to open the UK's fixed-network market two years ago.
The others have gone to Ionica, which is building a national radio-based
network, and Colt, which this month gained permission to operate a fixed
network within the M25 area. Colt intends to start offering services in the
City later this year.
Together with the cable TV companies' local networks, the new operators look
set to end the BT and Mercury duopoly that has existed since 1984.
National Grid is jointly owned by the 12 regional electricity companies in
England and Wales. Hydro-Electric is an integrated supplier and distributor
of electricity in northern Scotland.
Four other electricity companies have also applied for telecommunications
licences: ScottishPower, East Midlands Electricity, Yorkshire Electricity
(through a joint venture with Kingston Communications, the Hull
telecommunications infrastructure operator) and Norweb. The applications are
still under consideration.
Cable television companies installed more than 15,000 new telephone lines in
April, bringing the total to more than 156,000. This is a rise of almost
50,000 since January.
At the same cable television subscribers rose by 3,943 during the month to
stand at 458,410 - an increase of 22,000 this year.
The Cable Television Association says the number of homes that are now close
to cable networks this year - and therefore available for subscription -
could reach nearly 1m.

The public expenditure watchdog says that the sales proceeds of Pounds 20m

NCM's bid was the lower of two bids received for the sale - the government

However, the audit office says that the successful bid more closely met the
other objectives of the sale, such as ensuring that the purchaser would
provide the maximum credit insurance support to the widest range of UK
exporters.
While most of the 760 staff transferred to NCM, the department was left with
more than 100 surplus staff not required by the new owner. At one stage, 80
of these were on paid leave, though almost all have now found jobs in other
public bodies or have retired early.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Three writs over BCCI slam Bankfor 'bad faith'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England is accused in three separate writs lodged in the High
Court of 'misfeasance in public office' throughout the 12 years it regulated
Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The writs are from the four UK liquidators at accountants Touche Ross, the
three Luxembourg liquidators to BCCI and from a group of depositors led by
Three Rivers District Council, Hertfordshire, in a set of co-ordinated
claims for damages and interest against the Bank of England.
A group of 72 MPs headed by Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East,
tabled a Commons motion welcoming the proceedings as 'long overdue'.
In a letter, Mr Vaz urged Mr John Major, the prime minister, to 'intervene
to ensure a just and speedy settlement' rather than fight the action, which
would waste taxpayers' and creditors' money.
The writs say the Bank of England 'knowingly, deliberately contrary to the
statutory scheme in accordance with the (1979 and 1987 Banking Acts) . . .
and in bad faith' granted BCCI a full licence in 1979, which it failed to
revoke at any time between October 1987 and July 1991.
It alleges that the Bank 'deliberately, repeatedly and unlawfully' relied on
assurances by LBC and IML, the Luxembourg bank regulators, and failed to
supervise BCCI SA and BCCI Overseas.
The Bank of England yesterday reiterated its belief that it had 'a complete
defence' and refused to comment on the detailed allegations.
It is believed never before to have been sued under banking law. The 1987
act specifically introduced immunity from action in connection with
regulation except as a result of 'bad faith'.
Experts yesterday said there was a case to answer because approval to
proceed had been granted by Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor - the
senior Chancery judge - and was supported by a legal opinion to the
liquidators from Sir Patrick Neill QC. The Bank was criticised for its role
as regulator in the US, in an inquiry chaired by Senator John Kerry, and in
the UK in a Commons Treasury committee report and the government-sponsored
inquiry chaired by Sir Thomas Bingham.
The liquidators were advised that they could not sue the Bank on behalf of
BCCI as a company but that action by individual depositors had 'a fair
prospect of success'. There were 150,000 account holders in BCCI SA who
could join the liquidators' action.
The legal action comes as the liquidators to BCCI prepare for a meeting of
creditors at Wembley in London tomorrow to elect a creditors' committee.

FT  26 MAY 93 / GDP rise confirms recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH IN the economy in the first quarter was stronger than originally
estimated, with consumer spending leading the way out of recession.
Official figures yesterday showed that gross domestic product grew 0.3 per
cent in the first three months of the year compared with the previous
quarter, slightly higher than a provisional estimate of 0.2 per cent, and
0.7 per cent higher than in the same quarter last year.
The news, which confirmed that the recession is officially over, was
underlined by a similar upwards revision to GDP excluding oil and gas
production, a more reliable guide to the underlying strength of the economy.
It rose by 0.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter compared with a provisional
estimate of 0.6 per cent. This was the strongest rate of growth since the
0.8 per cent rise registered in the first quarter of 1990, just months
before recession enveloped the economy.
Detailed figures of GDP by expenditure suggest that the recovery is being
led by consumer spending. It rose 0.5 per cent in the first quarter compared
with the previous quarter, to stand 2.1 per cent up on a year ago.
Total investment throughout the economy rose by 0.3 per cent
quarter-on-quarter and was 0.9 per cent higher than in the same period a
year ago.
Manufacturing output rose by 2 per cent in the quarter to stand 2.1 per cent
up on a year ago.
Output of the service industries rose by 0.6 per cent in the quarter. This
was pushed higher by the transport sector's strong performance, particularly
rail, road and air travel.
Buoyant retail sales boosted output of the distribution, hotels and catering
sector, which grew 0.8 per cent in the quarter - up 1.7 per cent on last
year.
There were no first-quarter figures for the construction industry, but
statisticians said the trend was still downwards.
Output from agriculture, forestry and fishing shrank by 2.3 per cent in the
first quarter. There were also falls in oil and gas output - down 6.1 per
cent on the quarter - and other energy and water production, which was down
2.3 per cent.
The figures also showed that income from employment rose by 1.5 per cent in
the first quarter. Compared with a year ago it was 1 per cent higher, but
this figure was distorted by the high level of bonuses paid in the first
quarter of last year ahead of the general election, as people feared that a
Labour government would raise taxes.
Companies' gross trading profits rose by 2.6 per cent year-on-year and were
11.8 per cent higher than a year ago.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Pounds 1m owed to Swan Hunter's suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipyard which recently went into receivership,
owes almost Pounds 1m to direct suppliers in North Tyneside alone, according
to research released yesterday.
A survey by North Tyneside council's economic development service of 40 of
the yard's 44 direct suppliers in the borough says the suppliers employ
1,542 people; businesses representing 70 per cent of these said they faced a
significant impact if Swan closes.
The research, the first attempt to quantify the knock-on effect of Swan's
possible demise, reveals that the yard owes Pounds 904,000 to 31 of the
companies; some of the other nine, which declined to disclose details, are
also believed to be owed substantial sums.
Most said it was too soon to quantify job losses if Swan closed. But one
business, a supplier to Swans since 1937, planned to cut 10 jobs now.
In total, the report says, Swan has 140 direct suppliers in Tyne and Wear
and many local companies supply it.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, was warned yesterday that there is
growing concern at Swan's uncertainty.
Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of Tyne and Wear Development Corporation,
told Mr Sainsbury in London that a rapid government response on whether work
could continue beyond Friday on outfitting three frigates was vital to
maintain cashflow.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Names, odd socks and loose suits . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MAXWELL bust, BCCI bust, Lloyd's bust; policyholders won't be paid' read a
makeshift banner outside London's Royal Albert Hall, held aloft by a number
of bedraggled protesters wearing scruffy T-shirts, shorts and, in one case,
odd socks.
'We are friends of a Lloyd's Name,' said one protester. 'We can't disclose
who we are. But Lloyd's has been sneaking around and the Names are bust.'
Inside the hall, where Mr Peter Middleton, the chief executive, and Mr David
Rowland, the chairman, addressed a three-and-a-half-hour meeting on the
future of the insurance market, many Names - the individuals whose assets
support Lloyd's - seemed to share the sentiments and were more forthcoming.
'I feel like a creditor at a liquidation meeting. This is a spiv
liquidation,' said one gloomy Name. 'It's a long time since I bought a new
suit. This one no longer fits. I've lost so much weight through worry. I
stand before you as a victim and a loser. There can be no plan for the
future unless an equitable plan is made for the present.'
Mr Richard Micklethwaite, another loss-making Name, described the Lloyd's
business plan, published last month, as 'a plan to deceive all the Names all
the time.'
He added: 'We have no reason to trust Lloyd's any more, but, my God, how
much pain it's taken to understand that.'
Speakers criticising Lloyd's were warmly applauded, especially those
targeting the market's cost base and the high salaries paid to underwriters.
'Lloyd's is in cloud cuckoo land. They have no idea at all about the big
wide world outside,' said one Name, who introduced himself simply as Mr
Lloyd. 'The real problem is one of cost. There is a certain arrogance among
working people at Lloyd's. At the moment all I see is 'eat, drink and be
merry before we go broke and the Names can pay for it'. I don't see the
entrepreneurial flair.'
Mr Roger Bradley, a Name and retired underwriter at Lloyd's, criticised the
sharp rise in costs at the end of the 1980s and attacked the amount of money
called by syndicates to build up reserves.
Mr Rowland himself was urged to 'do something' about the problems of the
loss-making Names by sacrificing part of his salary of more than Pounds
400,000 a year. 'You've got half a million, chuck it in,' said one angry
Name.
Waiting in the lobby before the meeting, Mr Tony Ravenscroft, a Name since
1979 and a member of the disastrous Pulbrook syndicate, admitted that he
regretted having joined Lloyd's. The business plan represented a 'brave and
serious effort to stem the tide', he added, and he said that he would
continue as a Name.
'If I don't, the whole thing will have been a waste of time and money.'
A former expatriate who lived and worked in Kenya, Mr Ravenscroft said that
he was recruited at a riverside picnic in Africa.
'It was full of crocodiles,' he said. 'But they were not half as dangerous
as the sharks at Lime Street.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / Top industrialists meet Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR EXECUTIVES from 18 large organisations yesterday met Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to discuss the economy and
long-term issues such as industrial competitiveness.
Mr Heseltine said the three-and-a-half-hour meeting had been 'very
constructive' and 'an interesting unscripted dialogue'. Mr David Sainsbury,
chairman of supermarket chain J. Sainsbury, said it had been 'useful and
productive'.
The meeting is expected to be the first in a series of gatherings as part of
Mr Heseltine's effort to produce a better framework for industrial growth.
The companies have agreed to send Mr Heseltine confidential sales data every
few months to help him monitor the expected economic recovery.
Imperial Chemical Industries, which had indicated it would not be part of
the 'round table', sent a representative in the shape of Mr Tony Rodgers, a
director of its Zeneca bioscience subsidiary due to be floated as a separate
company next month. Courtaulds Textiles sent Mr Colin Dyer, a director,
after earlier saying no one would be available.
Other people attending were: Food industry: Christopher Haskins, chairman,
Northern Foods; Ross Buckland, chairman, Unigate. Banking/mail: Lord
Alexander, chairman, National Westminster Bank; Chris Lendrum, deputy
managing director, Barclays Bank; John Platt, regional director, 3i; Michael
Heron, chairman, Post Office. Engineering: Tony Pedder, commercial director,
British Steel; Chris Kinsella, finance director, Meggitt; John Towers,
managing director, Rover; Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman, TI; Alistair
Fleming, director, Weir Group. Retailing: Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman,
Marks and Spencer. Electronics/telecoms: Max Kaye, finance director, Racal
Electronics; Keith Todd, finance director, International Computers; Mike
Harris, chief executive, Mercury Communications. Department of Trade and
Industry: Tim Sainsbury, industry minister; Walter Eltis, economic adviser
to Mr Heseltine; David Coates, DTI chief economic adviser. Treasury: Robin
Mountfield, head, industry division.
Grand Metropolitan and Shell Chemicals were invited but did not send anyone.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Secretive service exposed: How the arms-for-Iraq inquiry has
put pressure on Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST over three weeks after they began, the public hearings of Lord Justice
Scott's inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq issue are already straining Whitehall
nerves and threatening a renewed political storm over an issue the
government may have felt had been confined to history.
Lord Justice Scott was appointed to head the inquiry last November with a
proven track record as a member of the 'liberal wing' of the judiciary who
was quite able, as in the Spycatcher case, to assert his independence from
government pressure.
However, few people could have predicted the speed with which he and his
counsel Ms Presiley Baxendale QC have moved to penetrate the morass of
Whitehall secrecy surrounding the British Iraqgate.
Armed with thousands of documents from within and from outside government
departments, the Scott team has developed an impressive double act of
probing questioning and cross-examination which has at times reduced even
the most disciplined civil servant to a compliant witness.
Lord Justice Scott's determination to use his powers as 'inquisitor' to cut
through political convention and complicity was starkly exemplified during
Monday's oral hearing of Sir Hal Miller.
The former MP suggested it was not appropriate for him to repeat a
conversation he had had in the Commons tearoom with fellow old-Etonian Alan
Clark, the former defence minister. The judge insisted that Sir Hal should
repeat it in the public hearing as the conversation had to do with
government policy on Iraq.
In an earlier hearing, a former MoD official told the judge he could not
answer some of his questions because he did not have the relevant documents.
The official was promptly told to return another day after he had provided
the documents.
With the political storm clouds already gathering over Sir Hal's statements
and the planned appearance tomorrow of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Scott inquiry
has already had more of an impact than last year's parliamentary inquiry
into the Supergun affair and numerous questions in the Commons. Sir Hal's
evidence comes at an awkward time for the government, which is still
battling to restore its authority after this month's devastating election
results.
But if prime minister Mr John Major had to choose one cabinet minister to be
the first to appear before Lord Justice Scott, then the suave, debonair Sir
Patrick might be his man. A former barrister who has considerably enhanced
his reputation since moving to the Northern Ireland office a year ago, Sir
Patrick is unquestionably a safe pair of hands.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Miners co-op in Scotland needs Pounds 3m to beat crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONKTONHALL Mine-workers, the miners' co-operative which is leasing a mine
near Edinburgh from British Coal, needs a capital injection of Pounds 3m to
overcome its financial crisis and become viable.
A report by Quayle Munro, the Edinburgh merchant bank, says that Monktonhall
is unable to develop new coalfaces because of lack of finance - due to
initial underfunding and to subsequent operating losses.
The losses have exceeded the Pounds 1.6m of initial capital, all of which
came in Pounds 10,000 subscriptions from the 160 miners.
More coalfaces are needed 'as a matter of urgency' to make the whole
operation viable. Quayle Munro said the company had failed to break even
since production began in January, but was capable of earning 'potentially
attractive rates of return at increased volumes at current market prices'.
Monktonhall has contracts to supply ScottishPower and British Coal, but
needs to finalise contracts with other customers. It has one producing face
but has been unable to open a second because of financial difficulties.
The Quayle Munro study was financed by Lothian Regional Council after
Monktonhall got into financial difficulties and for several weeks stopped
paying its employees. The company is retaining the bank to try to raise the
Pounds 3m, which will cover the opening of two new faces.
Mr Bert Brown, Monktonhall's managing-director-designate, said he hoped the
money would be raised from a variety of sources, which might be both private
and public sector.
'We would like to keep as close to the present format of ownership as
possible, but everything is negotiable. We will have to see what price we
have to pay for the money.'
In March the consortium decided not to negotiate with Caledonian Mining, an
English mining company which said it would put in new capital if it was
given management control.
The High Court will rule today on whether British Coal can go ahead with the
closure of the first 10 coal mines in its pit closure programme, John Mason
writes.
The corporation last week asked for a declaration that its use of Boyds, the
US mining consultancy, amounted to independent scrutiny of the closure
process.
This scrutiny was demanded by the High Court last December when it ruled
that British Coal's original procedures were illegal.
The corporation's move is being opposed by the National Union of
Mineworkers.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Law firm rejects dismissal allegation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR partner of a law firm yesterday denied at an industrial tribunal
that there had been a conspiracy to dismiss a male manager who supported a
female colleague's claim of sexual harassment.
The former senior property services manager of Caesar and Howie, based at
Bathgate, near Edinburgh, was dismissed for assaulting another employee and
failing to pay proper attention to business, Mr Robert Shaw, senior partner,
told the Edinburgh tribunal.
Mr Stuart Smith, whose case is funded by the Equal Opportunities Commission,
alleges he was sacked after agreeing to act as a witness for a woman who
took the firm to a tribunal for sexual harassment.
The harassment allegations concerned a senior manager in the property
department and were alleged to have gone on for two or three years. That
case was settled out of court.
Another partner, Mr Kenneth Hogg, giving evidence at the tribunal, admitted
that 'from time to time the property department and people within it ran it
like a sergeants' mess'. On being questioned about what he meant, he said it
was 'all boys together'.
Mr Hogg told the tribunal that the young woman had been dismissed for theft.
The first allegations of sexual harassment came, he said, when the woman
concerned began her action against the firm.
The hearing continues.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Climbdown on railcards worries bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the companies considering bidding for passenger service franchises
said last night that some rail travellers could be left worse off by the
government's turnabout on the sensitive issue of railcards for the young and
old.
Badger Rail, a newly formed subsidiary of the Badgerline group of bus
companies, said that many companies might have wished to offer bigger
discounts to certain groups than those available under existing railcard
schemes, but would no longer have the freedom to do so.
But Mr Philip Snowden, Badger Rail's managing director, said would-be train
operators were unlikely to be deterred from taking part in the privatisation
process as a result of the government's turnabout on railcards.
He said: 'The idea that railcards were somehow under threat was always
ill-founded. Commercial operators would almost certainly have carried on
with the same sort of offers that these cards represent because it would
have been in their commercial interests to do so.'
Badger Rail is considering bids for several rail franchises including
InterCity's Great Western Main Line and Regional Railways' South Wales and
West Region.
Mr Snowden said that one advantage of preserving the national railcard
schemes was that his company would not have to enter long negotiations with
other franchisees about what sort of cards should be offered.
However, Mr Snowden said if the government insisted that the cards were
offered to passengers on terms that were uncommercial, the potential losses
to rail operators would be reflected in the size of their bids for the
franchises - so the cost would ultimately rebound on the government.
At present there are about 750,000 holders of senior citizen's railcards and
750,000 holders of young person's cards. Members of both groups pay Pounds
16 a year for their cards. In return, they are entitled to a 33 per cent
reduction in the cost of virtually all tickets except Apex and excursion
fares.
British Rail introduced both types of cards in the early 1970s as a
marketing tool rather than a concession, with the aim of filling seats that
would otherwise have remained empty. But the calculation is difficult: the
danger is always that the value of new business fails to outweigh the
discounts claimed by existing passengers.
One estimate is that the net effect of railcards is to boost British Rail
revenues by Pounds 20m a year. But the contributions of the different types
of card is very uneven: the young person's card contributes most, the senior
citizen's much less, and the family railcard very little. The disabled
person's card makes a loss, but British Rail regards that card as a social
obligation and picks up the bill.

SHELL, the oil company, will not be prosecuted over the deaths of 11 men in
a North Sea helicopter crash, the Crown Office has confirmed.
Pilot error was blamed for the tragedy in March last year when a Super Puma
helicopter plunged into the sea on a two-minute flight from Shell's
Cormorant Alpha platform. But, after a fatal accident inquiry in Aberdeen,
Sheriff Alexander Jessop found that Shell had contributed to the loss of
life.
The Crown Office confirmed that nobody would be prosecuted because 'it would

FT  26 MAY 93 / Large urges clampdown on investment fraud: Calls for a
regulatory system that can prevent a recurrence of events like the Robert
Maxwell pensions scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW LARGE'S report on financial services regulation does not recommend
a dramatic overhaul of the system put in place by the 1986 Financial
Services Act.
The chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the City of London's
senior regulator, summed up the nature of his proposals in the foreword:
'This report is about the next big chapter in the regulatory story. If
Chapter One has been about creation and setting the system up, Chapter Two
will be about making the system really work well in the future.'
Mr Large was asked to conduct his investigation in July last year by Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor. It was to be an examination of how the
regulatory system permitted the plundering of pension funds by Robert
Maxwell and of the more widespread concern that the regulatory system does
not adequately achieve its goals.
Mr Large defines four main goals of the system:
It should operate in the public interest.
Fraudsters should be caught and dealt with.
Sharp practice should be dealt with.
Cost-effective investor protection should be provided.
Mr Large's report dismissed suggestions that the two-tier system of SIB
overseeing a collection of self-regulatory organisations (SROs) should be
ended. Yet he is not surprised that problems have emerged with the
regulatory system, because it is highly complex and was created only seven
years ago: 'Some 20 regulatory bodies have been recognised and over 28,000
firms authorised to do business in which 300,000 people earn their
livelihood primarily from investment business. Rules have been written and
rewritten to give substance to the provisions of the (Financial Services)
Act.'
He highlights a number of particularly telling criticisms of the system:
The objectives of the act are unclear.
Self-regulation is often seen as equating with self-interest.
The system is not seen as particularly cost-effective.
There is too much fraud that goes unpunished.
The system is too complex.
Retail business is under-regulated whereas business carried out for
professional customers is over-regulated.
Investor compensation schemes exact excessive costs on more prudent firms.
SIB's role is unclear.
SIB's enforcement role should be more visible and comprehensible.
SIB's resources are inadequate and its structure is wrong.
SIB is not sufficiently accountable.
He accepts many of these criticisms and tries to learn from three recent
examples of regulatory failure, the most important of which was the
inability of the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro) to
stop Maxwell robbing his pensioners and the failure of SIB to spot Imro's
weaknesses.
Another regulatory lapse was SIB's inability to prevent personnel employed
by a recognised investment exchange, London FOX - which trades futures and
options in commodities - from engaging in improper conduct in collusion with
firms operating in a new property futures market.
Finally, Mr Large tries to learn from the failure of several regulatory
bodies to prevent the widespread sale of home income plans - products
allowing purchasers to convert equity tied up in their homes into income -
to customers for whom the product was not suitable.
His first recommendation is that SIB and the recognised bodies should
publish a clear statement of their objectives, the central one being the
protection of investors.
He also argues that SIB should play a more active role in setting the
standards of regulation it will expect the recognised bodies to fulfil.
It should establish criteria for authorising firms to carry out investment
business, for the content and frequency of information that regulators must
obtain from financial firms, for the speed of response of regulators to
complaints and for their disciplinary policy.
It should also set standards of investor protection, setting out a list of
hazards for investment customers which the regulatory system is intended to
stamp out - such as agents not seeking the best prices for clients, the
giving of unsuitable investment advice to clients, or the mingling of client
money with company money.
SIB should set these standards for recognised bodies and develop measures to
verify that they follow the regulation standards and enforce the investor
protection standards.
A radical proposal is that SIB should become far more active in monitoring
the performance of the recognised bodies, in regular meetings with them and
supervisory visits to them. It should also visit regulated firms to ensure
that their regulators are doing their job properly.
Mr Large also calls for SIB to take a much higher profile in enforcement -
it has never used its legal powers to bar individuals from the investment
industry.
SIB should also try to promote greater co-operation between the many
different regulators with potential interests in prosecuting for fraud, and
play a more active role in prosecuting those suspected of unauthorised
business.
Although Mr Large calls on SIB to develop investor protection standards and
the best framework for meeting them, he says the board should attempt to
give the recognised bodies more freedom to develop their own rules and other
ways, such as codes of conduct or training requirements, to achieve these
standards. It should also attempt to remove unnecessary, impractical or
excessively costly rules.
The report calls for a new focus on the cost of regulation, with SIB
generating information on the costs of the system and commissioning an
independent study of cost-benefit monitoring techniques that regulators
might use over the longer term. SIB should set up a 'cost of compliance
unit' to monitor regulators' overheads.
Mr Large says it is no longer appropriate for SIB to have a role in the
direct monitoring of financial firms - a number of substantial firms,
notably the clearing banks, are regulated by Sibro, part of SIB.
'SIB's objective must be that the SROs should be the front-line regulators,
not SIB. The direct regulation powers may have been a necessary part of the
original structure, but I believe that now direct regulation should be
available only as a truly last option.'
SIB needs to have some expertise in direct regulation, so that if it were to
withdraw recognition from a regulator, it could take over the business of
monitoring that regulator's firms. But it should not supervise financial
firms on an everyday basis.
Mr Large is keen for Sibro's members to join the proposed Personal
Investment Authority, which is being set up as a new umbrella regulator for
retail financial business. He also wants SIB to clarify boundaries between
recognised bodies, to eliminate the considerable overlap which currently
exists between them.
But before SIB and the recognised bodies can increase their authority and
win back the confidence of the public, Mr Large says they need to become far
more open - to publish their objectives, budgets, management plans, reports
and accounts, performance indicators and operational reviews.
There should be a review of information on fees charged by SIB and the
recognised bodies.
In recognition of SIB's responsibility to serve the public interest, the
majority of non-executives on its board should not be active in the
financial services industry. SIB should set up advisory groups representing
the interests of consumers and the financial services industry. SIB is also
urged to work with other regulators on the training of personnel for
regulatory bodies.
On implementation of the report, SIB is charged with creating an
implemention team and publishing progress reports twice a year.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Detection system for insider-dealing considered: Central
computer may be used to combat market manipulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Invest-ments Board is considering a new central
'facility' to gather reports of many different types of transactions in
individual securities and derivatives, some of which are not reported to
regulators at present.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said: 'If the insider-dealing and
market-manipulation legislation is going to work we have to have an
intelligence system, and it's got to look at all the ways people can take a
position.'
The organisation is also assessing what steps to take, if any, to deal with
the way exchanges are reacting to the challenges posed by 'non-exchanges'
such as Reuters' Instinet service and the new Tradepoint share-dealing
system.
The proposal for a new facility, still at the initial stages, is mentioned
in the Large report. 'This would significantly enhance the provision of
vital raw material for preparing cases . . . of market manipulation and
insider dealing,' the report says.
The facility, which might be a central computer database, would bring
together in the regulators' hands for the first time records of a large
variety of transactions. In particular, it would provide details of
transactions at present not reported to regulators, such as over-the-counter
futures and options contracts.
Creating a central computer system to link with many different market
systems would be a substantial undertaking. SIB is still at the very early
stages of considering the issue, however, and it is not clear if such a
complex system is in fact likely to emerge from its discussions.
The initiative has been urged by the London Stock Exchange. It also has the
support of the Securities and Futures Association, which wants such a system
to aid its monitoring of the capital adequacy of market participants, and to
help it detect whether they are taking on more risks than they can afford.
The British Merchant Bankers Association wrote to the Treasury on Monday
saying that transaction-reporting should be expanded to aid the discovery of
market manipulation, including in the gilt and corporate bond markets.
The challenge to traditional exchanges is under consideration as SIB
prepares a discussion paper on market regulation policy.
Mr Large made it clear that he viewed transparency as a serious issue.
'Post-trade transparency is important not just for the Stock Exchange, it is
also important for the derivatives markets,' he said. Futures and options
markets rely on obtaining accurate prices from cash markets.
He added: 'Someone's got to say what level of post-trade transparency is
acceptable.' That someone, he said, was the SIB.
At present large share deals are published only after a delay, because
marketmakers fear that they would be commercially vulnerable if their rivals
could learn promptly what they were buying and selling.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Introducers come under new Lautro rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) has
introduced new rules for introducers - those who bring together investors
and sales representatives - Philip Coggan writes.
Until now introducers have been governed by the same rules as sales
representatives even though they do not sell products or give advice.
The new rules state that introducers must make their status clear to
potential customers - that is, that they are acting on behalf of a
particular Lautro member and that they are not authorised to give advice.
Members of the regulatory organisation will be responsible for the actions
of their introducers and must keep records of their names and addresses.

FT  26 MAY 93 / City welcomes SIB proposals: SROs back plan for regulation
of financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW dawn of financial services regulation received a cautious welcome
from the self-regulatory organisations which will have to live with the
changes. They said tighter control of their own activities by the Securities
and Investments Board was inevitable.
Sir Gordon Downey, chairman of Fimbra, the SRO for independent financial
advisers, and chairman of the proposed Personal Investment Authority, said:
'It is true to say that the relationship between SIB and the self-regulatory
organisations has been a difficult one. Any move to define responsibilities
between them is a good one.'
The chairman of another SRO said: 'There is a lot in the report which is
inevitable and which is quite sensible.'
He added: 'I do not expect my board of directors to react violently to it.'
City officials said they were particularly pleased at the suggestion that
SIB could outline standards to be met while allowing the SROs to write the
rules intended to achieve that effect.
SIB chairman Mr Andrew Large, in his report on improving the efficacy of
financial regulation, concluded that the theft of more than Pounds 440m from
pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell demonstrated that SIB
had been too lax in how it monitored SROs' activities. Moreover, the
'arm's-length' relationship that the SROs had demanded with SIB had
undermined its effectiveness, he said.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said Mr Large had the government's full
backing to use his powers to get maximum co-operation from the SROs and that
the Treasury would be prepared to take additional action if that was not
sufficient to raise standards.
His remarks appeared to be an implicit threat to rewrite the Financial
Services Act in way less agreeable to those regulated by it.
Support for the report was not unqualified. Chairmen of the various SROs
expressed concern about SIB's plans to monitor their enforcement of their
members by paying supervisory visits. 'That is a recipe for disaster,' said
one chairman.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Venables awarded extra time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY VENABLES, the chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club,
yesterday survived another attempt by Mr Alan Sugar, the club's chairman, to
dismiss him when the High Court postponed for two weeks the hearing that
will decide his soccer future.
The two men took their boardroom battle to the courts amid emotional scenes
as more than 500 Spurs fans demonstrated outside the court, voicing support
for Mr Venables and hurling abuse at Mr Sugar.
Lawyers for the Tottenham chairman attempted to persuade Sir Donald
Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, to lift the injunction which temporarily
blocked Mr Sugar's move to sack Mr Venables and allowed the beleaguered
chief executive to return to his desk.
Mr Philip Heslop QC, for Mr Sugar and the club, cited affidavits from other
club directors which claimed that, following Mr Venables re-instatement,
directors and staff were in a position of unacceptable confusion.
Their request was turned down by Sir Donald who, postponing the hearing
until June 8, ruled that Mr Venables should have a fair opportunity to
respond to the voluminous allegations made against him by Mr Sugar.
Sir Donald went on: 'It is to be hoped that the parties nonetheless can
agree a practical way of working together in the best interests of the
company and of the football club for the interim period.'
Mr Sugar, Mr Venables and their solicitors were locked in a meeting
yesterday afternoon in an attempt to work out an acceptable regime.
A further hearing on an unspecified date will consider Mr Venables' attempt
to force Mr Sugar to sell his 46 per cent stake to himself or a nominated
party. The chief executive is invoking a Companies Act clause allowing a
minority shareholder to force the sale of majority holdings if their owners
are deemed by the courts to be acting against the interests of the company.
Mr Heslop yesterday repeated Mr Sugar's claims that the move to dismiss the
chief executive was motivated by lack of confidence in Mr Venables and his
insistence in supporting Mr Eddie Ashby, the undischarged bankrupt who,
until his dismissal last week, worked as Mr Venables' 'right-hand man'.
It was also disclosed that, after the attempt to sack him, Mr Venables
backed an abortive move by Mr Jonathan Crystal, his ally on the Tottenham
board, to have the club's shares suspended from the Stock Exchange - a
tactic opposed by the club's merchant bankers Henry Ansbachers and its
lawyers Herbert Smith.
Mr Heslop also alleged that Edennote, Mr Venables' private company, was
either insolvent or in an extremely parlous financial state. Mr Venables had
to borrow some Pounds 2m to finance his 23 per cent stake, some of which was
security against his debt.
After the hearing Mr Sugar, escorted by police to the supporters' cries of
'Judas', left the court by a side exit. He said only that he would comment
'when the time is right'.
Mr Venables waved at supporters as he left through the main exit from the
court. When asked if he was happy about the court's decision to adjourn the
hearing, he replied: 'Well I've gotta be, haven't I?'

FT  26 MAY 93 / 'Travelgate' five get return tickets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN WHAT appeared to be a humiliating climbdown, the White House last night
reversed the summary dismissal of five of the seven travel staff sacked last
week and ordered an internal investigation into the controversy now known as
'travelgate'.
The five were not restored to their jobs but placed on administrative leave
with full pay pending the investigation. If cleared they would be eligible
for federal employment. The travel office head, Mr Billy Dale, has retired
under the threat of dismissal and his deputy's sacking was confirmed.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, the chief spokesman, conceded that 'we didn't
handle this as well as we would have liked'. He added that Mr Thomas 'Mack'
McLarty, the chief of staff, accepted responsibility for any mistakes and
would personally conduct the internal investigation.
The controversy, reflecting badly on the competence of White House staff,
has made it all the harder for President Bill Clinton to persuade Congress
to pass his budget package, on which the House is due to vote tomorrow.
This incident, combined with the affair of Mr Clinton's Air Force One
haircut last week, has made the president and his staff the butt of
criticism and ridicule on the floor of Congress, in the media and by the
nation's comedians.
Mr Stephanopoulos also admitted the White House was wrong to release an FBI
statement last week implying a criminal investigation into the travel office
was justified on grounds of non-competitive practices and poor accounting.
Ms Janet Reno, attorney-general, has complained the White House approached
the FBI without her knowledge.

   GUATEMALA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUATEMALA'S President Jorge Serrano yesterday suspended the country's
constitution, dissolving congress and the supreme court in what he said was
an attempt to 'purify the state of all its corruption'.
US president Bill Clinton reacted by calling on Mr Serrano to reverse his
'illegitimate' actions. State department spokesman Richard Boucher
threatened to press for an emergency meeting of foreign ministers of the
Organisation of American States if the measures were not reversed.
Mr Serrano took the unexpected decision, which included the suspension of Mr
Edgar Tuna Valladores, the attorney general, after meeting the military high
command, which has shown growing dissatisfaction with recent civil unrest
over the government's unpopular economic measures.
Mr Tuna Valladores, together with heads of congress and the supreme court,
was placed under house arrest.
Mr Serrano said later that a new national assembly would be elected within
60 days to draw up a new constitution.
Students have been protesting over transport price rises and there has been
discontent over government attempts to raise electricity charges in keeping
with its IMF standby agreement. Yesterday, however, the capital's streets
were quiet with security forces surrounding most public buildings.
The human rights ombudsman, Mr Ramiro de Leon Carpio, an acerbic critic of
the government and the military, has gone underground, according to radio
reports.
Mr Serrano attacked the supreme court for failing to administer justice and
for allowing criminals to go free.
'For two and half years I've been subjected to political blackmail by some
members of congress,' he said on national radio.
Mr Serrano, a fundamentalist evangelical who won a landslide victory in
January 1991 to become only the third democratically elected civilian
president in Guatemalan history, this month lost a working alliance he
enjoyed in congress with the opposition parties.
His uncomfortable presidency has deteriorated recently. Talks with the
leftist National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity guerrillas broke down this
month with both sides accusing the other of a lack of political will to
negotiate.
Foreign observers drew parallels with the so-called self coup of President
Alberto Fujimori of Peru in April last year.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Drugs war hits home in Mexico: Bloody shooting of a cardinal
highlights growing problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE killing on Monday of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo of Guadalajara
appears to be the latest and, for many, the most shocking development in
Mexico's drugs war.
The Roman Catholic cardinal and six other people died in the airport carpark
of Guadalajara, Mexico's second city. Officials said they thought they died
in crossfire during a shoot-out involving suspected drugs traffickers. Two
men have been detained by the Mexican police.
Cardinal Posadas, who was 66, had been cardinal in Guadalajara for nearly
two years, and had previously served as bishop in the cities of Tijuana and
Cuernavaca. Masses in his honour were being held throughout the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country yesterday.
While drug-related violence is usually concentrated in a few towns in the
north of Mexico, where the cartels reside, the number of such killings has
been increasing and has exposed Mexico to criticism from US drug-enforcement
authorities, who point to official corruption that allows traffickers to
flourish. Between 50 and 70 per cent of US-bound cocaine is shipped through
Mexico.
In November last year, in perhaps the most notorious recent incident, at
least a dozen men with machine guns shot dead six drug traffickers in a
discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, a holiday resort on the Pacific coast, near
Guadalajara. In January this year a vicious clan war broke out in Culiacan,
Sinoloa, Mexico's drug capital, as more than 60 people were murdered in 20
days, including eight in a public shoot-out in the central square.
On April 11 the drug fight reached the holiday resort of Cancun, on the
Caribbean coast, when six armed menkilled Rafael Aguilar Guajardo, a drug
trafficker from the cartel of Ciudad Juarez, and an American tourist.
On May 1, in what was described as a government triumph, the chief of the
Guadalajara cartel, Emilio Quintero Payan, was gunned down by police outside
a shopping centre.
The drug problem could yet cause difficulties for Mexico in the run-up to
the vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Until now, most of the debate over Nafta has focused on US job losses and
Mexico's lax enforcement of environmental and labour laws. But this week the
New York Times gave extensive coverage to a report from a US intelligence
officer that warned Mexican drug-traffickers were planning to take advantage
of lax border controls.
Drug-traffickers were planning to purchase trucking and warehouse businesses
along the border, and had started buying in-bond plants as conduits for drug
shipments.
Under international and domestic pressure, President Carlos Salinas in
January this year replaced an ineffective attorney-general with Mr Jorge
Carpizo, former head of the National Human Rights Commission, and a man
known for his aversion to corruption.
Mr Carpizo soon announced that some 200 anti-drug agents (of a total of
about 2,000) were being investigated for links to the drug-traffickers, and
issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Guillermo Gonzalez Calderoni, former
head of the drug investigations in the attorney-general's office, for
'inexplicable enrichment'.
A judge has also been accused of conspiring with drug-traffickers by
refusing to issue warrants for arrest of 19 suspected cocaine smugglers.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Clinton battles to secure deficit cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday intensified his lobbying for the House of
Representatives to pass his deficit reduction package tomorrow, but was told
by some Democratic congressmen that he needed to make his case in a
nationally televised address.
Congressman Bill Richardson of New Mexico complained that 'we seem to have
lost the perception game'. He was referring to congressional critics who
contend the package relies too much on tax increases and not enough on
spending cuts to achieve its goal of reducing the budget deficit by about
Dollars 500bn (Pounds 324.6bn) over five years.
House members are particularly agitated that their vote tomorrow may be
negated later in the Senate, as happened with Mr Clinton's economic stimulus
programme.
The bill in front of the House includes the energy tax, the particular
object of Senate discontent. The Democratic leadership in the House remains
guardedly confident that it can carry the day. A total of 218 votes are
needed to pass, and the Democrats currently hold a 257-176 edge, with one
independent and one vacancy. Mr Clinton was to meet with freshmen members
later yesterday.
One indication of the administration's concern was the report it is
considering moves to bypass the Senate finance committee, due to vote next
week on the programme.
Alternative plans include having the budget committee write the bill or, in
extremis, having it written on the Senate floor itself. The Democrats only
hold an 11-9 majority on the finance committee which could disappear if Sen
David Boren of Oklahoma carries out his threat to oppose the bill unless the
energy tax is substantially amended.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Sharp decline in US consumer confidence

US CONSUMER confidence fell sharply this month to its lowest level since
October, adding to doubts about the momentum of the US economic recovery.
The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its
confidence index fell to 61.5, more than reversing a brief rebound in
consumer sentiment in the spring that had lifted the index to 67.6 per cent
last month.
The latest figures indicate that the surge in confidence that followed
President Bill Clinton's election victory last November has completely
evaporated. In a strong recovery, the index would be expected to climb above
100.
Separate figures yesterday showed a 2.7 per cent gain in sales of existing
homes between March and April, a modest rebound after bad weather hit sales
in the first quarter. Sales, however, were still running 0.9 per cent below
the level of April 1992.
In financial markets, analysts attribute the lack of confidence partly to
uncertainty about the fate of the Clinton economic plan, which is now under
attack from moderate congressional Democrats as well as Republicans.
Mr David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G Lanston, a New York brokerage,
said the tax rises proposed by the Clinton administration had undermined the
confidence of small and medium-sized businesses.
Leaks in Washington suggesting the White House was considering new payroll
taxes to pay for an expensive reform of healthcare were the 'last straw' for
many businessmen.
'Consumers are increasingly worried about job prospects,' said Mr Fabian
Linden, a spokesman for the Conference Board.
Only 13 per cent of people surveyed believed there would be more jobs in the
months ahead - the lowest reading in well over a year, he said. Fewer people
were expecting an improvement in business conditions over the next six
months than in April.
The weak figures highlight the dilemma facing the Federal Reserve. If the
recovery were stronger, the Fed might already be nudging interest rates
higher in response to signs of higher inflationary pressures in recent
months.
But with parts of the economy apparently still struggling, many analysts
expect the Fed to postpone a tightening of policy until clearer evidence of
sustained growth and higher inflation emerges.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Clinton hones effort to secure deficit package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday intensified his lobbying for the House of
Representatives to pass his deficit reduction package tomorrow, but was told
by some Democratic congressmen that he needed to make his case in a
nationally televised address.
Congressman Dan Glickman from Kansas emerged from a morning White House
meeting of Democrats with the president to declare that 'the American people
do not completely understand what's in the programme'.
Congressman Bill Richardson of New Mexico complained that 'we seem to have
lost the perception game'.
He was referring to congressional critics who contend the package relies too
much on tax increases and not enough on spending cuts to achieve its goal of
reducing the budget deficit by about Dollars 500bn (Pounds 324.6bn) over
five years.
House members are particularly agitated that their vote tomorrow may be
negated later in the Senate, as happened with Mr Clinton's economic stimulus
programme.
The bill in front of the House includes the energy tax, the particular
object of Senate discontent.
The Democratic leadership in the House remains guardedly confident that it
can carry the day.
A total of 218 votes are needed to pass, and the Democrats currently hold a
257-176 edge, with one independent and one vacancy. Mr Clinton was to meet
with freshmen members later yesterday.
One indication of the administration's concern was the report that it is
considering moves to bypass the Senate finance committee, which is due to
vote next week on the programme.
Alternative plans include having the budget committee write the bill or, in
extremis, having it written on the Senate floor itself.
The Democrats only hold an 11-9 majority on the finance committee which
could disappear if Senator David Boren of Oklahoma carries out his threat to
oppose the bill unless the energy tax is substantially amended.
The president's general cause was not helped by two public opinion polls
yesterday showing sharp declines both in his own popularity and in support
for his economic programme.
A CNN-USA Today poll had his approval rating down to 44 per cent and ABC
News to 46 per cent, the latter a 13 point drop in the last six weeks. The
first poll found support for the economic programme also down to 44 per cent
while 64 per cent of the ABC poll agreed it relied too much on increasing
taxes.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Asia energy needs double

<TEXT>
MR Daniel Ritchie, director of the World Bank's Asia technical department,
said yesterday that soaring economic growth rates in Asia meant that the
region's energy needs would double during the 1990s.
Speaking at a Financial Times Asian Electricity conference in Singapore, Mr
Ritchie said additional power capacity of between 125,000MW and 160,000MW
was needed in Asia by the year 2000 - costing a total of between Dollars
400bn and Dollars 500bn (Pounds 260bn and Pounds 326bn).
He said the private sector needed to become more involved in investing in
Asia's power sector as traditional ways of financing power projects -
through government funding or publicly guaranteed funds - were no longer
practical. So far only 10 power projects in the region have private sector
participation.
Representatives of several countries in the region outlined ambitious power
expansion plans. Mr Tajol Rosli Gazali, Malaysia's deputy energy minister,
said Malaysia now had an installed capacity of 4,890MW.
With an economy forecast to grow at an annual rate of 7 per cent over the
next 25 years, power demand would rise to 9,500MW by the year 2000 and more
than 29,000MW by 2015. Mr Tajol said that MDollars 100bn (Pounds 25bn) would
be needed over 30 years to implement such a power expansion programme.
Dr Pham Khanh Toan of Vietnam's Ministry of Energy said that the country's
energy consumption per capita was now one of the world's lowest.
He said a large-scale power expansion programme was urgently needed. Without
a growth in power output the Vietnamese economy could not expand. 'We
calculate that we will need between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 30bn in
investment in the power sector between now and the end of the century,' said
Dr Toan.
Speakers from Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines also outlined plans
to carry out large-scale expansion projects in the near future.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Egyptian government's continuing battle against Islamic extremists has
led to a 'dramatic increase in human rights abuse,' according to a report by
Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group. It says Egyptian
security forces 'appear to have been given a licence to kill with impunity'.
The report follows Egypt's increasingly tough response to extremist attacks
against police and tourist targets, which Amnesty says has involved mass
arrests, torture, unfair political trials and death sentences.
Amnesty cites allegations of police killing Islamic suspects who were not
offering resistance, of torture in police stations and deaths in custody.
The Egyptian government has in the past year rounded up thousands of
suspected members of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the extremist Islamic group
behind a persistent campaign of attacks on police, government figures and
tourist targets which has led to an economically crippling wave of tourist
cancellations.
Amnesty puts the number of those detained under emergency provision, a
figure not released by the government, at 2,000 or more.
It says more than 160 people have died in the past year's political
violence.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Iranians raid guerrilla bases in Iraq: Aircraft retaliate
for sabotage against oil pipelines as election nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PARICHEHRE MOSTESHAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRANIAN aircraft yesterday raided guerrilla bases in Iraq in retaliation for
a series of attacks which have left an already war battered oil network in
even greater disarray.
Mr Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the Majlis (parliament) speaker, confirmed early
morning raids against bases of the Mujahideen Khalq north-east of Baghdad.
He said the raids, the first since April 1992, were launched in response to
recent acts of sabotage by the mujahideen ahead of presidential elections
set for June 11.
Tehran said last week that infiltrators from Iraq had blown up oil pipelines
in oil-producing Khuzestan province in south-west Iran and clashed with
government forces elsewhere.
The mujahideen claim to have killed scores of government soldiers in a
series of ambushes in the past month.
The organisation runs several camps in Iraq, and sided with the Iraqis
during the eight-year war with Iran.
Ordinary Iranians were yesterday unaware that their government had once
again taken arms against what remains the only thorn in the side of the
Rafsanjani government. However, popular support for the mujahideen is
minimal and yesterday's events are likely to have more significance in
Washington than in Tehran.
The mujahideen were instrumental in bringing about the Islamic republic, but
their 'Marxist' leanings later proved unpalatable to the mullahs.
The leadership fled to Iraq, where its backing of the enemy in the Iran-Iraq
war lost it what popular support it might have had.
A government spokesman in Tehran yesterday played down the significance of
the attacks. The mujahideen 'want to stir things up as people pay Iran
attention coming up to the elections, to make themselves look as an
alternative. These events are to attract the attention and financial backing
of Clinton,' he said.
'It is very unimportant and ordinary. In the affairs of this country it is
not very important, in the same way as the British government is not in
danger when the IRA plant bombs in London.'
In August last year a series of bomb attacks in Tehran and several other
Iranian cities were laid at the door of 'Iraqi agents'. The mujahideen
claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the Iranians arrested 'an Iraqi'
who 'confessed' that he was an agent of Saddam Hussein.
Following last year's attacks on mujahideen bases in Iraq, the organisation
claimed responsibility for a number of riots in the Iranian cities of
Shiraz, Arak and Mahshad. President Rafsanjani dismissed the events as 'mere
gatherings'.
It is more probable that the riots were the work of the so-called
fundamentalists who had just lost political power in the Majlis elections
last May.

FT  26 MAY 93 / EC seeks observers at trial of Tibetans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is likely to press China to allow it to have
observers present at the trial of Tibetan dissidents arrested around the
time of last week's visit by European diplomats to Tibet, European officials
said yesterday.
European pressure, and violence in Lhasa on Monday and yesterday, are
embarrassments which Beijing did not want while Washington debates the
conditions which it will attach early in June to China's most-favoured
nation trading status.
Police yesterday used tear gas for a second day running to disperse a group
of 100 to 200 Tibetans who gathered outside Jokhang Temple, a shrine in the
Tibetan capital. Many shops were closed and police patrols were heavy in
Lhasa .
Envoys from the 12 EC countries, now back in Beijing, are working on a
report about their week-long visit to observe the human rights situation,
during which they learned of the arrests of three named individuals. The
Danish ambassador, representing the EC presidency, sought to have observers
at their trial, and also requested access to them. He was refused.
According to European officials, the authorities at first said they had no
knowledge of the arrests, but later confirmed them.
Western countries believe independence of Tibet from China is unrealistic
but want Beijing to discuss the territory's future with Tibetans including
the Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader.
Reuters newsagency quoted a police spokesman describing Monday's
demonstration of about 2,000 people as 'counter-revolutionary activity'.
'It began as a protest in the name of lowering prices for grain and oil, but
it changed its nature into a counter-revolutionary activity,' the police
officer said. 'The demonstrators plotted to attack government offices and
police stations and to beat policemen.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / Taiwan's Dollars 300bn 'publicity stunt' is cut down to
size: A look at the island's infrastructure development plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S six-year development plan announced two years ago was filled with
sound and fury, with its USDollars 300bn (Pounds 194.8bn) spending spree to
drag the island's infrastructure into the 21st century; it is becoming
rapidly apparent that it signifies less.
The government is discussing a substantial cut in the TDollars 786bn (Pounds
19.8bn) budget for the plan next year in the face of a borrowing squeeze. It
will also soon announce the results of a review of the plan, which will
postpone work on a number of grandiose projects.
This looks set to turn the plan back into a collection of projects that were
already under way in 1991, before Mr Hau Pei-tsun, then prime minister,
announced 771 separate project proposals to be undertaken during President
Lee Teng-hui's six-year term.
It seems now it was little more than a publicity stunt, but a successful
one. It has raised Taiwan's international profile through the offering of
politically leveraged deals to recession-hit western nations, and it has
helped Taiwan weather a property, stock market and investment slump.
The 1991 plan was for a TDollars 8,200bn investment programme that would
channel Taiwan's notoriously speculative capital flows into infrastructural
projects.
At the time, the government said: 'Let us work hand in hand for the
happiness of all our citizens and let us exert ourselves for the future of
our nation.' Two years later Taiwan's citizens are viewing the plan with a
less than happy cynicism.
The Northern Section highway was budgeted to cost TDollars 58bn, but
difficulties in land acquisition have led to a final cost of TDollars 178bn.
The government had to negotiate with 10,000 landowners.
Taipei's much-needed TDollars 444bn Mass Rapid Transit system has also been
mired by corruption investigations over contracts and by a recent incident
in which a train carriage burst into flames during a test run.
In the end, the biggest problem is of a more fundamental nature - money. Mr
Tsai Hsung-hsiung, vice-chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, which co-ordinates the project, said: 'From a macro point of
view the resources are there. The problem is channelling these resources
into the projects.'
The government, in spite of its legendary Dollars 82bn (Pounds 53bn) foreign
reserves, is having difficulty finding its portion of the finance. 'We
expected a current account surplus of about TDollars 200bn in 1991. The
actual figure was around a quarter of what we expected,' said Mr Tsai.
The government has expanded its bond issuing programme. Outstanding bonds
will account for about 21 per cent of gross national product by the end of
the year to June 1994, up from 5 per cent in 1991. However, bond issues have
a ceiling in relation to government expenditure, and this has virtually been
reached. The government is also facing opposition from MPs who have to
approve financing for the scheme. As one merchant banker said: 'It has been
slowed down by the fact that it has happened at the same time as the economy
is being democratised.'
Mr James Wen, vice-president of China Securities, said: 'They were too
aggressive in the beginning. They are now being more practical and focusing
on what they can actually accomplish.' He predicts that 40 per cent of the
projects will be put off, leaving the TDollars 4,940bn-worth of projects
that were already on stream when the plan was announced.
This would result in the postponement of a TDollars 426bn high-speed
railway, a TDollars 170bn nuclear power station, five mass transit systems
for provincial cities, and some of the 12 improbable east-west highways that
had been proposed.
However, the remaining projects in the spending programme - a quarter of
which are leftovers from the '14 key projects' plan of the mid-1980s  -
still tower above other Asian infrastructural programmes.
Taiwan, whose financial muscle has historically been in inverse proportion
to its international standing, has not been shy in tempting recession-ridden
western governments with construction opportunities.
'Every major project has had a political price tag,' said one foreign
businessman, and this has been reflected in an increase in the stature of
diplomatic visitors to Taipei since the plan was launched.
It is deemed to be no coincidence that France's sale of Mirage jets to
Taiwan followed Matra's winning of the construction contract for one line of
Taipei's MRT system and at a time when GEC-Alsthom's TGV train was highly
favoured to win the contract for Taiwan's now-postponed high-speed rail
system.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Department store sales fall in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE department store sales fell 6.5 per cent last month, in an
indication of the continuing weakness in consumer spending that is dragging
down the country's economy.
Car makers, who hoped their market had turned the corner in March, when new
registrations rose 3.4 per cent, reported yesterday that passenger vehicle
output was down 9.9 per cent last month and sales were 9.5 per cent lower
than a year earlier.
Officials at the Economic Planning Agency are concerned that consumers'
reluctance to spend could slow economic recovery, in spite of two emergency
economic packages, which were aimed at stimulating the public sector rather
than private consumption.
The EPA is also worried because sluggish domestic demand has led to a
slowing of imports and a rapid expansion of the trade surplus over the past
year, intensifying the friction between Japan and the US. Export industries
also have an incentive to increase overseas sales to make use of excess
capacity on domestic production lines.
Consumer spending has fallen in tandem with overtime hours and coincides
with a growing sense of job insecurity created by companies' promises to
reduce staff and cut costs in the quest for improved profitability. Many
Japanese companies have just released their annual results, showing a third
year of falling profits and the likelihood of another fall this year.
The Japan Department Stores' Association said sales in April were lower in
all areas, including a 13.1 per cent drop in household goods and 6.6 per
cent in clothing. In larger Japanese cities, sales slipped 7.9 per cent,
while in other areas, they were down 4.4 per cent.
Demand for commercial vehicles is particularly weak, with truck output
falling 13.2 per cent last month, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association said. Most Japanese companies are cutting capital spending, and
postponing or cancelling new vehicle purchases.
In the first four months of this year, passenger car production slipped 4.8
per cent, following a 3.8 per cent decline last year and a 2 per cent fall
in 1991, putting extreme pressure on most of the country's car makers.
Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry said Japan's net foreign assets rose 34 per
cent last year to Dollars 513.62bn (Pounds 333.5bn), mostly because of a
surge in the current account surplus. The ministry said private debt fell by
15 per cent, which reflected the willingness of Japanese financial
institutions to withdraw from foreign projects to bolster their domestic
operations.
Private direct investment rose 7 per cent last year to Dollars 248bn and
investment in securities rose 3.6 per cent to Dollars 655bn, though both
areas would have registered falls if the yen had not appreciated. Direct
investment in Japan was 26 per cent higher at Dollars 15.5bn, while
non-residents' investment in Japanese securities expanded 2.8 per cent to
Dollars 431.4bn.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Pyongyang calls for talks over nuclear treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIPLOMATIC activity aimed at preventing a showdown over North Korea's
suspected development of nuclear weapons has accelerated with Pyongyang
yesterday proposing talks with South Korea, while the US agreed to hold
discussions on the issue with North Korea next week.
The flurry of negotiations comes shortly before the June 12 deadline when
North Korea is scheduled to withdraw formally from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty (NPT), which would halt inspections of its nuclear
facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The US and South Korea hope to persuade North Korea to remain a signatory of
the treaty.
The US-North Korean talks, which are scheduled for June 2 in New York, are
considered crucial in solving the crisis.
The high-level discussions will involve Mr Robert Gallucci, the US assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs, and Mr Kang Sok Chu, the
first vice foreign minister of North Korea. North Korea is believed to be
seeking improved ties with the US in exchange for returning to the NPT,
according to officials in Seoul.
North Korea cited an alleged threat from the US in justifying its withdrawal
from the treaty, including the holding of US military exercises in South
Korea.
It also claimed that special inspections demanded by the IAEA of two nuclear
facilities would provide important military information to the US.
Some analysts believe that North Korea decided to withdraw from the NPT in a
desperate attempt to gain US diplomatic recognition, which Pyongyang would
regard as a guarantee of its independence.
South Korea said it had no objections to the establishment of diplomatic
relations between Washington and Pyongyang.
North Korea also offered yesterday to resume talks with South Korea on May
31 in what was considered a conciliatory gesture.
The proposal was in response to a similar suggestion made by Seoul last
week.

THE HEAD of the United Nations mission said yesterday Cambodia's election
had been 'free and fair' and people had been able to vote for the candidates
they wanted in spite of intimidation by authorities, AP reports from Siem
Reap.
No significant incidents were reported on the third day of the UN-organised
six-day balloting, Cambodia's first multiparty election since 1972.
'This election has not been held in an ideal situation but, nevertheless, it
has met the yardstick for a realistic standard for free and fair elections,'
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN peacekeeping chief, told reporters during a tour
of polling stations in north-western Cambodia.
More than 85 per cent of Cambodia's 4.76m registered voters have already
cast their ballots, Mr Eric Falt, a UN spokesman, said.
Mr Akashi said he could not understand why the Khmer Rouge had not done more
to disrupt the poll. 'Their minds are unfathomable,' he said. In a surprise
move, some Khmer Rouge leaders let guerrillas and villagers vote on Monday
in the areas they control in spite of earlier threats to disrupt balloting.

MR Peter Sutherland, former EC competition commissioner and now chairman of
Allied Irish Banks, is expected to be named the next director-general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade when Gatt members meet in special
session on June 9.
The 47-year-old Irishman will take over from Mr Arthur Dunkel, a Swiss who
has held the post since 1980. Mr Dunkel retires at the end of June.
Mr Sutherland, nominated by the Dublin government with EC support, was the
clear favourite for the job once, after initial hesitation, he allowed his
name to go forward.
Once the US and other European nations made clear their support for Mr
Sutherland, the two Latin American candidates, Mr Julio Lacarte-Muro of
Uruguay and Mr Luis Fernando Jaramillo of Colombia, had no chance of
securing the necessary consensus of Gatt's 111 members.
Mr Balkrishan Zutshi, chairman of Gatt's contracting parties (members),
expects to complete his consultations on Mr Sutherland's appointment,
including terms and conditions, by the end of this month.
Mr Sutherland's most pressing tasks will be to complete the long-delayed
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks by the end of this year, when US
negotiating authority runs out, and to give the world trade body new
dynamism.
The June 9 contracting party session is also expected to decide to create a
third post of deputy director-general, probably with responsibility for
Gatt's economic analysis.
Mr Warren Lavorel, formerly chief US negotiator in the Uruguay Round, is in
the running for one post, traditionally held by an American, which will
become vacant when Mr Charles Carlisle steps down this summer. The second
post has traditionally been held by an Indian and the third may go to a
Latin American.
This 'package' has disappointed Japan with no national of senior rank in
Gatt. Tokyo has been lukewarm on Mr Sutherland's candidacy, though it is not
expected to block a consensus.

FT  26 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US poised to impose China conditions

THE CLINTON Administration is close to announcing a decision which would
impose conditions on China if it is to maintain its Most Favoured Nation
trading status after next year.
As expected, administration officials are recommending that President Bill
Clinton renew China's MFN this year.
Congressional and administration officials said yesterday the conditions
were being discussed with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill, who have been
pressing to remove China's MFN ever since the bloody demonstrations at
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Proposals, approved on Monday by administration officials, will go to Mr
Clinton unless key members of Congress raise strong objections.
The Chinese case was not helped by this week's unrest in Tibet, where police
used teargas to try to subdue demonstrators. It is the worst outbreak of
separatist violence in Tibet since 1989, and it comes just a few weeks after
Mr Clinton met the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader.
It is understood the administration is prepared to demand that China
safeguard human rights in Tibet as one of the conditions of MFN renewal next
year.
Also under discussion yesterday as stipulations for MFN renewal in 1994 were
that China account for the number of political prisoners it holds, provide
access by Red Cross officials to Chinese prisons, and allow inspection of
prisons suspected of producing products for export. China would have to live
up to previous commitments on nuclear non-proliferation and market access
for foreign goods.
During his campaign Mr Clinton promised to get tough with China on its human
rights record. However, once in office he came under pressure from the
business and farm lobby whose dealings with China grow each year.
What is emerging is a two-track policy which is more stick and less carrot
than applied by former President George Bush. US trade officials will,
however, continue to work with China to get it admitted to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In Gatt, most nations automatically grant each other MFN status. China,
however, is a non-market economy. The US grant of MFN within the Gatt will
be bilateral and conditional, in line with US law.
Congressional Democrats are expected to abandon their attempt to condition
MFN by law. Instead, the conditions will be granted under executive order,
which makes them easier to revoke.
The Jackson-Vanik amendment to US trade law requires withdrawal of MFN to
non-market economies which do not allow free immigration. Immigration is not
an issue with China, but because it is predominantly a non-market economy
its MFN status gets reviewed every year.

NEGOTIATIONS on China's bid to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade resumed this week, but Gatt members appear to be in little hurry to
admit China to the 111-nation body.
Nearly seven years after China asked for Gatt membership, trading partners
have not even agreed what should go into the country's draft protocol of
accession. Much of this week's meeting remains concerned with clarification
of its trade policy.
Recent talks have been slowed by the tense trade relations between China and
the US, including conditions for renewal of its Most Favoured Nation status.
However, many Gatt members share US concern that, without special
safeguards, they could be swamped by a flood of cheap Chinese exports.
China opposes special safeguards and wants entry terms to reflect its status
as a developing country. However, recent international comparisons show
China as the world's third biggest economy with a per capita income of
Dollars 1,450 (Pounds 945), four times previous estimates.

FT  26 MAY 93 / World Trade News: High hopes for Aden seaport's return to
glory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ADEN, formerly one of the world's busiest seaports, saw a sharp decline in
its fortunes in the two decades following the takeover in 1967 of a Marxist
government in South Yemen. That situation may soon be reversed with new
legislation and detailed plans for the creation of a free trade zone in
Aden.
'Location (on the south-western tip of the Arabian peninsula) is without a
doubt Aden's strongest asset and will enable it to compete with other zones
in the area,' says Mr Gerald Tunnel, of the US Raytheon Corporation and
project manager for the recently completed masterplan for the proposed free
trade zone.
Mr Tunnel concedes that Aden at the moment lacks the facilities to compete
with nearby Jebel Ali in the Gulf. But he insists Aden has 'reasonably good'
facilities and that its location represents better value for shippers in
terms of time and money.
'Shippers can save two and a half days' shipping time by sailing to Aden
instead of to Jebel Ali,' he says.
'In financial terms that represents Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 65,000) per
journey and about Dollars 1.5m a year.'
Raytheon's masterplan proposes a four-phase programme of development over a
25-year period and calling for total investment of Dollars 5.8bn to develop
the port's infrastructure.
As an inducement to investors, the Yemeni government in April passed
legislation offering a variety of incentives, including exemptions from
import and export duties, from taxes on industrial and commercial profits,
and from income tax for 15 years.
Plans at the moment propose activities including industry, light
manufacturing, assembly, and tourism. But the focus will be on developing
Aden's potential as a trans-shipment centre for world trade.
Toward that end the masterplan calls on Yemeni administrators to introduce
competitive methods to their respective sectors as quickly as possible by
privatising all facilities and services connected with the free zone,
especially Aden's airport and harbour facilities.
Promoters of the free zone admit to difficulties. Aden has long had an
unfavourable reputation for union militancy and low discharge rates.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA needs to dismantle trade barriers further if it is to reach its
goal of closer political co-operation with the EC, according to a European
Commission document released yesterday.
The Commission pays tribute to Seoul's efforts to open its market, but sets
out a lengthy 'wish-list' covering products and non-tariff barriers
currently under negotiation.
Patents and intellectual property rights. The Commission wants a 1991 accord
updated to include pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals. Progress on
eliminating counterfeiting and trade piracy is 'encouraging.'
Consumer products. Despite steep reductions in customs duties, outstanding
tariffs remain on imported alcohol. The EC is worried about Seoul's
restrictions on EC-sourced cars.
Telecommunications. The Commission wants new Korean laws reviewed to make
sure they do not discriminate against EC telecoms suppliers.
Financial services. The EC wants its banks to be allowed to open affiliates
and an open market for non-life assurance.
Foreign investment. Korean rules are too complex, and too restrictive.
Foreign companies in Korea also face restrictions on bringing in capital
from abroad.
The Commission report notes that bilateral trade has quadrupled between 1982
and 1991 to almost Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.7bn). Korea enjoyed a slight trade
surplus of Ecu800m (Pounds 622.4m), but EC exports dropped 12 per cent in
1992 because of the slowdown in South Korea.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Venture capital investments grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European venture capital industry recorded increases in investments and
new funds raised in 1992 despite the deepening recession in much of Europe.
Investments rose by 1.5 per cent to Ecu4.7bn (Pounds 3.7bn) while the level
of new fund-raising increased by 0.6 per cent to Ecu4.2bn, according to a
survey by the European Venture Capital Association (Evca) and accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick. In 1991 new investments rose by 12 per cent but the
amount of funds raised fell by 9 per cent.
Mr John Singer, Evca president-elect, said the outcome was 'encouraging'
during a recession when many small and medium-sized businesses had great
difficulties raising finance.
Venture capitalists made a total of 6,197 investments last year, a decline
of 10 per cent in 1991, although the average size of each investment rose
from Ecu670,000 to Ecu760,000.
The most popular form of investment was in expanding, established companies.
They accounted for 46 per cent of spending last year, compared with 53 per
cent in 1991, while management buy-outs accounted for 40 per cent, compared
with 35 per cent the previous year.
Early-stage investments remained out of favour because of the risks
involved, the relatively high cost of doing deals, and the timespan. The
most popular industry sector was consumer products, representing 19 per cent
of all spending.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Spanish Elections: Enemy of the people-in-power - A Spanish
editor becomes bad news for the government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN most responsible for forcing Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain
to call a snap general election on June 6, and for the fact that he may lose
it, is a journalist, not a politician.
Mr Pedro J. Ramirez, an obsessed, nimble-brained self-publicist, has been a
thorn in the side of the Socialist government for years. He sees Mr Gonzalez
as a silver-tongued constrictor who has wound himself around the great
institutions of state and crushed the beginnings of democracy.
'It is irrelevant to me who wins the election as long as it is not
Gonzalez,' he says. 'Victory again would make Felipe a dictator.' Mr
Ramirez, 41, is the darling of intellectuals who once supported Mr Gonzalez
but who have not been able to stomach the grubbiness of government.
Democracy should have been full of earnest, incisive debate, close elections
and new ideas.
It has been none of those things, but Mr Ramirez tirelessly chases his dream
of clean politics, and just before the last election, in October 1989, he
crafted the weapon he needed. Sacked as editor of the Madrid daily, Diario
16, in March 1989 - for insulting the Socialists - he decided to become his
own boss, and in seven months created, staffed and financed his own
newspaper, El Mundo.
Practically every stone in the mountain of political scandal that has
brought Mr Gonzalez so close to defeat has been put there by El Mundo.
Opposition parties regularly use its editorials as the starting point for
parliamentary initiatives and, in the process, El Mundo has become the third
biggest national daily newspaper in the country, after the pro-government El
Pais and the right-wing ABC. It claims to sell nearly 250,000 copies a day.
Rivals contest this, but last year El Mundo, now with a big Italian
shareholder, made its first operating profit.
El Mundo's growth, especially among young urban readers, has frightened
established titles.
Mr Gonzalez and Mr Ramirez were once on good terms, but the editor says Mr
Gonzalez failed to keep his promise to open up Spain. Soon after coming to
power in 1982 the Socialists began co-opting people and institutions, he
says.
Spain's constitution encourages this. Socialist parliamentary majorities
have given them the majority of votes in the selection of supreme court
judges and control of the boards of the public television and radio
services.
They have changed the way the law works. Once, unpopular new legislation
could be challenged and stopped in its tracks until the slow-moving
constitutional court ruled. Now, new laws can be be applied until the court
says otherwise, thus blunting one of democracy's important checks and
balances. To quieten the press the Socialists also want to criminalise
defamation.
But it was the discovery of GAL, a group attacking sympathisers of the
Basque terrorist group Eta in exile in France, that finally made him and the
prime minister deadly enemies. At Diario 16 and El Mundo, Mr Ramirez pursued
what he assumed was a state-financed dirty war, supported by a crusading
judge, Baltasar Garzon. Now Mr Garzon has become a Socialist candidate and
Mr Ramirez cannot contain his dismay: 'Its like Robin Hood taking a job with
the Sheriff of Nottingham.'
Mr Ramirez' obsession has produced some outstanding journalism, documenting,
among other things the GAL investigations, the Filesa scandal in which the
Socialists appear to have raised funds illicitly from business, and the
Guerra affair, where the ex-deputy prime minister's brother ran a business
empire from a free government office.
Mr Ramirez is happy to admit he is helping the conservative Partido Popular
in this election but insists this is only because they are the only
opposition capable of winning. He is generous to the Communists, too,
because they weaken the Socialists on the left.

MR Ciriaco De Mita, a former prime minister and ex-leader of the Christian
Democrat party, was yesterday advised he was under investigation for alleged
extortion in connection with the huge state funds available in the wake of
the 1980 Irpinia earthquake, near Naples.
Naples magistrates said that they also wanted to question Mr Elveno
Pastorelli, head of civil protection at the Interior Ministry, who was
temporarily in charge of distributing the earthquake reconstruction funds.
At the same time, arrest warrants were issued for 15 local government
officials and bank employees alleged to be involved in various frauds and
over-invoicing scams to the tune of nearly L30bn (Pounds 13.2m). In a
separate investigation, also connected with the earthquake reconstruction,
an arrest warrant was issued for Mr Corrado Ferliano, the colourful
construction magnate who runs Naples football club, on corruption charges.
Mr De Mita and Mr Pastorelli are alleged to have threatened owners of three
companies with losing their disaster relief funds if they did not take on
employees recommended by them. Mr De Mita's two brothers have already been
arrested and charged with separate offences relating to the abuse of the
funds.
The leadership of Italy's Socialist party, moving quickly to find a third
leader in three months, yesterday endorsed the candidacy of a top union
leader, Reuter reports from Rome. Mr Ottavio Del Turco, leader of CGIL,
Italy's largest union grouping, is expected to be elected at a scheduled
congress on Friday.
The party is seeking to regroup quickly after the resignation as leader last
week of Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, who complained that his efforts for reform
were blocked by an entrenched old guard.
Mr Benvenuto had been elected in February to replace former prime minister
Bettino Craxi, who was forced to resign by a corruption scandal after nearly
17 years as party secretary.

THE BANK of Spain cut its official intervention rate from 11.5 per cent to
11.25 per cent yesterday, bringing relief to the Spanish economy, but little
joy to Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who late on Monday night took a
hammering in a televised election debate with his inexperienced conservative
challenger, Mr Jose Maria Aznar.
The debate, watched by up to 11m people, was the first ever in Spain and is
likely to have seriously damaged Mr Gonzalez's chances of holding office
after the elections on June 6. Mr Gonzalez's socialists and Mr Aznar's
Partido Popular (People's party) are neck-and-neck in the polls.
Mr Aznar scored point after point against his seemingly poorly prepared
opponent, and most commentators yesterday credited him with having 'won' the
debate, although one extensive listener poll for a nationwide breakfast
radio show declared for Mr Gonzalez.
While that may mean that voters outside the big cities viewed the debate
differently from the country's intellectuals, Mr Aznar, almost without
interference, was able to attack Mr Gonzalez's two open wounds: the economic
recession - with 3.3m people unemployed and three peseta devaluations in
nine months - and corruption allegations against the ruling party.
Mr Gonzalez tried to counter by insisting that life in Spain had improved
immeasurably since the socialists came to power in 1982, but he made little
impact. Mr Aznar focused attention on the government's poor economic record
in its third term of office and sidestepped all of the prime minister's
attempts to make him detail his economic policies. The prime minister has
never before looked so vulnerable in public.
The two men will meet for one more TV debate next Monday. It is likely that
Mr Gonzalez's advisers will be working on his basic television performance
techniques before then. The prime minister, who considers himself a natural
communicator, believes that such theatrical skills are a waste of time -
such that he barely even looked at the camera on Monday night. Mr Aznar,
however, glued himself to it, his only weakness being a perhaps too
confident air.
The socialists, meanwhile, were thrown into further choas in the
Principality of Asturias just before the debate when the region's socialist
leader, Mr Juan Luis Rodriguez-Vigil resigned, the victim of a massive
confidence trick.
Hoping to boost socialist chances in the region on June 6, Mr
Rodriguez-Vigil hurriedly announced last week that his government had
secured a Saudi-led Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) investment in a new oil
refinery. But the region had been negotiating with a middleman who has since
vanished and the Saudi investors say they know nothing about the refinery.
Analysts in Madrid said yesterday they did not believe the quarter point cut
in the Bank of Spain's benchmark rate would have much effect on the election
result.
It is the second cut this month - the first, of one-and-a-half points,
brought official rates down from 13 per cent to 11.5 per cent after the 8
per cent devaluation of the peseta on May 13.

FT  26 MAY 93 / West may yet use force, says Stoltenberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations mediator, said yesterday that
the option of using military force to end the conflict in Bosnia had not
been abandoned by the international community, though other means to achieve
peace would be pursued first.
Speaking in Zagreb at the start of a tour of the war zones in the former
Yugoslavia, Mr Stoltenberg said it was wrong to assume, from the new
containment plan adopted by the western allies and Russia, that the use of
force to make the Bosnian Serbs give up their conquered territory had been
ruled out.
Meanwhile, Lord Owen, the European Community's representative on the two-man
international mediating team, remained silent about the future of the
Bosnian peace plan which he and Mr Cyrus Vance drew up.
Lord Owen's refusal to comment on the new international strategy to deal
with the Bosnian crisis, which many observers see as undermining the
Vance-Owen plan, has fuelled speculation that he might relinquish his role
as mediator.
However, diplomats in Geneva, venue of the Yugoslav peace conference, said
they saw no reason for Lord Owen to abandon his task since the EC continued
to back the Vance-Owen plan for a political settlement in Bosnia.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, said yesterday that what
the west had done was to reverse its priorities, placing efforts to end the
fighting ahead of an immediate political settlement.
'Essentially we still have exactly the same destination, but we may be using
a different route to get there,' he said.
Meanwhile, Turkey said the new plan adopted by the US, Russia, France,
Britain and Spain was a 'waste of time.'
'The plan proposes no measures to stop the side which is determined to
continue its attacks and which has challenged the world,' the Turkish
foreign ministry said.

<TEXT>
WHILE Serb leaders celebrate what they believe is the international go-ahead
for the division of Bosnia, there is a fear in Belgrade that the Washington
agreement could undermine the stability of Serbia and Montenegro.
The agreement - between the US, Russia, France, Spain and Britain - seeks to
create 'safe areas', effectively freezing the military situation while a
political solution is sought.
However, by implying that the Bosnian Serbs and their Croat counterparts
will be allowed to hold on to their territorial gains, the agreement appears
to signal to the Serbs that aggression will be rewarded. 'It's the opposite
of containment and it's the opposite of a durable peace. It enhances the
position of violent extremists,' said a western diplomat.
There is a particular concern that the position of Serb extremists such as
Mr Vojislav Seselj, a parliamentary deputy who also commands a paramilitary
unit, will be bolstered.
Mr Seselj, a vociferous opponent of the Vance-Owen peace plan, praised the
Washington declaration as 'the first sober public statement by the west.'
Described by the US as a war criminal, Mr Seselj has called not only for the
expulsion of all non-Serbs from Serbia but also for the prosecution of
'politically suspect' Serbs, who have voiced opposition to the Bosnian war.
'The agreement cuts the rug out from under potential democratic forces. It
creates an unstable Serbia,' one diplomat said. If the trend towards
extremism was allowed to continue, Mr Seselj and his ultra-nationalist
allies, like General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, would start
to represent the political mainstream, he added.
The ultra-nationalists' hand has been strengthened in Serbia by their
defiance of western pressure, even under the threat of military action
against the Bosnian Serbs.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has also won a degree of popular
support for his pledge not to yield to the west. He was quick to refuse the
deployment of UN monitors on Serbia's border with Bosnia on the grounds that
Serb and Yugoslav leaders could prevent the supply of weapons to Serb-held
Bosnian territories.
Nevertheless, in a bid to get stepped-up UN sanctions eased, Mr Milosevic
this month showed a more conciliatory attitude by exerting pressure on Mr
Karadzic to support the Vance-Owen peace plan. Yesterday he denied the
Washington agreement handed the Serbs victory.
Continued enforcement of sanctions will now become the west's most important
lever. Although sanctions have devastated the economy, they failed to slow
the Serbian onslaught in Bosnia. Worsening economic conditions may increase
the likelihood of unrest. But with scant popular support for the democratic
opposition, Mr Seselj and his supporters could benefit most.
Serb leaders have also rejected the proposed deployment of international
monitors in the southern province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up
90 per cent of the 2m population.
If the Serbs are correct in believing that the Washington declaration
condones the establishment through violence of national states, the restive
Albanian majority in Kovoso may be tempted to make a bid for independence.
'This agreement strengthens the nationalists and the extremists. Giving in
to those who divided up territory will encourage the Albanians. I'm afraid
it's a signal for the next flashpoint, Kosovo,' said Mrs Vesna Pesic, an
opposition leader.

COOPERS &amp; Lybrand, the accountants appointed to investigate allegations of
overspending at the headquarters of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, yesterday briefed a meeting of finance officials on the remit
of the firm's planned inquiry.
The meeting, convened by Sweden's Finance Minister Anne Wibble, in her
capacity as chair of the bank's board of governors, was held at the UK
Treasury.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand have been called in by the bank's internal audit committee
to help it investigate the cost of the headquarters' project.
'We are sure that Coopers will do a good and thorough job of this,' said one
official who had attended the meeting. He added: 'There is a firm desire to
get to the bottom of the affair and there is a very firm aim to get the
report completed by July 15.'
The meeting was described as low key and was intended as an informative
session for the finance officials of the leading industrial nations.
The bank's internal audit committee is also examining the EBRD's budget
control systems, its lending record and the use during last year of private
jets.

<TEXT>
KURDISH rebels in Turkey yesterday shattered a fragile ceasefire, killing 30
soldiers in an attack on a bus near the eastern city of Bingol.
The attack ends any hope for an early end to the eight-year conflict. The
acting prime minister, Mr Erdal Inonu, immediately suspended a government
decree extending a partial amnesty to the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
rebels.
The attack, on Monday evening, was the first rebel attack on government
forces since the PKK leader, Mr Abdullah Ocalan, declared a unilateral
ceasefire on March 20.
The rebels forced a bus carrying soldiers to stop at a roadblock, ordered
the troops off the bus and shot them, the regional governor's office in
Diyarbakir said. Another 15 people were abducted, including eight soldiers.
Turkish commandos yesterday recovered the bodies of 30 soldiers and four
civilians from a ravine. The bus and five other vehicles were set on fire by
the rebels.
On Monday, Turkey's newly elected President Suleyman Demirel convened a
special meeting of the National Security Council to approve a decree
offering reduced sentences to rebels charged with direct involvement in the
bloodshed, and a pardon for rebels who had fled to the mountains but had not
been involved in attacks. Death sentences for those already charged were to
be commuted to life imprisonment.
Mr Inonu's Social Democratic Populist party (SHP) has been urging its senior
coalition partner, the True Path party (DYP), to announce reforms in the
wake of the rebel ceasefire.
Mr Inonu said yesterday the decree had only been suspended.
However, the renewed rebel violence is expected to strengthen cabinet
hardliners who suspected the ceasefire was a ploy.

NATO ministers yesterday tried to keep hopes alive for the Vance-Owen peace
plan in Bosnia, emphasising that the 'safe areas' proposal agreed in
Washington at the weekend should be seen as a means to that end and not a
substitute.
With the main allies reluctant to commit extra troops to the safe areas, the
alliance is considering a limited role in implementing the Washington plan.
Defence ministers made clear that Nato saw its contribution as essentially
restricted to co-ordinating air cover.
The US, Britain, Turkey and the Netherlands, which already have aircraft
enforcing the no-fly zone, indicated they would be prepared to extend their
operations. France, absent from yesterday's talks at Nato headquarters, was
also expected to participate.
Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, attending his first Nato meeting,
suggested ground forces could also draw on Nato command and control
expertise. However, it was not clear where these forces would come from.
Ministers said no plans could be drawn up before a UN Security Council
resolution was passed defining the safe area proposal.
The plan is expected to require several thousand troops in addition to the
9,000 already in Bosnia.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government plans to force state enterprises to pay their debts
or declare bankruptcy, according to two radical ministers.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, said his Committee for the
Management of State Property had been entrusted with the task of 'launching
bankruptcies' following the adoption by parliament of legislation allowing
companies to go bankrupt.
He said, however, that the actual closing down or restructuring of
unprofitable enterprises would be initiated by creditors.
At the same time, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, yesterday blocked
off the traditional escape route for inefficient enterprises when he
announced that the central bank had agreed to stop creating money to cover
the debts between companies.
That promise was contained in a statement of intent to the International
Monetary Fund, signed on Saturday by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chief.
The central bank's printing of money has fuelled inflation and weakened
incentives for enterprises to become more efficient. Mr Fyodorov said
additional measures would soon be approved by the government to tighten
credit discipline and speed up slow bank transfers - which have also
contributed to the debt crisis.
He said not one enterprise would be allowed to apply for subsidies from his
credit commission unless it provided a bank record of its hard currency
holding. He said Russian enterprises had Dollars 9bn sitting in bank
accounts which they should be encouraged to spend rather than applying to
the state for help.
It remains to be seen whether the central bank and the government will keep
their promises, aimed at unlocking Dollars 3bn in new IMF loans this summer.
A similar statement of intent signed last year by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
former prime minister, secured a first Dollars 1bn loan but its contents
were not implemented.

POLAND'S six-party coalition government faced mounting pressure yesterday
after Ms Hanna Suchocka, the prime minister, said that she was not prepared
to amend this year's budget.
The former Communist SLD group has demanded budget changes, in the form of
public sector pay increases, in exchange for its 60 votes which could save
the government in a no-confidence motion on Friday. The motion is being put
forward by the disgruntled Solidarity union group.
The government, however, is bound to its budget targets, which include a
deficit fixed at 5 per cent of GDP in exchange for a Dollars 660m (Pounds
428.5m) stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund. The collapse of
this agreement could lead to the cancellation by western governments of
promised cuts in Poland's debt next year.
The government can count on the support of only around 183 deputies in the
460-strong chamber, where a disunited opposition controls 258 seats. The
SLD, which has already voted with the government on its privatisation plans,
now needs the concessions on the budget to explain to its increasingly
confused supporters why it wants to keep the present cabinet in power.

FT  26 MAY 93 / EC close to deal on works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S 11 European Community partners are close to agreement on setting
up mandatory works councils in large trans-European companies, amid signs
that Britain's obdurate opposition to this extension of workers' rights may
be softening.
The controversial draft directive, stalled for over two years, will be
discussed by labour and social affairs ministers next Tuesday in Luxembourg.
The Danish presidency of the EC, while working for an agreement including
Britain, has set as its minimum goal a consensus among the 11. This would
allow them to implement the directive once the Maastricht treaty, and its
social protocol from which the UK is exempt, is ratified.
Britain faces the dilemma of fighting to dilute the directive, or see it
come into force without having shaped it. If the latter happened, British
companies would be among those most affected, as there are more than 100 in
continental Europe falling under the proposed rules. British multinationals
in Europe would also face pressure to introduce in the UK the consultation
procedures they would be obliged to follow on the continent.
The rules would oblige companies employing more than 1,000 workers in more
than one member state, and with more than 100 employees in at least two of
them, to set up elected works councils, which would have to be consulted on
jobs changes, new technology, investment and relocation plans, and 'any
proposal creating serious consequences for workers' interests.' Although the
directive has been made more flexible, with, for instance, provision for
workers and employers to make their own arrangements, the UK flatly opposes
making consultation obligatory.
Yet Britain appears to be keeping its options open, playing a full
negotiating role in recent meetings to discuss the directive, according to
the latest compromise document.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Balladur makes jobs his top priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH PRIME Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday acknowledged a change of
emphasis in economic policy, confirming measures to promote economic
recovery and to fight unemployment through a record FFr40bn (Pounds 4.73bn)
state loan, out of which an extra FFr10bn would be spent on preserving jobs.
Mr Balladur acknowledged that this constituted a change in tack from his May
10 budget which focused largely on raising taxes and cutting public spending
with the aim then of keeping this year's budget deficit to FFr316bn. But he
told parliament that the country's economic plight was 'more difficult than
we could have foreseen even a few weeks ago'.
Members of Mr Balladur's centre-right coalition acknowledged he had shifted
economic gears in only a few weeks.
'The government has no doubt realised it lacked audacity because it is now
proposing to play its 'joker' card - that is a large national bond issue,'
Mr Philippe Auberger, parliamentary budget chief and a member of Mr
Balladur's Gaullist party, said.
The new job-creating measures will involve increasing the number of places
in work schemes by 200,000 to a total of 650,000, as well as providing more
financial incentives for employers to take the young on as apprentices and
to hire the long-term unemployed.
The switch in government priorities arises less from a change in its overall
forecast on the economy - which even on May 10 it estimated would see a
contraction in gross domestic product of 0.1 per cent this year - than from
new forecasts of unemployment. It now believes that the number of jobless,
set in March at 3.1m (10.7 per cent of the work force), will rise by another
350,000 this year.
Mr Balladur yesterday sought to reverse the widespread feeling that the rise
in unemployment was inexorable. He went on to criticise certain companies
for their 'unacceptable' practices in 'dispatching' people to the dole
queue, and he called on state-owned companies to be 'exemplary' in seeking,
whenever financial and market conditions allowed, to avoid redundancies.
On May 10 Mr Balladur had said he would spend FFr12.9bn this year to promote
employment, both directly through payroll tax cuts and work schemes and
indirectly through more spending on public housing and infrastructure
projects. But since then he has been intensively lobbied by employers and
unions to beef up his recovery programme.
The FFr40bn bond issue is designed to tap some of the FFr1,200bn of savings
now in money market funds and to put it to more productive use. To attract
individual investors away from popular money market accounts, Mr Balladur
said the bonds could be converted into shares in the privatised groups and
would carry tax breaks. Mr Balladur stressed that it would only represent a
momentary surge in state borrowing, until the planned sell-off of
state-owned companies started in the autumn. Today the government is to
unveil its privatisation bill, listing companies it plans to sell.
French banks yesterday continued the downward trend in interest rates by
cutting base rates by 0.2 points to 8.8 per cent. Yesterday's cut follows
Monday's announcement that the Bank of France was trimming its leading
interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.

FT  26 MAY 93 / EC voices doubts on global standard for HDTV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC officials said yesterday that a concerted new US effort to develop
digital high-definition television was unlikely to produce a single global
standard for cinema-quality television.
But a senior European Commission official said the US 'grand alliance',
formed on Monday between competing HDTV consortia, would probably boost
worldwide co-operation on television standards, and lead to technology
sharing.
Political progress on a European HDTV initiative has been stalled since last
year, with Britain blocking agreement on EC funding on the grounds that
digital HDTV technology will soon supersede the original Community strategy.
Two European electronics groups, Thomson Consumer Electronics of France and
Philips of the Netherlands, are among the companies which have now decided
to collaborate on a single digital HDTV standard for the US, instead of
competing for the approval of the US Federal Communications Commission.
However, a simple transfer of US standards to Europe would not be possible,
the European Commission said yesterday, because of differing technical
requirements, although EC digital standards could use the same basic
technologies as the US system.
But a Thomson spokesman yesterday said: 'Now Philips and Thomson are
involved in a grand alliance I should think there's definitely worldwide
potential for this standard.'
The announcement of the grand alliance should bring new urgency to the
meeting of EC telecommunications ministers on June 16, when 11 member states
will again try to overcome long-standing British opposition to a proposed
Community strategy on advanced television.
Philips and Thomson were supposed to be among the principal beneficiaries of
the EC's original HDTV strategy, based on exclusive satellite transmission
standards. Unlike the analogue technology first selected by the EC, digital
standards can also be used for terrestrial broadcasts and for links with
computer and audio technology.
Denmark, which holds the EC presidency until July, wants the Commission to
present proposals for a 'family' of EC digital standards in the autumn.
Philips said that a joint US digital standard could be agreed by the FCC
next year and broadcasts could begin by 1996. However, the company said
digital transmissions were more likely to begin in 1997.

The European monetary system has, in effect, broken down by letting
countries win competitive advantage by devaluing currencies, said Mr Erik
Hoffmeyer, the Danish Central Bank chief, Reuter reports from Copenhagen.
'I have no reservations about saying that the currency co-operation has
collapsed in the past nine months,' he told a Danish business seminar.
Britain and Italy pulled their currencies out of the exchange rate mechanism
last autumn, and Ireland, Spain and Portugal have been forced to devalue
within the mechanism.
'We have seen a series of major devaluations which were completely out of
line with the reasonable pattern in a fixed exchange rate co-operation,' Mr
Hoffmeyer said.
He emphasised that the point of the EMS was to avoid competitive
devaluations. 'This has not been the case. What we have seen have been
irresponsible exchange-rate changes.'
Mr Hoffmeyer said market confidence in the EMS would not return until the
pound and lira had come back to the grid.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Steinkuhler's exit leaves left in disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL of Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the one real star in the German trade
union firmament, was in the end entirely self-inflicted.
Few of his senior colleagues in the mighty IG Metall, the 3.3m strong
engineering workers union, really wanted him to go. He was an outstanding
union leader, a tough negotiator, a good speaker, and an instinctive
politician.
He quit yesterday 'against the advice and the requests of many colleagues',
in his own words. And yet few doubted that he had to go.
But then his offence was entirely self-inflicted too: to speculate in the
shares of companies controlled by Daimler-Benz, the industrial giant on
whose supervisory board he sits. It was the fact of his share-dealing - to
the tune of more than DM1m (Pounds 300,000) - rather than the question of
whether he had insider knowledge, which finally destroyed him in the eyes of
his peers.
His loyal spokesman, Mr Jorg Barczynski, admitted on Monday night: 'There is
fundamental criticism of his share-dealing from all concerned. But then
there are two factions within the union.
'One group says he must resign regardless. The second group, which is much
larger, says we did not elect him as a good share-dealer. We elected him for
his strength and experience as a union leader.'
In spite of such loyalty, Mr Steinkuhler decided yesterday to quit, and his
resignation may help to limit the damage to his union in particular, and the
trade union movement in general. What is certain is that the whole affair is
another devastating blow to the left in German politics, still reeling from
the resignation of Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the Social Democrats (SPD),
only three weeks ago.
It also raises questions about the exploitation of the supervisory board
system in German companies, and has finally focused attention on the absence
of any legal control on insider dealing in Germany. That must raise the
pressure for early legislation, promised by the government but proving very
slow in the drafting.
Mr Engholm and Mr Steinkuhler were probably the two most popular single
figures on the left, and their departure leaves the SPD and its union
supporters in serious disarray, in the run-up to a mammoth election year in
1994 (with no fewer than 19 separate national, state, local government and
European elections).
Mr Steinkuhler's most likely successor is Mr Klaus Zwickel, the current
number two, and the union's main wages expert. He is a safe pair of hands,
but a good deal less inspiring than his chief. That may well mean a less
militant IG Metall, at least for the immediate future.
Perhaps more damaging for the union has been the fact and outcome of the
strikes in east Germany, where no one has been the winner of a largely
pointless dispute. The union has been forced to concede a two-year extension
of the process of wage equalisation with the west, and, more seriously, the
option for any company to plead extraordinary circumstances and re-negotiate
a plant-level deal. Given the pressure for similar plant-level bargaining in
the west, it could be the thin end of the wedge.
The supervisory board system in German companies, although not for the first
time seen as a source of insider dealing, is too well established to be
questioned. The fact that Mr Steinkuhler has quit, and not tried to stay in
office, will also counter those who challenge the wisdom of putting trade
unionists on the board.
As for the pressure for legislation against insider dealing, it has not yet
had much effect on the Finance Ministry. A draft law, including stiff fines
and the ultimate penalty of jail, is promised by the summer. It is unlikely
to become full law until well into 1994.
One other consequence is that the affair may make companies like
Daimler-Benz more careful about the handling of price-sensitive information.

FT  26 MAY 93 / SIB to take tougher line on financial regulation: Large says
two-tier system must be made to work better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Investments Board is making sweeping changes to the way
it oversees the self-regulatory organisations for Britain's financial
services industry.
The changes are outlined in a report commissioned by the Treasury last
summer in the aftermath of the theft of more than Pounds 440m from pension
schemes controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Andrew Large, SIB
chairman, was asked to review the entire regulatory system and recommend
changes.
He stopped short of scrapping the two-tier system which relies on
self-regulatory organisations to enforce rules broadly set out by the SIB.
'What I have tried to do is to make what we've got work better,' he said.
The case for scrapping the system was not sufficiently compelling.
Mr Large's report gives a strong boost to the creation of the proposed
Personal Investment Authority, intended to be the SRO for all retail
financial services. The formation of the PIA is central to the success of
the new regulatory regime.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday gave an unqualified endorsement
of the changes and said he would keep the area under review. 'I will be
prepared to take whatever action is necessary if experience shows existing
powers to be inadequate,' he said.
In his report, Mr Large concluded that it was lax supervision of the SROs by
the SIB - partly at the insistence of the SROs - which led to the Maxwell
affair, widespread mis-selling of life insurance and pensions and
manipulation at the London Futures and Options Exchange.
Under the new system, the SIB will monitor the enforcement activities of the
SROs more closely, including setting performance targets, and making
periodic supervisory visits to both the SRO and to its member companies to
see how well the enforcement system is working.
The SIB, however, will delegate greater rule-making authority to the SROs
after setting out broad standards of investor protection they are expected
to meet.
The SIB also said it would take a higher profile in the enforcement
activities of the SROs, closely monitoring cases it feels are significant
and it will take the effectiveness of enforcement activities into account
when assessing SRO performance.
The board of the SIB will also be reconstituted to emphasise its public
interest. A majority of non-executives will come from outside the financial
services industry.
SRO chairmen gave a cautious welcome to the report, saying tighter
supervision of their activities was inevitable after the Maxwell affair. The
report warns that if the SIB does not get the co-operation of the SROs or if
the new regulatory approach does not work, alternatives will have to be
found.
Mr Large said the SIB wished to reduce its role as a direct regulator and
would encourage those which it now regulates, particularly banks and
building societies, to become members of an SRO. The life insurance industry
has threatened to boycott the PIA unless the banks and building societies
join as well.

FT  26 MAY 93 / De Klerk resists rule of black majority in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS and MICHAEL HOLMAN

<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT FW de Klerk of South Africa in effect rejected black majority rule
yesterday, insisting that the white-led National party should play a central
role in a coalition government lasting into the next century.
The president's demand for indefinite power-sharing goes well beyond the
understanding reached between his National party and the African National
Congress that a five-year government of national unity will be formed by the
main parties after the country's first multiracial elections, expected next
spring.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr de Klerk said power-sharing
between the country's main political parties should be entrenched as a
permanent principle in any constitution adopted after next year's elections.
'We definitely believe that a final constitution must include the principle
of power-sharing,' he said. 'A winner-takes-all model is the worst possible
model there can be for South Africa.'
His demand is likely to complicate the present negotiations in Johannesburg
on South Africa's political future, as participants struggle to reach
sufficient agreement to announce an election date and the formation of a
Transitional Executive Council, perhaps as early as next week.
The talks met a further snag yesterday when the radical Pan-Africanist
Congress called for their suspension after nearly 50 of its members were
arrested. 'The process is now hanging by a very thin thread,' Mr Cyril
Ramaphosa, chief ANC negotiator, told delegates.
Mr de Klerk made clear that 'fundamental differences' on power-sharing had
still to be resolved.
The president denied that he was seeking formal veto powers for the National
party in any new government, but argued that South Africa would in future
have 'to be governed on the basis of consensus on fundamental issues between
the main role players'.
That might, he said, involve the creation of an executive committee
comprising party leaders, with the chairmanship rotating between them, to
deal with 'fundamental principles'. He implied that real power should lie
with that body, with a future president acting as head of state, not of
government.
His remarks are certain to dismay ANC leaders. Only last week, a senior ANC
official said: 'The idea of an inner cabinet of party leaders goes way
beyond the government of national unity we have offered.'

FT  26 MAY 93 / Speyhawk calls in receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEYHAWK, a property development company with debts of more than Pounds
350m, lost its two-year struggle for survival yesterday and became the
latest casualty of the recession in UK commercial property.
The company said it was going into receivership after the withdrawal of its
bankers' support. The appointment of Mr Peter Spratt and Mr Alan Barratt of
Price Waterhouse as receivers is expected to be confirmed today.
Speyhawk's 46 banks are likely to share losses of more than Pounds 150m,
based on an estimated value of its assets of Pounds 200m. The property
company's main lender was Barclays Bank, which made loans totalling about
Pounds 50m.
The receivership is another example of heavy losses inflicted on the banks
by the collapse of large property companies, which last year included
Mountleigh, Rosehaugh and Olympia &amp; York, developer of Canary Wharf.
Speyhawk has been technically insolvent for well over a year. It continued
trading because it had won agreement in principle from its banks to
restructure its debts.
The change of heart by the banks followed a new assessment of the company's
position, which suggested the value of its assets, particularly in the City,
had fallen to a point where it was not feasible to support it. Mr Trevor
Osborne, Speyhawk's chairman, called the banks' decision a 'devastating
piece of news'.
The banks' action was seen in sections of the property market as signalling
an increased willingness to put companies in receivership to take advantage
of the first signs of recovery in the property market.
Barclays, however, said Speyhawk's receivership was an isolated case. 'We
don't want this to be seen as a sign of banks' impatience with property
companies,' it said. Moreover, Speyhawk's portfolio, much of it unlet, is
unlikely to be an early beneficiary of the improvement in the property
market's prospects.
The company had losses of Pounds 2.9m, Pounds 216.9m and Pounds 90m for the
three years to September 1992.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Mayhew to testify at arms for Iraq inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PATRICK MAYHEW is to give evidence to the Scott inquiry into arms for
Iraq in a hastily convened appearance following allegations that he tried to
prevent evidence about the Supergun affair coming to court.
Sir Patrick, the Northern Ireland secretary and a former attorney-general,
is to appear before Lord Justice Scott tomorrow, taking a break from his
efforts to restart talks on Ulster's political future in order to do so.
Sir Patrick will be the first member of the present cabinet to give evidence
to the inquiry. He is expected to try to rebut this week's allegations by
Sir Hal Miller, ex-MP and former Conservative party vice-chairman, that he
tried to dissuade Sir Hal from giving evidence in support of a businessman
accused of illegally exporting parts for the Supergun.
Sir Patrick has denied the claim, saying he had never urged Sir Hal to
withhold evidence which would benefit a defendant.
In a statement yesterday Sir Patrick told a hushed Commons he had been
invited to 'take an opportunity to give oral evidence to Lord Justice
Scott's inquiry on Thursday. I very gladly shall avail myself of that
opportunity.' Like other witnesses, Sir Patrick will not be under oath.
Challenged elsewhere, ministers stonewalled questions on topics being
considered by Lord Justice Scott.
Asked by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, for an assurance
that the government had not coached witnesses from Walter Somers, a Midlands
engineering company, before they gave evidence to a parliamentary Supergun
inquiry last year, Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader, said the most
'appropriate' course for ministers was to allow the Scott inquiry to
proceed.
For Labour, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, tried to
draw other ministers into the arms-for-Iraq web, naming 10 members of the
present cabinet - including Mr John Major, the prime minister.
The controversy over Sir Hal's allegations has effectively forced Lord
Justice Scott to rearrange his schedule of hearings. After Monday no further
public hearings were planned until June 11.
Separately, Mr Gerald Kaufman, former shadow foreign secretary, said last
night Sir Hal's evidence was in flat contradiction to a letter sent to him
last November by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. The letter said the
government did not learn of the involvement of British companies in
supplying tubes for the Supergun until March 30, 1990. Sir Hal has said he
alerted three government agencies about the project in June 1988.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Major maps out strategy for EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POST-MAASTRICHT strategy to capitalise on the shift in the balance of
power in the European Community that will follow enlargement has been mapped
out by Mr John Major.
In an interview with the Financial Times, the prime minister said speedy
entry into the Community by Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway was
'pivotal' to Britain's agenda in the approach to the 1996 inter-governmental
conference.
Mr Major confirmed there is no early prospect of sterling's return to the
European exchange rate mechanism. Significantly, though, he refused to rule
out the prospect entirely over the longer term.
He was equally reluctant to translate his deep scepticism about the value of
granting independence to the Bank of England into a categorical statement
that monetary policy would remain indefinitely in the hands of the Treasury.
Mr Major said the combination of enlargement and the popular mood of
disenchantment across the Community that had come to light in the debate
over Maastricht would reinforce Britain's case for a more flexible,
decentralised Europe.
Under intense pressure to heal the wounds in the Conservative party
inflicted by Maastricht, he added that the entry of the four would 'begin to
change the culture of the Community'.
The new entrants were more committed than some existing members to free
trade and, importantly, all would be net contributors to the Brussels
budget. 'For the first time since the Community was established, you begin
to see a balance in the members between net contributors and net
recipients.'
Mr Major said the shift in the balance of power would provide the backdrop
for Britain to propose institutional changes in the 1996 conference, notably
to strengthen the accountability of the Commission.

FT  25 MAY 93 / World Trade News: UK agrees credit lines for Russia
contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has agreed credit lines worth about Dollars 350m (Pounds 227.2m) for
three big Russian refurbishment projects, according to Mr Alexander Shokhin,
Russian deputy prime minister in charge of foreign economic affairs.
He said yesterday that - in talks with Mr Michael Heseltine, president of
the UK board of trade, and other British ministers over the weekend - the
two sides had agreed to proceed on three contracts central to Russian
efforts to upgrade its communications and energy infrastructure.
These are:
Refurbishment of a gas terminal in Siberia, co-financed by Dollars 136m of
UK government and US Export-Import Bank credits and Dollars 74m of credit
guarantees put up by the Russian government. Rolls-Royce will be the leading
UK contractor.
The construction of a new international air terminal at Moscow's Domodyedovo
airport, financed by Dollars 170m in UK credits and Dollars 58m of credit
guarantees from the Russian government. Taylor Woodrow will be the main
contractor.
The project includes development of a new airline based at Domodyedovo
called Air Russia - a joint venture by British Airways and Aeroflot.
The modernisation of Moscow's telephone exchange, financed with Dollars 50m
of UK government credits and Dollars 25m Russian credit guarantees.
Among other projects discussed, said Mr Shokhin, was a plan for a traffic
control system in Moscow.
All the projects chosen are in sectors desperately needing up-grading. The
telephone system in Moscow is plagued by breakdowns, while the international
air terminal at Sheremetyevo cannot meet the growth in traffic.
At Domodyedovo airport, one of the largest domestic terminals badly needs
repairing.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Rulings, relationships and regulatory
regimes - The slower profits growth expected from the forthcoming results of
the 10 privatised water companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADITIONAL rally in water companies' shares ahead of their annual
reporting season, largely prompted by expectations of increased dividends,
has so far failed to take off.
With the first of the 10 privatised companies, North West Water, announcing
results for the year to March 31 tomorrow, the sector has instead fallen
more than 10 per cent in the past month. The decline partly stems from
investors switching into recovery stocks, and partly from worries about
regulatory risk.
This year's results season, which rumbles on until mid July, will be the
last before Ofwat's 1994 periodic review, when price levels to the end of
the decade and beyond will be set. As such, this will be the last time until
after the review that attention will still focus on companies' results,
rather than their relationship with the regulator.
The results threaten to be unexciting. Although companies continue to
diversify into unregulated areas such as waste management and process
engineering, group results are still dominated by their core water and
sewage businesses. These businesses are predictable and few surprises are
likely.
Analysts expect average pre-tax profits growth to slow from previous years
to about 5-6 per cent. Operating profits are still growing rapidly, thanks
to guaranteed price rises. But pre-tax figures are constrained by higher
financing costs as borrowings on capital expenditure programmes start to
mount up.
North West, for example, is expected to report interest charges of about
Pounds 50m last year, compared with interest received of Pounds 16m in the
previous period.
Ms Angela Whelan, water analyst at BZW, expects most companies to have moved
into a lightly geared position. But, illustrating the strength of water
companies' balance sheets, average gearing is likely to increase to no more
than 30-35 per cent by 1995.
Behind the headline profit figures, which are all expected to be reported in
line with FRS 3, three special situations are expected to lift profits at
Northumbrian, Welsh and Wessex well above the sector average.
Northumbrian will include a Pounds 7.3m first half profit from an investment
fund, while Welsh will include a pre-tax Pounds 17m exceptional gain from
the sale of its 14.9 per cent stake in South Wales Electricity last
December. Wessex's results will be helped by a contribution of several
million pounds from UK Waste Management, its joint venture with Waste
Management International of the US.
Dividend growth, meanwhile, is expected to be more punchy, with companies
announcing increases of 9 per cent or more, or a real increase of up to 5
per cent.
As in previous years, this increase is likely to be seen by customers as
excessive. According to Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell at NatWest Securities, the
problem is partly due to falling inflation. 'Given that their dividend
policy for the whole year was formulated (at the interim stage) when
inflation was slightly higher, these final dividends will look pretty
generous,' he said.
Analysts therefore do not expect any further dividend increases to reflect
changes in the rates of advance corporation tax introduced in the budget.
With large capital allowances, water companies pay no mainstream corporation
tax and stand to benefit from lower levels of unrelieved ACT.
According to some analysts, companies stand to save up to Pounds 100m this
decade due to the changes. They may therefore be pressured by shareholders,
some of which will lose money because of the changes, to share the windfall
by paying higher dividends. Ofwat is likely to disagree.
With the regulatory review looming, companies will also be pressed for
initial thoughts about their strategic business plans, which will map out
targets for the following 10 years. The strategic plans are due to be
submitted to Ofwat next March and will form the basis for the regulator's
decisions on each companies' price increases from 1995.
As a first step towards the plans, companies are already consulting
customers about different market strategies and the various costs involved.
Anglian surprised some observers earlier this month when initial public
research suggested its customers may be prepared to pay more than the bare
minimum to improve standards. North West, in contrast, said its research
showed customers wanted to keep costs down.
Ofwat's review is likely to cast an ever lengthening shadow over share
prices in the lead up to the regulators' final rulings. According to some
analysts, the recent weakness in water shares also reflects investors'
realisation that a year of uncertainty has begun.
The regulatory regime is not expected to become excessive. But it is likely
to become tougher for the second half of the decade than it has been for the
first. Ofwat is also expected to start, probably this autumn, publishing its
conclusions on questions such as the cost of capital and companies'
efficiency savings. Each announcement will give scope for jitters as the
market weighs up each ruling's implications for the sector.
The last area of companies' results which will come under scrutiny is
returns from unregulated businesses. These were mainly acquired after the
1989 privatisation and have performed poorly so far, partly because of the
effects of recession.
Most companies see their unregulated businesses as a way to grow earnings
after the periodic review and maintain dividend growth.
Biffa, the waste management company acquired by Severn Trent in May 1991,
has become the most high profile example of a disappointing acquisition.
Biffa is expected to have remained loss making after interest costs last
year.
Elsewhere, analysts will be keen to hear updates from Yorkshire Water about
its engineering joint venture with Babcock.
Wessex should also have some early indications about the integration of
NFC's waste arm, which it bought with Waste Management International in
January.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Profits warning lowers Kellogg's

A WARNING on second-quarter earnings sent Kellogg's share price sharply
lower yesterday.
The US cereals group expects earnings per share in the quarter to be about
10 per cent lower than the 68 cents in the same period last year.
It sees record earnings per share for the full year but achieving
double-digit growth over last year's Dollars 2.75 a share 'will be
challenging', it added.
By the close the shares were down Dollars 2 3/4 , or almost 5 per cent, at
Dollars 53 7/8 on Wall Street.
Mr Arnold Langbo, chairman and chief executive officer, said they were being
hit in the short term by 'slower-than-expected recoveries from recession in
key markets such as Europe, Mexico and Australia. These conditions are being
complicated by unfavourable foreign currency exchange rates and by trade
inventory adjustments.'
The company remained optimistic about its global growth prospects.
Last month, the group reported first-quarter earnings per share 7 per cent
higher at 74 cents, excluding one-off items.
General Mills, the packaged foods and restaurants group, is to restructure
some of its consumer foods manufacturing facilities and close some
restaurants to help offset the impact of expected new federal tax and
healthcare policies.
The company said yesterday it would take a fourth-quarter charge of Dollars
45m to Dollars 50m (28 to 30 cents a share). It expected the actions to lead
to Dollars 15m in after-tax savings savings (9 cents) in fiscal 1994.
A total of 31 of the company's 1,075 restaurants in North America will be
shut down, half of the closures coming in Canada.
Mr Bruce Atwater, chairman, said fourth-quarter operating performance was
expected to be on target as were the full-year results before exceptional
items.

MAY Department Stores, the St Louis-based retailer, is to invest Dollars
4.6bn over the next five years in opening 100 department stores and 1,200
Payless ShoeSource stores.
The expansion was announced at the annual meeting, when Mr David Farrell,
chairman and chief executive, said the company expected record sales and
per-share earnings in 1993. Earlier this month, the retailer reported
first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 96m, up from Dollars 81m, on net
retail sales 5.3 per cent higher at Dollars 2.32bn.
The company planned to open 13 department stores and 225 Payless ShoeSource
stores this year.

6.5% - Japanese Corporate News and Results Round-up

YAMANOUCHI Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drug manufacturer, yesterday
blamed lower interest rates and capital increases at overseas subsidiaries
for a 6.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y57.1bn (Dollars 517m) for the
year to March.
Net profits dropped by 13 per cent to Y27.2bn last year, while sales rose
7.9 per cent to Y243.6bn due to steady demand for the company's anti-ulcer
drug in the Japanese market.
Yamanouchi's shares, which trade on the first section of the Tokyo stock
exchange, were under pressure from profit-taking during yesterday's session,
ending Y60 lower at Y2,480.
Mr Toshide Yoda, a pharmaceutical sector analyst at UBS Securities, predicts
pre-tax profit declines for the overall drug industry once the government
establishes a fixed-priced system in an effort to control the expansion of
healthcare costs.
Drugs totalled about 30.8 per cent of the entire healthcare bill in Japan
last year, compared with less than 15 per cent in most western countries, he
said.
Yamanouchi expects a slight growth in unconsolidated pretax profits at
Y57.5bn for the current financial year, with net profits at Y28bn, and a 6.7
per cent increase in sales to Y260bn.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, the Japanese drugmaker specialising in antibiotics,
reported a 46.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y22.7bn last year due to
strong sales of oral drugs. These sales increased by 4.2 per cent to Y236bn.
However, the Osaka-based company posted a sharp 76.9 per cent fall in net
profits to Y1.3bn due to substantial evaluation losses on its holding of
shares of Fujisawa USA. These losses totalled about Y6.5bn.
The company expects unchanged earnings for the current fiscal year, with
pre-tax profits at Y21bn, and sales at Y236bn.
Shionogi, a pharmaceutical maker engaged mainly in antibiotics, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits climbed by 11.0 per cent to Y21.6bn for the last
fiscal year, and attributed the gain to steady demand.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Solvay may be forced to close
soda ash factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIERCE competition from the US and central and eastern Europe could force
Solvay, the Belgian chemicals company, to cut up to 10 per cent of its soda
ash production capacity this year - including the closure of its first soda
ash plant in Belgium.
Solvay, which last month warned that 1993 earnings would fall steeply, has
lodged formal complaints with the European Commission against alleged
'dumping' of cheap natural US soda ash on the EC market, and asked for
measures to protect the industry from cheap Polish, Bulgarian and Romanian
imports.
Solvay said yesterday it would have to stop production at its 129-year-old
Couillet plant in Belgium this year. Losses at the plant had grown to an
'unacceptable' BFr800m (Dollars 23.95m) a year, despite repeated attempts to
reduce fixed costs. The group is also considering the closure of its
Heilbronn soda ash factory in west Germany.
Up to 540 jobs could be lost at the factories, although sodium silicate and
calcium chloride activities will be maintained at Couillet. Last year, the
group cut 1,700 jobs and a spokesman said yesterday that at least the same
number would be lost this year.
Solvay said US and east European imports of 800,000 tonnes a year accounted
for more than 13 per cent of total EC consumption of soda ash, which is used
in the production of glass, detergent, soap, adhesives and paint. Solvay,
which pioneered the production of man-made soda ash, is the largest
producer, but recession and overcapacity have hit the industry.
Excluding extraordinary items, Solvay's net consolidated profits fell 14 per
cent last year, to BFr8.41bn from BFr9.79bn. In the alkalis sector,
including soda ash, earnings before interest, tax and charges slipped to
BFr5.6bn from BFr6.13bn.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: CEA Industrie profits decline
26%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CEA Industrie, the French atomic energy commission, yesterday announced a 26
per cent fall in net profits to FFr960m (Dollars 175.34m) for last year,
from FFr1.3bn in 1991, due to the impact of adverse exchange rates and
sluggish demand in some markets.
Meanwhile, France's new conservative government appeared to soften its line
on the future of CEA's involvement with SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian
microchip manufacturer. The industry ministry squashed speculation that CEA
would reduce its involvement with SGS-Thomson, in which it is one of the
main French shareholders, by saying it would retain its existing stake.
However, the ministry, which has already made clear it planned to adopt a
far tougher approach in its relations with state-controlled companies such
as CEA and SGS-Thomson, said long-term links between the two companies would
be reviewed.
The new government has also stressed it would be much more rigorous in its
provision of financial support to public sector concerns, although the
industry ministry said CEA would continue to participate in the
recapitalisation of SGS-Thomson.
CEA saw turnover rise from FFr38.9bn to FFr39.18bn last year, due largely to
an increase in sales outside France. The proportion of sales generated from
other countries rose to 34.3 per cent from 28.2 per cent over the same
period.
The group identified its main problems last year as the difficult condition
of the mining industry and poor demand for capital goods. CEA, like other
French companies, was also affected in the closing months of 1992 by the
strength of the franc following the September currency crisis.
Operating profits rose to FFr3.24bn from FFr1.68bn. But group net profits
were hit by an exceptional deficit of FFr322m against an exceptional credit
of FFr2.25bn in the previous year.
CEA does, however, hope to secure growth this year through the inclusion of
SGS-Thomson's semi-conductor operations, the mines recently acquired from
the Total oil group and the Sopha medical business.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BCE, Canada's biggest telecom group, will have a 16.5 per cent interest in
Talisman Energy, the former BP Canada, as a result of tendering its Encor
common and convertible preferred shares to Talisman under a revised offer.
The value of this holding will be about CDollars 275m (USDollars 217m) at
present market prices.
BCE controlled Encor, the former exploration subsidiary of TransCanada
PipeLines, through its holding of Encor common and convertible preferred.
Talisman, now an independent upstream oil and gas producer, made an offer
for Encor early this year and following criticism from institutional
investors, revised it twice.
Encor shareholders late last week approved the latest offer.
BCE is expected to divert its Talisman holding later, because it has decided
to leave the energy field and concentrate on its telecom business.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Railway renews Germany's links to East Prussian past:
'Nostalgia' tours are set to revive sensitive ties to a former heartland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If it were not for the red ribbon across the railway line, and the bright
blue paint liberally splashed on the new steel sleepers, nobody need have
noticed the occasion.
A handful of speeches on the platform, a couple of anthems from the local
navy band, an inaudible press conference in the station waiting room, and it
was all over. The rest of Kaliningrad railway station was bustling with
Russian commuters going about their normal business.
And yet it was a sort of moment of history: when the ribbon was cut, it
meant the railway line from Kaliningrad, the former East Prussian capital of
Konigsberg, to Berlin, the German capital, was back in business for the
first time since the second world war.
The 'Konigsberg Express' will run once a week from Berlin's Hauptbahnhof,
through Poland, carrying German 'nostalgia-tourists' back to their former
home town, or the home of their ancestors. It is already listed in the new
German railway timetable.
The inauguration this weekend was a half-hearted affair. The main
dignitaries stayed away: there were no ministers of transport from Germany
or Russia, no chief executives of the railways.
The celebration was left to the German private sector, which launched the
initiative of rebuilding the 2km gap in the railway line where the Russians
tore it up in 1947; and to the local administration of Kaliningrad, which is
desperate to open links to the outside world. Moscow, Warsaw and the German
government in Bonn were represented by lowly transport officials.
The truth is that the subject of Germany's links to its former Prussian
heartland is acutely sensitive, and potentially embarrassing. The collapse
of the Soviet Union has left the entire Kaliningrad region in limbo, a no
man's land caught between its neighbouring states of Poland, Lithuania and
Belarus, with no direct links to Russia, and its only real historical ties
to Germany.
With 900,000 inhabitants, 400,000 of them in the city itself, the region is
little more than a glorified military garrison, the main base for the
Russian Baltic fleet, and a point of return for Russian troops based in
eastern Europe. Agriculture, which once supported vast estates of the
aristocratic Prussian Junker families, has been all but abandoned, and the
region has little to offer economically apart from a modest fishing industry
and an equally modest tourist potential.
Kaliningrad itself is a Soviet-style eyesore, with only a handful of ruins
to mark its history. About 40 per cent of the city was destroyed by British
bombers in 1944, and the rest was effectively levelled by Stalin's tanks and
subsequent town planning.
Pauline, one-time Intourist-trained guide retrained in devastating
frankness, admits that the city has been rebuilt in a style 'both primitive
and tasteless'. Her German tourists are horrified that all that is left are
the devastated ruins of the city cathedral, a hideous neo-classical tomb of
the philosopher, Immanuel Kant, and a couple of gates from the old city
walls.
The German government is sensitive about any sign that it might be
acquiescing in the 're-Germanisation' of what was Konigsberg. Mr Helmut
Schafer, the minister of state at the foreign ministry in Bonn, was supposed
to deliver a speech in the city last week. He sent his apologies, and a
diplomat read the text.
For Germany, he said: 'There is no question of this territory belonging to
the federal republic. The borders of united Germany are those of the
previous federal republic, and the GDR. Germany is making no territorial
claims of anyone.'
The problem is that behind Germany's back, and behind Russia's back, a
German-speaking population is returning. An estimated 10,000-15,000 Volga
Germans, deported from their homeland by Stalin, have settled in the
countryside around the city in the past four years.
So the Bonn government, with backing from Moscow, has opened a
'German-Russian house' to give them a meeting point. It plans to open a
consulate next year. But it is adamant that it has no ulterior motives.
Mr Yuri Matochkin, the head of the Kaliningrad regional administration, is
clearly hedging his bets. Asked which would be most important in the region
in 10 years' time, Moscow or Berlin, he would still opt for Moscow. Asked
which it might be in 20 years, he replied: 'I think you had better come back
and ask your question again then.'

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (10): Energy and the
ayatollahs - Iran: Post-war build-up needs more power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM MILLARD

<TEXT>
Since 1988, at the end of the war with Iraq, Iran's industrial activity has
ballooned from 30 per cent of capacity to nearly 100 per cent as it
struggles to repair past damage and meet the demands of the present for a
population of some 55m people.
The government recognises that an adequate level of electrification, both in
generation and transmission/distribution capacity, is crucial to the success
of its economic reforms.
In the industrial sector, where power remains heavily subsidised, the
emergence of heavy industries such as steel, aluminium, and petrochemical
refining have helped to boost demand to an unprecedented 20 per cent
annually. Overall, most observers see total demand continuing to grow at 10
per cent or more a year for the rest of the decade.
The two Five Year Plans published in 1988 and covering the period to 1998
show that Iran has allocated some Dollars 12bn of its future foreign
currency earnings to the electricity sector, Dollars 6.8bn during the first
Plan and Dollars 5.5bn during the second. There is also a significant sum
representing goods and services purchased with local currency or through
supplier credits.
The exact value of the country's power generation equipment market (which
forms the bulk of its electricity sector spending but excludes downstream
industries such as transmission and distribution equipment) over the same
period is less easy to determine. But it can be estimated by costing the
ministry of energy's proposals for broadening the base and peak load
generating capacity from around 13,200MW in early 1992 to an extremely
ambitious 34,000MW by end-1998.
Averaging the expense of a mix of thermal, gas-fired and hydroelectric
plants at a conservative Dollars 1,000 per installed kilowatt produces a
future gross figure of about Dollars 3bn a year of which local contracting
and supply might account for 30-40 per cent.
Although the present tight budgetary conditions, introduced to cushion the
blow of the government's decision to devalue the rial, mean that such
figures are probably slightly ambitious, western suppliers are under no
illusions that Iran is by far the most significant market in the Middle East
region.
According to the ministry's power planning bureau, the total capacity of
plants under construction at any given moment totals 80 per cent or more of
the capacity currently in operation.
The government has little option but to press on, as power failures and
brownouts are already a reality. It is a telling reminder of the scale of
the challenge that even if all the 30-odd power plants involved in the
programme are commissioned on schedule, the ministry does not expect to
enjoy any surplus capacity until 1997 at the earliest.
The ministry of energy has mapped out a programme to meet both the urgent
short-term undercapacity that threatened to strangle any hope of economic
revival and provide cost-effective generation in the medium term and beyond.
The last five years saw the widespread installation of simple cycle gas
turbine sets of 90-125MW units which can be easily incorporated into older
(pre-1980) thermal plants for immediate connection to the transmission grid.
Many will subsequently be converted to combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) use
by adding waste heat recovery boilers and steam turbines.
By contrast the next five years will see the emergence of a mixed bag of
thermal, combined cycle, and hydroelectric projects, the latter comprising
four major projects on the Karun river in the south-west, and a 1,000MW
pumped storage plant at Siabisheh on the Caspian sea in the north.
However, large hydroelectric schemes cost around Dollars 1,500 per kilowatt.
The completion of the Karun-3 (3,000MW) and Karun-4 (2,000MW) stations
depends on Ab-Niroo, the ministry's hydro wing, securing sufficient foreign
loans and supplier credits.
The government already has permission from the majlis (parliament) to raise
up to Dollars 3bn in loans and credits to help provide for both Karun
plants, Siabisheh, and a 1,000MW extension to Karun-1.
While a consortium comprising ABB Kraftwerke, Voest and Sulzer has secured
the contract for the primary equipment orders for the Karun-3 hydro-electric
plant, Japanese companies are tipped to win the primary contracts for the
Karun-4 plant on the back of Japan's propensity to offer finance when others
are increasingly reluctant to do so. Japan is expected to confirm shortly
its decision to provide a Dollars 325m loan for Karun-4 through its official
development assistance (ODA) programme.
However, there is evidence that Iran may have trouble raising the necessary
funds for several of these megaprojects - possibly deferring commissioning
by years. US opposition to any further World Bank power sector loans is
compounded by Tehran's view that many of the Bank's conditions, such as
institutional reform and higher electricity tariffs, are unacceptable.
Nonetheless, a Dollars 165m loan to the Tehran Regional Electricity Company
(TREC) was approved by the Bank at the end of April to cover a range of
electrification projects including part of the upgrade of the Qom power
plant from open-cycle to combined-cycle.
Any significant borrowing difficulties could impact seriously on the
ministry's plans. 'Karun-3 is undoubtedly our top priority at this time',
says Mousa Refan, chairman and managing director of state-controlled
Ab-Niroo - also known as the Iran Water and Power Resources Development
Company (IPWC).
Large thermal plants will also play a significant role. Work has now started
on a Dollars 450m turnkey oil and gas-fired plant at Arak in the west of the
country. An international consortium comprising Canadian companies Babcock &amp;
Wilcox and Howden Group Canada, and Nuova Ciminmontubi (Italy) and GEC
Alsthom (UK-France) will be supplying the 2 x 550MW plant for commissioning
in 1996.
In the short term, however, orders will continue to be for simple gas
turbine and CCGT type stations such as Gilan (1,350MW) in the north, and
Shahid Montazer Ghaem (1,080MW) and Shahid Rajaei (1,080MW) near Karaj, west
of Tehran.
In March, Tavanir, the state utility responsible for all power generation
outside Tehran, took delivery of the last of 14 PG9001/E gas turbines
supplied under a Dollars 350m deal with John Brown Engineering of Scotland.
Rated 124MW each, the turbines are to be installed at the Shahid Rajaei,
Shiraz, and Shariati plants, where they will later be converted to combined
cycle operation.
Anglo-French power group GEC Alsthom also completed delivery of a similar
size order for the 14 complementary 125MW generators.
Siemens KWU of Germany has also thrived in Iran, securing contracts or
letters of intent for the Gilan and Tehran South (proposed 2,400MW)
stations, although past controversy may yet return to haunt the company in
the form of Iranian litigation over the incomplete 1,300MW nuclear station
at Bushehr, abandoned by KWU at the start of the Gulf war.
Through its Atomic Energy Organisation (AEO), the Iranian government has
already spent an estimated Dollars 3.6bn on the plant, now blocked by the
German government's refusal to grant export licences for crucial equipment.
This impasse was sorely tested towards the end of last year when the Qeshm
island Free Trade Authority, flagship of Iran's free market experiment,
signed a letter of agreement with Siemens for the finance and construction
of the first of four 250MW CCGT units. Under the terms of the agreement,
Siemens will invest some Dollars 340m into the project, which it will
continue to operate on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis.
If the government bows to AEO pressure to penalise Siemens, either through
trade sanctions or by intervening to block the Qeshm deal, it stands to lose
much of its credibility with potential foreign investors. Observers see the
most likely outcome to be some form of compensation whereby Iran recovers
some of its lost capital to reinvest in other programmes, while Germany
protects its position as Iran's premier trade nation.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (9): Doors opened to
foreign investment - China is aiming for an extra 100,000 megawatts in the
1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY

<TEXT>
China's energy planners are confident they will be able to add nearly
100,000MW of power generating capacity to the grid system by the end of the
decade.
They are counting on accelerated inputs from foreign private sector
investors to help achieve this ambitious target.
According to energy officials, a total of 12,000-15,000MW of new capacity
are being planned for each year for at least the next decade, the major
proportion destined for the rapidly industrialising regions in southern and
eastern China.
Large power stations are also planned at coalfields in the interior.
These will require a major extension of transmission lines to shift
electricity to the industrial centres. But this adjustment in the location
of some new installations will also ease the burden on China's overtaxed
rail coal haulage system and gradually minimise coal supply problems at
far-distant power stations.
The growth, if attained, will bring China's installed capacity to 265,000MW,
against the current level of approximately 165,000MW.
According to Han Ying, China's vice-minister for coal, the mix will continue
to be dominated by coal - some 70 per cent of China's power capacity is
coal-fired. Annual coal production is expected to rise to 1.4bn tonnes per
year by 2000 compared with 1.1bn tonnes last year.
The closing of inefficient pits and the commercialisation of the coal-mining
industry could lead to some new thermal projects using other fuel sources.
Most of the balance is derived from hydroelectric power - China has Asia's
biggest rivers - and preliminary work is already under way on the world's
largest hydroelectric project, the 17,000MW Three Gorges scheme on the Upper
Yangtse.
The China Yangtse Three Gorges Project Development Corp. is now organising
the bidding, which will be open to domestic and foreign contractors. First
power from the complex could be on line early in the next decade.
A third factor in the generating mix is nuclear. Later this year, the first
half of the 1,900MW Daya Bay nuclear power project in Guangdong Province
near Hong Kong will go on line, to be followed a year later by phase two.
The complex is being built by a consortium of the Anglo-French GEC-Alsthom,
and the French companies, Framatome, Electricite de France and Campenon
Bernard.
The Daya Bay complex is expected to be succeeded by another of similar size
in southeast China, to be built by foreign companies, which have not yet
been designated.
China's first power generating reactor, a 300MW unit, went on line at
Qinshan, near Shanghai, last year. The Qinshan plant is largely home-grown.
A second is planned as part of a programme to add five new reactors with
3,300MW of capacity to the system by the early 2000s. All will be built in
the northeast or the southeast.
The long lead times for nuclear and hydroelectric mean that there are
growing opportunities for non-coal thermal projects, not a significant
factor at present. For example, the ABB Group recently announced a 300MW
combined cycle contract on behalf of Hong Kong interests for a plant to be
set up in southern China. 'The average installation time for combined cycle
is 18-24 months, whereas coal stations, which normally are much larger, take
36-48 months to install,' an ABB official said.
Given China's 1.1bn population and a birth rate of 17m births a year,
analysts say the major challenge will be on funding infrastructure projects.
The central and regional power authorities have partially dealt with this by
throwing open their doors to foreign investment, not just minority holdings
in joint ventures but full ownership.
They appear to have accepted in principle the need to establish a commercial
approach to tariff rates, without which private sector involvement in the
growth programme will dry up.
Mr RT Fox, vice-chairman, Kleinwort Benson merchant bank, said in Beijing
recently that he was encouraged by China's flexibility. 'Ownership of a
power project can vary from 100 per cent Chinese to 100 per cent foreign;
the life the venture can be 10 years, 20 years or with no transfer date
foreseen. . .'
The private sector phenomenon stems from the success of Hong Kong's Hopewell
Group, which formed two build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects in southern
China, the long-completed 700MW Shajiao B scheme and the new 1,980MW Shajiao
C scheme, now under construction.
Under these, Hopewell and partners build the plant and sell electricity at
commercial rates to the local grid, turning the project back to Chinese
ownership after a decade or so of ownership. Since then, BOT and other
schemes with indefinite ownership for foreign companies have flourished.
In fast-growing Guangdong province, virtually all the 68,000MW of power
stations to be installed over the longer term could, it is suggested, have
some private sector involvement.
The International Finance Corp., the private sector wing of the World Bank,
has opened an office in Beijing. Sir William Ryrie, IFC vice-president, said
the institution would provide Dollars 600m to help finance projects with a
total cost of Dollars 3bn over the next three years. The Asian Development
Bank says China's concessional rate borrowings could be as much as Dollars
1bn per year.
The World Energy Council has cautioned against over-optimism, suggesting the
realistic tariffs hurdle still remained formidable.
As of last year, electricity shortages were about 20 per cent of prospective
demand. 'A total of 32 counties remain without electricity supply, but the
average electricity price paid by urban consumers is only about 3 cents per
kilowatt hour, well below the cost of production.'

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (7): Even a little
means a lot - US expansion should not be underrated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US market for power generating equipment tends to be ignored by the
media in all the excitement about Asian prospects, but even a modest growth
rate in percentage terms can provide a healthy business if built on a big
enough base.
The forecasts for the next decade by General Electric and Westinghouse, the
two dominant US suppliers, differ slightly in numerical terms but agree on a
key point - that the US remains an attractive market, worth at least Dollars
5bn a year for the next decade.
Westinghouse forecasts a peak power demand growth rate of 2.2 per cent over
the next decade, equating to total orders exceeding 141GW, more than 20 per
cent of the existing US generating base. Of this, about 15GW will be
replacing existing capacity.
The Orlando-based supplier says utility investments in existing capacity
will also help meet rising demand. By the end of the decade, says
Westinghouse, about 25 per cent of the installed thermal capacity in the US
will be more than 30 years old, and candidates for life extension,
modernisation, uprating and repowering programmes.
GE, based at Schenectady, forecasts total capacity additions of 105GW for
the US market over the same period from 1993-2002, and believes that
required resources will start to outpace committed resources shortly. The
forecast is almost double the 46GW which GE sees being added in Japan over
the same period, although it is surpassed by the 180GW predicted for the
Asia Pacific region.
It forecasts total US orders for power plant at 154GW for the decade, which
includes equipment that will not come into service until after 2002.
About 12-15 per cent of the market will be equipment for repowering existing
power stations, and the rest will be for greenfield sites or for additions
to existing sites, says Mr Del Williamson, vice-president for sales at GE
Industrial &amp; Power Systems.
GE's projections for the US assume a load growth of 2.5 per cent a year, a
20 per cent reserve margin - the gap between the utilities capacity and the
power load - 2GW of Canadian imports and 2GW of net retirements.
The national average of 2.5 per cent annual load growth, coupled with a
declining reserve margin, produces a forecast growth in capacity of 1.9 per
cent a year. The most important region by far is predicted to be the
south-east, where GE forecasts uncommitted needs of 30GW and total orders of
44GW.
Predictions for the types of power equipment to be sold also coincide
broadly, with combustion or gas turbines clearly dominant. Of GE's forecast
for 105GW of total capacity additions, 64GW is combined cycle, 25GW is gas
turbines, 12GW is steam turbines, 3GW will come from hydro-electricity and
renewables and just one GW from nuclear power.
Westinghouse's forecasts for the type of new power plants are shown in the
accompanying chart, which also shows graphically why combustion turbines are
predicted to take some two-thirds of the market.
Apart from the fact that gas has become the fuel of choice, combustion
turbines are particularly suited to the independent power producers which
want new capacity on stream fast, and which, it is predicted, will account
for more than 50 per cent of the power generation market. Almost all the IPP
orders are for baseload combined-cycle stations, says Mr Williamson.
Mr Frank Bakos, vice-president and general manager of Westinghouse's power
generation business unit, says the traditional utilities are also finding
combined cycle power attractive. And Mr Randy Zwirn, general manager of the
unit's power generation projects division, notes a trend for power producers
to start with a simple or open cycle combustion turbine, which can be
completed in a matter of months, and leave room for a subsequent conversion
to combined cycle.
Coal-fired generating equipment looks like accounting for no more than about
15 per cent of the US market over the next decade, but could become less
'traditional' in equipment terms as clean coal technologies such as
integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) take hold.
At present, says Mr Williamson, the extra capital cost and fuel prices are
restraining interest in IGCC.
The market for new nuclear plants, in contrast, is now firmly closed, but
there are signs that the door could be at least slightly ajar by the end of
the century.
Last month, Westinghouse and a group of 16 US utilities signed a contract to
invest Dollars 158m over the next five years in the detailed engineering
needed to build the Westinghouse AP600, a standardised 600MW pressurised
water reactor design.
The investment is supported by the US Department of Energy, and is important
not only for Westinghouse but as an indicator of an eventual future for new
nuclear plants in the US. GE won a similar competition for a large advanced
boiling water (ABW) design, but neither supplier is exactly holding its
breath for new business.
As with most countries that have a developed power equipment industry,
domestic producers dominate the market. That is not to say, however, that
the market is closed - it has historically been one of the most open.
Westinghouse and GE have about 70-75 per cent of the gas turbine market and
80 per cent of the steam turbine market. These figures have not changed much
in recent years but both ABB and Siemens are trying to expand their presence
in the US power equipment market.
ABB already has significant manufacturing facilities in the US and recent
successes include the boiler and other equipment for a Dollars 300m
coal-fired cogeneration project in Maryland and a Dollars 130m order from
two Kentucky utilities for six gas turbines.
Siemens is stepping up its interest in the US, which it sees as an important
growth market. By the end of the 1990s, it plans for 20 per cent of its
entire KWU business to be in the US - already, the US accounts for 20 per
cent of foreign business.
The German company has been spurred by factors including modernisation and
service life extension of thermal and hydroelectric plant, demand for new
thermal power plants, and topping and repowering of existing steam power
plants.
In particular, says Mr Hans Bohm, vice-president of Siemens and a member of
the KWU group executive management, 'we have stepped up our activity on the
gas turbine side.' Two years ago, Siemens bought A-C Equipment Services, the
former service division of Allis-Chalmers, in Milwaukee, where it is now
making gas turbines for the US and other markets that use the same 60 Hz
frequency.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (8): A controlled and
careful fightback - Profile: Westinghouse Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Westinghouse Electric name is one of the most famous in the power
equipment industry but is currently more likely to be associated with the
company's troubles in financial services or the seven-year legal wrangle
with the Philippines over the Bataan Peninsula nuclear plant.
Not for the first time, some of Westinghouse's competitors in the power
generating equipment industry have been trying to exploit the recent adverse
publicity by suggesting the US company's long-term commitment to the power
industry is in doubt.
That rankles with Mr Frank Bakos, vice-president and general manager of the
Westinghouse power generation business unit. 'Enough is enough,' he says.
'We are doing fine.'
Power generation is the biggest part of Westinghouse's power systems
business, which also includes the nuclear and process control businesses.
Overall, power systems has grown about 44 per cent in the past three years,
contributing 35 per cent or Dollars 2.9bn to Westinghouse's revenues last
year.
This achievement is a measure, in particular, of the transformation in the
fortunes of the power generation business, which had reached a low point by
1988, says Mr Bakos.
Over the previous three years, the business had been through considerable
management upheaval, and two wrenching closures of 'dinosaur' factories in
East Pittsburgh and Lester, Pennsylvania - each of them a massive 4m sq feet
in size. Crucially, though, Westinghouse had also withdrawn in 1986 from the
production of combustion turbines in the US.
However, as the combustion (ie gas) turbine market - for open cycle or
combined cycle application - pulled the industry out of its doldrums,
Westinghouse found itself 'in the right church, but the wrong pew,' as Mr
Bakos puts it.
What has happened in the past three years is a careful, controlled
fightback. At the core of the strategy has been the three-way alliance in
combustion turbines with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and FiatAvio
of Italy. Westinghouse, fortunately, had remained committed to designing gas
turbines throughout the period of non-production in the US.
The network allows the three companies to build turbines to the same design
in three locations, sharing development work and building on each other's
strengths and capabilities. This was one way in which Westinghouse was able
to produce its first US gas turbine again in 1991, only 17 months after
taking the important decision in 1989 to restart production.
Another crucial element, however, has been the manufacturing strategy. The
concept of a 'Great North American Factory,' where several plants work
together on a product by concentrating on their core competences, has come
into its own over the past three years.
Factories from Hamilton, Ontario to Charlotte, North Carolina and Pensacola,
Florida are involved in the production of combustion turbines, with no new
bricks or mortar required.
Building a new factory would have cost Dollars 120m-Dollars 150m, says Mr
Bakos, considerably more than has been spent on upgrading facilities.
Although Westinghouse cannot produce as many gas turbines as arch-rival
General Electric, it is cost-competitive even when producing only 24 a year,
he says.
The move southwards, away from the unionised plants of the north-east, to
plants such as Charlotte and Pensacola has clearly been a big benefit for
Westinghouse (as it has been, at GE). A flexible, non-union workforce has
been a big element in the all-important reduction of cycle times.
At the project level, too, the company is attempting to reduce lead times
from order to operation. Mr Randy Zwirn, general manager of the power
generation projects division, says the goal is 20 months for a combined
cycle plant - achieved by reducing the level of 'first time engineering' to
about 25 per cent of the project and raising the level of repeatability.
'That helps you drive the cost down,' he says.
Sales in the Orlando-based power generation business unit have grown from
Dollars 700m to Dollars 1.7bn in five years, and the business is becoming
increasingly international - 60 per cent of new plant orders last year were
non-US. In the world combustion turbine generator market, the three-way
alliance has moved from the number five position in 1987 to claim number two
spot last year with a 20 per cent share.
One of the biggest recent power contracts won by Westinghouse - in
consortium with Mitsubishi - was for Enron's 1725MW Teesside plant, the
largest combined cycle plant in Europe. Performance to date is 1,840MW, says
Westinghouse.
But smaller orders also bode well for the future. An example was a brace of
contracts announced in November and worth Dollars 80m in total, to supply
generating equipment to companies in Peru and Venezuela.
The turnround in the power generation business has changed the profile of
Westinghouse's power systems business. Power generation took over from the
nuclear business in 1991 as the biggest single element of power systems, but
the nuclear and process control segments, grouped together as energy
systems, has also had some notable successes recently.
The new plants side of the nuclear business is relatively quiet, but the
great advantage for Westinghouse is its unrivalled installed base of nuclear
plants which need regular servicing and support - 173 of the 400 plants
worldwide were either supplied by Westinghouse or based on its technology.
Along with its successful nuclear fuel business, this means that the nuclear
side can run profitably even without new orders, says Mr Nat Woodson,
vice-president and general manager of the energy systems business unit.
The process control division has also distinguished itself by building the
instrumentation and control system for the Sizewell B nuclear plant at
Suffolk - at short notice after a French supplier's contract was cancelled
in 1991.
Mrs Ann Pauley, general manager of the process control division, is
targetting Poland and Czechoslovakia as the likeliest east European
countries to be able to buy Westinghouse's sophisticated control systems -
for nuclear or conventional power plants. Already the business is doing
Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m a year of business in Poland.
In spite of these successes, however, the power generation business unit
seems likely to become an increasingly important part of Westinghouse power
systems. In this it will be helped by last year's multifaceted agreement
with Rolls-Royce. The UK company's aero-engine technology will be applied to
Westinghouse's next generation of large gas turbines, helping it maintain
its much improved position in increasingly competitive and global markets.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of the Philippines (10): A key role for Filipino
skills abroad - Earnings by overseas contract workers help to offset the
stagnation of the domestic economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STORY of how Mrs Pascuala Dastas, a Filipina domestic worker and
mother-of-three, met her death illustrates the cruel consequences of a
supposedly resource-rich economy that cannot provide enough jobs for its
people.
Mrs Dastas left her three sons in the Philippines to seek employment in Hong
Kong. She was killed in March while saving her five-year-old ward from a bus
accident. Her body was brought home to a heroine's welcome - and President
Fidel Ramos gave her a posthumous Bagong Bayani (new hero) award, handed out
annually to outstanding Filipino overseas contract workers at the Labour Day
celebrations.
The government long ago proclaimed OCWs as the nation's modern-day heroes
for their contribution to the economy. During its debilitating slowdown in
the mid-1980s, earnings sent home by OCWs eased the situation in many
Philippine communities.
Over the past two years, foreign exchange remittances have again partly
offset the stagnation of the domestic economy. This year, remittances are
projected to reach Dollars 2.5bn, making Filipino manpower the country's
leading export item.
From about 40,000 in 1975, the number of Filipino skilled and semi-skilled
workers winning employment contracts abroad has reached 680,000 a year. This
number does not include those who sneak away to find employment illegally.
There are now two million Filipinos legally employed as construction
workers, seamen, domestic helpers, hospital staff or nightclub entertainers
in many parts of the Middle East, Europe, east Asia including Japan, and the
US. Most of them earn up to five or six times what they would be paid in
similar jobs back home - if they could ever get one. According to the
Department of Labour and Employment, of the total 25.3m employable persons
in 1992, nearly 2.3m were out of a job. By January 1993, the unemployed
total had declined to 2.18m people.
However, even among the ranks of the locally employed, there remains a high
'under-employment' rate, which makes working overseas an attractive option
for many. But as the deployment of OCWs has increased, so has the range of
problems involving their relationships with their employers and with the
families they leave behind. Charges of physical abuse and non-payment of
correct wages are the most prominent.
This has put a strain on the staff of Philippine embassies abroad. In areas
with large number of Filipino OCWs, the country's diplomats have a hard time
coping with the social problems that arise, and are sometimes accused of
indifference.
At the same time, the Philippine foreign service has benefited from the OCW
movements. Where there are large concentrations of such workers, Philippine
embassies register large cash surpluses from fees related to the workers'
tenures. For instance, the embassy in Saudi Arabia, where there are an
estimated 250,000 Filipino workers, reportedly provides financial support
for the operations of 12 diplomatic posts in Europe.
Yet social workers are increasingly worried about the rising number of
inter-marriages among migrant workers and local nationals that lead to
broken homes and other problems. A recent case involved the death, from
hepatitis, of a Filipina who worked as a nightclub entertainer in Japan.
According to the police, the body of the victim bore torture marks that
indicated foul play.
Owing to the failure of Japanese authorities to give a credible account of
the death, there were calls in Manila for an end to the deployment of
Filipinas to entertain in Japan. Instead, the government imposed a 'partial'
ban: no Filipino aged below 23 is now allowed to work there as an
entertainer.
Japan, South Korea and other more advanced economies have cut industrial
costs by investing in factories in south-east Asia. Although the Philippines
has missed out on much of this investment wave, its officials are hoping
that some day - when the local economy starts generating enough jobs to
absorb the 800,000 people who join the labour force annually - the OCWs
could return home and bolster the quality of technical skills for the
expected industrial boom.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of the Philippines (9): Protection for a final
frontier - Victor Mallet visits the island of Palawan, an environmental
test-case for south-east Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGN at the 'Bottleground' bar on Rizal Avenue, boasts: 'Hot Women Plus
Cold Beer.'
With its brothels and Roman Catholic churches, there is not much at first
glance to distinguish Puerto Princesa, the capital of the island province of
Palawan, from any other town in the Philippines.
A typical family owns an old videotape of the wedding of Britain's Prince
Charles to Lady Diana Spencer, and has eight children. Seven masses are
celebrated each Sunday at the Immaculate Conception cathedral, to
accommodate the growing number of inhabitants.
Religion even penetrates the underground river, Palawan's main tourist
attraction - 'see this stalactite - it is like the Virgin Mary,' declares
the boatman to his sceptical passengers. 'And this one' - he points at
another apparently shapeless rock - 'is like the Holy Family.'
In one very important sense, however, Palawan is different. Elsewhere in the
Philippines almost all the tropical forest has been destroyed, but about
half of this long, thin mountainous island south-west of Manila is still
covered with trees.
Elsewhere, coral reefs have been dynamited into oblivion, but in the waters
around Palawan much of the coral and other forms of marine life have
survived, making the area a paradise for divers and the source of two thirds
of the fish for the national capital, Metro Manila.
Palawan has become a test case, not just for the Philippines but for
south-east Asia as a whole: is it possible to preserve some of the region's
beauty and natural resources for future generations, or must everything be
destroyed to make room for an increasing population and for the traffic jams
which accompany the phenomenon known as 'economic development'?
'Palawan, our last frontier: make it last. Stop illegal fishing,' declares
the roadside billboard in Puerto Princesa. Another billboard shows the
diminishing size of fish caught over the past 20 years, and urges fishermen
to stop using cyanide, which does not discriminate between baby and mature
fish and therefore needlessly decimates fish populations.
The presence of the billboards is both bad news and good news. The bad news
is that the battle to save Palawan's resources for the future is an uphill
struggle; the good news is that a few members of the central and local
governments are starting to take the matter seriously.
The very fact that Palawan is relatively undamaged - and undisturbed by
separatist or communist rebels - makes the island a favoured destination
both for poor migrants from other parts of the Philippines and for foreign
tourists. Migrants follow the logging companies' bulldozers to clear
farmland for rice, cashew nuts or coconuts, and the tourists come to find
the tranquillity now lost in much of the rest of south-east Asia.
Palawan also has oil offshore and nickel deposits in the south, but the
financial benefits - even when they come to the island rather than to the
central government or to big business - are clouded by the inevitable
disadvantages.
The island's population has doubled to about 600,000 in the past decade, and
Puerto Princesa is starting to smell of the diesel smoke and motor-cycle
fumes generated by trucks and tricycle taxis; one of the nickel companies is
being accused of polluting a river with laterite waste; there are fears that
the gold prospectors, who have recently rushed to the north of the island,
will poison fresh water with the mercury they use to separate their gold
from sand; and there are increasing signs that deforestation is causing the
erosion of land, silting of rivers, and fresh-water shortages which have
plagued other islands in the Philippines.
A moratorium on commercial logging in Palawan was imposed last year, and
more recently the authorities banned the transport of live fish which had
been exported from the island to aquariums and to Chinese restaurants.
Enforcement of environmental regulations, however, is hard - 'it's very
difficult,' says Mr Felipe Ortiz, the chief of forest management at the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in Puerto Princesa.
'There are many people in the city - and it's still a developing city.
There's really a need for lumber.'
Furthermore, big businessmen backed by private armies are still keen to
export logs in defiance of the official ban. Court cases filed against those
who violate timber laws are sometimes mysteriously dismissed, local
officials say.
But the election of a new mayor and a more enlightened local government for
the capital Puerto Princesa in May last year has given a boost to Palawan's
environmental campaigners.
'Before, they (the old officials) made lots of speeches about conservation,
but meanwhile their people were out cutting trees,' says Mr Ortiz.
In 1991, 14 members of Haribon Palawan, the island's main environmental
group, were charged with subversion and harassment, although the charges
were eventually dropped. Now, Haribon workers carry walkie-talkies provided
by the local authorities so the two sides can work as a team.
The resounding defeat of Mr Ramon Mitra, the former speaker of the
Philippine House of Representatives, in last year's presidential election,
is also a bonus for the environmentalists, since he was regarded as the
political patron of Mr Jose Alvarez, a businessman from outside the island
who has taken a leading role in the logging industry in Palawan.
Palawan's new mood of co-operation between the local authorities,
environmentalists and inhabitants was underlined at a recent ceremony in the
district of Tagabinet attended by Haribon representatives and local
officials.
Twenty-two members of the Batak and Tagbanua tribes were awarded
'stewardship certificates', giving them the right (under a national plan to
control upland cultivation) to occupy and farm their land near the St Paul's
national park. Previously they were regarded as illegal settlers. In
exchange they must undertake not to expand their clearing by cutting down
forest trees. Mr Mil Reynoso, the vice-mayor of Puerto Princesa, said too
much deforestation would turn the country into a desert like Iraq - 'it
affects the personality of the people there,' he said. 'They are so hard.'
It is by no means certain that the farmers fully understand their
obligations under the scheme - one drunken smallholder immediately asked
whether it was all right if he chopped down a protected species of tree
because it was good for building houses - but at least a start has been made
in winning the support of the inhabitants of Palawan for efforts to preserve
the island's resources.
Mr Joselito Alisuag, the activist lawyer who heads Haribon Palawan, is
relieved that he finally has a few allies in the city hall. 'We used to
fight everyone,' he says as he fingers his walkie-talkie. 'Now we've got
friends.'

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (6): Renewed interest -
A more efficient use of steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE development of gas turbine technology may have taken most of the
limelight in recent years, but it would be wrong to give the impression that
steam turbines, the stalwarts of power generation for a century, are being
ignored.
Inevitably, technology is developing faster in the much younger gas turbine
sector, but recently the pace of change in steam turbines has been
accelerating.
Part of the reason is that steam turbines are an integral part of combined
cycle power generation, and must therefore play their part in increasing the
overall efficiency of the system - which is one of its key selling points.
But, across the world, there is also renewed interest in getting greater
thermal efficiency and economy from new coal-fired plants, which require
steam turbines that run hotter, and at greater pressures.
A third task for which significant technological advancement has been
achieved is turbine modernisation for existing coal-fired and nuclear power
plants, notes Siemens.
In contrast to the rivalry in the gas turbine market, where it is possible
to identify clear leaders, the steam turbine market has many more players,
and there is no obvious technology leader. 'It's a very close race,' says Mr
Hans Levander, senior vice-president for technology at Asea Brown Boveri's
power plants business.
Along with European and US producers, all of which are working along much
the same lines, the Japanese have also been active. One of the most
sophisticated designs, for a 700MW double reheat turbine powered by
'supercritical' steam, was developed by three scientists at Toshiba and won
an award in 1991 from the UK's Institution of Mechanical Engineers.
The reason for the activity is simple. 'If the competition can produce a 1
per cent better heat rate, you won't get the order,' says Mr Michael
Barrett, managing director of GEC Alsthom's large steam turbines division.
'That applies to coal-fired generation and combined cycle.'
There are two broad types of steam turbine, impulse and reaction turbines,
which differ in the way that the blades interact with the steam flow. GE,
GEC Alsthom, Toshiba and Hitachi produce the impulse type while ABB, Siemens
Westinghouse and Mitsubishi have opted for reaction turbines.
Proponents of each type tend to say theirs is better, says Mr Barrett, but
the fact remains that both types have survived, and each is capable of
further development.
The key challenge for steam turbine technologists is to increase thermal
efficiency without sacrificing reliability, flexibility or environmental
performance. All these factors - and in particular the emissions performance
 -depend on the choice of boiler too, of course.
Increasing the 'cycle efficiency' of the turbine is a question of raising
steam pressures and temperatures at the inlet of the machine, to get more
work out of the series of turbines and increase the torque of the turbine
rotor (this turns the rotor in the generator to produce the power).
A typical European steam turbine of the 1970s and 1980s would have an inlet
pressure of 165 bar and a temperature of 5650C. Mr Levander says there is
renewed interest in steam turbines over 5800C with reheat and double reheat
of the steam via return trips to the boiler. GEC Alsthom this month won
contracts for steam turbines at two Danish power stations which will operate
at 285 bar and 5800C, and there are other designs where the temperature is
nearing 6000C, says Mr Barrett.
The steam is said to be 'supercritical' above pressures of 221.2bar and
temperatures of 5400C and higher. Beyond this threshold, the transition from
water to steam is continuous and the steam becomes a much more efficient
carrier of heat.
The effect of such developments is to increase the thermal efficiency - the
amount of energy produced per unit of fuel burnt - from the high 30s to the
mid40s in percentage terms. Claims of 46 or 47 per cent efficiency are being
made for some stations in Denmark.
In the US, GE has developed what it calls an ultrasupercritical steam
turbine, suitable for conditions of 300 bar and about 5950C, as part of a
project funded by the Electric Power Research Institute. According to GE,
the design, in conjunction with an advanced boiler design, can deliver
higher efficiency and reduced emissions per KW produced than turbines and
plants employing conventional subcritical and supercritical steam cycles.
These temperatures may look puny compared with the 1200-13000C of gas
turbines, but the technologies are completely different - although there are
some spin-offs for steam turbines from aero-derived developments in gas
turbine design.
For steam turbines, achieving the higher efficiencies available in theory
from supercritical conditions has several implications in practical terms.
Advanced steel materials are needed for casings, rotors and buckets due to
the high pressure and temperature requirements, says GE. Erosion is a big
problem in steam turbines, so new steam path coatings with improved adhesion
and solid particle erosion resistance have been developed.
Mr Levander says ferritic steels have now been developed which can cope with
the higher temperatures, avoiding the extra cost and some technical problems
associated with austenitic steels. The next phase of materials development
will see a concentration on sophisticated steel alloys with 9 or 12 per cent
chrome, says Mr Raymond Lawrence, engineering and operations director at
Parsons Turbine Generators.
Blade design is also crucial to better overall performance. Improved
computational methods, measuring techniques and manufacturing technology are
contributing to the introduction of advanced three-dimensional blading, says
Mr Levander. Similarly, says GE, the aerodynamics of other components such
as valves, inlets and exhaust hoods have been improved, due to advances in
computational fluid dynamic (CFD) computer codes.
Additionally, says Mr Barrett, turbine clearances (the gap between the tip
of the blades and the casing) have been made much tighter to reduce steam
leakage, and sealings have been improved.
A second very important trend in steam turbines is towards reduced size of
the overall machine, thus lowering the cost for the utility and the space
required to site the turbine. A typical 500MW steam turbine in use in the UK
might have one high-pressure turbine casing, one intermediate and three low
pressure casings, but modern designs make it possible to have a combined
high/intermediate turbine and a single low-pressure section, says Mr
Barrett.
A number of producers point out the significance for this trend of the
ability to make longer blades or buckets for the last (low-pressure) stage
of the turbines - due to new manufacturing methods and materials, especially
titanium. Longer blades have the effect of increasing the exhaust area, and
thus removing the need for two low-pressure stages. Titanium blades and
buckets up to 1360mm are available, such as the last-stage buckets on GE's
steam turbines for a Tokyo Electric Power nuclear plant.
For larger turbines, this trend means that turbines which were previously
configured as three-casing machines with four steam flows can now be
configured as two casing, double flow machines, says GE. Similarly, the
output of the smaller single flow, single-casing units has been increased.
All these trends have an impact on the repowering market as well as that for
new equipment. Siemens cites the example of its replacement of the
low-pressure steam turbine in the 1300MW Unterweser nuclear power station
near Bremen, increasing output by more than 50MW at constant thermal power
of the reactor.
The plant's total efficiency was increased from 35 per cent to 36.5 per cent
through the addition of one blade row per flow, advanced blade profiles for
all stages, and the optimisation of the exhaust flow conditions.
All the producers believe there are further opportunities for improving the
efficiency of steam turbines - Mr Barrett says the technology has yet to
reach the point of diminishing returns.
The next few years seem likely to see a continuation of the present focus on
improved efficiency and compactness (or power density as it is known). 'It
is hard to come up with a quantum leap on the steam side,' says Mr Del
Williamson at GE.
Steam turbines will, therefore, make some contribution to one of the biggest
technological challenges for the power equipment industry - further
improving the thermal efficiency of combined cycle power which is currently
hovering at about 55 per cent.
Efficiency gains could come either from the gas turbine or the steam
turbine, says Mr Williamson. Competitors agree, although the majority feel
that, as befits a less mature technology, the efficiency of gas turbines
will probably rise faster.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of the Philippines (7): Exchanges resist a full
merger - Stock market euphoria has faded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS ONE of the best performers in recent years among the world's emerging
markets, the Philippine stock market has been receiving increasing attention
from global investors.
In 1992, the Manila Stock Exchange (MSE) composite index closed the year 9.1
per cent higher, a growth which was, however, substantially slower than the
77 per cent recorded the year before.
The euphoria in the weeks that followed the election of President Fidel
Ramos, in May last year, which pushed the index to a historical high of
1,580 points, has given way to a cautious optimism, especially since it
became clear in October that existing electric power generating capacity may
not be sufficient to support economic growth targets.
This year, most analysts expect the market to approximate last year's
performance, with much of the growth in the second half.
In April, after the signing by Mr Ramos of an 'emergency powers' bill that
enables him to attack the power problem more decisively, the index level
broke the record established in mid-1992.
However, foreign investors are by no means tripping over each other in their
efforts to put money into the country's two operating stock exchanges, the
66-year-old MSE and the Makati Stock Exchange (MKSE), which was established
in 1963 by a splinter group disenchanted at the time by the domination of
Chinese-Filipino interests in the older bourse. The Philippine market,
despite its strong performance since 1990, has also been viewed as a
volatile one. Furthermore, certain fundamental reforms are felt necessary to
ensure investors of a level playing-field.
The two exchanges trade the same set of stocks, often at different prices,
and give the impression - according to the watchdog Securites and Exchange
Commission (SEC) - of price manipulation, especially since arbitrage is
allowed.
The SEC has vigorously pushed for a merger of the two exchanges, but leaders
of each detest the idea of being absorbed by the other. The proposal has
been amended to a 'functional unification', which member-brokers of the two
approved overwhelmingly at a historic meeting last March. However, a key
issue at the same meeting, the selection of the head office for the unified
exchange, had remained unresolved owing to a fierce contest between two
property firms, both regarded as giants in the local real estate market.
The MSE is currently housed in Tektite Towers, owned by Philippine Realty
and Holdings, which is located in the rapidly developing Ortigas Centre,
where the Asian Development Bank has put up its new headquarters.
ON the other hand, the MKSE has its own building on Ayala Avenue, in
Makati's financial district. It was established by Ayala Corporation, the
oldest business conglomerate in the Philippines, which is controlled by the
Zobel family.
The debate has simmered down a bit since mid-April, with a move to declare
both present locations as head offices, which will be linked up by a
computerised system starting this July if no further delays are encountered.
Amid this acrimony, the two exchanges accounted for combined turnover of
154.5bn pesos (Dollars 5.8bn) in 1992, almost double the level in 1991.
Analysts forecast that turnover will expand by a third this year.
While the composite index reflects price movements of a dozen stocks from
the market's three sections, six stocks already account for over 60 per cent
of the market capitalisation of 390bn pesos.
It is scarcely surprising that trading is often concentrated on these six
firms: Philippine Long Distance Telephone, San Miguel Corporation, Ayala
Corporation, Ayala Land, Philippine National Bank, and Manila Electric
Company.
The Philippine stock market is also more sensitive to movements in interest
rates and the peso-dollar exchange rate than to other macroeconomic figures.
For instance, with the expected further decline in domestic interest rates,
mirroring the downtrend in Treasury bill yields, investor interest in stocks
should grow over the next few months.
During the two-tiered exchange-rate era of the mid-1980s, which was
characterised by volatile peso-dollar rates on the black market, speculative
money was siphoned away from the stock exchanges, resulting in lean
turnovers.
These days, with the exchange rate showing fundamental stability, funds are
more partial to stocks.
The market at the end of 1992 was trading at a price/earnings multiple of
about 15, from which level there has been not much change. This rating is
considered competitive among the region's stock markets.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of the Philippines (8): Magnet for new investments -
Subic Bay special economic and freeport zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN when it was under US navy jurisdiction because of a treaty with the
Philippine government, Subic Bay was highly regarded for its strategic
location in the Asia-Pacific region.
The former military base served as a jump-off point for American operations
in Vietnam during the 1960s and in the Gulf War of 1991.
Now being converted into an industrial estate after the withdrawal of the
last of the US forces in November 1992, Subic Bay is attracting business
groups that require a well-equipped base to expand their activities in the
region.
More than 2,500 companies, according to the ebullient Mr Richard Gordon,
chairman and administrator of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, have
offered to locate operations in the area, now known officially as the Subic
Bay special economic and freeport zone.
Among these businesses are four big international conglomerates, each of
which expressed interest in taking over and running the whole zone. The
SBMA, which is overseeing the conversion, turned down these proposals and
opted instead to undertake the development itself.
Subic Bay 'will be the magnet for new investments' into the Philippines, Mr
Gordon told the Financial Times. 'We are building an economic zone that can
compete with other, similar projects in the region.'
TAIWANESE investors, as a group, are among the most enthusiastic in setting
up shop in Subic Bay. A 300-hectare area is being developed into an export
processing zone for Taiwan companies. The Taipei government has pledged a
Dollars 20m loan to the SBMA to help develop that area.
Having been the US navy's largest military base overseas, Subic boasts a
variety of top-class facilities that can readily accommodate investors. Its
recreational areas, including an 18-hole golf course, are also certain to
attract tourists.
The 6,000-hectare facility sits between a deep natural harbour on the west
opening up to the South China Sea and a mountain range on the other side,
which makes it an ideal anchorage. The surrounding hills are regarded as
protective barriers to any further lahar (volcanic debris) flows from Mount
Pinatubo which is located north-east of Olongapo.
Existing infrastructure facilities include an airport, shipping berths and a
well-maintained road network, as well as utilities (electric power plant,
telecommunications, water and sewerage systems) and structures that can be
used as warehouses, offices, hotels and medical centres. These make the zone
attractive for businesses desiring an early start-up.
A 123-hectare petroleum, oil and lubricants depot has only recently been
leased for Dollars 100m to Coastal Petroleum, the 10th largest
petroleum-refining company in the US. The lease covers a 25-year period.
The depot has 68 individual storage tanks with a combined holding capacity
of 2.4m barrels, and an 844ft pier capable of servicing two 60-80,000
deadweight tonne vessels simultaneously.
Mr James Paul, president and chief executive officer of Coastal, was
recently in Manila to sign the contract with the SBMA. He said its Subic
facility 'has effectively and strategically positioned (Coastal) to supply
gasoline, gasoil, jet and bunker fuel to the Pacific Rim,' which he
described as 'the world's fastest-growing petroleum consumer.'
That is the type of investment that the Subic zone wants to capture. An
official in the SBMA's corporate planning office said the objective is 'to
prove that the Philippines can absorb foreign investments efficiently and
quickly.'
Subic Bay is likely to establish precedents that could benefit other
industrial estates in the country.
In the planned industrial corridor south of Metro Manila, private groups in
the five provinces known collectively as 'Calabarzon' (coined from the first
syllables of the provinces' names) are converting farmlands into industrial
enclaves where investors may put up factories.
Unlike Subic's network of advanced infrastructure facilities, these
Calabarzon estates are still being modernised.
As an incentive to investors, enterprises operating at the Subic Bay
freeport zone are exempt from all national and local government taxes, and
have only to pay a 5 per cent final tax on gross income. Currently, however,
both the freeport zone and Olongapo's downtown are virtual 'ghost towns' as
the transition from a boisterous 'good time' city into an envisioned
industrialising economy proceeds at a slow pace.
While some companies are eager to come in, Mr Gordon speaks of the need to
'make haste slowly'. A master plan for the development of the zone, funded
by the World Bank, covers only the former naval base itself. 'We cannot go
beyond what is in the master plan.'
A factor that has to be taken into consideration is that the area was
originally configured not as an economic zone but for military operations.
The SBMA plans shortly to lease housing units for executives - 'we can use
the income for the construction of housing for the workers,' says Mr Gordon.
BY this July, the first of the nearly 700 light and medium-sized industrial
enterprises that are likely to be set up in the area reserved for Taiwanese
investors, could be operational. Eventually, these enterprises could employ
over 160,000 people.
The new jobs should enable the Olongapo economy, which in the past was
mainly dependent on transient US servicemen, to perk up.
'You will have to devise other businesses when the new occupants of Subic
come over,' Mr Gordon warned Olongapo market vendors and small entrepreneurs
recently. 'If, in the past, you thought you've earned enough by swinging a
sale with a drunken sailor, this time you will have to make your products
and services truly competitive.'
On the side of a hill fronting Olongapo's main road, huge letters are
planted, Hollywood-style, with this exhortation: 'Aim high, Olongapo.'
Subic Bay freeport zone will have to take off before the people of Olongapo
can heed the message.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of the Philippines (6): Support grows for 'steady
Eddie' - President Fidel Ramos is winning new allies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIVING UP to his nickname of 'Steady Eddie,' President Fidel Ramos has
advanced gradually but firmly on two fronts in an attempt to bring political
stability to a notoriously unstable country and to consolidate his own
authority following his election victory in May last year.
In September, he established the National Unification Commission, an
advisory body with the task of mediating between the government and various
rebel groups - including communists, right-wing military rebels and Moslem
separatists - and with devising an effective peace process.
Mr Ramos has also won enough allies in Congress to ensure that the
legislature does not block him at every turn in the day-to-day running of
the Philippines. He has thus avoided so far the governmental paralysis which
afflicted his predecessor, Mrs Corazon Aquino.
The president made an inspired choice in naming Ms Haydee Yorac to chair the
NUC. A lawyer with liberal credentials, she won respect as an incorruptible
election supervisor for Comelec, the election commission, and is acceptable
both to the establishment and to left-wing guerrillas, some of whom were her
clients.
Both Ms Yorac and the government regard the military rebels as the most
immediate threat to the security and stability of the Philippines.
The rebels did, after all, stage seven coup attempts against Mrs Aquino; Mr
Ramos, as her armed forces chief, was obliged to protect her.
Negotiations between the government and the rebels have already begun, and
Colonel Gregorio 'Gringo' Honasan, the charismatic officer regarded as the
most influential of their leaders, is seen regularly in Metro Manila, either
in restaurants or attending peace talks.
The assumption is that the rebels will be granted an amnesty and will in
exchange disband their forces and give up their weapons - 'I'm pretty
confident that maybe within the year we will have a settlement,' says Ms
Yorac.
MEANWHILE, the communist threat has been sharply reduced by its
international decline as a popular ideology. According to official estimates
the number of partisans under arms in the Philippines has fallen from a peak
of about 25,000 in the mid-1980s to a third of that number - 'in terms of
being able to overthrow the government, it's not forthcoming in the next 100
years,' says Ms Yorac.
The communist party is racked by internal strife and is heavily infiltrated
by military intelligence agents. Divisions have been deepened by Mr Ramos's
decision to rescind a ban on membership of the party; communists are being
urged to abandon the armed struggle and to campaign legally in Philippine
elections.
In spite of the weakness of the communists, the government is anxious to
conclude a formal peace agreement because officials are finding it
increasingly difficult to distinguish between political rebels and armed
gangs; a deal would leave the bandits out in the cold and allow the
government to tackle them as common criminals.
The Red Scorpion crime and kidnapping gang, for example, is led by former
communist rebels, according to the government. In March, Vice-president
Joseph Estrada, the ex-film star who heads the Presidential Anti-Crime
Commission, was in a group of officials attacked with guns and grenades
south of Manila as they investigated the death of a tax officer thought to
have been murdered by the Red Scorpions.
No-one was killed, but Mr Estrada blamed supporters of Leopoldo Mabilangan,
a former communist commander known as 'Comrade Hector,' for the attack. Mr
Estrada has accused Mr Mabilangan, who recently surrendered, of taking part
in kidnapping jobs for the Red Scorpions.
The government and the leadership of the communist party have been haggling
about the venue for a proposed second round of talks, and a meeting in Hong
Kong is being considered. The atmosphere has not been improved by a
statement from Mr Jose Maria Sison, party chairman, who accused the NUC of
being 'a propaganda instrument of the US-Ramos regime'.
Organising negotiations with rebels of the Philippines' Moslem minority is
likely to be equally difficult. Again, it is hard to distinguish between
political activity and crime in the lawless southern provinces where the
Moslems are strongest, and again the Moslem movement is divided.
The Moro National Liberation Front, whose leader, Mr Nur Misuari, is based
in Tripoli, Libya, does not want to negotiate with the government at the
same time as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the more
religiously-inclined faction which broke away from the MNLF 17 years ago.
Behind the various rebellions in the Philippines lies a widespread
perception that the political system - even after the 1986 downfall of the
late dictator Ferdinand Marcos - is unjust and favours the wealthy,
influential families which have long dominated both business and politics.
The NUC is also trying to tackle this problem and has hosted 'public
consultations' in most of the country's 76 provinces.
Ms Yorac says she is urging disaffected Filipinos to air their grievances
constitutionally rather than militarily. She reminds people that there are
legal ways for the public to sack corrupt or incompetent officials, and that
they can press for reforms suggested by the post-Marcos 1987 constitution;
this, for instance, directs Congress to legislate against political
dynasties, something it has so far failed to do.
It would be over-ambitious, however, to expect the political patronage
system in the Philippines to transform itself overnight into a model
democracy.
Mr Ramos, who was competing against seven rivals, won a mere 23 per cent of
the vote in the presidential poll and his Lakas party fared poorly in
congressional and local elections. He has therefore not flinched from making
alliances with power-brokers to consolidate his position.
He co-opted (or, say the cynics, was co-opted by) Mr Jose de Venecia, a
political organiser for Marcos who is now speaker of the House of
Representatives. The result was a 'rainbow coalition' of support for Mr
Ramos, a euphemism meaning that many congressmen defected from the once
dominant Laban party and from Mr Eduardo Cojuangco's party and gravitated
towards the presidency and its powers: the whole House comes up for
re-election in 1995, three years before Mr Ramos's term expires.
The Senate meanwhile replaced Mr Neptali Gonzales as its president with the
more amenable Mr Edgardo Angara. Mr Ramos's amicable relations with Congress
allowed him in March to win emergency powers to deal with electricity
shortages - 'you have to credit Ramos with the political ability to get the
legislature behind him,' says one leading foreign businessman.
President Ramos also felt obliged to seek popular legitimacy after his
narrow election victory by touring the country to attend numerous rallies, a
tactic some describe as a 'post-election election campaign'.
If the opinion polls are anything to go by, the president is doing fine. Not
only do they suggest that 60 per cent of Filipinos approve of his
performance, they also show that 46 per cent claim to have voted for him in
the election - double the actual figure.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (5): Things are
improving - Profile: Rolls-Royce Power Engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be easy to conclude from a tour round the Parsons steam turbine
factory at Heaton in Newcastle that one of the most illustrious names in the
UK's rich history of heavy engineering triumphs is down on its luck.
The factory is ticking over on a low level of activity, and some of the
massive machine tools capable of handling a 300-tonne workpiece are being
used on work for outside customers - now that the UK market for large
coal-fired steam turbines has dried up.
Parsons and its parent company, the recently renamed Rolls-Royce Power
Engineering, have, indeed, just been through a rough patch. Overall
employment has fallen about 40 per cent in 10 years, while Parsons'
workforce has been halved to 2,500 since 1985.
This is partly a reflection of the rationalisation of capacity throughout
the power equipment industry, and especially in the European steam turbine
business. But Parsons in particular was also badly hit by the Iraqi trade
embargo, causing the cancellation of its Pounds 70m Al Shemal contract and
the loss of 650 jobs. Bits of equipment for the order still languish at
Heaton.
Fortunately, Parsons' factory will soon be humming once again, as
manufacturing begins in earnest on two orders now in the design stage. Last
year Parsons won a Pounds 70m contract from Calcutta Electric for two 250MW
steam turbine generators to be installed at the new coal-fired Budge Budge
power station.
Parsons also secured an order worth Pounds 100m to supply three 250MW steam
turbine generators for Stage 3 of the Pulau Seraya power station in
Singapore. Having built Stage 1 and then lost out to Japanese competition
for Stage 3, the new order is the pay-off for all Parsons' recent efforts to
improve its competitiveness.
More orders are being chased, but meanwhile Mr Richard Maudslay, managing
director of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, can claim that the power
generation business is 'quite well loaded: much better than 12 months ago'.
At Parsons, Mr Trevor Murch, managing director says: 'We have turned from a
situation of some gloom and pessimism to one where we can continue building
on these recent successes.' Over the next few months Parsons will even be
recruiting some 300 new manufacturing workers.
R-R PE can trace its history back to Sir Charles Parsons, the inventor of
steam turbines, and more recently has been at the centre of the
restructuring of UK heavy engineering. A merger in 1977 brought together
Reyrolle Parsons (turbine generators, transformers, switchgear and control
systems) and Clarke Chapman (boilers, water treatment plant, fossil and
nuclear fuel handling systems) to form Northern Engineering Industries. NEI
was itself bought by Rolls-Royce for Pounds 300m in 1989 in a move designed
to protect the aero-engine group from the vagaries of the aerospace market.
Subsequently, a deal with Asea Brown Boveri saw the creation of a UK joint
venture, NEI ABB Gas Turbines. This allowed NEI to participate in the UK
combined-cycle market, as it lacked a range of heavy-duty gas turbines.
Then last year, Rolls-Royce and Westinghouse Electric announced an alliance
covering technology transfer and marketing collaboration that is of
far-reaching significance for both companies. And in February, some big
changes were made to the corporate identity of companies within the
Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group.
NEI's business is now conducted in the name of Rolls-Royce Power
Engineering, and the NEI prefix has been removed from companies with
historic names such as Parsons, Reyrolle, Peebles and Clarke Chapman. 'There
were too many names,' says Mr Maudslay.
Changes at R-R PE go a long way beyond the name. Over the past five years,
the company has worked hard at rectifying problems which were reducing its
competitiveness, especially in turnkey work.
Mr Maudslay is frank about the errors of the past. Up to the mid-1980s, he
says, the company lacked the management skills to bring in a project on time
and on-budget. 'A tremendous amount of time and effort has been spent
correcting that,' he says.
He contrasts the company's performance on the Rihand power station project
in India, where it made the mistake of signing the contract before the
technical specification was clearly agreed, to its recent work converting
the open-cycle gas-turbine Connaught Bridge power station in Malaysia to
combined cycle operation. The Pounds 70m turnkey programme won by Parsons,
was finished on time and on budget, and also brought work to other companies
within R-R's Industrial Power Group.
On the manufacturing side, the rationalisation included closure of the
Parsons plant at Long Benton and a change in the make-or-buy policy to
increase outsourcing of less critical components.
At Parsons, some Pounds 70m was invested in the 1980s on manufacturing
technology, and the rate is being maintained this decade, says Mr Murch. A
new approach to manufacturing organisation, which Parsons calls 'systems
engineering' has had a big impact on productivity.
Having slimmed down to what Mr Maudslay calls an 'essential core,' R-R PE
now has a stable base from which it can provide integrated solutions to
customers. As long as it was concentrating internally on reducing its
capacity, it tended to take a piecemeal approach to winning orders - the
same customer would be visited separately by Parsons, Reyrolle etc.
Mr Maudslay sees the overall strategy for R-R PE to be to select the market
areas and product ranges where it can play to its strengths.
In power generation this means building on its successful record in what
have conventionally been called medium-sized steam turbines - 250-500MW -
but which are now very much the standard size used in combined cycle power
generation.
Its regional priorities are the Middle East, India and the Far East. These
are the areas with the strongest growth, says Mr Maudslay. The trend towards
private power in India and several fast-growing markets in Asia increases
the chances of countries' power ambitions being realised, and, via
Rolls-Royce &amp; Partners Finance, Mr Maudslay is prepared to take equity
stakes in projects. 'But I don't see us taking a major share in a major
project,' he cautions.
Looking ahead, Mr Maudslay attaches considerable importance to the tie-up
with Westinghouse. The attraction he says, is the big mutual interest in a
deal for both companies. Westinghouse gets aero-engine derivative technology
for its gas turbines, while Rolls-Royce gets access to Westinghouse's heavy
duty gas turbine range.
The companies will work together on marketing, with either leading a bid
depending on each other's market strengths. Co-operation in steam turbine
technology development has already begun - 'it did not make sense for each
to develop its own products,' he says.
The agreement with Westinghouse excludes the UK because of the NEI-ABB joint
venture, but this looks to be declining in importance for R-R PE overall,
perhaps because it lacks the necessary element of mutual interest. Even in
the UK, its prospects look uncertain as the market for gas turbines turns
cooler.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (4): A determination to
catch up - Eastern Germany is a huge, if sluggish, market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The noise is deafening. The mammoth turbine hall is 600 metres long and 42
metres wide, big enough to accommodate a total of 12 210MW units.
Together with two 500MW units installed in 1980, eastern Germany's Boxberg
plant was for years the largest lignite-fired power station in Europe.
Today, it offers some of the largest contracts in continental Europe for
power generating equipment.
Boxberg, built with Soviet-designed turbosets in the lignite strip-mining
fields of eastern Germany, needs extensive refurbishing and plans are
underway for two new 800MW plants. The whole project is expected to cost
DM5bn-6bn.
While western Germany's power generating capacity is expected to remain
relatively stable over the next few years, the restructuring needs of the
ageing power industry in the east has opened an important market for
suppliers of generating equipment.
Some 30 per cent of eastern Germany's power stations are due to be closed by
mid-1996 as refurbishing is too costly. Moreover, the sharp decline in
energy consumption, caused by the economic slow-down and the energy waste
which characterised the old regime, makes a large portion of the 22,000MW
existing capacity superfluous. Instead, the power plants, which are mostly
small 200MW Russian types, will be replaced by large 800MW units.
Vereinigte Energie AG, VEAG, the east German utility company in charge of 70
per cent of the energy production in the five new German states, plans to
build 4,000MW of new brown coal-fired power stations and 2,000MW of hard
coal stations by 2005. Another 1,000MW will be available from
newly-installed gas turbines.
Brown coal, which is abundant,will provide 80 per cent of the energy fuel in
east Germany. By 2005, east Germany is expected to produce annually 60m to
70m tonnes of brown coal, according to VEAG.
Moreover, remaining plants will be fitted with sulphur and dust removal
equipment to reduce their pollution. VEAG has already committed DM6bn to
refurbish the two largest plants in east Germany, Janschwalde and Boxberg.
In contrast, expansion in west Germany will be minimal with a 2.5 per cent
addition to the installed 110,000MW capacity planned over the next five
years, according to Siemens. Mostly, projects in the west will focus on
replacement of old plants. In total, east Germany will need an estimated
DM30bn to rebuild and upgrade its power stations and modernise its
transmission lines.
The prime benefactor of this growth will be VEAG which was formed after the
disintegration of the energy 'Kombinat', the monopolistic structure in
charge of energy under the former communist regime. VEAG is still owned by
the Treuhand, the state holding agency in east Germany.
Remaining energy production is to be left with regional energy utilities and
town authorities.
Three large companies have been dominating the burgeoning market:
Siemens, acting mostly through its KWU energy subsidiary, has acquired 40
per cent of the market for coal-fired stations and 50 per cent of the market
for gas turbines. Its outstanding orders for east Germany amount to DM1.5bn,
with further projects in the pipeline.
Siemens orders have included the supply of two 800MW turbosets for the large
power plant to be built at the Schwarze Pumpe site in Brandenburg.
Siemens will also install a natural gas-fired and steam turbine cogeneration
plant near Dresden. This new plant, representing a total investment of
DM480m, will replace the lignite-fired cogeneration at the same site and
reduce pollution by 97 per cent.
Other projects include the design and planning of a backfit for the
lignit-fired Janschwalde power plant near Cottbus with a flue gas
desulphurisation plant and a combined gas and steam turbine cogeneration
plant near Halle.
Asea Brown-Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish power and engineering group, has
invested DM300m so far but its outstanding orders reach DM2bn.
ABB's largest order is for the Boxberg site for which it will be handling
the planning work and supplying two complete turbosets for DM435m. ABB has
also won a DM150m contract for a new coal-fired power plant in Rostock. GEC
Alsthom, the Anglo-French joint venture, has also acquired significant
market shares, with EGT, its gas turbine marker, claiming a 25 per cent
market share in Germany while MAN, its engineering division, has captured a
12 per cent market share. EVT, its manufacturer of boilers and environment
protection products, claims 20 per cent of the market, with competition
coming mostly from the German engineering companies, Deutsche Babcock and
Steinmuller.
These companies, all well-established in the West German market before
reunification, have largely applied similar strategies to access the eastern
market, acquiring sister companies formed with break-up of the monolithic
power industry in east Germany.
Other suppliers have included General Electric of the US which in early 1992
signed a contract with Blohm and Voss, the Hamburg-based machinery maker, to
offer steam turbine and combined-cycle plants with electrical outputs of 50
to 500MW.
Companies that have established a local presence through acquisition have
generally been more successful at winning contracts. This stems from the
efforts of VEAG to foster growth for local manufacturers and safeguard
existing employment levels.
'We attempt to award contracts to local companies as far as possible when
their offers are competitive in order to help the local economy,' says Mr
Albrecht Schleich of VEAG.
Contracts have been delayed, however, by the bitter battles between regional
utilities and towns for a slice of the pie allocated to VEAG. The rivalries
have led to appeals to the federal constitutional court against the
quasi-monopolistic power of VEAG.
After months of negotiations, VEAG has struck agreements with 14 of the 15
regional utilities in the new German states. But legal quarrels between the
regional utilities and the towns are still hampering the decision making
processes.
Suppliers will not admit that public-sectors contracts are being awarded too
slowly. But the uncertainty has led to a slow-down in allocating available
funds.
'Some delays have been observed for some projects but in many cases there
has been an awareness that decisions needed to be taken rapidly,' says Mr
Manfried Simon, a director of ABB Germany.
However, eastern Germany's economic slowdown, which has been sharper than
anticipated, has cooled initial expectations. 'Programmes have been
stretched because economic growth and energy consumption is below target.
The big volume did not in fact materialise and the market is overestimated,'
says Mr Wilhelm Heitmann, chairman of the board of GEC Alsthom's EVT
subsidiary.
But most suppliers that hope to pick up business in eastern Europe as a
whole remain confident.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of the Philippines (2): Reforms are a high priority -
Prospects for sustainable growth / The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG

<TEXT>
AFTER a decade marked by recession, government indecision and missed
opportunities, the Philippine economy again seems to be preparing for a
long-delayed take-off.
Economists believe the new government of President Fidel Ramos has a better
chance than its predecessors of achieving sustainable economic growth,
partly because it has inherited some healthy macroeconomic reforms from the
previous administration.
Further, the ten-month-old government has demonstrated a keen determination
to pursue crucial reforms - backed by the International Monetary Fund - to
open the economy and pave the way for robust growth. In the past, similar
attempts wilted amidst the politically destabilising effects of the reforms.
The medium-term outlook, however, will continue to be hampered by the
inadequacy of the country's infrastructure. Among the worst problems are the
shortage of electricity generating capacity and the inefficient transport
systems in the archipelago of 7,100 islands.
In common with other developing countries, the Philippines has only scarce
resources for its myriad programmes. Low domestic savings rates have been a
chronic problem, which gives the country no recourse but to tap foreign
financing. Even now the cost of servicing the country's foreign debt of some
Dollars 30bn remains a large item on the budget. While efforts to reduce the
debt burden continue, the government also needs to increase revenues by
improving the efficiency of tax collection and boosting exports.
Beyond these roadblocks, however, the Ramos administration has set targets
designed to put the economy on track towards modernisation as it steps into
the next century. The three main goals of the Ramos economic agenda are:
To raise economic growth rates to double digits by 1998.
To raise per capita income to at least Dollars 1,000, from about Dollars 730
at present.
To reduce poverty incidence to 30 per cent of the population, from about
half now.
Mr Ramos and his economic managers, led by Mr Ramon del Rosario, the finance
secretary, have already put market-opening policies in place. In August 1992
most restrictions on foreign-exchange transactions were lifted. This was
followed in April this year by a decision to allow the use of medium and
long-term foreign loans to cover exporters' costs, which previously was
restricted to import costs of materials.
Among the policy measures initiated by the previous administration of Mrs
Corazon Aquino is the Foreign Investment Act, which allows up to 100 per
cent foreign equity in local enterprises. This is now being followed up by
the new government with more specific measures to open up certain sectors
previously restricted to Filipino interests, such as in land usage and
minerals exploration.
The ongoing tariff reform programme has also reduced nominal import tariffs
to an average 23 per cent, from about 42 per cent at the start of the 1980s.
By 1995, the effective protection will be down further to 19 per cent,
making the Philippines one of the most liberal markets in the region.
While the Aquino government's dissolution of monopolies in the agricultural
sector early during its term saw almost immediate results in boosting farm
incomes, the response to the Ramos administration's initial round of reforms
has yet to be felt.
This is because of other fundamental problems, such as high domestic
interest rates and the strength of the peso against the dollar over the last
year. Inflation has been brought down to an average 8.9 per cent in 1992,
from 18.7 in 1991, and the current programme targets a 1993 average of 7.5
per cent.
INTEREST rates softened in April, prompting speculators to sell the peso and
boosting the stock market to a record high. Costs of financial
intermediation have fallen with the reduced level of reserves that banks are
required to hold against bank deposits and the increase in the amounts that
state banks can lend in proportion to their deposit bases.
Even greater benefits are expected from the move to replace the Central Bank
of the Philippines with a more independent Central Monetary Authority with a
healthier financial base. The Central Bank's activities towards maintaining
price stability are being hampered by huge deficits, particularly those
incurred under the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos. A law is expected to be
passed by Congress by mid-year creating the new CMA. Without the crippling
deficits, the new agency should be able to steer monetary expansion more
efficiently.
Barring a further deterioration in the electric power situation, business
expects a more favourable climate following these changes in the
macro-economic environment. However, given that the daily power failures are
expected to continue to curtail operations until the third quarter of the
year, overall economic growth is now forecast by independent economists at
no more than 2.5 per cent, substantially lower than the government's
forecast.
Mr Jose Pardo, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
says: 'Amidst the darkness (caused by power failures or 'outages'), we see
somehow a growth in 1993 - perhaps the recovery that we had anticipated in
1992.'
The more significant business expansion, Mr Pardo believes, can be expected
to start next year. But even the slow rate of growth this year should not be
a problem.
While government officials insist that the 4.5 per cent growth target this
year is in fact 'achievable,' a low growth rate that is accompanied by
suitable reform measures should over the long run be more beneficial for the
Philippines. The economic 'dragons' of East Asia, which the Philippines is
using as models for its shift away from its current Latin American-type
dilemma, started out with small growth rates on their way to rapid economic
advance.
Besides, past experience shows that high-growth periods in the Philippines
were usually cut short by balance-of-payments crises. This was due to the
increase in consumption spending's share of GNP, as opposed to a healthier
expansion supported by increased capital spending.
The government aims to channel increasing amounts into capital investments
via an aggressive infrastructure projects. This year, for instance, it has
front-loaded spendings for infrastructure projects in a 'pump-priming'
programme that will seek to increase capital expenditures and perk up
domestic demand.
It would be short-sighted to judge the prospects for the Philippine economy
purely on the outlook for electricity supplies. Agriculture, for instance,
which is still the main source of livelihood for most Filipinos, is expected
to record significant gains this year with the expected improvement in
weather conditions. Crop production in the past two years had been affected
by drought in most provinces and typhoons in others. The Department of
Agriculture expects self-sufficiency in rice this year with production
reaching 10m tonnes. Sugar output will also increase, with producers already
looking at the attractive prices on the world market.
Remittances from Filipino overseas workers, estimated to top Dollars 2bn
again this year, will continue to play a key role in the economy. In the
past two years, the foreign exchange brought home by two million Filipinos
employed abroad has helped offset the poor performance of the domestic
economy. The growth in remittances has already outpaced that of exports,
although this is likely to change if the exchange rate becomes favourable to
exporters again.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of the Philippines (4): Disruptions hit industry hard
 -Power failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE power-cuts that paralyse industries and households in the Philippines'
main island of Luzon for several hours daily have inflicted more damage to
the economy than any of the natural calamities that regularly hit the
country.
Losses in industrial production amounted to at least 20bn pesos in the first
three months of this year due to these power cuts (or 'brown-outs,' as they
are known locally), according to the 'multi-sectoral task force on power,' a
group that has been monitoring the problem since 1990. Mr Raul Concepcion,
task force chairman, says sales in the period fell by an average of 20-30
per cent. Most of those affected were small entrepreneurs, he adds.
In 1992, the economy failed to attain its target growth, due in large part
to the power failures which disrupted 258 of the year's 297 working days. If
the situation does not improve soon, economists fear that growth this year
could again suffer grievously.
The main problem lies in the shortage of sufficient reserve power capacity
to cope with shut-downs by the regular baseload plants, which are all old
and prone to systems failure.
The government has not built new plants since the start of the construction
in the late 1970s of the 620MW nuclear power plant in Bataan province. The
plant, which was to have supplied 15 per cent of the Luzon power demand, was
completed in 1986 but was mothballed by the previous government because of
protests arising from safety fears and allegations of corruption in its
construction.
Of the total national electric power-generating capacity of 6,000MW, the
Luzon grid accounts for 4,400MW. However, in practice only about 2,500MW of
the Luzon capacity is available because sections are under repair or being
refurbished, and others, particularly the hydroelectric plants, have
water-supply problems.
Given the peak demand of 3,200MW from its industrial and residential users,
National Power Corporation (Napocor), the state-owned generating agency,
already faces a shortage even before the day starts. Napocor thus has to
ration what it can generate to its consumers.
Every 100MW of deficiency in the supply translates into another hour of
power-failure a day. The deficiency has risen to around 800MW at the start
of the Philippine summer in March. Around mid-April, the shortfall stood at
about 500 MW.
In recent weeks, a variety of reasons have been given for power-plant
failures. In one case, imported spare parts reportedly 'did not fit'; in
another, a cooling tower in a geothermal plant was damaged by fire which was
blamed on 'faulty electrical wiring.'
Many companies have had to install their own generating sets, to reduce
losses from shortened operating hours or spoilage of goods during
processing, and the government estimates that total private generating
capacity now exceeds 800MW. Most of the generators use diesel.
Napocor has an ongoing 'fast-track' programme to install, under
build-operate-transfer arrangements with private groups, new capacities that
will lead to reserves of some 500MW by September and to 600 MWby end-1993.
The government hopes that the new plants will put an end to the power
failures by September this year.
However, there is widespread scepticism, because of Napoco's poor track
record.
The corporation had been seeking an increase in its rates, to be able to
meet profitability standards required under its loan contracts with the
World Bank. New financing is needed for its expansion plans, and any default
in its loan commitments could cripple these plans.
It was in this environment that Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president,
sought 'emergency powers' from Congress. While his request was granted,
lingering fears over the 'emergency powers' used by the martial-law regime
of the late Ferdinand Marcos meant that the new powers won by Mr Ramos were
tamer than those he originally sought, and were only for specific
objectives.
One of these allows Napocor a higher return from its customers, a way of
skirting round a Supreme Court freeze on an earlier rates increase. The
extra powers should now pave the way for the construction of crucial
baseload plants which will enhance the Luzon grid's capacity by some
1,300MW.
These plants use coal or geothermal energy, rather than oil or gas, as in
the 'fast-track' plants which are being put up to bolster reserves. But the
use of gas turbine systems ceases to be economical over long periods, due to
added fuel costs. The move to construct baseload plants using cheaper energy
sources, therefore, is critical for the long-term health of the economy.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of the Philippines (5): Fights on many fronts - Big
business families
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT battle for control of newly privatised Philippine Airlines (PAL)
has served to emphasise an old truism: the Philippine economy is dominated
by a small number of very powerful business families with surnames such as
Cojuangco, Ayala and Soriano.
Such families often trace their strength to the quasi-feudal relationship
between master and peasant which still exists in much of the countryside,
and some of them have increased their influence by cosying up to successive
central governments in Manila and by protecting their industrial enterprises
behind high tariff barriers.
The privatisation of PAL in January 1992 has involved several of the
country's best-known business families in a bruising and complex battle for
control of PR Holdings, which bought 67 per cent of PAL from the state for
Dollars 370m.
Mr Antonio 'Tonyboy' Cojuangco, president of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone (PLDT) and the former PAL chief, lost the first round of the PAL
fight to Mr Lucio Tan, a Chinese-Filipino businessman with tobacco and
banking interests, partly because Mr Cojuangco himself had secretly
approached Mr Tan to help finance the transaction when he was unable to
raise enough cash.
Mr Andres Soriano III, head of the San Miguel beverage and food
conglomerate, regards Mr Tan as a dangerous rival in the brewing industry
(Mr Tan has been marketing a beer called 'Beer' which looks remarkably like
San Miguel's own brand but costs less). Mr Soriano, like the Ayala family,
had been allied to Mr Cojuangco against Mr Tan for the airline deal.
But Mr Soriano, outraged by Mr Cojuangco's scheming, apparently ended up
selling his stake to Mr Tan via International Container Terminal Services,
which wanted a ground handling contract from PAL.
There was a serious side to this unedifying and as yet unfinished saga,
namely a dispute between Mr Tan and Mr Cojuangco over the wisdom of buying
Dollars 1.2bn of new aircraft; Mr Tan wanted more emphasis on regional
rather than long-haul routes. But the squabbling forced the government,
which still holds a stake in the airline, to intervene and impose a
compromise. Both Mr Gabriel Singson, the new PR Holdings chairman, and Mr
Carlos Dominguez, the new PAL chief, are effectively government appointees.
Mr Tan is now reported to be seeking to sell his stake of just over 50 per
cent in PR Holdings, describing his involvement in the airline as 'a big
headache.'
An equally murky war has been waged over the location of the new, unified
Philippine stock exchange (at present there are two exchanges, one in Makati
and one in Manila).
A vote among stockbrokers in March chose Philrealty Holdings' Tektite
Towers, in territory controlled by the Ortigas family, over a site owned by
the Ayala family; but the margin of victory was narrow and the losers are
challenging the result.
Mr Tan is regarded as something of an upstart by the dynasties which can
trace their influence back to the days of Spanish colonialism, but his name,
like theirs, seems to crop up again and again when big deals are being
discussed in the Philippines.
The late Ferdinand Marcos helped to justify his dictatorship with a populist
commitment to reduce the power of wealthy landlords and businessmen, but he
gathered around him a set of equally influential business 'cronies' instead;
when he was overthrown in the uprising which brought Mrs Corazon Aquino to
the presidency in 1986, some of the cronies found themselves in trouble and
Marcos's old enemies emerged once more to flex their financial muscles.
The legacy of these continuing struggles is a corrosive uncertainty in the
world of Philippine big business.
The Soriano family company San Miguel, for example, was brought under the
control of Mr Eduardo Cojuangco (a Marcos associate who is one of Antonio's
cousins) in the time of Marcos. The Aquino administration seized some of the
Cojuangco-controlled shares in the company, saying they were unfairly
obtained, but he is fighting in the courts to retrieve them.
Ownership of part of PLDT is also under a cloud; in March the Presidential
Commission on Good Government declared that the 44 per cent stake in PLDT's
holding company claimed by the Cojuangco family may have in fact been owned
by Marcos and therefore was at risk of seizure by the state.
Like others before him, President Fidel Ramos has vowed since his election
in May last year to liberalise the economy and reduce the power of
inefficient monopolies, although he has moved with deliberate caution to
avoid antagonising the business community; his critics say the government,
by intervening in PLDT, San Miguel and PAL, is taking an unhealthy interest
in running big businesses.
'There is this intention to really overcome or eliminate inefficient
monopolies in our economy,' said Mr Cielito Habito, the Socio-Economic
Planning Secretary in the Ramos administration and head of the National
Economic and Development Authority. 'My impression is that 90 per cent or
more of the population is supportive of this trend.'
But he added: 'We don't want to overdo this. We don't want to do this to the
point of discouraging investment.'
Filipino businessmen, even those with free market tendencies, are concerned
that Congress might pass anti-trust legislation so sweeping that it cripples
big companies and provides further avenues for corruption and litigation in
a country already over-burdened with both.
Although the big families are mostly fighting each other, some of them are
starting to grumble about Mr Ramos's drive to increase competition. Mr Jaime
Zobel de Ayala, head of the Ayala clan, complained in a recent speech that
some officials were starting to regard businesses 'particularly large and
established ones' as detrimental to the national interest.
Seasoned observers of the Philippines believe Mr Ramos is bound to reach
some sort of compromise with the big families he is targeting.
'The intention is sincere as a way of equalising the level of competition in
the marketplace,' says Mr Raffy Manalaysay, senior investment analyst at
Crosby Securities in Hong Kong, 'but whether the implementation is going to
be as steadfast and earnest as he would like people to think - that's
another matter.'
PLDT is likely to be the focus of the government's attention for the time
being. It is widely seen as an inefficient monopoly (there are only two
telephones per 100 people in the Philippines) and improvements would be
welcomed by the people forced to use PLDT's service, including the sort of
protectionist businessmen who might otherwise be expected to oppose
liberalisation; there are, furthermore, plenty of competent international
companies which would be delighted to compete with PLDT for the lucrative
Philippine market.
The ground has been further prepared for the Ramos administration by
accusations of bribery and skulduggery. PLDT has long resisted attempts to
make it connect its network to those of rival organisations such as Eastern
Telecommunications, a Cable &amp; Wireless affiliate, and it won an order from
the Supreme Court to stop Eastern handling international traffic. Now,
however, Eastern has suggested that the judgement read out by a supreme
court justice - who has now resigned - was written by a PLDT lawyer.
Perhaps encouraged by these developments and by the likelihood of public
support, President Ramos has ordered PLDT to allow other companies to
connect with its network. He has also directed the government to exercise
more vigorously its rights as a shareholder in PLDT and the holding company,
replacing the government representatives on both boards.
The result of these moves is that Mr Antonio Cojuangco is starting to back
down. In late March, PLDT announced that it was making connections with a
number of other companies, including Eastern.
Big families still dominate the economy - and local politics - in the
Philippines and they are unlikely to lose control during the Ramos
presidency; but they may - as Mr Ramos seems to be showing with PLDT - be
obliged to loosen their grip slightly if the economy is again to compete
with the rest of south-east Asia.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (2): Something
interesting is afoot - GE's support for an unorthodox power system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the largest company in any industry secures a worldwide licensing deal
from one of the tiniest for a relatively new technology, something
potentially very interesting is probably afoot.
Such was the case in February when General Electric, the world leader in
power generating equipment, announced a worldwide licensing agreement with
Exergy of Hayward, California to further develop and market a technology
that could increase overall efficiency of GE combined cycle power systems.
Behind the deal lies the Kalina cycle technology developed by Dr Alexander
Kalina, a Russian emigre who is the principal owner of Exergy. Dr Kalina,
like many other engineers, was looking for ways to improve the overall
efficiency of electric power generation.
Using as a basis theory developed by Dr Myron Tribus, a former GE turbine
designer who is now a director of Exergy, Kalina decided to 'throw the book
away' and change a system that has been in place for 140 years. Instead of
concentrating on equipment and materials that could lead to only marginal
improvements, Dr Kalina focused on the very process by which heat is
converted into electricity.
The Kalina cycle, therefore, is an alternative to the standard steam cycle
by which 70 per cent of all electric power is generated. The standard or
Rankine cycle uses a single working fluid (usually water) to make steam in a
boiler, expand it through a turbine to generate electricity, and then
condense the spent steam, pump it and return it to the boiler. Because the
thermodynamic requirements in the various parts of the cycle differ, this
creates compromises, says Exergy.
In contrast, the Kalina cycle changes the working fluid in different parts
of the system, by using a fluid that is a mixture of two or more components
with different boiling points - typically, ammonia and water - and varying
their ratio, to avoid compromises in the standard steam cycle.
The result is that more electricity is produced from the same quantity of
fuel. According to Exergy, the Kalina cycle improves the efficiency of
thermal power plants by 8-80 per cent, depending on the particular
application. Assuming a 15 per cent increase in efficiency, 100 per cent
adoption of the Kalina cycle in the US would save fuel worth Dollars 6bn at
1991 prices. Emissions, including greenhouse gases and particulates, would
decrease by 15 per cent, says Exergy.
As with many small companies trying to interest large established suppliers
in a new technology, success has not come overnight for Exergy, which was
founded in 1980 to exploit the Kalina cycle.
In 1984 it decided that the best way to demonstrate the advantages of the
Kalina cycle was to build a prototype power plant, and three years later it
signed an agreement with the US Department of Energy to build one at the
Department's Energy Technology Engineering Center in Canoga Park,
California.
In 1991, a major milestone was passed when the 3.2MW plant, using exhaust
gases from an adjacent test facility as its heat source, was successfully
operated. The working fluid is ammonia and water, and the lynchpin is a
'distillation condensation subsystem' in which the composition of the
mixture is changed - so that different mixtures can be used in the boiler
and condenser.
It was about this time that GE began a detailed, two-year study of Kalina
cycle technology. By the time the two companies had announced a deal this
year, both the efficiency and economics of Kalina cycle systems had been
improved by the companies' joint efforts.
GE's worldwide licence for the Kalina cycle covers its application only to
combined cycle power generation. Using a mixture of ammonia and water
increases the thermodynamic availability of energy transfer from the gas
turbine exhaust to the steam turbine. 'So you can use a bigger steam turbine
for free,' says Mr Del Williamson, vice-president for sales at GE Industrial
&amp; Power Systems.
The effect of the Kalina cycle could be to raise the thermal efficiency of
combined cycle power generation by one or two percentage points from the
current 55 per cent-plus. This would help the power industry save millions
of dollars a year in fuel costs, and could, therefore, be very important to
GE from a competitive point of view.
According to Mr Williamson, GE is now working on scaling up the technology
to establish what the cost would be. GE expects to have demonstrator units
in place over the next three years.
Mr Tribus points out that there are no theoretical limitations to the size
of the Kalina cycle. Standard equipment is used, and the only material that
has to be avoided is copper, which is attacked by ammonia.
'I am convinced this will give GE an unbeatable advantage over everybody
else,' says Mr Tribus.
In practical terms, the Kalina cycle version of a combined cycle plant would
have a modified heat recovery steam generator (boiler), to include the
elements of the distillation/condensation subsystem. A low pressure
condenser, recuperative heat exchanger, gravity flash tank and high pressure
condenser would replace a single condenser in traditional plants.
For the utility, the payback would depend on the market and the fuel price,
says Mr Williamson. 'Where fuel prices are low, the payback will not be so
attractive,' he says. And if the payback was more than three or four years,
the system may not be seen as attractive.
Exergy, meanwhile, is working on several other applications for the Kalina
cycle. It will be five years until the cash rolls in from any GE sales of
combined cycle plants with a Kalina cycle, which could be too long to wait
if Exergy wants to develop its plans for coal-fired plants, says Mr Tribus.
Here a particular attraction is the repowering market. 'You could take out
the guts of an old coal-fired plant, put in our plant, and increase output
by 20 per cent for the same coal usage,' he says.
To exploit this market, Exergy may well raise Dollars 50m-Dollars 60m to get
into the coal-fired business itself. A less likely possibility would be to
find a partner with engineering ability and market knowledge.
Exergy is also negotiating with several companies that want to take a
licence for applying the Kalina cycle to geothermal power generation. The
efficiency gains are as high as 80 per cent here because the Kalina cycle
performance improves in lower temperatures.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (3): Weakest will go to
the wall - The boilermaking industry is changing, but at its own speed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along with other parts of the power generating equipment industry, boiler
makers are having to adapt to changing product and technology trends -
environmental pressures, the growth in popularity of combined cycle power
generation - and are also reorganising themselves to become more
competitive.
But, in comparison with newer sectors such as gas turbines, the boiler
industry has travelled less far down the road towards global concentration.
As one of the oldest, and - until recently, at least - less sophisticated
sectors of power engineering, national buying preferences have prevailed
longer than elsewhere.
Worldwide, there are about 50 companies capable of producing boilers for
power plants - the boilers are traditionally used for raising steam in
coal-fired generation but are also used in combined cycle: the waste heat
steam generators that link the gas turbine to the steam turbine are
basically boilers.
In Europe alone there are 20-30 producers and manufacturing overcapacity has
been a serious problem. A study for the European Commission in 1988 found
that capacity utilisation by Europe's boiler manufacturers averaged just 20
per cent, compared with 60 per cent for the turbine generator sector.
In Europe and worldwide, the situation has improved since then, due partly
to mergers worldwide, to improved world market conditions and also to
restructuring within individual companies in Europe and North America.
Among the various deals that have more closely tailored boiler manufacturing
capacity to worldwide demand or, at the very least, rationalised the
industry's structure, were:
Asea Brown Boveri's takeover of Combustion Engineering of the US and its
recent acquisition in Prvni brnenska strojirna in the Czech Republic;
The integration of France's Stein Industrie and EVT of Germany - each of
which had themselves developed through mergers - under one roof as the main
elements of GEC Alsthom's boilers and environmental systems business;
Last year's joint venture in boilers between Deutsche Babcock and Lentjes, a
subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft; Deutsche Babcock had acquired Riley Stoker
of the US in 1990.
The acquisition by Finland's Ahlstrom Pyropower of Outokumpu's boiler
business and of Fakop, a leading Polish boiler manufacturer.
Last year's acquisition by Germany's Steinmuller of a 40 per cent stake in
Tampella's boiler-making business. Tampella, based in Finland, had
previously bought Keeler in the US.
There has also been thoroughgoing slimming and refocusing at many of the
larger companies. The workforce at Babcock Energy's main boiler plant at
Renfrew in Scotland, for example, has been reduced by 800 in the past five
years to just under 1,200 and the factory is a true low-cost producer, says
Mr John Prosser, executive director of Babcock Energy's power engineering
division.
The workforce at Combustion Engineering has been cut by about 15 per cent to
under 5,000, although the entity no longer exists as such within ABB. The
business, says Mr Kevin Pilon, vice-president for strategic development at
ABB's boiler business, is 'down to the core, and perhaps now in a small
build-up phase' for employment.
Outsourcing of less critical components has been stepped up, and the
business has been reorganised on a profit centre basis, and given new
management at profit centre levels.
Worldwide, the major boiler producers are Combustion Engineering, Foster
Wheeler and Babcock &amp; Wilcox, all of the US; Ahlstrom, Babcock Energy, and
Deutsche Babcock from Europe and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan. The
Babcock companies are unconnected, albeit linked in the past.
Then come dozens of national producers, some of which are active in
international markets.
Most observers believe there both could and should be further
rationalisation in the boiler industry, with weaker players going to the
wall and companies with niche technologies either remaining independent or
finding financial security within larger groups.
But the pace at which some of the national producers will be squeezed will
depend critically on how quickly some of the more protectionist markets will
be opened up. Countries such as France and Italy, for example, have never
been easy for foreign suppliers.
Meanwhile, overcapacity remains and the strong competition for orders means
that prices for power plant boilers have been stable or declining in real
terms, according to Mr Pilon.
He points out, though, that there are ways for boiler makers to
differentiate themselves. One measure of competitiveness is an effective
cycle time strategy - the ability to deliver quicker. Differing product
strategies add another twist to the competition.
Companies such as ABB make a virtue of offering a turnkey package of
virtually everything needed to build a power station. Siemens and
Westinghouse, in contrast, buy in their boilers.
Then there are companies which concentrate almost exclusively on boilers, at
least as regards their power equipment business.
Mr Prosser points out that Babcock Energy has supplied boilers with ABB, and
in one of the biggest recent power plant contracts, the Dollars 1.25bn Black
Point combined cycle project in Hong Kong won by GEC Alsthom and General
Electric, Babcock won an Pounds 80m contract to supply the heat-recovery
steam generators because of the customer's strong preference for its
equipment.
Inevitably, the outlook for the boiler industry over the next few years
mirrors that of the power generating equipment market generally. Overall,
says Mr Prosser, the next two years will be tough but there are big market
opportunities in Asia and the Pacific Rim.
Naturally, therefore, the western boiler makers are stepping up local
manufacturing to help win orders and because it makes economic sense to
build at least some of the components close to the market place.
ABB, for example, has a boiler fabrication joint venture in Indonesia, and
Babcock Energy, says Mr Prosser, is looking for partners in China and
Malaysia to supply plant such as flues and ductwork.
Babcock is currently bidding jointly with Wuhan Boiler Works in central
China for the Ezhou anthracite-fired power station. Again Wuhan will be
manufacturing some of the less critical parts if the consortium wins the
contract.
As for technological developments, there is still considerable debate as to
how environmental pressures will affect the boiler industry. The boiler
producers have already made important contributions to clean coal burning,
whether through the development of low-Nox burners or through flue gas
desulphurisation equipment which removes sulphur dioxide. The big companies
are trying to keep their options open, as it is not clear what the relative
long-term importance will be in the market place for such clean coal
technologies as integrated gas combined cycle, circulating fluidised bed
boilers, traditional pulverised coal boilers with scrubbers, or such
combinations as pressurised fluidised bed boilers linked to IGCC.
GEC Alsthom's Stein Industrie recently won an order in France for a 250MW
CFB boiler, which it claims is the world's largest. Mr Eric Oakes, Ahlstrom
Pyropower's president, says the company has orders for two 230MW boilers in
Poland, and says 300MW boilers are attainable.
'If a CFB boiler can match the price of a pulverised coal boiler with a
scrubber, it can be the boiler of choice as the emissions are lower,' says
Mr Oakes. He suggests that the future could see IGCC repowering existing gas
turbine plants as the price of gas rises, while CFBs could be used to
re-equip existing coal-fired plants or fitted to new ones. 'There is room
for both in the future,' he says.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of the Philippines (1): A long way still to go -
Since coming to power last year with a less than overwhelming mandate,
President Fidel Ramos has nevertheless managed to prompt a renewal of hope
among Filipinos and foreign investors alike. But it is far too early to talk
of optimism on the troubled economic front
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT is hardly surprising that Filipinos spend much of their time looking back
nostalgically to the 1950s when their economy was one of the strongest in
Asia: the present is often too depressing to contemplate.
As if it were not enough to have watched the dynamic, export-driven
economies of their south-east Asian neighbours one by one overtaking the
Philippines, the inhabitants of the capital Manila are now being subjected
to the added humiliation of all-day power cuts and a surge in kidnapping and
violent crime.
Visit the office of a Filipino businessman or government official in Manila,
and the chances are that you will find him cursing and sweating in the
summer heat without the benefit of air-conditioning. The previous
administration of Mrs Corazon Aquino, who toppled the late dictator
Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, neglected to invest in new power stations.
The arrival of Mr Fidel Ramos in the Malacanang presidential palace has
prompted a growing number of Filipinos and foreign investors to look to the
future with renewed hope, although it is too early to talk of optimism.
The cigar-chewing President Ramos, the general who as armed forces chief
protected Mrs Aquino from seven attempted coups d'etat by right-wing
military rebels, was her chosen presidential candidate in the May 1992
elections. He won with only 23 per cent of the vote, beating six rivals
including Mrs Miriam Santiago, the anti-corruption campaigner, Mrs Imelda
Marcos, the dictator's flamboyant widow, and Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, a Marcos
'crony.'
Since coming to power in June with this less-than-overwhelming mandate, Mr
Ramos has successfully consolidated his support among Filipinos by touring
the country and addressing public rallies; by attempting to make peace with
a variety of rebels, including the right-wing military officers, the
communists and the Moslem separatists in the south; by reshuffling the
leadership of the notoriously corrupt police force (some of whose officers
were accused of taking part in the kidnappings of ethnic Chinese and foreign
businessmen) and appointing Mr Joseph Estrada, the vice-president and former
film star, as head of an anti-crime force; and above all by making alliances
in the Congress which had so often stymied his predecessor Mrs Aquino.
This congressional support allowed Mr Ramos to grant himself special powers
in April under the Electric Power Crisis Law to deal with the electricity
shortage.
He will be able to push through new power station projects and to bypass the
country's notoriously slow procedures for screening bids and granting
environmental clearance certificates. The new law also gives him the right
to raise electricity prices - an option previously blocked by a Supreme
Court ruling - and thereby satisfy International Monetary Fund and World
Bank conditions for a new international lending programme.
The public debate over the new law, conducted with a vigour and openness so
lacking in most other south-east Asian countries, goes to the heart of the
Philippine dilemma.
On one side of the argument are the disciplinarians, including many
businessmen, who believe that the Philippines should pay more attention to
discipline and law enforcement than to the kind of freedom and democracy -
characterised by interminable lawsuits - that the country inherited from the
US, the former colonial power.
These disciplinarians nodded approvingly when Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the founding
father of Singapore, expounded his gospel of authoritarianism on a recent
visit to Manila at the invitation of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and
Industry; they also generally approve of the granting of special powers to
Mr Ramos to deal with the electricity crisis, and would probably agree with
the local newspaper columnist who joked that the Philippines suffers from
being a member of a special kind of NATO: 'No Action, Talk Only.'
On the other side are the libertarians. They fear that such special powers
could be the thin end of a wedge which might eventually open the door to a
new dictatorship, thus throwing away the hard-won gains of the uprising that
put an end to the Marcos era. The waiving of regulations on bidding, they
add, is an invitation to further corruption.
President Ramos's relaxed and undictatorial demeanour - as well as the
evident and urgent need both to crack down on crime and build new power
stations - has helped to calm such fears. If anything, his supporters want
Mr Ramos, known as 'Steady Eddie' because of his methodical ways, to move
quicker to restore the country's fortunes.
Notwithstanding the lack of new power stations, Mrs Aquino did attempt in
her last two years in office to restore the health of the Philippine economy
with a series of measures liberalising imports and foreign investment rules,
and Mr Ramos has been able to build on that in an attempt to compete with
capital-hungry Indonesia, China and Vietnam for foreign investors.
Following the departure of US forces from their bases in the Philippines,
and the associated loss of hundreds of millions of dollars each year in
revenue, Mr Ramos has assiduously courted Japanese and other Asian investors
with a round of overseas visits.
In August last year he dismantled foreign exchange controls on current
transactions, and in an effort to boost the economy this year the
administration has embarked on a 'pump-priming' exercise of doubtful value
whereby government departments were supposed to weight their spending on
roads, housing and other infrastructure towards the first half of the year.
After zero economic growth and a poor performance by the agricultural sector
last year, the government initially aimed for a 4.5 per cent rise in real
gross domestic product this year, but most businessmen and diplomats regard
the target as unreachable because of the crippling blow to industry
delivered by the power crisis on the principal island of Luzon. At best,
they say, the economy is likely to grow by two per cent; that compares with
a population growth rate of 2.4 per cent and would mean that the average
Filipino will continue to get poorer in 1993.
But the economy is showing a number of promising signs, so much so that the
peso actually strengthened for a time following the foreign exchange
liberalisation as dollars from overseas workers, tourists, property
speculators and stock market investors flooded into the market.
The relatively strong peso has made life even harder for exporters, but they
can at least take comfort from the fact that inflation has been restrained
below 10 per cent and worker militancy has decreased. The outflow of dollars
to service the country's Dollars 30bn of foreign debt has fallen to below 20
per cent of export earnings, and the World Bank has redesignated the
Philippines as a 'moderately indebted' (rather than 'severely indebted')
developing country.
After frantically buying dollars to control the rise of the peso, the
central bank has Dollars 6bn of reserves and has been buying back Philippine
debt at a discount on the international market; there is a further Dollars
5bn of foreign exchange in the commercial banking system.
In February, the Philippines successfully borrowed Dollars 150m on the
eurobond market after an absence of more than a decade, and hopes to borrow
more. Negotiations are due to resume shortly with the IMF for an extended
fund facility of Dollars 800m-Dollars 1bn over three years, which would pave
the way for a delayed Paris Club rescheduling of bilateral debt and other
borrowing agreements.
'This will be our last programme involving a special relationship with the
IMF, where we are in effect wards of the IMF,' said Mr Ramon del Rosario,
the finance secretary, in an interview with the Financial Times. 'We are
approaching a situation where we can be back on our own.'
OUTSIDE the capital, some areas - notably on the island of Cebu and along
the industrial corridor south of Manila - have succeeded in attracting
foreign investors and developing export industries.
Mr Ramos, however, will face many obstacles as he struggles to achieve his
aim of achieving double-digit economic growth by the end of his term in
1998. Although the country is probably more stable politically than at any
time in the last decade, and some Filipinos have started to whisper that the
days of coups d'etat are over, it would take a bold pundit to stake his
reputation on such a prediction.
A large backlog of work also remains to be done in building and repairing
the country's physical infrastructure, not just for power stations but also
for roads and water supply. Economists estimate that the government's per
capita real spending on infrastructure has fallen by about 40 per cent in
the last decade; the traffic jams in Manila seem as bad as those in Bangkok
 -and Manila does not have the excuse of an economic boom.
Unsustainable population growth is another problem in this predominantly
Roman Catholic country. As a Protestant, Mr Ramos (with the help of his
condom-waving health minister, Mr Juan Flavier) may find it easier to tackle
the issue of family planning than would a Catholic, but an open
confrontation with the powerful Catholic church would be risky for the
president.
Last, but not least, there is the environment. Deforestation has contributed
to erosion and thereby to the silting of dams and a reduction in the output
of much-needed hydro-electricity. Of the top five manufacturing industries
identified as particularly beneficial to the economy on the grounds of
export potential, employment and other factors, two - wood processing and
fish processing - are directly dependent on effective environmental
protection which does not yet exist in the Philippines. The valuable tourist
trade also depends on a clean environment.
In Manila today, pedestrians hold handkerchiefs to mouth and nose to try to
filter out the dust and diesel fumes from the filthy air they are forced to
breathe. From Taipei to Bangkok, that seems to be a price Asian
city-dwellers are prepared to pay for increasing prosperity. The Filipinos
have got the pollution; they are still waiting for the prosperity.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (1): Strong wind in the
east - Throughout the next decade, demand for new power generating equipment
will continue to shift from the US and western Europe to Asia. The trend is
recognised by all the big equipment producers, who are laying plans
accordingly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LAYMEN who assume that the world market for power generating equipment is
just a matter of selling turbines, boilers and generators to utilities might
wonder where, and why, rolling brown-outs and boiled chicken heads come into
the equation.
Rolling brown-outs are the power cuts that countries such as Taiwan and the
Philippines impose as they struggle to keep power output up with the needs
created by rapid economic growth. Boiled chicken heads are the kind of
banquet delicacy faced by western equipment salesmen during the battle for
orders in key markets such as China.
Over the past five years, and throughout the next decade, demand for new
power generating equipment has been and will continue to shift from the US
and western Europe to Asia. The trend is recognised by all the big equipment
producers, who are laying plans accordingly.
'It is quite clear that Asia will be the highest economic growth area for
several decades,' says Mr Frank Bakos, vice president and general manager at
the Westinghouse Electric power generation business unit. 'Whoever can
deliver the best product at the most reasonable prices will be most
successful in supplying the needs of the industrialising countries.'
However the projected statistics for the next few years are displayed, Asia
looks like coming out on top in a world market that Westinghouse expects to
be worth Dollars 25bn a year by the year 2000 - with annual order volume up
40 per cent from today.
General Electric, the world's biggest power generating equipment supplier,
forecasts that 180 gigawatts (GW or thousands of megawatts) of new power
capacity will be needed in the Asia Pacific region from 1993-2002,
equivalent to annual growth of 6.2 per cent.
That excludes a forecast 46GW of additional capacity needs in Japan, and
comes out of a total world forecast of 610GW of new capacity needs -
implying a reasonable growth rate of three per cent.
Asea Brown Boveri, the big Swiss-Swedish supplier, expresses the growth
differently. Mr Goran Lindahl, the Swiss-Swedish group's executive
vice-president for both Asia and for its power plants business, says China
and Hong Kong will be adding 12-15GW of new power capacity every year for
the rest of this decade.
This is the equivalent of Switzerland's entire installed power capacity.
Overall, says ABB, power capacity additions in Asia are running at triple
the rate seen in the 1970s, while in western markets new capacity is being
added at only two-thirds of rates seen 20 years ago.
Precise descriptions might vary, but few would quibble with GE's description
of the Asia Pacific region as a targeted 'megamarket' for power generation.
Strong economic growth in several countries, including Taiwan, China, South
Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and China is producing large infrastructure
investments and continuing electrification, says GE.
In particular, demand for nuclear plants in Taiwan, Korea and China comes as
an immense relief to suppliers facing bleak prospects for plant orders
virtually everywhere else outside Asia.
However, the growth in the Asian market creates two problems for western
suppliers. First, they have to decide the extent to which it is necessary to
enter into joint ventures and local manufacturing deals with domestic
suppliers, and understand the different nuances in what is by no means a
unified market.
Korea, for example, is more interested in developing its heavy equipment
industry than is Taiwan. In China, according to Mr Hans Bohm, vice president
of Siemens, it is very important that the market is approached via local
manufacturing deals, which will allow the majority of plant investment to be
financed locally.
There is also, he says, a need to develop local manufacturing so that its
capacity to handle larger unit sizes can be increased.
Siemens is negotiating joint ventures in China in steam turbines and in
hydro-electric power. Westinghouse, too is looking to strengthen its
position in Asia through new joint ventures, and developing existing ones in
China and Korea. GE and ABB have several negotiations underway - the
Canadian arm of GE recently concluded a hydro-electric technology transfer
deal in China. The Anglo-French GEC Alsthom also has a strong position in
China.
A second, and related, poser for equipment suppliers is the extent to which
they should become financially involved in the many independent power
projects which are proposed or planned in the region. US suppliers have
greater experience of such projects because of the phenomenal growth of
non-utility power producers in the home market, but the political risks are
much greater overseas.
Overall, equipment suppliers are wary of long-term involvement in Asian
'build-own-operate' (BOO) or 'build-operate-transfer' (BOT) arrangements.
'We are investing only to drive our core business,' says Mr Bohm. 'We are
not an investor like a bank.'
If Asia is the main current theme in the generating equipment industry there
are a number of sub-plots - in some of which the denouement is as far away
as ever.
In the US, a combination of 'repowering' of existing plants, modernisation
and life extension and new thermal plants is providing steady growth
opportunities in a market that is still likely to account for almost a sixth
of new capacity needs over the next 10 years.
In Europe, overall growth is relatively sluggish but the market is becoming
increasingly technology-led, with environmentally-related equipment
accounting for as much as 30 per cent of the cost of a power station. The
dominant themes will be examined at the three-day Power-Gen Europe
conference and exhibition which opens today in Paris.
An important development over the past year in Europe has been the
resolution - at least as regards power plant - of a dispute between the US
and the European Community over public procurement.
US suppliers are relieved to have won a waiver on controversial articles in
the EC utilities directive, in particular the rule stipulating that public
utilities must prefer a European bid where it is no more than 3 per cent
dearer than the best bid from overseas.
GE sees the deal as opening the way to selling its steam turbines in Europe
for the first time since the era of the Marshall Plan. 'This was the key
trade issue in the industry,' says Mr Del Williamson, vice-president for
sales at GE Industrial &amp; Power Systems.
Mr Williamson recalls a bid which GE made last year to build a power plant
in Germany. The US company lost out in spite of having a lower price and a 1
percentage point edge on thermal efficiency - although the project was later
cancelled.
The situation in eastern Europe remains, in the words of John Yasinsky,
group president at Westinghouse Electric, 'exciting and frustrating'. Most
suppliers have had their share of both sides of the story, where the key
issue remains the need for western finance to complete, update or replace
with alternative power generating plant the 81 Soviet-built nuclear plants
in eastern Europe, Russia and the Ukraine.
Some progress has been made on this issue, but suppliers complain of
bureaucratic delays hampering the raising of money that has already been
agreed - such as the Dollars 700m approved at the G7 meeting in Munich last
June. Westinghouse is attaching particular importance to a Dollars 220m
contract it has tied up to supply the instrumentation and control system to
the partially-completed Temelin nuclear project in the Czech Republic. The
deal could open the way for further work on the newer, safer VVER 1000 type
of stations, Westinghouse believes.
Siemens has already won a contract to update the instruments and controls of
the second generation VVER440-type station under construction at Mochovce in
the Slovak Republic.
Meanwhile, says Mr Bohm, it is confident of winning soon an order for three
450MW combined cycle power units in St Petersburg, providing district
heating and fired by gas turbines to be produced at Interturbo, Siemens'
joint venture company in the city.

FT  25 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Late rebound eases gloom on rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOOMY perceptions of the outlook for interest rates and for the recovery in
the UK economy kept London stocks subdued for most of yesterday's session,
and traders drew little comfort from a successful rebound from the FT-SE
2,800 area. With the institutions still evidently unwilling to move ahead of
the BT III sale, which was launched yesterday, and the outcome of the Zeneca
rights issue, the new equity trading account made an unimpressive start.
The market rallied from the day's low point with the help of a sizeable
trading programme, weighted towards the buy side and thought to have been
operated by the London arm of a Swiss bank. In early deals, London was
depressed by the combination of Wall Street's weakness on Friday and a slow
start in UK stock index futures. The low point of 2,804.3, down 7.9, was
reached early, however, and shares began to steady as the trading programme
took effect.
But the rally proved extremely shallow and the market remained no more than
a shade either side of Friday's close until late in the session. Not until
New York had opened with a gain of 15 Dow points in UK hours did London turn
distinctly higher.
The success of New York's Dow Industrial Average in stemming its fall
comfortably above the sensitive 3,480 mark cheered the UK market. At its
final reading, the FT-SE Index was 13.4 up at 2,825.6. The stress on the
international blue chips was reflected in the relative underperformance of
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which, although at another new peak of 3,168.4,
added only 3.3.
Seaq volume slipped to 510.5m shares in a trading session generally agreed
to be uneventful, with non-Footsie business around normal averages at some
64 per cent of the total. Friday's 699m shares through the Seaq network was
worth Pounds 1.43bn in retail value. Retail business, the most significant
guide to the market's health, has remained high as the Footsie Index has
given ground recently. The market's growing doubts about the outlook for the
Zeneca rights issues were not helped yesterday by negative views on the
pharmaceutical sector by analysts at a leading US investment bank. The
opening of the sales campaign for the BT III issue, which will comprise
virtually all the remaining government stake at a price of more than Pounds
5bn, served to remind the stock market of the weight of demand on
institutional cash.
On the broader economic front, the UK stock market's dwindling hopes of a
base rate cut were bruised by reports that a member of the Bundesbank
council had dismissed any likelihood of a cut in German rates within the
next few months. The chances of a cut in UK rates are regarded in the stock
market as a political decision hinged on the progress of the recovery in the
domestic economy, but news yesterday of a slight narrowing of Britain's
trade gap with non-EC countries last month had little effect. In any event,
any move on base rates is thought highly unlikely ahead of tomorrow's
auction in the UK government bond market.
Against this uncertain background, UK shares appeared hesitant. Some brewery
stocks extended the losses suffered last week in the wake of trading results
from Bass, but consumer stocks were generally indecisive.

<TEXT>
OPTIONS trading in British Steel was the highlight of a dull day in the
derivatives market yesterday, writes Christopher Price.
Over 7,000 contracts were dealt in the steel maker, equivalent to 7m shares
in the equity market. Dealers said the institutions involved were hedging on
Steel's recovery potential, a fact highlighted by a number of brokers in
recent weeks. The trades included 1,000 of the July calls at 8.5p and 2,000
of the October 110 calls at 7 1/2 p.
Among other stock options, other former nationalised industries also held
sway, with 1,425 British Gas contracts being dealt, followed by 1,255 in
British Airways. These were trailed by Lucas Industries, which traded 1,038,
while Land Securities recorded 678.
However, the day's overall total of 23,887 was well down on Friday. The
FT-SE contract reached 5,686 contracts.
In the futures market, the June contract opened weakly at 2,810, drifting
down fairly smartly to the day's low of 2,802. Buyers were then seen and the
contract perked up, although trading continued in a tight band and low
volume.
Dealers said there was little for the market to focus on, although the
afternoon session was a little livelier on the back of French rate cuts and
a slightly stronger Wall Street.
June closed at 2,834, about 4 points over its fair value level of around
5.5. Volume was a lowly 5,059 contracts.

FT  25 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Argyll strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in Argyll Group ahead of full-year results today saw the shares
close 15 1/2 ahead at 317p in good volume of 4.4m. Results are expected to
reach the top end of analysts forecasts, of Pounds 405m to Pounds 420m, with
positive news also anticipated on current trading. Argyll recently launched
a price cutting programme.
The shares have generally lagged behind the rest of the food retail sector,
which has itself been under a cloud as some brokers have grown fearful of
the impact of food discounters. In addition, recent figures from J.
Sainsbury underlined for some critics the maturity of the market and pointed
to only slow growth at best in the near-term. Sainsbury shares were also
strong yesterday, gaining 2 to 468p after going ex-dividend.
Some stability returned to Burmah Castrol as the market made a belated
response to news late last Friday that two of the company's directors had
bought additional shares in the company.
Burmah shares fell over four per cent last week as the market focused on a
severe profits warning by Brent Chemicals. Yesterday, Burmah Castrol stock
edged up 3 to 691p, albeit in relatively thin turnover.
Mr Brian Hardy, Burmah's finance director, bought 1,000 shares at 689p and
Mr JM Fry, managaging director, bought 5,000 shares at 688p.
Leading oil shares were disappointing, according to dealers, as the market
continued to worry about the forthcoming Opec meeting, scheduled for June 8.
But NatWest Securities said two of the three key factors which drive the
sector 'looked quite promising'.
NatWest saw a good chance of oil prices firming after the Opec meeting,
'perhaps towards Dollars 20 a barrel, amid fears of plans for higher energy
taxes in the US and Europe and a seasonal pick up in oil demand'. The broker
also pointed to higher world refining margins, currently at Dollars 3.58 a
barrel, compared with the Dollars 2.79 achieved in the first quarter.
NatWest maintained its positive stance on BP, describing the shares as
'still the best recovery story', but said the market was still
over-optimistic about Shell. BP eased to 307p while Shell edged up 3 to
607p.
Second-line oils attracted interest, especially Clyde which rose 2 1/2 to
50p after 750,000 shares changed hands.
British Steel was one of the market's most active stocks with some 7.7m
shares were traded during the session.
The shares burst through the 100p barrier for the first time since November
1991 and closed a net 3 1/4 higher at 102 3/4 p, with dealers citing last
week's news of the closure of several steel plants in Germany as the main
reason for the upturn in the stock. Steel was also the most heavily traded
stock option where the equivalent of more than 7m shares changed hands.
The company, scheduled to report preliminary results towards the end of next
month, is in its 'closed season', and therefore unable to disclose
information to the market.
British Steel shares have staged a remarkable recovery since reaching their
all-time low of 46 1/2 p last November. The stock has been bolstered by a
series of European steel price increases, with more expected in the autumn.
Reuters Holdings gained 17 to 1310p as further strength in the New York
market helped internationally traded stocks.
BAT Industries, which also has a big exposure in the US, rose 8 to 845p. The
tobacco and insurance group is to issue over 1.5bn new shares as a result of
its planned capitalisation issue and its enhanced scrip alternative
proposal.
A profits downgrading depressed Lloyds Bank which closed 5 off at 536p on
relatively good turnover of 3.2m. NatWest, reflecting the successful cash
raising in the US, via the issue of Dollars 250m preference shares, edged up
2 to 475p.
The latest burst of strength in the Hong Kong market triggered renewed
buying of HSBC, which moved up 10 to 615p.
TSB improved 2 more to 185p with dealers still talking about the likely sale
of the bank's Hill Samuel arm.
British Airways rose 10 1/2 to 307 1/2 p ex-rights after recent weakness.
Doubts hanging over the stock were cleared last week when BA announced a
rights issue after months of speculation.
Property group UK Land was forced for the second time this year to issue a
statement saying it knew of no reason why its shares had risen. They closed
9 up at 37p. In February, UK Land responded to a 4p rise to 30p by reminding
the market that there was a deficit of shareholders' funds on March 311992
of Pounds 31.9m and that restructuring talks were still taking place. It
made a loss of Pounds 17.1m for the 18 months to March 31. Dealers said they
were equally mystified by the shares' rise.
Carlton Communications gained 6 in pre-market trading after reporting
half-year profits of Pounds 55.1m, in line with most expectations. However,
once the reassurance had been felt there was nothing else to latch on to and
the shares were pulled back to close a penny down at 733p.

<TEXT>
Broker support for BTR the industrial holding company, after the
announcement of a Chinese bottling plant deal, pushed the shares up.
The company yesterday confirmed that its Australian subsidiary BTR Nylex had
completed a Dollars 270m (Pounds 175.3m) agreement to buy two glass
container plants in Guangzhou and Shanghai.
Following the announcement, Hoare Govett, broker to BTR Nylex, published a
buy recommendation. Mr David Ireland, who travelled in China with BTR's
chief executive Mr Alan Jackson, predicted sales of ADollars 500m a year
within five years as a result of the deal. He said China was the third
largest beer drinking country in the world after the US and Germany and yet
the per capita intake was only 7 litres a year compared with 140 in Germany.
BTR shares closed 4 higher at 596p.

FT  25 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Another blow for Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGED recommendation on Glaxo by a leading investment bank prompted a
turnaround in the stock and also added to market worries over prospects for
the Zeneca rights issue. The analyst's move highlighted the fragile nature
of the sector and the vulnerability of the impending Pounds 1.3bn rights
issue from Zeneca, the bioscience arm of ICI.
Glaxo was up 16p in the morning on the back of positive reports in the
weekend press. Then, Credit Suisse First Boston moved its recommendation to
sell from buy. The advice was aimed chiefly at US investors and when New
York opened, the shares ticked back in London to close unchanged at 629p.
Mr Robin Campbell of CSFB believes investors should be more concerned over
Glaxo's dependence on its ulcer drug Zantac, which is likely to be
threatened in the US by the arrival of cheaper rival products. He believes
the loss of Zantac sales could wipe Pounds 400m a year from Glaxo's total
turnover by 1995.
Potential sellers of pharmaceuticals stocks, which are already unsettled by
worries over US healthcare reforms, needed little further encouragement. Any
hopes that Zeneca might stage a recovery yesterday from recent weakness were
dashed as analysts and marketmakers began to express increasing concern
about next week's rights issue.
The Zeneca rights price of 600p a share contains a hefty 27.5p dividend but
if the ex-rights price falls below 600p there is every possibility that a
large amount of the shares offered will be left with the underwriters. Any
take-up of less than 80 per cent would result in a significant drag on the
stock and the sector. Zeneca ex-rights fell 3 to 622p while the nil-paid
lost 5 to 30p. ICI 'new' eased 2 to 622p and the existing ICI slid 3 to
1260p.

after Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the new economy minister, said that
monetary policy will continue to aim at cutting rates.

FT  25 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks rise on lower bond
yields and gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A FALL in longer-dated bond yields and lower gold prices helped US stocks
post modest gains yesterday, despite reports that the Federal Reserve has
shifted the emphasis of monetary policy toward a raising of interest rates,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.95 at 3,507.78. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 1.89 at 447.73, while the
Amex composite finished 1.17 lower at 431.69, and the Nasdaq composite up
0.41 at 694.70. NYSE trading volume was light at 198m shares.
After last week's wild gyrations, the markets opened amid a considerable
degree of confusion and uncertainty about the near-term outlook for stocks.
That outlook appeared to darken yesterday morning when newspaper reports
said that the Fed's policy-making Open Market committee had voted at its
meeting last week to prepare for a possible increase in short-term interest
rates because of growing concern about the threat of revived inflation.
The suggestion that short-term rates could go higher would normally derail
equity market sentiment. Yet, after last Friday's 30-point decline,
investors were more inclined to buy, rather than sell, stocks. A rise in
bond prices, which brought down long yields, helped, as did a fall in gold
prices. A series of computerised buy programs also contributed to the
advance. After posting a 21-point gain mid-morning, however, the Dow slipped
back into negative territory mid-afternoon before staging a late rally.
Among individual stocks, Kellogg dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 53 7/8 in
busy trading after the company said that it expected second quarter earnings
to come in about 10 per cent below the 68 cents a share earned at the same
stage of 1992. Quaker Oats, fell 1 3/8 to Dollars 72 1/2 , fell in sympathy.
Some big computer stocks were in fine form , as they continued to make up
new ground in the wake of recent surprisingly good figures from
Hewlett-Packard. IBM rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 49 3/4 , Hewlett-Packard
added Dollars 2 to Dollars 85 5/8 , and Motorola firmed Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 80 1/8 . Others in the sector, however, did not fare so well.
Digital Equipment gave up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 46 and Compaq lost Dollars
 3/8 at Dollars 57 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq market, Amgen fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 in volume
of 3.5m shares after the brokerage house, Hambrecht &amp; Quist, lowered its
rating on the California biotechnology company's stock from 'hold' to
'sell'.
CANADA was closed for a public holiday yesterday.

FT  25 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris rallies late on seventh
interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISCAL easing, or the prospect of it, affected a number of bourses
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS took time to react to a further cut in domestic interest rates, the
seventh since the new administration took office, but a late rally saw the
CAC-40 index gain 24.5 or 1.3 per cent to 1,861.37. Turnover was some
FFr2.4bn on the first day of the new account.
The rate cut came as a surprise. Most market participants had not been
expecting a further decline until a fresh move is made by the Bundesbank.
However, the recent strength of the franc enabled the central bank to go
ahead.
Weekend reports that the government plans to extend privatisation candidates
to include, among others, Renault and Unisor, the steel group, also lifted
sentiment.
Among the day's most active stocks, Total benefited from news that oil tests
in Colombia had been successful. The shares advanced FFr13 to FFr262. The
report helped Elf which gained FFr5.30 to FFr374.
Peugeot went against the trend, down FFr5 to FFr525, after Mr Jacques
Calvet, its chairman, forecast that French new car sales will show an even
sharper slowdown in May than in April.
FRANKFURT was short of upbeat news, and unhappy with the corporate stories
it did hear, Volkswagen falling DM4.90 to DM313.50, and VEW DM7 to DM256
among second liners. The DAX ended 7.48 lower at 1,603.09 in turnover down
from DM5.4bn to DM4.7bn.
VW, still relatively close to the 1993 high it hit on the appointment of Mr
Ignacio Lopez, the former General Motors cost-cutter, and its prospects for
corporate restructuring, fell on profit-taking and the legal row between GM
and Mr Lopez over the alleged removal of company documents.
VEW, the German utility heavily committed to gas-fired electricity
production, and thought to be a prospect for strategic gains in fuel supply,
dropped from last week's 1993 high of DM267 as flat profits were accompanied
by an unchanged dividend.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by strength in Wall Street and a recovery in Unilever,
up Fl 2.80 at Fl 192.50 after last week's suggestions of a downturn in the
European food sector.
The CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 105.1. Heineken was another winner, up Fl
1.20 to Fl 179.10, while the publishing sector was weaker as some investors
took profits: Elsevier slipped 20 cents to Fl 128.30 and VNU 40 cents to Fl
119.00.
ZURICH featured a SFr12 gain to SFr619 for Swissair registered as the SMI
index rose 3.9 to 2,237.4.
Holderbank, the cement producer, closed SFr1 lower at SFr651 after it
forecast at least maintained profits in 1993, and mooted a higher dividend.
In a mixed insurance sector, Baloise registered rose SFr20 to SFr1,780 ahead
of today's annual news conference.
MILAN fell back on late profit-taking which eroded some of the day's early
gains. The Comit index fell a marginal 1.21 to 577.24.
Fondiaria, the insurance group, put on L922 to L30,215 in spite of denying
weekend press reports that it might be sold.
Fiat, which is due to announce 1992 results next Monday, gained L50 to
L6,625 on the kerb.
Other movers included Montedison, up L9 to L1,170 and Banca Commerciale
Italiana which rose L99 to L5,555.
MADRID reported interest rate hopes, and futures-inspired buying which kept
the general index in respectable territory, up 0.34 to 256.67 as turnover
eased from Pta23bn to Pta16.9bn. Banesto fell Pta30 to Pta2,175 after the
weekend news that it would pass its final dividend for 1992, and seek a New
York stock exchange listing after a pending Pta130bn (Dollars 1.04bn)
capital raising operation.
BRUSSELS saw large declines in banking stocks as the Bel-20 index fell 8.56
to 1,204.65. Turnover, at around BFr1.8bn, was enhanced by heavy trade in
the electricity utility, Electrabel, which fell BFr30 to BFr6,100 in 44,100
shares.
Analysts blamed profit-taking as the banking sector fell by over 1 per cent.
Generale de Banque ended BFr140 lower at BFr7,500, Kredietbank BFr100 at
BFr6,500 and Bruxelles Lambert BFr50 at BFr3,600.
STOCKHOLM could not sustain Friday's strong advance as both Astra and
Ericsson weakened. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 5.3 to 1,087.4 in
turnover of SKr1bn.
Ericsson B shares, which accounted for some SKr170m of total turnover,
slipped SKr4 to SKr316 while Astra was off SKr2 at SKr738.
OSLO's all-share index fell 2.17 to 474.91, but the market showed an upward
trend just before the close after the central bank announced that it was
cutting its key overnight lending rate from 7.75 to 7.50 per cent.

FT  25 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Bourses decouple from volatile Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Technical analysts were saying last week that European bourses had decoupled
from the Dow. Record highs on Wall Street on Wednesday and Thursday seemed
to engender no answering enthusiasm on this side of the Atlantic.
Falls in Europe's three biggest equity markets - Germany, the UK and France
 -were instrumental in reducing Europe's performance to a slight decline
which, with Japan in average form, left the US mainly responsible for the
0.8 per cent gain in the FT-Actuaries World index in local currency terms.
The Dow fell back on Friday, on profit-taking and under technical pressure,
but the global strategy team at Nomura, headed by Mr Nicholas Knight, is
bullish.
They say that cash had been stockpiled on the sidelines ready to hit the US
equity market at the first downside opportunity, and that this is exactly
what happened. 'The average mutual fund has 10 per cent liquidity,' they
argue, 'twice the amount necessary to meet at least the initial redemptions
that were seen over the weekend of the crash in 1987.' Nomura is increasing
its weighting in the US equity market from 32.3 to 36.3 per cent, reducing
Spain, Hong Kong and Australia in the process.
Europe was marked by renewed enthusiasm for Italy and Finland, the former on
interest rate hopes and the latter after a strike threatening exporting
companies was called off. Thursday's Ascension Day holiday, extended to two
days in Paris and Brussels, gave most bourses an excuse to mark time.
Germany was the worst performer in Europe last week. The UBS global research
letter, edited by Mr Guy Rigden, says that, with Italy, Germany has yet to
face the full impact of severe fiscal retrenchment and consequent falling
domestic demand. 'We have cut our estimate of German profit growth to minus
30 per cent in 1993,' say UBS.

FT  25 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong improves by
another 1.5% ahead of talks

EQUITIES fell in the final minutes of trading as stock index futures
contracts weakened and investment trust fund purchases lost momentum, writes
Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 81.31 lower at 20,476.16, after trading between
20,453.57 and 20,691.20. The Topix Index of all first section issues slipped
2.43 at 1,610.69 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.33 to
1,241.69.
Volume was 400m shares compared to Friday's 425m. Advances equaled declines
at 505, with 168 issues unchanged.
Brokers said that favourable money supply data for April, released after
Friday's close, which showed a 0.6 per cent rise from the previous year,
kept activity firm early in the session.
However, clearer signs of an economic recovery are needed to motivate
investors to enter the market. 'We need more good figures,' said Mr Ryoji
Tanaka, head of Japanese equity trading at Kidder Peabody International. But
investors should become more confident about entering the market as the end
of the earnings results season approaches, he added.
Technical analysts predict that the Nikkei average's short-term range will
remain between 20,250 to 20,600 in the absence of incentives.
Good earnings results encouraged market participants to buy shares in the
shipbuilding sector. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the day's most active
issue, rose Y1 to Y735, Hitachi Zosen Y6 to Y609 and Mitsui Engineering and
Shipbuilding Y2 to Y477.
Non-ferrous metals stocks continued to rise in tandem with the gains in the
gold price overseas. Mitsui Mining and Smelting put on Y19 to Y563, Dowa
Mining Y7 to Y667 and Mitsubishi Materials Y6 to Y521.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose after it filed for government approval
to increase the charge rate of public telephones on Friday. The shares rose
Y16,000 to Y985,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 22.49 higher at 22,745.07, in volume of
23.4m shares.
Roundup
APART from another impressive performance from Hong Kong the region was
generally muted.
HONG KONG continued its record run, the Hang Seng index rising 106.43 or 1.5
per cent to 7,276.39 in turnover of HKDollars 4.7bn.
The announcement of the fourth round of Sino-British talks scheduled for
Friday encouraged buying, some commentators noted.
Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong topped the active list, rising HKDollars
1.10 and 30 cents respectively to HKDollars 21.90 and HKDollars 28.00.
Investors were also seen switching into utilities: HK Telecom rose 30 cents
to HKDollars 11.50 while China Light added HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars
39.75.
SINGAPORE fell back but some observers commented that overall sentiment
remains positive. The Straits Times industrial index lost 6.71 to 1,855.15
in turnover of SDollars 462m.
Amcol Holdings jumped 31 cents to SDollars 3.26 after giving details of its
involvement in an Indonesian satellite project.
SEOUL was slightly firmer for the seventh consecutive session in spite of
some profit-taking which erased an early 6 point gain. The composite index
added 0.57 to 733.91 in turnover of Won706.8bn.
TAIWAN reversed early gains to close lower on late selling. The weighted
index, which had risen 25 points, ended 36.51 lower at 4,258.92, its fifth
straight fall. Turnover was TDollars 15.3bn, the lowest in a full session
since January.
Conflict within the ruling Nationalist party and recent poor economic data,
including a cut in this year's official GNP forecast, continued to affect
sentiment.
However, Hualon, the textile group, went against the trend, gaining 80 cents
to TDollars 31.10 on reports that a consortium of local banks had agreed a
loan arrangement of TDollars 3bn.
MANILA moved slightly ahead although activity was reported to have been
subdued. The composite index rose 5.61 to 1,577.71 in turnover of 202.4m
pesos. Philippine National Bank was among the day's biggest gainers, rising
5 pesos to 249.
KUALA LUMPUR fell back on profit-taking, the composite index losing 4.87 to
724.48. Volume declined sharply to 431m shares against Friday's 642m.
Among the actives Tanjong shed 70 cents to MDollars 13.40.
AUSTRALIA slipped towards the close in spite of a strong performance by gold
stocks.
The All Ordinaries index lost 10.1 to 1,685.5 with banking and transport
particularly weak. Turnover was ADollars 302.3m.
In the gold sector, Newcrest gained 13 cents to ADollars 4.18, Placer
Pacific climbed 5 cents to ADollars 2.70 and Poseidon Gold rose 6 cents to
ADollars 3.01.
NEW ZEALAND shrugged off a weak opening to finish stronger with a gain in
the NZSE-40 index of 9.67 to 1,628.27. Turnover was NZDollars 33.5m.
Air New Zealand rose 10 cents to NZDollars 2.20 on strong overseas demand.
Elsewhere Fletcher Challenge rose 1 cent to NZDollars 2.65 while Brierley
eased 1 cent to NZDollars 1.06.
BANGKOK lost nearly 2 per cent after the SET index fell below the 850 level,
closing off 17.14 at 841.23. However, turnover was a below average Bt2.6bn.
Some analysts commented that recent disappointing first quarter results had
depressed sentiment.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Lower French rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France set the tone for lower interest rates throughout Europe
by shaving a quarter point off its intervention rate, writes Peter Marsh.
The French authorities' freedom for manoeuvre was helped by the continuing
weakness of the D-Mark which gave further signs of losing its role as the
key currency within the European exchange rate mechanism.
At the close of trading last night in Europe three-month interest rates in
four countries - the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Ireland - were below
the corresponding figure in Germany.
This unusual state of affairs highlights how some countries are finding they
can institute easier borrowing conditions, without necessarily having to
wait for the Bundesbank to pave the way.
The Bank of France cut its intervention rate to 7.5 per cent from 7.75 per
cent at a securities repurchase tender held yesterday.
In Belgium, the central bank took similar action, cutting its seven-day
advances rate by 10 basis points to 7.2 per cent following the cut announced
last Wednesday in its central rate, also by 10 basis points to 7.2 per cent.
Signs that lower interest rates across Europe will become increasingly
necessary during the rest of the year were underlined by a gloomy statement
from Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, warning of 'negative
growth' for the European Community.
With German three-money money being quoted at 7.5 per cent, the equivalent
rate in the Netherlands last night was 6.93 per cent. In Belgium, France and
Ireland, the corresponding interest rates were 7.12 per cent, 7.31 per cent
and 7.44 per cent.
The monetary authorities' room to reduce borrowing rates in these countries
is directly linked to yet more signs of D-Mark fragility. The German
currency, third from the bottom in the ERM grid, has a divergence indicator
of minus 23 per cent against its central Ecu rate, compared with plus seven
per cent two weeks ago.
In Britain, the Bank of England provided the money market with Pounds 950m
of early assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds
1.25bn. The Bank bought Pounds 950m of bills for resale to the market. Later
on, the Bank took total assistance for the day to Pounds 1.4bn.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar up on rate speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION about a tightening in US interest rates pushed up the dollar
against a D-Mark weakened by increasing signs of economic slowdown in
Germany, writes Peter Marsh.
The French franc traded comfortably, in spite of a further cut in French
interest rates which promises to head off the possibility of a further
faltering in economic activity.
Sterling gained against the D-Mark but lost ground against a dollar
strengthened by a newspaper report that the US Federal Reserve might soon
raise interest rates to damp inflationary pressures.
Meanwhile the D-Mark continued to sag, as investors weighed up the
possibility of a deep recession in the German economy this year.
In spite of the Bundesbank sounding the usual messages that it will think
long and hard before cutting interest rates further, many in financial
markets think a steady easing in borrowing conditions in Germany is assured
in the coming months.
The dollar climbed nearly 1 pfennig on the day against the German currency,
closing in London at DM1.6365. Investors took profits after the US currency
climbed during European trading to just under DM1.64.
Hitting the headlines in a quiet day's trading was the decision by the
French government to cut the Bank of France's intervention rate to 7.5 per
cent from 7.75 per cent. The French franc traded at FFr3.3665 per D-Mark
after the news, from FFr3.3661 earlier. It closed at 3.365, little changed
on the day.
Sentiment about the outlook for the D-Mark was helped somewhat by tough
comments from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, about the
government taking 'decisive action' next year to cut its mounting budget
deficit. However, that failed to prevent the yen hitting another new high
against the German currency. It closed at Y67.37 per D-Mark, compared to
Y67.90 on Friday night.
The guilder also hit a five year peak against the D-Mark, being quoted in
London last night at NFl 1.119 per D-Mark. There was strong speculation that
the Dutch monetary authorities might soon decide on a further bout of
interest rate easing.
After the pound's 4 pfennig rise against the Germany currency last week, it
continued its rise yesterday, closing in London at DM2.5125, up half a
pfennig. Against the dollar sterling closed in European hours at Dollars
1.5350, just over half a cent down on the day.
Foreign exchange dealers took little notice of a European Community report
over the weekend approving the idea of new checks to stop a repeat of last
year's currency crisis. However, the absence of significant strains in the
European exchange rate mechanism pushed the escudo slightly firmer at the
top of the grid. It closed at Es94.60 per D-Mark versus Es94.70 at the close
on Friday.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Small sugar surplus seen for
1992-3
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP between world sugar production and consumption in 1992-93 is now
widely expected to be a deficit, but one London company has bucked the trend
with a forecast of a surplus, albeit of only 560,000 tonnes.
ED &amp; F Man puts world production at 111.8m tonnes for 1992-93, and
consumption at 111.3m tonnes. However, production figures are calculated
according to each individual country's crop year, while consumption is
calculated between October and September.
Man's latest sugar market report notes that if production is worked out over
a uniform October-September season, a deficit of 313,000 tonnes emerges.
This is still much lower than last week's deficit estimates of 2.84m tonnes
from Czarnikow, another London trade house, and 1.61m tonnes from the
International Sugar Organisation.
Man points out that production estimates appear to be falling into line, but
'there is still much discrepancy surrounding the consumption numbers.' It
describes the market, which has soared on supply factors such as the falls
in Thai and Cuban production, as 'bereft of consumption news'. This has led
to resistance to any further upward price movement.
Nevertheless, Man believes the market in raw sugar is likely to remain
tight, especially as the emerging southern hemisphere crops for 1993-94 from
Australia, South Africa and Brazil have all been hit by drought.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc mines 'under acute stress'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZINC MINES are suffering acute financial stress because of low prices for
the metal and because revenues from by-products such as lead and cadmium are
also seriously depressed, according to Mr David Humphreys, economist at RTZ
Corporation, the world's biggest mining company.
Prices for three metals languish at or near their lowest levels in real
terms. Some smelters, far from giving a financial credit for the cadmium
content of concentrate (an intermediate material), are imposing financial
penalties if it is present, he said.
So far this year cuts have been made at zinc mines owned by MIM, Pasminco
and Aztec Mining in Australia and by Noranda, Cominco, Curragh Resources and
RTZ in North America. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group predicts
mine output will fall this year by 6 per cent or more from the 1992 level.
But, because stocks of zinc concentrate are so large, this will not in
itself be enough to choke off production of refined metal from the smelters,
which have good financial reasons for continuing output at a high level.
Mr Humphreys said: 'Without further smelter cuts, zinc metal production is
on course for a further increase, largely from Latin America and non-Japan
Asia.'
If prices were to rise and stocks - at present representing more than 11
weeks' supply compared with the maximum of six weeks that the industry
needed - to fall, smelter production cuts were urgently required. 'Exchange
rates and the condition of the domestic market suggest that cuts will need
to be in Europe,' he said. In Europe 18 smelters, one third of the world
total, chased the same raw materials and the same customers.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low price forces lead output
cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE DRIFT in lead prices to the lowest levels for nearly seven years sparked
a cut in production by a leading European smelter yesterday.
Metaleurop said it would stop production at smelters in France and Germany
between June 15 and August 15, cutting refined output by 50,000 tonnes.
The company said it wanted to reduce oversupply in markets depressed by
economic weakness in western Europe and exceptionally high shipments from
eastern Europe. It intends to take the latter complaint to the EC Commission
in Brussels.
Yesterday the three-month lead price on the London Metal Exchange moved
ahead by more than Pounds 9 to Pounds 274.625 a tonne after a fresh 6 3/4
 year low last Friday after LME warehouse stocks rose to a record 254,125
tonnes.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, said the Metaleurop decision
crystallised 'the debilitating impact of eastern bloc shipments to the
West'.
Imports from these countries were a record 173,000 tonnes in 1992. Chinese
exports were up to 73,000 tonnes from 9,000 tonnes in 1991; Polish exports
were at 14,000 tonnes from 8,000 tonnes; and CIS exports were 70,000 tonnes
from 45,000.
Mr Moore pointed out that in 1980 the West exported 123,000 tonnes to the
East. Consumption in the West last year, fell 0.9 per cent to 4.43m tonnes.
In dollar terms three-month lead fell from Dollars 450 a tonne at the
beginning of April to Dollars 404 last week. Yesterday it closed at Dollars
423 a tonne, equivalent to 19.20 cents a lb. The average cost of producing
refined lead in the West is thought to be between 23 and 24 cents a lb.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Struggle to fix EC farm price
deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers will today attempt to forge a
compromise on this year's farm price package, against a formidable list of
concessions demanded by France, and opposition among several member states
to increases in milk quota for Italy.
The European Commission fears the demands could break the EC farm budget and
risk unravelling last year's painstakingly negotiated reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy.
'It is not so much that the demands are massive,' one Commission official
said, 'but that the budget is so tight now that any increase could be fatal.
Plus (increases in) aid risks disrupting CAP reform.'
The farm budget, expected to come in at around Ecus35bn this year, is under
growing strain because of the currency turmoil of the past nine months.
The price package put forward by Brussels is, on the face of it, anodyne, in
that it derives almost wholly from the decisions on CAP reform taken last
year. But the attempts to chip away at it could turn into a challenge to the
the reform itself. France wants a 50 per cent increase in the amount of
compensation paid to oilseed producers for the land they take out of
production.
And in response to the CAP reform's injunction to oilseeds and cereals
producers to set aside 15 per cent of their land on a five-year rotational
basis, Paris wants the period of rotation cut to two years. The Commission
recently raised the set aside percentage to 20 per cent for land which is
not rotated, to prevent farmers from maximising production by leaving only
their least fertile land fallow.
Senior Commission officials concede that France, in the end, will be allowed
to pay its farmers additional national - rather than EC - subsidies for set
aside. But limiting the quantity will be vital if the new CAP is not to be
undermined, especially if there is a knock-on effect through other member
states.
France also wants to loosen the new limits on buying in surplus beef to the
EC's growing meat stockpiles; a reduction in the proposed 5 per cent cut in
butter prices; and a restoration of the 4.7 per cent cut in EC milk quota
made in 1989, although this was thereafter fully compensated.
The milk demand, to help farmers in France's mountain areas, got backing
from Ireland, which wants to buttress its smaller dairy (and beef) farmers.
But it further complicated the row over Italian milk quotas. Italy, in
principle, is to get an extra 900,000 tonnes of milk quota, if it can
demonstrate that it is cutting 1.6m tonness of its now 2.5m tonnes over
quota output. The Benelux countries and the UK remain to be convinced that
it is on target - unlike Spain and Greece which negotiated similar
concessions in exchange for reducing the overproduction.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Udokan development plan is
being renegotiated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN winner of the Russia's first international mining tender is now
renegotiating almost every aspect of plans to develop the country's biggest
copper deposit, including the buy-out of its foreign partner.
Mr Andrei Chuguyevsky, whose Arter group holds 35 per cent of the Udokan
Mining Company which won the tender, is acting partly under pressure from
the Russian authorities, who now want the copper concentrate to be smelted
in Russia, rather than in China as initially proposed.
This is one of the reasons why Mr Chuguyevsky says he is currently
negotiating to buy out Mr Eddie Wong, the Hong Kong businessman who holds 45
per cent of UMC and set up the Chinese end of the deal.
Mr Chuguyevsky has also begun looking for alternative sources of financing
for the project, which was to have relied partly on the sale of 200,000
tonnes of concentrate a year to China. He intends to dispense with the
services of Allen &amp; Co, the private New York investment bank lined up by Mr
Wong to raise some of the capital, and has started talking to other western
banks, including Morgan Grenfell, as well as the International Finance
Corporation, the World Bank's private investment arm.
Having defeated major western mining companies in a tender organised by
Goldman Sachs, Mr Chuguyevsky's challenge now is to raise western finance
for an all-Russian project. The turnabout illustrates how everything, to
quote a western banker, is 'negotiable' in Russia's investment climate.
The licence agreement stipulated that he appoint a world-class western
company as project operator. This was widely expected to be Fluor Daniel,
the US mining company which helped draw up a pre-feasibility study on the
Udokan deposit. But Mr Chuguyevsky has begun talking to Australia's BHP, one
of his competitors in the tender. He said he would appoint a project
operator only after a feasibility study which would take more than a year.
One problem was that though foreign companies were keen to extract
guarantees of tax concessions from the Russian government, these would not
be forthcoming in advance. Five Russian enterprises have already undertaken
to smelt the copper.

GOLD fixed slightly lower than its morning setting in the afternoon on the
London bullion market, taking the steam out of the overnight run-up in
prices for all precious metals, dealers said. Technically, gold's outlook
remains positive. ZINC broke lower on the LME, ending near fresh six-year
lows. Selling pressure at around Dollars 970 a tonne for three-month metal
eventually triggered the expected sell stops, driving prices down to Dollars
957 at one stage. Fundamentals remain weak, with supply continuing to exceed
demand, and the market is in need of cuts in refined production to prevent
further losses. TIN touched fresh 17-month lows, and traders expect further
losses soon. If recent contract lows near Dollars 5,450 a tonne for
three-month metal are breached, the market could fall to Dollars 5,300 - the
lowest in real terms since the early 1970s. London robusta COFFEE ended
around the day's lows on profit taking after an earlier advance. Dealers
said moves between Latin American producers towards setting up an alliance
to harmonise polices would have little market impact unless they led to firm
agreements to withhold supplies.

ENVIRONMENTAL groups have criticised growing US reliance on chemical
fertilizers and pesticides and called on the government to show 'bold
leadership' in pushing farmers to cut the use of agrichemicals, writes Lisa
Bransten in Washington.
Programmes approved by Congress in 1990 to develop alternative ways to
protect crops remain underfunded, say the environmentalists.
A study by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy reported that the volume
of pesticides used on US crops rose 125 per cent between 1966 and 1991,
despite a slight fall after 1988. A parallel study by the World Wildlife
Federation reported that Sweden and Denmark cut pesticide use 25-50 per cent
in the late 1980s due to government-sponsored reduction programs.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: High costs of producing nothing
 -Even those who sent in Domesday forms face an uncertain future / Farmers'
Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the form-filling, the public relations battle. It was, of course,
entirely predictable that the blame for the apparent nonsense incorporated
into the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy would rebound on farmers.
The proposed payment of EC taxpayers' funds to Community farmers in order to
persuade them not to grow crops was bound to attract derision from the antis
of both agriculture and the EC itself.
Indeed it is not so long ago that I was in the habit of deriding similar
policies in force for many years in the US. In after-dinner speeches I used
to quote a letter claimed to have been sent by an American farmer to his
senator.
It was based on the (inaccurate, but only slightly) premiss that US farmers
could get government grants 'for not raising hogs. So I am going into the
not raising hogs business next year,' the letter writer continued. 'What I
want to know is what is the best kind of farm not to raise hogs on and what
are the best kind of hogs not to raise?' And it went on to describe the
difficulty the fictitious writer ancitipated in 'keeping an inventory of how
many hogs I have not raised'. It ended with the following postscript: 'Can I
raise 10 or 12 hogs on the side while I am in the not raising hogs business
 -just enough to get a few sides of bacon to eat?'
A few years ago that 'letter' was guaranteed to raise a good laugh among a
British farming audience. But I have not used it recently because today we
too are in the not raising commodities businessand it might not go down so
well.
So, having spent much of the last month with cold towels wrapped around
their heads or queueing for expensive Ordnance Survey maps of their farms in
order to complete long and complicated forms to qualify for such aid under
The Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), farmers should
hardly be surprised that attacks on them have already begun.
First in line, again predictably, is the softest landowning target of all,
the Royal Family. 'The queen and Prince Charles' thundered a popular Sunday
paper recently, 'are set to receive nearly Pounds 300,000 of taxpayers'
money this year.' Of that, alleged the Sunday Express, Pounds 60,000 is for
set-aside, the policy of paying farmers to grow nothing. The front page
article failed adequately to explain that the remainder must, if the figures
were accurate, be compensation for cuts in guaranteed prices which also
formed part of last year's CAP reform package.
As a reluctant participant in the same scheme I must avoid defending it. But
to criticise the queen, or any other farmer, for claiming compensation for
being forced to 'do nothing' on some of their land is equivalent to saying
that people who invest their savings in a building society should not
receive interest. The fact is that the owners of land are as entitled to
earn income from their asset as the owners of cash or shares and when that
entitlement is denied, or reduced, by government decree they should also be
entitled to compensation.
In any event it is hardly accurate to suggest that the cash will go to
farmers for doing nothing. Claimants are required to keep set-aside land
trimmed and free of harmful weeds. And when the time comes to plough and
plant another crop the costs of this preparation of the soil will be much
higher than if the land had been regularly cultivated.
It should also be understood that although the set-aside scheme is
advertised as voluntary, it is in fact virtually compulsory. For farmers who
do not participate deny themselves the right to compensation for commodity
prices which will be 30 per cent lower by 1995. Few could survive such a cut
in revenue - given that incomes have already fallen by more than 50 per cent
in real terms during the last decade - especially when they face significant
increases in the costs of imported inputs as last September's devaluation of
sterling begins to bite.
So, like the queen and her agents, most farmers concluded they had little
alternative to setting land aside and therefore attempted to complete the
so-called Domesday forms claiming compensation by the May 15 deadline.
But some have not done so. Of the 240,000 forms sent out, only 155,000 had
been returned by the due date. The rest probably includes some who have been
unable to obtain the necessary documentation, in the form of maps in
particular, in time. They risk reductions in entitlement to aid of 1 per
cent per working day after May 15, up to a maximum of 20 days, after which
they lose their rights altogether. The deficit in returned forms also
includes small farmers who, in spite of massive publicity, have not realised
what is at stake.
The other day I heard of a 150-acre neighbour who had not filled in his IACS
forms 'on principle'. At a rough guess he has lost the right to about Pounds
6,000 of aid this year which is probably more than the annual profit he has
made during the last few years. Even a small hobby farmer with six acres
near here stood to lose Pounds 300 for failing to complete his forms, in
spite of certain small farm exemptions.
The majority of British farmers who have done what was required, however,
can now ride their weed mowers and wait for the money to arrive. As they do
so they will contemplate with little pleasure the set-aside fields they are
trimming and which they would rather have seen growing crops; the
possibility that should there eventually be a Gatt agreement the area of
set-aside they will be forced to take out of production could be doubled;
and the very real risk that compensation for all this may not last.
For the irony is that the reformed CAP is likely to cost EC taxpayers
significantly more than the flawed original. It will take very good PR
indeed for the package to survive. Especially as farmers, the apparent
beneficiaries, don't like it either.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Bund prices fall as hopes of further rate
cuts recede

GERMAN government bonds closed lower as hopes of further cuts in interest
rates receded and the market prepared for more medium-dated supply.
Bund prices fell in reaction to comments from Mr Lothar Mueller, Bavarian
state central bank president and Bundesbank Council member, over the
weekend. Mr Mueller said that in view of the pace of money supply growth and
the public sector debt, the Bundesbank would have to pause before easing
rates further.
The 6 3/4 per cent bond due 2003 opened at 99.18 and fell to 98.89 and the
Liffe bund futures contract dropped from a high of 93.80 to 93.68 by late
afternoon.
Dealers said the market remains bearish and investors would be waiting to
see the latest inflation figures, which are expected this week. Also
contributing to the market's poor mood is the prospect of new supply today ,
with dealers expecting DM4bn to DM6bn of four-year notes to be issued.
THE SURPRISE announcement of another cut in French interest rates yesterday
helped to lift French government bond prices at the short end, while other
maturities closed lower on profit-taking.
The Bank of France cut its key rates by a quarter point, which left the
intervention rate at 7.5 per cent and the five to 10-day rate at 8.5 per
cent.
'The franc seemed reasonably steady on the back of it,' said Mr Philip
Tyson, economist at Yamaichi International, adding that the market would be
looking for further rate cuts over the next few months.
The spread of 10-year French bonds over comparable bunds has narrowed to 27
basis points from 32 basis points, compared to 62 basis points at the end of
March. Among shorter-dated bonds, two-year notes now yield 6.43 per cent,
down from 6.44 per cent.
HIGHER-yielding markets continued to benefit from switching out of Germany
in the wake of the Danish referendum result.
In Spain, market participants will be watching for further signs of easing
this week. The Meffsa futures contract slipped from 88.48 to 88.40
yesterday.
In Italy, the short end remained firm while longer-dated issues weakened,
with the BTP futures contract falling from 99.72 to 99.53.
ACTIVITY in the UK government bond market remained muted ahead of tomorrow's
auction.
JAPANESE government bonds tumbled yesterday on fears of higher short-term US
interest rates and concern about the forthcoming Japanese bond auction.
The September futures contract dropped from its high of 106.60 to a low of
105.98 in Tokyo and continued to fall in London trading to reach 105.88.
Dealers said the market was upset by news reports suggesting the US Federal
Reserve may allow short-term interest rates to rise.
The finance ministry is expected to hold its auction of 10-year government
bonds today, and there was considerable speculation in the market about
whether the auction stock would be a further tranche of the existing No 153
issue or a new bond.
Dealers point out that a further tranche of the No 153 issue would help to
establish it as the new 10-year benchmark.
The No 153 has a 4.8 per cent coupon, but some dealers maintain that the
Japanese market has fallen back so much in recent weeks that the new auction
stock should carry a coupon of 4.9 per cent to reflect the shift in yields.
The yield on the No 145 opened at 4.64 per cent and closed at 4.665 per cent
after touching 4.735 per cent.
TALK of a possible tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve
depressed prices at the short end of the US Treasury bond market yesterday.
However, it no impact on the long end, where bonds posted solid gains in the
wake of falling gold prices and some short-covering by dealers.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  21/32 at 101
21/32 , yielding 6.986 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 7/16 , to yield 4.163 per cent.
After declining on foreign markets overnight, longer-dated securities
recovered when trading opened in New York as some dealers covered their
short positions in anticipation of a rally and others took the opportunity
to complete yield curve-flattening trades. Later in the day, bonds rose
further, aided by declining gold prices.
Short-dated securities, however, failed to rebound from early weakness,
which was the result of selling on press reports that policymakers at the
Fed's Open Market Committee meeting last week had voted to shift the
emphasis of monetary policy toward higher short-term interest rates because
of concerns about revived inflation.
THE French government is likely today to announce a special bond issue to
raise as much as FFr20bn, AP-DJ reports from Paris.
'If it's less than FFr10bn, that wouldn't be good. But if it's FFr20bn or
more, that would be considered a major success,' said a source close to the
government.
'You have to remember that, originally, the government was hoping to get
FFr30bn this year from privatisation receipts.'
A report in the French press yesterday claimed that prime minister Edouard
Balladur planned to announce the debt issue today.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Asian Development Bank prepares Dollars
500m 10-year issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ASIAN Development Bank is preparing to launch a Dollars 500m 10-year
issue following a series of roadshows in European financial markets.
The deal, jointly arranged by JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers, is expected to
emerge this week if market conditions prove favourable. Traders are
expecting the deal to be priced at a yield spread of 20 to 25 basis points
over the comparable Treasury yield.
The reception of an offering yesterday by the Nordic Investment Bank in the
nascent Dragon bond market suggested that there is still strong demand for
dollar bonds in south-east Asia, despite the recent weakening of the US
Treasury market .
NIB's Dollars 250m five-year issue, arranged by Goldman Sachs, was priced to
yield 20 basis points above the five-year US Treasury. Dealers said the
issue was several basis points too tight for European investors, but had
sold into south-east Asia.
Growing interest from south-east Asian investors in global bond offerings
lies at the root of the development of the locally-traded Dragon bond
market, pioneered by the Asian Development Bank. Dragon bonds are
essentially the same in structure as Eurobonds, except that they are listed
in Hong-Kong and Singapore and distributed and traded in the region. Because
investors in the area prefer to buy bonds which will be traded locally, they
are prepared to pay a tighter spread than for Eurobonds.
'Since NIB is active in lending to Asia, issuing in the Asian bond markets
is a logical step in expanding our relationships in the region,' said Mr
Thorsteinn Thorsteinsson, head of borrowing at the supranational bank.
Meanwhile, the European Investment Bank is currently considering launching a
Dollars 300 to Dollars 500m Dragon bond in the next few weeks. However, the
Dragon bond market is one of several options, an EIB official said.
Elsewhere, Inter-American Development Bank launched a FF1.2bn seven-year
issue via BNP Capital Markets, its first in the sector for 20-years. The
deal was swapped into fixed-rate yen.
In the Swiss franc market, Eurofima launched a Sfr400m 10-year issue via
Swiss Bank Corporation.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Futures regulator brings
charges against CBOT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEDERAL regulators have charged the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) with lax
financial monitoring and failure to enforce its own rules in an action that,
if successful, could result in more than Dollars 1m in fines for the world's
largest futures exchange.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the futures industry's
chief regulator in the US, made the 10-count administrative complaint
against the CBOT in connection with the August 1990 collapse of Stotler and
Company, a large Chicago-based clearing firm. At the time the firm failed,
Mr Karsten Mahlmann, who was a principal in Stotler, was also the chairman
of the CBOT.
Mr Mahlmann, who was not named in the complaint, subsequently resigned as
exchange chairman. The CFTC and the CBOT transferred 65,000 customer
accounts from Stotler to other firms in August 1990 to protect them from
losses.
Mr Patrick Arbor, CBOT chairman, said the CFTC's complaint lacked merit. He
said the CFTC was unfairly holding the exchange responsible for a member
firm that lied to its customers and regulators and altered reporting
documents sent to the exchange.
This is the first time the CFTC has charged the CBOT in a complaint, and the
action has serious implications. The CFTC has the right, if its charges
succeed, to delist the CBOT as an exchange. Few expect that to happen.
In a related complaint, Coopers and Lybrand, the international accountancy
firm, was charged with failing to perform adequate audits of Stotler during
the years 1988 and 1989, when the firm was undercapitalised by Dollars 1m
and Dollars 7.1m, respectively.
Coopers and Lybrand has settled its case with the CFTC, without
acknowledging guilt, by paying the sum of Dollars 500,000.
Also charged by the CFTC were Mr Thomas Egan, formerly chief executive of
Stotler, Mr Phillip Zarcone who had been chief financial officer of Stotler,
and Mr Thomas Kolter, an attorney and president of Stotler Funds, a money
management firm.
Mr Egan has settled his charges with the CFTC and has agreed to never engage
in customer related futures trading again.
Mr Dennis Klejna, head of the CFTC's enforcement division, said the
complaint came so long after Stotler's collapse because 'these are very
complicated financial cases with sweeping allegations'.
The CFTC in early August, 1990, obtained an injunction against Stotler to
keep it from using customer funds to shore up its capital base. At nearly
the same time the CFTC filed an administrative complaint against Stotler and
ordered its registration as a futures dealer to be revoked.
Attorneys for Coopers and Lybrand and Mr Zarcone could not be reached for
comment yesterday. Mr Kolter, who is representing himself in the case, also
could not be reached.

MR ROBERT PIRIE is stepping down as co-chairman and chief executive of
Rothschild North America, the US unit of investment bank NM Rothschild,
after more than a decade at the helm of the New York-based firm, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
In his place, Rothschild is establishing an office of the chairman,
consisting of Baron David de Rothschild, the Paris-based group chairman, Mr
Gerald Goldsmith, the president and chief operating officer of Rothschild
North America, and two other senior executives, Mr Wilbur Ross and Mr
Yves-Andre Istel.
Mr Pirie, 59, said he decided to step down because, after 11 years as chief
executive, it was time to move on. He said: 'Any good actor ought to know
when to leave the stage.'
He would not be drawn on his plans but said he would remain in the same
business. Mr Pirie has agreed to stay on as a non-executive director of the
bank and Rothschild North America.
During his 11 years at the helm of Rothschild in New York, Mr Pirie was an
adviser to the Reichmann brothers of Canada, who built the Olympia &amp; York
property empire, and Mr Robert Maxwell, the late publishing magnate.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: US marketmakers fight back
against the nerds - Small investors, defined as 'professional traders', are
upsetting some of Wall Street's biggest firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE wall of an office at the small upstate New York securities firm of
All-Tech Investment Group, a magazine headline is proudly displayed. It
reads: 'Revenge of the Nerds'.
To the All-Tech clients occupying the office, the headline is an in-joke, a
reference to the fact they spend their days in windowless rooms staring at
computer screens filled with stock prices.
To the marketmakers and dealers of the big Wall Street firms, the people at
All-Tech - a collection of former bartenders, truck drivers, accountants and
beauty consultants turned 'professional investors' - are nerds of the most
annoying kind.
Although they classify themselves as investors, the men and women who have
found a second career buying and selling small amounts of stock via a
computerised automatic share execution system, are essentially stock market
traders. They spend their days trading on the Small Order Execution System,
a system run by the National Association of Securities Dealers. SOES was
established in 1988 to allow individual investors to buy and sell small
amounts of stock, without having to go through an intermediary.
At All-Tech, the SOES traders concentrate on the marketmakers' quotes - the
prices at which marketmaking firms indicate they are willing to buy and sell
shares - waiting for one marketmaker to lag behind in updating his quote
when a share price moves.
When they spot these temporary price discrepancies, SOES traders immediately
buy or sell the stock at the price quoted by the slow marketmaker. The
marketmakers cannot escape the trade, because under SOES rules, they must
take up to 5,000 shares worth of trades before changing their quote.
A few minutes later, when all the prices have moved back in line, the
traders unwind their earlier order. If they bought a stock low, they sell it
back high, if they sold high, they buy it back low. The difference
represents their profit.
Although the amount of stock traded each time is small, those profits can
add up. If a trader exploits a quarter of a point (25 cents) difference
between marketmakers' prices, he can earn a Dollars 250 profit on the
maximum SOES trade of 1,000 shares.
Good SOES traders can pocket several thousand dollars a week, and the very
best earn an annual income well into six figures. And they do not need that
much capital - a minimum of Dollars 15,000. There is nothing illegal about
what traders do, yet marketmaking firms are so angry at being 'picked off'
by the traders that they have pushed the NASD into taking action.
In the past few months the NASD has tried to change some key SOES rules to
curb the SOES traders. It narrowed the definition of 'professional traders',
who are banned from using SOES, to anyone trading on the system more than
four times a day.
Since then, the NASD has proposed other changes, including reducing the
order size from 1,000 shares to 500 for which marketmakers must guarantee
firm quotes on SOES, and giving marketmakers more time to change their
quotes after taking the first automatic order. Ultimately, the NASD wants to
change SOES from an automatic trade execution system to a simple order
delivery system that will give marketmakers the choice of accepting or
rejecting customer business.
The tightening of the 'professional trader' definition has not hurt the SOES
traders because the rule change has been temporarily blocked while All-Tech
and other firms challenge it in the courts. The other proposed changes are
before the Securities and Exchange Commission, awaiting approval.
The NASD justifies attempts to shut the traders out of SOES on the grounds
they are exploiting a system designed for small investors, not professional
traders. A NASD spokeswoman says: 'They are not investors, because they
immediately unwind their trades after executing them.'
The NASD also contends marketmakers are losing money because of the SOES
traders. There are 29 brokerage firms offering a home to SOES traders, and
at times, says the NASD, marketmakers are hit by 'wave after wave' of
automatic orders from these traders, leaving them thousands of dollars out
of pocket each time.
Moreover, the NASD insists marketmakers are not the only ones to suffer from
the SOES traders' activities. It says that, to make up for losses incurred
at the hands of the SOES traders, marketmakers have been widening price
spreads - something that hurts all investors who use the system.
Additionally, the NASD says the traders' activity increases stock price
volatility and damages liquidity.
The SOES traders deny such claims. Mr Harvey Houtkin, chief executive of
All-Tech, says there is no convincing evidence the traders have either
forced marketmakers to widen their spreads, or their activities have added
to volatility. Mr Houtkin says his customers add liquidity to the market.
He fears if the NASD is allowed to change its rules SOES will be placed
off-limits not just to his clients but to a wide range of users, hindering
efficiency and liquidity in the OTC market. Ultimately, Mr Houtkin says the
NASD, which bills itself as the stock market of the 21st century, will kill
off the one system with the po-tential to be the blueprint for the market of
the future.
There is now an uneasy impasse between the two sides, with the court not
expected to rule on All-Tech's appeal for several months.
While trading on SOES is only a small part of the total business conducted
on US stock markets, the row between the NASD and the traders has wider
implications.
At a time when the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating
possible changes to the structure of US stock markets, the SOES controversy
raises an important question: who does the NASD run its stock market for -
investors, or the marketmaking professionals who operate the system?
The people at All-Tech and advocates of computerised trading in the US argue
that if the NASD were putting investors' interests first, it would not only
allow them to trade on SOES, but would also develop SOES into an automated
trading system on which everyone - big and small investors, brokers and
marketmakers - could trade directly with each other. Only then, says Mr
Houtkin, would the NASD live up to its billing as the stock market for the
next 100 years.

again bids for assets

<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of E-II, the bankrupt holding company which has become the
subject of a fierce tussle between two major creditors - Mr Carl Icahn, the
financier, and Mr Leon Black, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert banker -
remained unresolved late yesterday.
Court hearings to authorise a reorganisation plan put forward by the company
began yesterday with a debate on the advisability of a litigation settlement
involving E-II and McCrory, which was approved. McCrory, like E-II, was once
controlled by Mr Meshulum Riklis, another well-known US businessman. But
after a late start and lengthy adjournment, no decision over the central
issue - whether E-II's reorganisation plan should be approved by the court -
had been reached.
Mr Icahn, who owns 31 per cent of E-II's junior debt securities and is
opposing the company's reorganisation, again muddied the waters. He said
yesterday he was willing to bid for all E-II's operating assets.
Under this plan, the Culligan water treatment unit would be acquired by
Ametek, a quoted Pennsylvannia-based conglomerate, for Dollars 265m, while
Mr Icahn would bid for Samsonite, the luggage business, and McGregor. Mr
Icahn said his company, ACF, had placed Dollars 310m in escrow accounts
pending court action on the bids. Mr Icahn had previously offered Dollars
1.18bn in cash for the entire company.

FERMENTA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, made a profit after financial
items of SKr8m (Dollars 1.1m) in the first four months, turning round a
SKr29m loss in the corresponding period of 1992.
The company attributed the improvement to lower interest costs and
favourable foreign currency movements.
It said it expected the full-year result to be considerably better than last
year, when it recorded a loss after financial items of SKr115m. Fermenta is
anticipating a positive operating result and even a positive overall result,
although currency and interest rate factors will not be as beneficial over
the rest of the year as in the first four months.
Turnover in the first four months amounted to SKr174m, up 25 per cent from
SKr139m last year.
The group said increased volumes and the stronger dollar contributed to the
rise, which amounted to 50 per cent when adjusted for comparable units. The
profit after extraordinary items was SKr8m, compared with a SKr49m loss last
year.
The group's financial position has strengthened markedly over the last year,
following a refocusing on its core pharmaceutical activities.
Interest-bearing debt amounted to SKr310m at the end of April, compared with
SKr1.72bn a year ago, and SKr734m at the end of last year.

Argentine oil group

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S state-owned oil company, YPF, reported a 123 per cent increase
in operating profits to Dollars 390m in 1992, despite a 7 per cent decline
in sales revenues to Dollars 3.91bn, according to a provisional prospectus
leaked to a Buenos Aires newspaper yesterday.
The government, which owns 100 per cent of YPF, plans to sell up to 70 per
cent of the company in a local and international share flotation scheduled
for July 2.
The flotation is expected to raise Dollars 2.5bn, making it one of the
biggest privatisations yet in Latin America and among the largest in the
world this year.
However, the government has restricted data on the company's financial
performance pending approval of its application for listing in the US.
Government officials confirmed the data, published in a special eight-page
supplement in Ambito Financiero, a business daily, was largely correct, but
warned final figures for 1992 were likely to be slightly different due to
revisions to fourth-quarter figures. The final version of the prospectus
will also contain financial information on the first quarter of 1993.
The fall in sales and a 9 per cent decline in assets to Dollars 7.42bn
reflect the government's policy of selling off non-core YPF businesses in
the run up to privatisation.

in the first year.
It is aware that many of the world's corporate users of mid-range and
high-end computer systems are likely to be cautious about the first
significant new operating system in almost 10 years.
Microsoft has sold 25m copies of its PC-based Windows operating environment
and sales are steady at about 1m copies per month.
NT costs Dollars 295 to customers who already own Windows. The standard
price is Dollars 495 and an advanced version for corporate computing will
sell at Dollars 1,495 in the first six months.
Mr John Dodge, executive editor of the US trade magazine PC Week, says
Microsoft must know that some analysts on Wall Street have over-ambitious
expectations for the product.
He points out that NT is unlike earlier versions of Windows in that it is
designed primarily for use with the more expensive 'file server' systems -
large computers shared by many users.
It is designed for users who need substantial computing power and for
'enterprise-wide' applications developed by large corporations.
Windows NT is also distinctive in that it has been developed to run on
microchips from the US electronics companies Intel, MIPS and Digital
Equipment - all of which is likely to introduce greater competition into the
high end of the computer hardware market.
Microsoft believes NT will appeal to corporate customers, and paraded a
number of users from corporate test sites at the press conference announcing
the product.
One of these was the UK's National Westminster Bank, which is using an
NT-based workflow system to redesign completely how work is assigned
throughout its credit card, telesales and loan applications systems.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fund cancellations behind
Kenwood's Y5.4bn deficit - Japanese Corporate News and Results Round-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENWOOD, the Japanese audio equipment maker, reported net losses of Y5.4bn
(Dollars 49m) for the year to March after cancelling securities investment
funds and restructuring an ailing financial affiliate.
The difficulties at Kenwood, which reported net profits of Y2.7bn in the
previous year, are typical of those facing manufacturing companies which
established special investment trusts in the late 1980s.
Kenwood is also taking the typical route of electronics companies by
expanding manufacturing operations in China and Malaysia and cancelling a
planned telecommunications plant in Japan, where relative costs have been
pushed higher by the yen's appreciation.
The plunge in Tokyo stock prices forced Kenwood to report extraordinary
losses of Y9.5bn, marking the end of its indulgence in zaiteku, the
financial engineering which became increasingly ambitious during the
so-called 'bubble era'. Pre-tax profits slid 33 per cent to Y4bn, the first
fall in 11 years. Sales, which rose 1.9 per cent to Y210bn, were supported
by strong demand from east Asian markets.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Weak domestic demand hits Suzuki
 -Japanese Corporate News and Results Round-up

<TEXT>
SUZUKI Motor, Japan's largest minicar producer and the world's third-largest
motorcycle manufacturer, yesterday blamed a 3 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Y20.5bn (Dollars 186m) for the year to March on a combination of
weak domestic demand, higher non-operating costs and a plunge in financial
income due to lower interest rates.
Suzuki, however, reported a 34 per cent rise in operating profits to
Y22.9bn, helped by higher sales and a rise in productivity.
The results highlight the contrasting economic climates of developing
countries, where the company's products have been in strong demand, and
Japan, where demand for both motorcycles and cars has been weak.
Strong demand for motorcycles in south-east Asia, China and Latin America
offset otherwise difficult trading conditions for Suzuki, taking sales
marginally higher to Y1,053bn from Y1,047bn previously.
Outside Japan, particularly in developing countries where Suzuki has been
focusing its efforts, the company benefited from rising demand for its
knock-down price compact cars and for its motorcycles in south-east Asia and
South America.
Exports of motorcycles rose 38 per cent in unit terms, helping sales of
motorcycles overall to increase by 18 per cent.
In the domestic market, Suzuki - which is 3.4 per cent owned by General
Motors of the US - suffered from sagging demand for both minicars and
motorcycles, with sales dropping by 21 per cent and 9 per cent respectively
in unit terms.
The strength of the yen was a depressing factor, with exchange rate losses
accounting for Y3.7bn. The company expects the high yen and persistent
economic weakness at home to continue to cloud its prospects in the current
year.
Suzuki is forecasting a moderate improvement in sales to Y1,055bn but a fall
in pre-tax profits to Y20bn for the year to March 1994.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Tokio Marine and Fire receipts
increase - Japanese Corporate News and Results Round-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOKIO Marine and Fire Insurance, the largest Japanese non-life company,
reported 5.6 per cent growth in premium receipts in the year ending in
March, as the industry generally benefited from a higher rate card during
the period.
Pre-tax profit at Tokio Marine was down 1.4 per cent to Y83.7bn (Dollars
758m), but the non-life companies have fared better than many Japanese
financial institutions, hard hit by the collapse of stock and property
prices over the past three years.
Loss ratios for Tokio Marine were highest in the marine area at 83.6 per
cent, and lowest on fire-related business at 39.5 per cent, down from 92.5
per cent in the previous year. Loss claims on car-related policies,
accounting for just under half of the total, were running at 63.1 per cent,
unchanged from the previous year.
Tokio Marine said unrealised gains on securities holdings were Y1,931bn at
end-March, compared to Y1,955bn a year earlier, though gains on foreign
securities holdings fell from Y3.3bn to Y428m.
For the current year, the company expects premiums to expand to Y1,230bn,
reflecting the impact of a 10.6 per cent rise in premium charges in April,
following a 7.4 per cent increase in mid-1991. Pre-tax profit is forecast at
Y91bn, a gain of 8.7 per cent.
Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance reported 4.2 per cent growth in premiums,
and a 36.6 per cent lift in pre-tax profit to Y28.4bn. It reported a similar
loss ratio to Tokio, 64.4 per cent, on car-related policies, 77 per cent in
the marine area, and 37.8 per cent on fire, down from 65.3 per cent.
This year, Mitsui Marine is expecting that premiums will rise from Y548.6bn
to Y600bn, and forecasts a pre-tax profit marginally higher at Y29bn.
Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance reported 4.6 per cent growth in premiums,
but a 7.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y37bn. However, the company
expects premium growth of almost 10 per cent to Y880bn this year, and a
pre-tax profit of Y38bn.
Pre-tax profits were flat at Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance, 5 per cent
higher at Nichido Fire and Marine Insurance, and 22 per cent lower at
Dai-Tokyo Fire and Marine Insurance.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nikon turns in first loss since
stock listing - Japanese Corporate News and Results Round-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIKON, the Japanese camera and precision instruments manufacturer, yesterday
reported a plunge into pre-tax losses of Y2.33bn (Dollars 21m) for the 12
months to March from profits of Y7.23bn the year before. Sales fell 11 per
cent to Y204.9bn.
This was the first loss incurred by the company since it was listed on the
stock exchange in 1949. It followed depressed demand for its semiconductor
equipment and precision instruments caused by a sharp downturn in capital
spending by Japanese corporations.
At the net level the company managed to stay in the black with profits of
Y219m, down 93 per cent from Y3.32bn.
Nikon, which depends for 54.4 per cent of sales on exports, said its camera
sales had also been under pressure due to the downturn in consumer spending
in Japan.
Compact cameras performed relatively well, but sales of single-lens reflex
cameras and interchangeable lenses had been disappointing.
Precision instruments were particularly hard hit by the decline in capital
spending by semiconductor manufacturers.
Sales of Nikon's machinery division plunged 35 per cent in the domestic
market against 4 per cent overseas.
Continuing weakness in capital spending by corporations and the slump in
personal consumption, the sharp appreciation of the yen, trade friction and
sluggishness in EC markets were expected to work against the rapid recovery
of markets, Nikon said.
The company was working to raise efficiency, slim down operations and cut
costs, it said. For example, it had moved some production to Southeast Asia
for the first time in order to deal with the stronger yen.

Citicorp and other unsecured creditors wanted Mr John Zucotti, president of

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Barlow Rand holds dividend
despite fall in half-way earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARLOW Rand, South Africa's largest industrial company, yesterday announced
it would maintain its interim dividend at 54 cents per share despite a 5 per
cent fall in earnings per share to 196 cents in the six months to March from
207.3 cents a year earlier.
Although the company predicted a sharper decline in profits in the second
half, Mr Warren Clewlow, chairman, said he remained confident that the total
dividend would be maintained at 173 cents per share. The results were in
line with market predictions and followed a warning in January from Mr
Clewlow that profits were likely to be down.
Mr Derek Cooper, managing director, said the results - Barlow accounts for
about 10 per cent of South African GDP - showed that the economy was
'certainly not buoyant'. It was difficult to see any improvement in the
economy before 1994, and he cited business confidence and a political
settlement as the key ingredients in any upturn. He said he 'remained
optimistic that the politicians are on a path of reasonable settlement.'
Turnover rose by 10 per cent to R18.7bn (Dollars 5.9bn) from R17.1bn, but
pressure in virtually all sectors manifested itself in a 5 per cent drop in
operating profits, before interest, to R1.3bn from R1.37bn. Interest paid
fell by 9 per cent to R279m from R305m as a result of lower interest rates
and reduced borrowings following the sale of Middelburg Steel in December
1991. Attributable profits fell by 4 per cent to R384m from R400m.
Results across the group were patchy. Some sectors performed well, notably
packaging, pharmaceuticals, paint and motor interests and electronics. Other
areas such as food, white and brown goods and earthmoving equipment
struggled. A breakdown shows the main contributors to attributable earnings
were:
Mineral resources (mostly coal) - 23 per cent;
Industry - 32 per cent;
Packaging and textiles - 16 per cent; and
Food and pharmaceuticals - 18 per cent.
Mr Cooper said a feature of the results was that about 43 per cent of
attributable profits came from consumer-oriented companies compared with 30
per cent three to four years ago. The main strategic thrust of the group in
recent years had been to move away from commodities and closer to the
consumer, seen to be the main growth area in future years as urbanisation
continues.
Finanzauto, Barlow's recently-acquired Caterpillar dealership in Spain, was
badly affected by the decline in the Spanish economy and traded at a
'substantial loss'. Mr Cooper said Finanzauto's losses would continue for
the rest of the financial year, but said Barlow's management and information
systems were now in place and he anticipated an upturn in the new year.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Government to oversee
liquidation of bank - Japanese Corporate News and Results Round-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government is to oversee the liquidation of a
financially-troubled credit association in Kamaishi, northern Japan, after
fears that a disorderly collapse of the institution could undermine
confidence in the regional banking system.
Assets of Kamaishi Shinkin Bank, which has Y44.8bn (Dollars 406m) in
deposits, will be distributed among a larger bank in the same area, Bank of
Iwate, and two other institutions under a liquidation plan drafted by the
Bank of Japan and the finance ministry.
The government plans to use funds from the Deposit Insurance Corporation
(DIC), which insures deposits for up to Y10m, to ensure the success of the
liquidation.
Funds from the DIC have been used in the past to facilitate a merger of a
troubled bank, but this is the first time money will be used for a
liquidation, suggesting that the government was unable to find a larger
institution willing to take over the bank, as is customary in these cases.
It is expected that between Y10bn and Y20bn in funds will be needed from the
corporation to cover losses at Kamaishi Shinkin, an institution similar to a
credit union and traditionally reliant on small companies for its business.
Officials at the bank, which has 12 outlets, blame its plight on a
particularly severe recession in the area brought on by troubles in the
fishing industry and the closure of a large steel mill. However, they also
hinted that 'illegal lending' could also be responsible and promised to
launch an investigation.
Government officials indicated that there were 'management' problems at
Kamaishi Shinkin, which generally means that an institution became carried
away during the frenzied years of the late 1980s, when lending to stock and
property speculators by Japanese banks was common.
Kamaishi Shinkin says there has been no evidence of a run on its deposits,
which have been stable over the past year, but it has an increasing pile of
non-performing loans. A bank official said yesterday that 'we thought there
may be trouble because of the publicity', but there were no queues of
depositors.
The Bank of Japan and the finance ministry were particularly concerned an
unseemly collapse would fuel rumours that a range of small regional
institutions are unstable, prompting a run on those banks or credit
associations.

<TEXT>
FONDIARIA, the Italian insurance group which is expected to announce heavy
losses later this week, is to sell for DM170.9m (Dollars 105m) its one-third
stake in the Epic insurance partnership.
Epic (European Partners for Insurance Co-operation) was set up in February
1992 by Fondiaria, Royal Insurance of the UK and Germany's Aachener und
Munchener Beteiligungs as a step towards European insurance co-operation.
While each company decided to maintain its independ-ence, European expansion
outside their home countries was to have been co-ordinat-ed.
Under the terms of Epic's creation, the stake has to be bought by AMB should
Royal not buy it first. Epic's main activity is Royal's former Dutch
business, and various other European business ceded by the three partners.
The latest move follows Fondiaria's DM985m sale this month of its 21 per
cent stake in AMB to a group of German institutions.
As with the AMB shares, Fondiaria's Epic stake, held by its Latina
subsidiary, will officially change hands only at the end of May 1994. The
Italian company is likely to use a bank intermediary to receive the cash
earlier to cut debts.
Fondiaria and AMB will also unscramble two remaining financial transactions,
with Fondiaria selling AMB its 30 per cent stake in AMFO, the former
Fondiaria Verwaltungs, for DM198m.

business recovers

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian integrated oil and chemicals group, reported a smaller
operating loss in the first quarter due to recovery in its energy
businesses. However, losses worsened in its chemicals and plastics
operations.
The first-quarter loss was Sch135m (Dollars 11.8m) compared with a loss of
Sch247m in the same period of 1992. Turnover was up 7 per cent at
Sch20.33bn, but the group cautioned that the growth was due to the inclusion
of new activities in its accounts.
OMV said the period was marked by better conditions towards the end of the
quarter than at the beginning of the year.
The chemical division tumbled to a loss of Sch100m, after breaking even in
the comparable period, because of 'extremely difficult' conditions in
industrial chemicals, such as melamine. Agro-chemicals, on the other hand,
made a profit, as volume sales of fertilisers were high towards the end of
the quarter.
A small increase in prices for plastics towards the end of the quarter was
not enough to prevent a widened loss of Sch490m in this division.
The exploration and production division raised its profit from Sch50m to
Sch180m due to an increase in crude oil prices and the sale of the Canadian
subsidiary. One quarter of the CDollars 180m proceeds was taken into the
accounts.
The gas division's operating profit jumped 40 per cent to Sch450m on
turnover up only 2.9 per cent to Sch2.12bn. The group said the profitability
of importing, transporting and storing gas improved.
The loss in the refining division narrowed to Sch90m from Sch150m, mainly
due to cost cutting. Margins and monomer prices remained inadequate.
The marketing division performed well, but continued high capital investment
in retail outlets caused a loss of Sch90m, down from a loss of Sch120m.

Pre-tax profits for the half-year ended March were DKr4m higher at DKr694m
(Dollars 111.44m) after an improvement in net financial income to DKr214m
from DKr190m.
Had earnings by non-Danish companies been translated at the exchange rates
ruling a year earlier, pre-tax profits would have been some DKr50m higher,
the group said.
Operating profits (after depreciation) dipped to DKr480m from DKr500m,
including a DKr90m increase in depreciation. Sales were 8 per cent higher at
DKr7.25bn, against DKr6.66bn.
The Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture in the UK, which came into effect from
December 12 last year, are included in the results. The venture contributed
to the rise in sales, although specific detail is not provided.
'It is much too early to say anything about Carlsberg-Tetley. It has been
too short a period,' said Mr Walther Paulsen, a member of the Carlsberg
board of management.
The joint venture shows up in the balance sheet, with total assets of the
group increasing to DKr18.29bn from DKr14.92bn at the end of September last
year.
Carlsberg said that the recession would cause a decline in operating profits
for the full year, but this would be offset by increased financial income,
barring adverse foreign exchange and interest rate movements.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Injection of FM700m for Skopbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND'S government guarantee fund has agreed to inject a further FM700m
(Dollars 128m) into Skopbank, one of the country's leading banks, to ensure
it continues to meet international capital adequacy requirements.
The infusion, which will be used to subscribe to the bank's capital
certificates, means the bank has now received FM3.7bn in support from the
government guarantee fund and a further FM600m in state preference capital
to help it over Finland's banking crisis.
A further FM13.8bn was invested in a rescue of Skopbank by the Bank of
Finland in September 1991 prior to its transfer to the state's guarantee
fund in June 1992.
Last year, the bank sustained a FM3.61bn loss and its capital adequacy ratio
slumped to 8.2 per cent at the year-end, just over the 8 per cent
international minimum. Skopbank had already indicated it might need FM1.5bn
of extra support this year.
The government has yet to decide on the future of Skopbank, the central bank
for Finland's savings banks, and the Savings Bank of Finland, which is also
in state ownership.
Merrill Lynch is currently studying reorganisation options for both banks,
including a merger of the two. Earlier discussions which might have led to
them being taken over by Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's leading
commercial bank, have been adjourned, pending the presentation of the
Merrill Lynch report.
The government guarantee fund owns 63 per cent of the votes in Skopbank and
53 per cent of the shares.

<TEXT>
PROFITS at Sweden's Incentive, the industrial group controlled by the
Wallenberg family, were up by 54 per cent in the first quarter to SKr83m
(Dollars 11.38m), excluding associated companies, from SKr54m despite flat
demand in the group's main European markets which left sales unchanged at
SKr2.98bn.
Incentive attributed the improved profitability to a rationalisation
programme aimed at narrowing the group's focus on core engineering
operations.
Last week, it announced the sale of its US hydraulics group, Hagglunds
Denison Hydraulics, which has sales of around Dollars 100m, to a group of
Swedish, US and British investors.
Mr Mikael Lilius, chief executive, said the effects of last autumn's
devaluation of the Swedish kroner would have a positive impact on full-year
earnings, which were forecast to improve over last year's SKr371m, excluding
associated companies.
First-quarter profits after inclusion of income from shareholdings in Asea,
Electrolux and Esab were SKr282m, compared with SKr238m a year ago.
Earnings per share, excluding non-recurring items, were up 5 per cent at
SKr2, compared with SKr1.90.

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Holderbank sees payout boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOLDERBANK Financiere Glaris, one of the world's largest cement producers,
expects its 1993 net profits to be 'on a par' with the 1992 level of SFr390m
(Dollars 264.85m).
Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman, also indicated that the dividend for 1993
should be sharply increased following the 54 per cent rise in profit last
year.
'The dividend certainly cannot remain at the previous level,' Mr Schmidheiny
said after the group's annual press conference. The directors have already
proposed that the dividend for 1992 be maintained at SFr12.50 per bearer
share.
Sales in the first quarter were up '1 or 2' per cent and profits were
stable.
Mr Schmidheiny said the economic environment this year would be even tougher
than that in 1992. 'Regions experiencing buoyant construction activity can
no longer expect impressive growth, and other areas are unlikely to see an
upswing.'
He expected a drop in demand in Europe and said the success of US operations
depended largely on whether the recovery continued.
Latin American markets, which contributed substantially to the jump in group
profits last year, were expected to produce 'further gratifying results'.
The group's total cement and clinker sales last year rose 12.2 per cent to
43.1m tonnes, with sales in Latin America rising 14.4 per cent to 10.3m
tonnes and European sales up 18 per cent to 13.3m tonnes.
Return on operating assets was strongest in Latin America at 19.7 per cent
followed by 9.9 per cent in Europe and only 0.4 per cent in North America.
Mr Schmidheiny forecast that the group's cement deliveries this year would
rise 4.4 per cent to 45m tonnes.
Mr Urs Bieri, a member of the executive committee, said Holderbank was
seeking to improve its market position in Asia, and was actively looking for
acquisitions in Vietnam, India and China.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Jarvis Porter to Pounds
4.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS and improved margins helped Jarvis Porter, the specialist label
printer for the spirits, toiletries and pharmaceutical industries, more than
double its full-year pre-tax profits.
The Leeds-based group which acquired the promotional print division of James
Wilkes in August for Pounds 12m, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.78m in
the year to February 28. This compared with Pounds 2.19m a year earlier when
profits were depressed by a Pounds 500,000 provision to cover anticipated
rationalisation costs.
Turnover grew by 40 per cent to Pounds 39.7m (Pounds 28.4m) with Pounds 9.3m
of the gain attributed to acquisitions, including Pounds 7.9m from the James
Wilkes promotional businesses, which are market leaders in printing drip
mats and other promotional material for the drinks industry in the UK and
Belgium.
Sales and profits were also boosted by a full year contribution from Holmes
McDougall, the Glasgow whisky label printer acquired in June 1991.
Earnings per share rose from 8.3p to 11.4p and the final dividend is being
increased to 3.2p (3p) per share making a total of 4.7p (4.4p) for the year.
Operating profits increased by 63 per cent to Pounds 4.76m (Pounds 2.92m)
with Pounds 1.2m of the gain attributed to acquisitions and Pounds 700,000
to organic growth. Operating margins rose from 10.2 per cent to nearly 12
per cent.
Pre-tax profits were also boosted by Pounds 24,000 in net interest receipts
compared with net interest costs of Pounds 221,000 last year.
Mr Richard Brewster, chief executive, who joined Jarvis in March 1991, said
the results reflected the success of the group's strategy in focusing on
specific niche markets within the packaging sector.
The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 3.2m which helped fund the
acquisition of two self-adhesive label companies, Dolphin based in Lewis and
Irwin Packaging Holdings based in Cardiff after the year-end. Jarvis paid
Pounds 4.6m in cash from its own resources for the two companies and assumed
Pounds 1.5m in bank debts.
COMMENT
Even excluding acquisitions, operating profits at Jarvis Porter increased by
24 per cent and sales by 6.5 per cent last year. The group is now the
biggest UK supplier in all three of its niche label markets, and increased
its market share in the self-adhesive labels market by 5 per cent when it
acquired Dolphin and Irwin Packaging. Further acquisitions are likely since
Mr Brewster says he has a list of 60 potential acquisitions in Britain and
on the Continent. Some 18 per cent of group sales now go customers outside
the UK and the group's involvement in continental Europe is likely to grow
as it follows its multinational customers overseas. The share price has
risen sharply since last autumn and now stands at an all-time high of 240p.
Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.7m this year would give earnings of
14.1p and a prospective p/e of 17. This is a quality buy.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Highland and IDV may swoop on NB Distillery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHLAND Distilleries and IDV, Grand Metropolitan's drinks division, are
believed to be preparing a Pounds 100m joint takeover bid for the North
British Distillery, an Edinburgh-based distiller of grain whisky.
North British, an unquoted company with 600 shareholders, announced 11 days
ago that it had received a bid approach, and it declined yesterday to add to
its statement.
The company, established last century by a consortium of wholesale whisky
merchants, supplies grain whisky for Highland's Famous Grouse brand of
blended scotch, and for J&amp;B Rare, IDV's leading whisky brand.
Industry sources suggest that the Highland/IDV move may have been sparked by
fears that another international drinks group, possibly Seagram of Canada,
was considering a bid.
The largest shareholder of North British, with 33 per cent, is Robertson &amp;
Baxter, a whisky blender, which is 35 per cent owned by Highland. North
British, which in turn, has a 4.8 per cent stake, worth about Pounds 17m, in
Highland.
The Edinburgh distiller's strong balance sheet, with cash at the end of
December of Pounds 4.1m, adds to its bid attractions.
Profit before tax last year was Pounds 9.8m on sales of Pounds 31.3m,
slightly below the previous year's results because of the pressures from
surplus stocks in the industry.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sindall shares recover as court defeat
studied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in William Sindall, the Cambridge-based builder and civil engineer,
yesterday recovered 15p of their 25p fall on Friday to close at 80p.
The Friday fall followed the relisting of the shares after Cambridgeshire
County Council won an appeal against a judgment given in favour of the
company. It related to an action for the rescinding of a Pounds 5.08m land
purchase contract made in 1988.
Mr Ray Johnston, company secretary, said the shares had returned to the
level before the judgment began to have an effect.
Sindall had bought the land, a former school playing field in Cambridge,
from the council in 1988 with outline planning permission for housing, but
later discovered that a sewer, which was not on the deeds, ran through it.
The shares were suspended on Thursday pending the appeal. In April the
company said it was delaying the publication of its annual results.
Mr Johnston said the results would be published soon but could not give a
date. He said the judgment was a long and complex document which required
considered study.
He added: 'The results will now record the ordinary trading figures of a
company in the contracting sector without the benefit of the windfall we
would have received if the judgment had gone our way.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas is considering the construction of a Dollars 260m power plant in
Indonesia. The Indonesian government gave the company the go-ahead yesterday
to complete a full feasibility study on the project which would involve the
construction of a 400 MegaWatt gas-fired power station at Serpong in west
Java.
British Gas is currently discussing the project with a number of partners,
but the company stressed it had made no firm decision on its own
involvement.
The project is understood to involve a power station that would be completed
by 1996 and feed into the Indonesian electricity grid. It would be operated
by British Gas and handed over to the Indonesian government 30 years after
start-up.
British Gas is involved in two other projects in Indonesia. It is acting as
technical consultant to Perum Gas Negara, the state gas company, providing
technological and management support for the expansion of the gas
distribution network in Jakarta.

Pounds 1.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECIALEYES, the USM-quoted optical retailer which saw substantial board
changes last year, yesterday finally produced its results for the 78 week
period to November 28 1992. Pre-tax losses totalled Pounds 2.27m.
At the same time it announced it was raising Pounds 1.41m net through the
issue of Pounds 1.55m nominal of 10 per cent convertible unsecured loan
stock 2000 at par. The sum raised will be used to eliminate bank borrowings
and supply funds for capital expenditure.
Mr Jim Power, chairman, said that the pre-placing of the rescue package was
essential before Morison Stoneham, the auditor, would sign off the accounts
on a going concern basis. He said he regretted the 'very late' publication
of the figures.
However he added that in many respects the hardest work was yet to come,
pointing to the 'weak financial controls and trading disciplines' that were
a main factor behind Specialeyes' problems.
Having identified the flaws, they now had to be addressed, he said, adding,
'retail is all about detail.' The capital expenditure programme would
initially be aimed at refurbishment of the stores and the introduction of
electronic point of sale equipment.
The pre-tax losses were struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 904,000
to cover the costs of closing six branches, and reducing central overheads
and head count. Mr Power said that Pounds 1m had been stripped out of the
payroll, mainly through the departure of 15 middle managers, and four
directors at Christmas.
Turnover in the 78 weeks was Pounds 25.9m and interest payable Pounds
232,000. Losses per share emerged at 14.16p. In the 53 weeks to June 1 1991,
pre-tax profits had been Pounds 240,000, turnover Pounds 14.8m, interest
payable Pounds 102,000, and earnings per share 2.3p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigate is to buy Dairy Crest's Marshfield dairy located at Cardiff and four
associated depots for Pounds 11.45m.
The dairy and three depots in south Wales - the other is at Marlborough -
were part of Unigate until 1989 when they were sold to Dairy Crest as part
of a package together with other dairy businesses in the Midlands and
eastern counties.
MD Foods, based in Accrington, said yesterday that it had acquired Dairy
Crest's milk business at Bamber Bridge, near Preston.
No details of the consideration were given. As part of the integration of
the businesses the Accrington dairy, which employs 350 people, will be
closed.
MD said the deal enlarged and consolidated its operations in the north-west
and produced a stronger base for further development.

Kingstream Resources, the small Australian exploration company, has lapsed
its hostile bid for Plateau Mining.
Kingstream said this was because Plateau shareholders had passed a
resolution approving the reversal into the UK company by Dixon Motor
Holdings, a motor dealership in the north of England. The ownership of such
a business was not compatible with the commercial objectives of Kingstream,
it said.
On May 20, Kingstream had received acceptances in re-spect of 9.55 per cent
of Plateau's share capital. No more acceptances had been received.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, the struggling natural resources company which lost its
main asset to creditors last year, has found an investment partner for its
Siberian joint venture.
Northstar Energy, a Canadian company, has agreed to pay Dollars 1.15m
(Pounds 740,000) for 85 per cent of Richmond Russia, the sole asset of which
is a 39 per cent interest in Taloil, a joint venture with Krasnoleninsk Oil
and Gas.
Northstar has also agreed to find Dollars 18.5m in financing to equip the
joint venture, and will procure funds in excess of Dollars 50m to meet the
project's foreign capital requirements.
Richmond has been struggling to find financing for the joint venture since
the company hit problems selling its coal bed methane interests. Last year's
accounts were qualified, with accountants Touche Ross saying that Richmond's
ability to continue trading would depend on disposals.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sharply reduced provisions help NHL cut
deficit to Pounds 24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Home Loans, one of the UK's largest mortgage lenders, reduced its
interim losses after a sharp fall in the level of provisions.
Improvements in the arrears position and lower costs also contributed to a
reduced Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 85.9m) pre-tax loss in the six months to
end-March. Interest receivable fell from Pounds 110.9m to Pounds 80.6m.
Provisions were more than halved from Pounds 79.4m to Pounds 36.8m because
house prices stabilised and the number of accounts in arrears fell.
Some 4,500 of NHL's 52,000 accounts are now in arrears compared with about
6,000 a year ago, according to Mr Jonathan Perry, chairman.
Following the loss in this period, NHL has negative shareholders funds of
Pounds 14.5m.
The group will not be paying a dividend on its 7.5 per cent convertible
preference shares. A total of Pounds 12.9m of preference dividend is now in
arrears.
Following a year of debt restructuring, NHL had now stabilised its finances
and was looking at how to rebuild its business, Mr Perry said.
NHL's house lending business was decimated in the fall-out from the late
1980s housing boom. Rapid growth meant its portfolio was not strong enough
to survive the subsequent collapse.
Mr Perry said NHL had facilities which made it one of the country's best
collectors of arrears. The intention was to put more volume through this
system and NHL was considering purchasing a portfolio of home loans from
companies withdrawing from the market or managing the portfolios of others.
Mr Perry repeated his view that NHL 'had the prospect of reporting a
significantly reduced loss for the current financial year and of returning
to profitability in the future.'
The National Mortgage Bank, the banking subsidiary, continued to be run
down.
Mr Perry said that Pounds 1.7bn of assets under management were off balance
sheet in special purpose securitised companies which were expected to be a
significant contributor to the future performance of the group. The group
managed Pounds 2.4bn of mortgage assets at the end of March, down 3 per cent
over the last 12 months.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Tesco gets go-ahead for French buy
</HEADLINE>

   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco, the UK grocery chain, will today proceed with the purchase of the
94-store Catteau chain in northern France, five months after it first
announced the acquisition.
Tesco said the deal had been cleared by the regulatory authorities, and it
would today acquire 93,713 ordinary shares at FFr7,050 (Pounds 835) a share,
representing 51 per cent of Catteau's share capital, from the principal
directors of Catteau, and certain other shareholders.
The UK retailer also submitted for approval by the French stock exchange a
public offer for all outstanding preference shares, convertible bonds and
warrants of Catteau.
It said it had received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer from
shareholders owning 163,286 preference shares, representing 20 per cent of
the share capital.
The offer was FFr705 for each preference share, FFr705 per convertible bond,
and FFr27.5 per warrant. The deal values Catteau at FFr1.46bn.
Tesco confirmed its initial investment would not exceed 85 per cent of the
company, or Pounds 148m, and it would finance the acquisition and offer from
internal sources.
Tesco first announced the conditional acquisition of the family-owed chain
last December, but had to wait until French treasury and EC approval had
been received, and Catteau's accounts had been finalised.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Forte pay committee under spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE shareholders yesterday asked whether Sir Anthony Tennant was an
appropriate person to chair the group's remuneration committee after the
controversy surrounding his own pay increase.
Sir Anthony, the retiring chairman of Guinness, received a 24 per cent
salary rise in his last year, excluding bonuses, taking his pay to Pounds
777,000.
One shareholder was applauded at Forte's annual general meeting when he
noted the presence of Sir Anthony and Sir Paul Girolami, Glaxo chairman, on
the Forte remuneration committee and asked: 'Would these people have a
realistic idea of what is a fair reward for directors?'
The two were appointed to the Forte board last year. Sir Paul received
Pounds 1.19m from Glaxo in 1992.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, strongly defended both non-executive
directors. He said of Sir Anthony: 'It's very unfair to raise the issue. He
deserves every penny.' He said of Sir Paul: 'If we manage to achieve in this
company what Glaxo has achieved, I don't think you would begrudge me that
salary.'
Mr Forte, who added the title of chairman to his previous role of chief
executive last October, received Pounds 251,934 last year, compared with
Pounds 249,721 the previous year. Mr Forte waived an additional Pounds
56,000 last year and Pounds 42,000 the year before.
Mr Forte also defended a Pounds 175,000 incentive payment to Mr Garry
Hawkes, managing director of the Gardner Merchant contract catering
subsidiary which was sold last December.
Mr Forte said the payment was a reward for Mr Hawkes keeping the business
going, maintaining morale and retaining customers during the protracted
negotiations leading up to the sale.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Securiguard attacks 'unwelcome' Pounds 59m
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURIGUARD, the security and cleaning services company, has again dismissed
the hostile Pounds 59.2m bid made last week by Rentokil Group, the
environmental and property services company.
Securiguard said it was 'unimpressed' by Rentokil's offer document,
delivered to shareholders yesterday.
Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman of Securiguard, said the offer was 'unwelcome and
inadequate'. He said the cash offer price of 270p a share was not 'anywhere
near' an acceptable price.
The 270p a share offer represented a 46 per cent premium to Securiguard's
closing price on Monday of 185p. Following Securiguard's rejection last
week, its shares closed 19p above the offer price at 289p, and closed
yesterday up 4p at 296p.
In a letter to Securiguard shareholders, Mr David Newbigging, chairman of
Rentokil, repeated the company's offer to meet with Mr Baldwin.
Except for a phone call on the morning the bid was launched, there has been
no contact between the two sides.
The understated tone of Rentokil's offer document, and both sides' refusal
so far to criticise their opponents, has prompted some observers to comment
that the bid has the flavour of a recommended rather than a hostile offer.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BTR aims to seek further opportunities in
China
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Gourlay
MR ALAN JACKSON, chief executive of BTR, said the joint ventures signed at
the weekend with two Chinese provinces were the first of a number of
commercial opportunities the industrial holding company hoped to enjoy in
China.
He added, however: 'We will be making sure that this one works first.'
Mr Jackson was speaking from Australia after signing agreements to invest
ADollars 270m (Pounds 121m) over three years in two glass bottle plant joint
ventures with China's Guangzhou and Shanghai Municipal governments.
'Guangzhou province has a population is 68m people and only one glass
manufacturing plant,' Mr Jackson said. 'This is a wonderful opportunity to
go into China.'
BTR's 61 per cent-owned Australian subsidiary, BTR Nylex, will take a 70 per
cent stake in the glass bottling ventures. The balance will be held by the
respective municipal governments' Ministry of Light Industry.
The Chinese partners will be transferring existing assets and business of
the bottling plants into the new joint venture. BTR will be importing
equipment - duty free - and knowhow over the three year period and will not
be subscribing any cash to the joint venture. Its investment will be
ADollars 95m in Shanghai and ADollars 175m in Guangzhou.
Mr Jackson said BTR had had an option on the deal since last November and
that he had travelled to China five times since the start of May to conclude
the deal.
The Guangzhou plant has been established for 35 years. BTR will, however,
immediately add four new glass manufacturing lines to the seven that exist.
Combined with the redesign of bottle moulds and the production process, this
investment will more than double the plant's capacity, Mr Jackson said.
At the moment the plant's managers have to ration the supply of bottles to
its customers. Growth of beer consumption was very high and China had become
the third largest consumer of beer in the world.
Glass and plastics packaging has been one of the engines for growth at BTR
Nylex through its ACI packaging subsidiary which will be supplying a manager
for the Chinese ventures.
The joint venture agreements state there will be no restriction of
transmission of dividends. BTR will have a majority of members on the joint
venture boards.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: CSI chief received Pounds 366,100 pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN BINKS, chief executive of Cannon Street Investments for only 15
months was paid a total of Pounds 548,000 last year, according to the latest
accounts.
Mr Binks had joined the board from SG Warburg in November, 1990, and was
made chief executive in December 1991. He was replaced last March by Mr
David Smith, the management consultant who masterminded the Isosceles bid
for Gateway, the supermarket chain.
Although Mr Binks' departure was said to have been by mutual consent, the
annual accounts published yesterday show that Mr Binks received Pounds
366,100, including Pounds 345,100 in cash, as a 'termination settlement' in
addition to his pay, for a total of Pounds 548,000.
During his tenure, Mr Binks reversed the strategy of his acquisition-minded
predecessor, Mr Bill Hislop, and made a series of disposals to reduce
borrowings.
Last year the group realised more than Pounds 60m from asset sales,
including Pounds 42m from the flotation of Avonside, the house-building
group. In the process 14 operating units, spanning more than 50 companies,
were cut to three.
However Mr Tom Long, chairman since May last year, decided that a change in
chief executive was appropriate because the group had moved into the next
phase of recovery and needed a chief executive with 'operational skills'.
Earlier this month Cannon Street reported a jump in pre-tax losses from
Pounds 34.3m to Pounds 115.5m for the year to January 2, reflecting trading
losses coupled with substantial goodwill write-offs and losses on sales and
closures.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: National advertising boosts Radio Clyde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADIO Clyde Holdings, the USM-quoted broadcaster, lifted half-year pre-tax
profits from Pounds 843,000 to Pounds 1.53m as national advertising revenue
grew rapidly. The rise was helped by the adoption of FRS 3 and the
restatement of last year's figure.
Exceptional gains totalled Pounds 273,000 including the release of a prior
year's provision, against charges of Pounds 270,000. The company said
exceptional credits for the full-year would reach Pounds 615,000.
Turnover improved to Pounds 7.06m (Pounds 6.62m) in the six months to March
31 with advertising and sponsorship at 90 per cent of sales. Local revenue,
which made up two-thirds of the income, rose 4 per cent while national
revenue increased by 20 per cent.
Mr John Bowman, finance director, said: 'Local revenue is at a record level
for us. National revenue is recovering from the sharp drops we have seen
recently.' The company noted that advertising revenues could be volatile,
but said trading since the half-way stage showed 'satisfactory growth'.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 970,000). Net interest
received fell to Pounds 98,000 (Pounds 143,000) reflecting the drop in
interest rates. The company had Pounds 3.06m (Pounds 2.72m) cash, having
generated Pounds 569,000 from operating activities.
Radio Clyde has committed Pounds 160,000 for its 40 per cent stake in
Carlisle Radio which went on the air in April, in an area 'largely unserved
by independent radio'.
The company has also decided to take a leading stake in a consortium
application for the North-West regional licence. If successful the company
will put in Pounds 640,000 towards starting up the station.
The board declared an interim dividend of 3.5p (3.25p). from earnings per
share of 12p (5.4p).

FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Dublin confirms Telecom
alliances

THE IRISH government yesterday confirmed that it is seeking a strategic
alliance for Telecom Eireann, its national telecommunications utility.
However it emphatically ruled out privatisation, following reports that
Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, is negotiating for a 25
per cent stake.
C&amp;W said that discussions were progressing 'at a senior level, with a view
to a possible strategic alliance or joint venture'.
Privatisation is a political minefield in Ireland.
The sensitivity of the issue was underlined yesterday by Mr Dick Spring, the
deputy prime minister and leader of the Irish Labour party, who said that
the sale of any of TE 'would represent a breach of the programme of
government'.
This was a thinly-veiled warning to his Fianna Fail coalition partners that
the Labour party might be prepared to leave the government on the issue.
Mr David Begg, the general secretary of the Communications Workers' Union
also warned that his members would fight any efforts to privatise the
company.
Mr Brian Cowen, minister for transport, energy and communications, said:
'Privatisation is not on the agenda.'
However he added that he had instructed TE to look for 'strategic alliances
or joint ventures . . . to maintain its position in a sector which is moving
at an alarming and accelerating rate.
'The idea of the company standing alone in an international arena is
something that I think would be questionable in the long term.'
With a debt/equity ratio of about 250 per cent, and a telephone line
penetration rate of only 31 per 100 people, TE is anxious for overseas
investment and expertise.
Privatisation of state-owned telecommunications utilities is now commonplace
outside Europe. Within the EC only the UK has yet privatised, but Greece is
negotiating with overseas companies for the sale of a significant equity
stake and most operators have been constituted as companies separate from
the government, in some cases with a view to possible privatisation.
Both Mr Spring and Mr Begg have made it clear they were not opposed to TE
entering into new joint ventures, but neither spelled out how the company
might raise capital for such a move without giving a future partner a stake.
With its UK Mercury network, which now extends to Belfast, C&amp;W has obvious
attractions to TE as a partner or equity holder.
For C&amp;W it would be in line with the company's policy of expanding from
existing business centres. Apart from Mercury, its European business
includes a 40 per cent stake in Tele2 of Sweden, the second national
carrier, and leased line businesses in France, Italy and Germany.
TE has had a turbulent decade since its establishment in 1984, with four
chairmen in the past two years. Mr Michael Smurfit resigned in September
1991 after it was revealed he had an interest in a company which was
involved in selling a site on to TE for building its new headquarters.
His successor, Mr Brendan Hynes, was sacked after only six months, after a
revolt by fellow directors upset by his 'hands-on' management approach in
dealing with overstaffing and lack of competitiveness. An acting chairman,
Mr John Scanlan, was replaced last December by Mr Ron Bolger, a partner in a
prominent Dublin accountancy firm.
The government's inept handling of recent privatisations, in particular that
of Greencore the sugar, malting and milling group, has made it even more
difficult for the issue of future privatisations to be the subject of
rational public debate.
Boosted by reports of the Irish deal, C&amp;W's shares closed up 10p on the day
at 724p.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BP in talks over Pounds 250m consumer
products sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum is negotiating the sale of the consumer products division
of its Nutrition business for Pounds 250m to an investment group headed by
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks
conglomerate.
Legal and General, the insurance group, is heading the consortium of 10
investors which include Lehman Brothers, the US investment bankers.
The sale involves BP Nutrition's three main consumer products interests in
the UK, Italy and Belgium.
BP put its nutrition division up for sale just over a year ago in order to
concentrate on its core oil and gas business.
It sold the consumer foods division to Sara Lee, the US foods and consumer
products group, in December.
The sale of consumer products leaves BP's US animal feeds business: Purina
still to divest.
BP has appointed financial advisors to assist with the sale. It also has a
smaller European animal feeds business.

FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec retraces growth steps - Exceptional
charge and recession in UK leaves losses of Pounds 8.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HI-TEC Sports, the sports and leisure wear company, yesterday announced that
mounting losses and recession had forced it to close its recently expanded
continental European sales network.
The closure of the network, mainly built up with the proceeds of a Pounds
10.3m rights issue last year, led to exceptional costs of Pounds 4.82m
leaving pre-tax losses for the year to January 31 at Pounds 8.3m, compared
with profits of Pounds 9.06m.
Mr Frank van Wezel, chairman, said Hi-Tec would revert to using
distributors. 'It means in Europe we will have less clout, which hurts me.'
He claimed the closure lay behind the sudden resignation in March of two
recently appointed non-executive directors, Sir Michael Edwardes, former
chairman of British Leyland, and Mr Richard Fenhalls, former chief executive
of Henry Ansbacher.
Mr van Wezel said the two pair, who joined in January, wanted to close the
loss making network immediately while he wanted more time. 'We had different
expectations from each other,' he said, adding that he was now convinced
immediate closure was the right course.
Losses in the UK and Europe were also blamed for the turn down into losses.
Turnover fell from Pounds 127.8m to Pounds 106.9m. At the interim stage,
pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.84m compared to a Pounds 3.74m profit.
In the year the UK was worst hit, recording operating losses of Pounds 1.58m
(profit Pounds 6.88m) due to depressed consumer spending, price cutting by
competitors like Nike and Reebok and redundancy costs.
However North America performed well increasing operating profits by 24 per
cent to Pounds 2.4m, helped by sales of rugged outdoor products.
Losses per share were 18.8p (earnings 16.1p). The proposed final dividend is
cut to 1p to give a total for the year of 2p (5.5p).
Hi-Tec also announced the appointment as non-executive directors of Mr John
Sharkey, chairman of BDDP (UK), and Mr Roger Rowland, until recently
chairman of Lambert Howarth.
COMMENT
Hi-Tec has taken care to bring forward all the bad news, and will no doubt
wish to forget last year. But shareholders are unlikely to be so
accommodating, especially since proceeds from the rights issue have now been
lost in Europe, and the shares have since collapsed from nearly 200p to 40p
yesterday. At least this year the UK should return to profit, helped by
improving margins, and the US looks firm. Pre-tax profits should recover to
Pounds 4m or Pounds 5m. But the reasons for avoiding the shares remain
compelling, and include a dominant chairman with more than 50 per cent of
the shares, barely transparent accounts and lingering questions about the
sudden departure of non-executives and other senior officers. Finally,
switching back to distributors in Europe could further dent Hi-Tec's brand
name and puts its European strategy on hold pending another review once the
three year distribution contracts end.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Lopez denies he took General Motors papers to Volkswagen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN'S top executives fought back publicly yesterday against a renewed
legal attack from arch-rival General Motors of the US.
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, whom, GM believes, took confidential
documents with him when he defected from Detroit to VW last month, said the
charge was 'untenable'.
'What did I bring with me? My personal knowledge and years of experience,'
Mr Lopez said. 'A strong inner motivation. The will to realise quantum leaps
at VW. No secret documents,' he added.
'I can only imagine that GM has been so affected by my change that it wants
to damage my credibility,' he told selected journalists at a
hastily-convened press conference.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, publicly defended Mr Lopez. It was
incredible that anyone should try to discredit not only his 'irreproachable
professionalism' but also the image of VW itself, he said.
VW was responsible for all its own technological progress and had not the
slightest need to take out 'loans' from competitors.
He could not discuss any other details of the legal confrontation because he
had not yet seen the text of the charges.
The press conference, in Braunschweig, near Hannover, was called after
General Motors announced on Friday that it had filed legal complaints in
Darmstadt, near Frankfurt, after Mr Lopez quit GM to be promptly followed by
seven group colleagues.
VW officials said yesterday that while the seven had filed counter suits
against their former employer, Mr Lopez had not yet taken legal action.
Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, had earlier won a court injunction
preventing VW from poaching its staff. According to Opel, Mr Lopez had
targeted about 40 key purchasing and production employees.
Mr Lopez, a renowned cost-cutter, joined VW after a bizarre on-off tussle,
as a key member of Mr Piech's new management team brought in to restore the
group's fortunes. VW lost DM1.25bn (Pounds 516m) in the first three months
of this year.
Mr Lopez, a Basque, claimed he had no contract at GM, and denied rumours of
multi-million dollar deals with VW. 'I could earn a lot more today in the US
than I get at VW,' he added.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Carlton TV breaks into profit in its third month on air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLTON TELEVISION, the new London ITV company, went into trading profit in
its third month on air, a better performance than expected.
The television company, which took over from Thames Television on January 1,
lost Pounds 4.2m in the first quarter compared with the Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m
forecast. With advertising revenues continuing to rise, the company is not
expected to slip into trading loss again. The Pounds 4.2m loss, which is
likely to be overturned in the full year, includes the bid money paid to the
government as well as interest on the Pounds 80m launch costs.
The first news on Carlton Television came yesterday as its parent, Carlton
Communications, announced a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 55.1m for the six months to the end of March. Turnover rose 57 per
cent to Pounds 508m and earnings per share was up 14 per cent to 18.3p. The
interim dividend is up 10 per cent to 7.4p.
Mr Michael Green, chairman of the broadcasting and television services
group, said it still had net cash of Pounds 50m after the financing costs of
Carlton Television. 'The year has started well and Carlton is confident that
the outcome for the year as a whole will show continued progress,' Mr Green
said.
Carlton Communications' results were in line with market forecasts. Its
share price closed down 1p at 733p.
'A good set of results from a well managed company,' commented Mr Guy
Lamming, media analyst at James Capel, the stockbrokers. He is forecasting
earnings per share of 43.3p and pre-tax profits of Pounds 129m for the year
to September. 'The big question for the market is where Carlton is going to
get the growth from three years from now,' he said.
Carlton yesterday would not rule out takeovers, but said that growth would
increasingly be internal and from the launch of new companies. A new company
Technicolor Entertainment Services will distribute film release prints
direct to cinemas.
Carlton's video and audio production division had pre-tax profits of Pounds
30.8m compared with Pounds 20.4m last time although film and television
services were static on Pounds 13.2m.
Video and sound products increased pre-tax profit from Pounds 8m to Pounds
12m.

FT  25 MAY 93 / BT hopes fund managers will buy before sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and VLADIMIR MATEJOVSKY

<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL shareholders which increase their holdings in BT, the telecom
group, in the run-up to the sale of the government's 21.9 per cent stake
will be given greater allocation.
The move, announced yesterday at the launch of the BT marketing campaign, is
designed to prevent institutions from trying to depress the company's share
price over the next few months.
Big shareholders which increase their stake in BT between May 21 and the
close of the offer period in July will be given favourable allocation if, as
expected, the offer is oversubscribed. The sale is worth more than Pounds
5bn.
SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator, is anxious to avoid the
row which flared up with institutions in the last sale of BT shares in 1991.
Lord Cairns, Warburg chief executive, said that he favoured offering a
'carrot' by rewarding big shareholders which increased their BT holdings
instead of using a 'stick' by penalising institutions trying to depress the
share price.
In practice, any institution which 'aggressively shorts the stock', in an
attempt to push the BT price down, is still likely to be penalised.
Mr Tim Hirst, telecommunication analyst at Kleinwort Benson, which decided
not to take part in the sale when it was not chosen as a global manager,
said: 'It looks like blatant rigging of the market.'
One UK fund manager said: 'The government is trying to support BT's share
price in advance of the sale of its shares which one would normally call
rigging.'
However, most UK institutions yesterday welcomed what several described as
'Warburg's more constructive approach to the sale'. As in previous sales,
the new BT shares will be offered in three instalments expected to be spread
over 12 to 18 months.
The first instalment for retail investors will be announced in the middle of
June and set at a lower price than the first instalment for institutions
which will be set on June 29 when the prospectus is published.
The second and third instalment will be the same for both investors; the
last will be priced at the end of the offer period depending on the BT share
price at the time.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Buildings take on new air of respectability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL property, the pariah of the investment markets for the past three
years, is edging back into favour, writes Vanessa Houlder.
A Gallup survey for Smith New Court reported last week that a balance of 12
per cent of fund managers want to increase their property holdings in May;
two months earlier, the same survey found that a majority of funds wanted to
disinvest.
Increased institutional interest in property has also been detected by
agents. 'There are definite signs of a sea change in investment activity,'
says Mr Greg Nicholson of Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. 'The
institutions have moved back into the market.'
Increased demand has already pushed down investment yields in small pockets
of the market, notably retail warehouses and high yielding office buildings
in central London.
In part, the increased demand from institutions stems from the need to
rebuild the balance of property in their portfolios, after the drastic
underperformance of property in the past three years.
At the same time, a growing number of investors believes the property market
is near the bottom of its cycle and will begin to recover within the next 18
months. The industry's prospects have improved significantly since
sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism, which paved the way
for lower interest rates, economic recovery and potentially a revival in
inflation, which enhances the investment appeal of assets like property.
The appeal of property can also be ascribed to its high investment yields,
compared with those offered by equity and gilts. 'It is a rational response
to the economic circumstances we are facing,' says Mr Peter Lyon, strategist
at Smith New Court Securities.
But the enthusiasm for property is tempered by a number of caveats. On a
practical level, the funds' investment criteria are so demanding that they
have difficulty in finding property they are prepared to invest in. On a
strategic level, many funds doubt whether property still has a valuable role
to play in diversifying risk. The renewed enthusiasm for property is
demonstrated by a relatively small number of funds.
In a market glutted with unwanted property, the difficulty in obtaining
suitable buildings is a surprisingly serious obstacle. Finding stock is a
'fundamental problem' says Mr Andrew Strang of Allied Dunbar, which invested
about Pounds 100m over the last year.
Being risk-averse, most institutions want to buy properties with highly
secure income streams. They have virtually no interest in the huge number of
second-rate properties which overhang the market.
But the number of properties with long leases let to financially secure
tenants is limited to as little as a fifth of the market; moreover, many are
in the hands of long-term investors which are reluctant to sell.
As the economy recovers, concern about tenants' ability to pay the rent will
ease. But even then, it is unclear whether institutions will be willing to
invest in a wider range of properties. Changes to the UK commercial lease
have reduced the security of income associated with property. Unless
institutions adopt a less demanding stance on the security of property
income, there could be a depleting stock of desirable acquisitions, forcing
up prices of a limited number of properties still further.
This trend will only continue until an improvement in prices persuades
existing investors to put more property on the market. This could happen
sooner than most pundits think. A recent survey of investors' intentions by
Gallup suggested that the institutions polled planned to sell nearly as much
property as they intended to buy. The 37 institutions questioned said that,
in aggregate, they would spend Pounds 770m and raise Pounds 750m from sales
over the next year.
It is scarcely surprising that institutions' attitudes to property differ:
the arguments for and against buying property are finely balanced. Although
property yields have moved substantially above gilt yields for the first
time in many fund managers' memories, that does not necessarily mean that
property is cheap. Investors have to weigh up a property's generous yield
against its limited prospects of rental growth, the risk of tenant default
and costs arising from the building's physical deterioration.
Furthermore, attitudes to property differ according to the type of fund. The
insurance companies have tended to be steadier and more enthusiastic buyers
than the pension funds, many of which view property as too illiquid an
investment medium.
Size has an important bearing on funds' appetite for property. The number of
funds that are active in the property market has shrunk from 150 funds five
years ago to a couple of dozen, according to the Investment Property
Databank, a research group.
'Small funds are put off by the way that the market has become terribly
complicated,' says Mr Rupert Nabarro, a director of IPD. The property market
is not homogeneous: it is split into many tiers depending on sector, region,
tenant and type of lease.
Investors are also nervous about the erosion of tenants' responsibility to
pay rent for the full duration of a 25-year lease, which stems from the
improved bargaining position of tenants in an oversupplied market and from
proposed changes to the law.
Many funds feel that property no longer has a role to play in their
portfolios. In the 1970s, it was seen as a good way of hedging against
inflation while reducing the risk and volatility of a portfolio. By 1981,
property accounted for 24 per cent of life assurance companies' portfolios
and 15 per cent of pension funds.
But property went out of fashion with the institutions in the 1980s. In real
terms, the net investment in property by institutions between 1983 and 1992
was just over half the total for the previous decade.
This largely resulted from the removal of exchange controls that allowed
funds to invest in overseas equities, which were often seen as a better way
to diversify risk than property. In the five years to end-1992, institutions
invested Pounds 33.2bn in overseas equities, compared with Pounds 6.5bn in
UK property.
Some analysts, such as UBS, reckon that the balance between overseas
equities and property may soon reach equilibrium, as they now represent
about 18 per cent and 8 per cent of institutional funds, respectively.
But that does not necessarily mean that a larger proportion of new funds
would be channelled into property. 'The events of the past four or five
years have damaged property's record of low volatility in returns,
heightening investors' perception of the risk in property investment,' says
Mr John Atkins of UBS.
For all these reasons, the institutions are unlikely to play a large part in
pulling the market out of its slump, as they did in the wake of the crash of
1974-75.
But those funds that do take the plunge have a strong case for believing
that they are investing near the bottom of the property cycle. Although
property has a slim chance of becoming fashionable, it may at least become
respectable.

FT  25 MAY 93 / S&amp;P says two life insurers are 'vulnerable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD AND POOR'S, the US-based rating agency, has added two more UK life
insurers to its list of companies whose financial strength it has assessed
as 'vulnerable'.
In the second volume of S&amp;P's UK Life Financial Strength Digest, the rating
agency said Life Association of Scotland and General Portfolio Life
Insurance may be highly exposed to adverse economic or underwriting
conditions.
The first volume of financial strength ratings resulted in protests from
life companies and actuaries who questioned S&amp;P's methodology. S&amp;P said its
reports had been prepared 'against a background of unprecedented concern
over the financial strength of UK life offices'.
In the case of General Portfolio, S&amp;P said that despite the company's highly
successful efforts in growing its business, the free asset ratio of its
non-linked business, mostly consisting of guaranteed income bonds, is
relatively low.
Although there has been recent improvement in that indicator of strength,
its ability to sustain that improvement is unclear.
Mr Geoffrey Puritz, joint managing director, said the S&amp;P data were out of
date and that General Portfolio received a Pounds 16m capital injection last
autumn which has improved several of its key ratios.
Also, he said that because General Portfolio has no with-profits business,
there is little point in measuring it using criteria outlined by S&amp;P.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Mayhew denies trying to block disclosure of Supergun
evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PATRICK Mayhew, the former attorney-general, yesterday denied that he
tried to prevent evidence about the Iraqi Supergun affair coming to court,
as stated earlier in the day by a former vice-chairman of the Conservative
party.
Sir Hal Miller, a former MP, told the Scott inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq
affair that Sir Patrick had tried to dissuade him from giving evidence in
support of a businessman accused of illegally exporting parts for the gun.
But Sir Patrick, now Northern Ireland secretary, last night issued a
statement of denial, saying he would be glad to give evidence to the
inquiry.
Sir Hal said he had approached Sir Patrick soon after Mr Peter Mitchell,
managing director of Walter Somers, a west Midlands company, had been
charged with export offences linked to the gun.
Sir Hal had been prepared to produce records of conversations with an
intelligence officer and government officials.
He said he had met Sir Patrick in the House of Commons lobby. 'I was
seriously concerned about these people (Walter Somers). They had done
nothing wrong and were going to jail.'
Sir Hal said that when he said he would defend Mr Mitchell in court if
necessary, Sir Patrick had said: 'You wouldn't do that, would you?' He had
replied: 'Just watch me.'
But Sir Patrick's statement said: 'I have never urged Sir Hal Miller or
anyone else to withhold evidence which would advantage a defendant.'
He added that in November 1990 he had advised Customs and Excise to drop a
prosecution in the Supergun case. 'This was a Customs prosecution for which
neither I nor anyone for whom I had ministerial responsibility had had any
part in its preparation.'
Charges against Mr Mitchell were dropped after government law officers
advised there was less than a 50 per cent chance of conviction.
Sir Hal also said yesterday that British intelligence had briefed witnesses,
including businessmen, on what they could tell a parliamentary Supergun
inquiry last year.
Later Mr Jim Cousins, a Labour MP and former trade and industry committee
member, attempted to raise Sir Hal's remarks on the floor of the Commons but
was interrupted by Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker. She said the matter
might involve a contempt of the House.
Mr Cousins is expected to write to Miss Boothroyd arguing that, if Sir Hal
is correct, it would appear that government departments and at least one
minister deliberately deceived a Commons committee.
Sir Hal, speaking after giving his evidence yesterday, said he did not think
Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, was linked to the Supergun affair.
'I'm a Conservative. I believe in the cock-up theory,' he added.
The Scott inquiry will resume public hearings on June 11.

FT  25 MAY 93 / BCCI depositors sue Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPOSITORS in the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
yesterday issued a writ against the Bank of England for allegedly failing in
its role as regulator.
Liquidators at Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, co-ordinated the legal
action. It is believed to be the first time the Bank has been sued under
banking law.
The move - which had been hinted at by liquidators over the past few weeks -
was delayed by questions over whether the law would permit BCCI itself to
sue the regulator.
But Touche Ross recently received a legal opinion from Sir Patrick Neill,
QC, that while BCCI or its liquidators could not sue directly, individual
depositors might be entitled to damages from the Bank.
The writ was issued in the names of a small number of depositors and alleges
that the Bank failed to regulate BCCI properly in accordance with the 1979
and 1987 banking acts.
The Bank of England said yesterday: 'We have been aware for some weeks that
the liquidators were considering whether proceedings could be brought
against the Bank. We believe we have a complete defence to them.'
The Bank was criticised last year in a US inquiry chaired by Senator John
Kerry and in a report commissioned by the government from Mr Justice
Bingham, following which it introduced a number of supervisory changes and
proposed amendments to legislation.
Three of the joint liquidators at Touche Ross wrote yesterday to depositors
encouraging them to add their names to the writ. They said it would be
'extremely difficult, expensive and impractical' for depositors to take
action individually.
But the government of Abu Dhabi, BCCI's majority shareholder, hinted that it
might commence its own legal action against the Bank.
'We have been actively looking at what claims we may have against the Bank
of England and these investigations are at an advanced stage,' a spokesman
said.
The Touche Ross letter said it had been advised by Sir Donald Nicholls, who
as vice-chancellor is the senior chancery judge, that it could use
liquidation funds to take legal action on behalf of depositors provided it
distributed any award to creditors in proportion to their claims.
It stressed that the outcome was uncertain and there was little precedent
but that it had been advised that the claim 'has a fair prospect of
success'.
The 1987 Banking Act says the bank and its employees will not be liable for
any actions or omissions unless it is shown to be 'in bad faith'.

FT  25 MAY 93 / US deal will speed start of HDTV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREE rival consortia seeking to set the technical standards for
high-definition television in the US yesterday agreed to combine their
systems. Their decision will speed up HDTV's introduction in America and
give the country a powerful lead in the establishment of a global HDTV
standard.
HDTV offers viewers much sharper pictures and clearer sound than current
systems and yesterday's deal means it could be in operation in the US in
time for the Olympic Games in Atlanta in the summer of 1996.
The groups reached a business and technical agreement on a so-called 'grand
alliance' which will submit a single HDTV proposal to the Federal
Communications Commission, the government agency that oversees the
communications industry and has to approve a standard.
Provided the FCC supports the agreement, it should speed up HDTV
implementation in the US because rival tests and the threat of litigation
from losing consortia will be eliminated.
The FCC's decision may strongly influence HDTV standards in Europe, in the
wake of the disintegration of European Community efforts to develop a
home-grown version. It is also likely to have a powerful impact on Japan,
which has developed an HDTV system based on less versatile analogue
technology.
An FCC advisory committee on advanced television had been due yesterday to
start costly tests between four rival HDTV systems.
However, the FCC panel had for weeks pressed the consortia to agree on a
single system. Mr Richard Wiley, head of the advisory committee, said the
grand alliance would mean the development of a digital system incorporating
the best elements of the four proposals.
The consortia consist of Zenith Electronics and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph; NBC, the US television station, Thomson of France, Philips of the
Netherlands and America's David Sarnoff Research Center and Compression
Labs; and General Instrument and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The FCC had previously rejected an HDTV standard from NHK, Japan's public
broadcasting corporation, because it uses analogue technology. Links with
computers are easier through digital systems.
