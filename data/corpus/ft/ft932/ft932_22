<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild has once more rattled the threat of a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission reference in front of the privatised
electricity generators. That is pretty standard stuff, but the generators'
victory in the battle over coal may also have cost them friends in
Whitehall. The duopoly, always an anomalous structure, may thus be under
threat, along with the companies' high dividend cover and strong cash flows.
In the short run, the government's 40 per cent stake may protect them.
Further out, National Power and PowerGen may have to consider selling
stations to reduce market share. The companies may also hope that Professor
Littlechild's desire to shape the industry himself leads him to strike a
deal directly rather than take a chance with the MMC.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Five months after its announcement, Tesco's foray into France through the
acquisition of Catteau looks even odder. With Tesco's mainstream business
still under pressure, shareholders will hardly welcome management time being
diverted across the Channel. The stock market is asking some tough questions
about Tesco's performance in the UK - as shown by an above-market yield.
Some convincing answers would be appreciated. By itself, though, Catteau
will not do much harm, even if it does go horribly wrong, since it only
accounts for a minuscule proportion of Tesco's total sales. It is what comes
next that provokes the worries.

FT  25 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is more than one precocious offspring in Royal Bank of Scotland's
brood. Direct Line insurance has overshadowed Citizens Financial, but the
acquisition of the failed New England Savings Bank from the authorities
continues a prodigious rate of growth in US banking this year. Both Citizens
and its parent have enough capital to stand the strain. NatWest, the other
clearer with ambitions in US retail banking, must be envious on that score
despite yesterday's issue of preference capital. The only worry is that
Royal Bank's capital strength gives it rope with which to hang itself.
By remaining a regional bank concentrating on retail business, Citizens has
so far taken a conservative line. The arrangement to sell immediately the
commercial loan assets of New England Savings is a case in point. If that
policy is adhered to from here on, Citizens might avoid the kind of real
estate loan losses which blighted NatWest Bancorp. But avoiding pit-falls is
not enough to guarantee a decent return on capital. Royal Bank has seen only
a modest return on its original investment in 1988.
Expanding Citizens' loan book and gearing-up its capital base are thus
necessary to keep profits rising. While loan demand is slack, buying smaller
rivals may be a safer way of proceeding than forcing growth from within -
always assuming exhaustive due diligence procedures are followed. Royal Bank
deserves credit for installing management with local knowledge. It has yet
to prove it can keep a transatlantic grip during the growth phase.

FT  25 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Carlton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to view Carlton as an entertaining investment with reasonable
growth prospects and a splash of recovery appeal thrown in for free. Its
interim figures, showing a 16 per cent profit improvement and continuing
progress on most fronts, seemingly contradict those who have chewed away at
Carlton's shares since the start of the year.
The newly-consolidated Pickwick is contributing nicely. New video products
appear to be faring well. Strong sales forecasts for the Aladdin video
should also help polish up profits. Carlton TV is already producing
encouraging results as the advertising market shows signs of life. The
company's stakes in Central, GMTV and ITN further confirm just how
formidable a force Carlton will be in terrestrial television - particularly
if the government were to relax the takeover rules applying to TV
franchises.
Even recent scare stories, which have so undermined the shares, contain more
scare than story. Although alternative film distribution channels may
eventually present a threat to Carlton video business, the big Hollywood
studios are unlikely to risk them just yet. Nevertheless, despite all
Carlton's attractions and its sub-market rating, it is doubtful whether the
shares deserve to move much from here. Reuters, another unfashionable media
giant, has fallen to a lower historic earnings multiple than Carlton.
Reuters' growth prospects may be questioned, too, but there is no disputing
the greater reliability of its income stream.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is clearly learning on the job when it comes to pricing
privatisations. For BT 2, it refined the book-building process to avoid
selling shares too cheaply. Now it is bribing fund managers with
preferential treatment if they buy the company's shares ahead of BT 3. Given
the attractions of the issue, that may be enough to prevent institutions
selling to beat the price down ahead of the tender. Indeed, in other
circumstances, the tactic might be considered an inducement to ramp BT
shares into the float. The normal retail discount will be required if
private investors are to see even modest gains.
Once the Treasury has lost its financial interest in BT, uncertainty about
regulation will increase. The likely timing of the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission report into British Gas - which may arrive on ministers' desks
just after the BT issue - falls at an uncomfortable time. Yet the MMC will
doubtless be careful in framing its recommendations with regard to the
impact on other privatised companies. While the trend is towards tighter
regulation, experience suggests that the unknown attitude of Mr Don
Cruickshank, the new director-general of Oftel, will be the deciding factor.
Perhaps the main hint about the postion of Mr Cruickshank will come from the
degree to which he forces BT to account separately for the parts of its
business. Such action might foreshadow an attempt to split BT, although
Oftel has not so far taken that line. It would, however, make plain where
the power for the cash-generating machine comes from.

FT  25 MAY 93 / EC leaders likely to consider strategy to create extra jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders are likely to consider a strategy for tackling
unemployment in the EC which would create more jobs than economic recovery
on its own is expected to produce. A document which the Commission is
expected to adopt tomorrow says unemployment could be cut by measures such
as reducing employers' social security contributions and encouraging the
sharing-out of jobs.
There are now 17.4m EC citizens without jobs, 10.3 per cent of the
workforce.
The framework policy, which was approved in its essentials yesterday by the
chefs de cabinet of the Commission, puts forward a jobs-crisis agenda for
the next three presidencies of the EC, to the end of 1994. But the so-called
'Community-wide framework for employment' avoids any challenge to Europe's
welfare states.
The document says a return to the high economic and productivity growth of
the late 1980s 'would still leave the Community well short of a target such
as 5 per cent unemployment'.
But the Commission confidently states that 'there is sufficient evidence and
experience to suggest that ways of, at least, improving the situation can be
found - over and above those which can result from higher levels of economic
growth.'
The proposed strategy, which is likely to be near the top of the agenda at
next month's Copenhagen summit of EC heads of government, is the first
EC-wide attempt to deal with structural unemployment. It focuses on ways of
creating more labour-intensive growth.
The document notes that while Belgium and the Netherlands have similar
labour productivity, the Dutch provide jobs for 10 per cent more people of
working age. The Danes earn less per head in real terms than western
Germans, but have a much higher proportion of people at work.
Outside the EC, the Commission notes that the US had the same rate of output
growth as the Community in the last decade, but that income growth per
American worker was half EC levels. More jobs were created and household
incomes rose. In Japan, the document says, high productivity in the traded
goods sector has created well-paid jobs in the service sector, where
productivity is well below EC levels.
'You can have labour-intensive work while still providing a highly
competitive product,' said one senior Brussels official.
The five main points call for: 'reducing labour costs . . . notably by
modifying the incidence of taxation systems'; new working time structures to
share out jobs; 'adaptibility at the workplace' and 'new forms of work
organisation'; training systems to bring more people into work and
'anticipate structural change' in industry; and exploitation of 'new areas
of work' like environmental industries.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Steinkuhler offers to resign in row over insider dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Franz Steinkuhler, leader of Germany's powerful IG Metall engineering
workers' union, yesterday offered to resign after accusations that he
benefited from insider dealing in the shares of Daimler-Benz.
At the same time he appealed for support from his union members to let him
stay in office and win back their confidence.
In a separate letter to Mr Hilmar Kopper, the chairman of the supervisory
board at Daimler, of which he is a member, Mr Steinkuhler said he would not
attend any further meetings until an inquiry into insider dealing on the
Frankfurt stock exchange reported on his particular case. That means he will
not attend the company's annual general meeting tomorrow, at which Mr
Steinkuhler's position on the supervisory board is certain to be an issue.
His move was seen yesterday not as an admission of defeat by the most
powerful union leader in Germany, but as a calculated gamble to maintain his
position.
In a letter to top officials of the 3.3m-strong union, he admitted that he
had made a 'political mistake' in buying and selling the shares of two
companies closely linked to Daimler.
Although he denies the charge of insider trading in the shares of both
Fokker, the Dutch aerospace manufacturer controlled by Daimler, and Mercedes
AG Holding, the Daimler holding company, he admitted that it was wrong to
have bought and sold them at all as a board member.
He promised that all the shares had now been sold, and the profits paid into
the solidarity fund for the recent strike by union members in the east
German engineering and steel industries. Mr Steinkuhler bought DM1m (Pounds
390m) worth of MAH shares, and earned a profit of at least DM64,000 on the
sale of a first tranche, after Daimler decided to dissolve the holding
company and exchange its shares for full company shares.
'I am clear today that it was politically wrong for the first chairman of IG
Metall to buy the shares of a company to whose supervisory board he belongs,
regardless of when it was done,' he said. 'In that sense, I have committed
an error which has shaken not only my personal credibility, but has brought
our organisation and our common goal into disrepute.'
He offered to resign 'if my behaviour proves too great a burden for the
union'. His letter will be discussed today at a national executive meeting
of IG Metall. However, any final decision on whether his resignation is
accepted will almost certainly be left to a meeting of the union's national
advisory committee on June 8.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Personal View: Portillo risks targeting his own foot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN LE GRAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Targeting welfare benefits is again in fashion for the UK government in its
search for cost savings. Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury,
has floated the idea as part of the current review of public spending.
Political pundits declare its inevitability. Even the Labour party's
Commission on Social Justice is giving it serious consideration.
The argument is simple. Public spending is out of control, largely because
of the expense of universal benefits; and universal benefits by their very
nature go to the middle class, who do not need them. Targeting would enable
welfare spending to be cut, thus relieving the pressure on the public purse
while not hurting those really in need.
But research by the welfare state programme at the London School of
Economics, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, suggests that
all these claims have to be treated carefully. It is true that welfare
spending is at an historical high with respect to gross national product -
26 per cent in 1992-93. But this is in part a consequence of the recession,
which both raises spending, through its impact on unemployment, and lowers
GNP. If the green shoots of recovery are indeed appearing, then the crisis
will melt away with the recessionary snows.
It is also true that the middle class benefit extensively from parts of the
welfare state. In some areas this involves large subsidies that are
difficult to defend - for instance, the use by the middle class of the
higher education system far outweighs any contribution they might make in
terms of taxation. But in other cases the situation is not so simple. For
the welfare state is not only, or largely, a Robin Hood device for taking
from the rich to give to the poor. Rather it takes tax payments from people
at one stage in their lives and, in return, pays benefits to them at
another. We estimate that over their lifetimes people pay for between
two-thirds and three-quarters of the benefits they receive from social
security, education and health. Hence the welfare state is acting as a
'savings bank', smoothing the flow of resources for the same individuals
over the life cycle.
The welfare state is not a real savings bank in the sense that people get
out the actual money that they have put in. Instead, today's workers pay for
today's welfare beneficiaries. But they only do so because there is an
understanding - an implicit contract - that they will be looked after if and
when the need arises. If the welfare state is altered at this point, large
numbers of people will feel the contract has been broken - that they have
paid into something from which they will not themselves benefit.
Moreover, even if any savings due to targeting are fed back to the losers
through tax cuts, it is far from clear that they will end up being better
off. Those who lose eligibility for benefits will be forced to make
insurance provision for themselves, provision that may be more expensive and
less flexible. Due to the costs of marketing, the payment of sales
commissions and so on, the administrative costs of private welfare are much
higher than for state welfare. And the market may fail altogether to offer
some kinds of protection, such as insurance against unemployment.
There is a further complication. Part of the welfare state does act as Robin
Hood and does indeed take from the lifetime rich and give to the lifetime
poor. It also redistributes between the sexes. Overwhelmingly, over their
lifetimes women are net gainers from the welfare state, receiving an amount
equivalent to the value of a good-sized house in a nice part of the country.
This is largely because of the impact of universal benefits such as child
benefit and the state earnings-related pension scheme. Removing them or
cutting them would benefit men at women's expense.
As Mr Portillo has found out, on this issue even putting a toe in the water
has serious political risks. Targeting offends many powerful groups.
Moreover, in many areas it is difficult to justify on more objective
grounds. Political parties should be very careful before they plunge into
this particular pool.
Finally, it should be remembered that the current 'crisis' is in large part
the government's own creation. In the run-up to the 1992 election, it
sharply increased public expenditure on welfare. Spending on health,
education, housing, personal social services and social security went up by
more than 14 per cent between 1990-91 and 1992-93, far more than could be
justified by recessionary pressure. All governments follow the electoral
cycle, but they need to be sensitive as to whom they make pay for it when
the election is over.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Complacency on the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDGED BY the lessons they draw from the turmoil in the exchange rate
mechanism, the principal monetary officials of the European Community have,
like the Bourbons, forgotten nothing and learned nothing. This is a pity.
'The Community,' asserts the EC's monetary committee, 'needs plain speaking,
confrontation on policy issues and critical probing of forecasts and policy
intentions.' But it also needs these virtues when analysing EC-wide policy
systems, like the ERM. Unfortunately, neither its report nor that from the
committee of central bankers display them.
It would help if the authors showed some appreciation of the scale of the
disaster that has befallen the EC. The Monetary Committee is correct in its
castigation of policy failures in member states. But the rigid application
of the ERM itself spread the consequences of German unification to the rest
of the EC, so creating today's damaging, but largely unnecessary, EC-wide
recession. Subsequent turmoil in the ERM damaged both the credibility of
individual governments and relations among them, in the process transferring
huge sums from taxpayers to speculators.
If the reports had confronted this record head on, they might have been less
complacent. For their conclusion is simply that 'current institutional and
technical arrangements in the EMS remain on the whole appropriate'.
Many recommendations
The principal recommendations from the monetary committee are 'the adoption
of stability-oriented economic policies in all participating countries';
'improved co-ordination of economic policies'; orientation of monetary
policy towards price stability; sound public finances; symmetric policy
action, 'in the sense that all countries are obliged to pursue
stability-oriented policies'; and appropriate responses to inflationary
divergence, including 'exchange rate changes . . . to offset, at least
partly, the effects on competitiveness'.
These recommendations are to be made effective by frank discussion of the
economic position of member states and 'action, when necessary, well in
advance, of the development of expectations of change on the markets'. But
the ERM will retain 'fixed but adjustable exchange rates', not turn into a
'crawling peg' system. In short, the system is fine. It is politicians who
have been foolish. This is an understandable position for countries still in
the system to take, but that does not make it the right one.
No consistency
In the first place, the ERM has failed to provide consistent help to
stability-oriented policies. Spain, for example, did indeed suffer a
'significant and cumulative deterioration' in its competitive position that
undermined the credibility of the peseta. Nevertheless, Spain's problem in
the ERM was for years not a weak exchange rate, but a strong one. Similarly,
the fiscal problems of EC member states have been exacerbated in recent
years by the adverse effects of the ERM on the cyclical position of member
states.
In the second place, the ERM cannot be made stable by more timely adjustment
of exchange rates. Markets read the same statistics as policy-makers, but
react far faster. With the illusion of stability departed, investors will
analyse every EC member state for signs of cyclical or structural
disequilibrium. When they find one, they will move. The authorities must
then either resist or give in. If they normally accede to the pressure,
their currencies will be pushed towards floating. If they resist, their
credibility will be at stake and the temptation to play 'double or quits'
will be overwhelming.
The way fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates work in the absence of
exchange controls is well known. They cannot survive by offering a series of
hugely profitable one-way bets to speculators. As a result, the ERM will not
become more stable if substantial pre-emptive jumps in the exchange rate are
made more frequently than hitherto. The well-known answer is to move either
towards credibly fixed exchange rates, or towards managed floating. Given
the politics, it is not surprising, that the dilemma has not been
confronted. But there are flaws in the ERM. They must be eliminated.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Mission unpopular: The performance of the agency charged
with privatising east German industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eggs have often been pelted at the Berlin headquarters of the Treuhand, the
agency charged with privatising east German industry. Earlier this month
angry workers from the potash mines in Thuringia arrived in Leipziger
Street, where the Treuhand is based. Throughout the hot afternoon, they
shouted abuse at the agency's employees, threw eggs at the windows, and
scattered potash on the pavements. It was a reminder that of all the
institutions set up in east Germany after unification, the Treuhand is not
only one of the most well known. It is also the most hated.
This is because it has completely restructured east German industry in
accordance with the mandate granted by the government in 1990 after
reunification. The result has been high unemployment. Of the 4m workers in
the 13,000 companies placed under the Treuhand, only 1.4m now have jobs. By
the end of last year, the Treuhand had started closing down 2,200 companies.
Mr Hero Brahms, vice-president of the Treuhand, said there was no choice. 'I
know we are a shield for the politicians in Bonn. We will be blamed for the
unemployment in eastern Germany,' he said. 'But if you look at the
Treuhand's role, it was set up not only to privatise. We had to find
solutions for all our companies.'
Nearly 11,000 of the Treuhand's 13,000 companies have been dealt with since
1991, mostly through privatisation, which has brought in a total of DM40bn
(Pounds 16.2bn) - lower than expected. However, the agency has received
investment commitments totalling DM170bn, which will guarantee the 1.4m
jobs.
Mr Brahms believes the Treuhand has accomplished the tough part of its task.
Between now and the end of next year, when it is wound up, fewer than 1,000
companies, which employ 210,000, are left to be privatised. 'Eight hundred
of these companies have fewer than 100 employees each. These will not be too
hard to privatise,' Mr Brahms said.
Among the 1,000, there will, however, be some from heavy industry, such as
mining operations and engine makers, which are difficult to break up and
sell as smaller units. The Treuhand has set up five management companies,
run by west Germans, each of whom will supervise about 15 of these heavy
industrial companies. Over the next three or four years, they will
restructure them with the aim of selling them off.
It is not just industrial concerns that have proved difficult to sell. The
entire privatisation process has been complicated. One of the problems the
Treuhand faced in the early days was that it was working in a vacuum.
Germany chose not to use any of its neighbouring east European countries as
a model - it ruled out the Hungarian system of small-scale privatisation,
by-passed the Czech voucher scheme system of employee shares, and resisted
the Polish or Russian method of leaving big enterprises intact until the end
of the privatisation proceedings. Instead, it chose to privatise from 'the
top down'. Having made the decision, the government simply put everything up
for sale.
'It is academic whether the Treuhand could have done it differently,' said
Mr Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. 'I
was highly critical of this method of privatisation in the early days. But
it has done a fairly good job in a short space of time.'
Mr Mayer admitted that the cost of privatising east German industry had been
higher than expected. Initial estimates for taking over the bad debts of the
region's enterprises totalled DM70bn. This increased to DM92bn after
reunification and monetary union between the former west and east Germanys.
A further DM160bn was earmarked for the Treuhand for investment and
restructuring costs.
Now, the total debt of the companies for sale is likely to exceed DM270bn,
instead of DM252bn, because of rising labour costs. In addition, the falling
value of obsolete plant has limited the receipts from privatisations.
A further political development which has had a negative effect on the
companies' purchase prices has been the breakdown of the Soviet and east
European markets. When west German and foreign companies entered east
Germany it was initially with the hope that a stepping stone would be
provided to markets in the east. That hope has evaporated.
'Expectations (among investors) were high in 1991 because eastern Germany
still had markets,' said Mr Brahms. Russia, for example, was absorbing about
70 per cent of east German exports. But following the collapse of Comecon,
the former Soviet trading bloc, trade is down to virtually zero. 'This
affected the large enterprises. Their market disappeared overnight,' said Mr
Brahms. 'Investors were hit as well because some of their early concepts
were clearly designed for having a new, additional export market for eastern
Europe.'
Despite the collapse of markets in the east, the Treuhand managed to find
buyers for thousands of east German companies - mostly from west Germany.
Critics of the agency accuse it of having an in-built bias towards west
German industry and west German managers. There is a widespread perception
that west German companies rushed in and took over the most potentially
viable businesses, such as insurance companies and chemicals companies, to
protect their markets and keep out foreign competitors.
Mr Brahms and his colleagues dismiss such charges. 'Our foreign friends have
always said: 'East Germany for the West Germans'. The real story is that not
only did the west Germans know more about east Germany - and knew the
langauge. But they were more prepared to cope with uncertainties,
particularly property rights, which were very shaky in 1991,' he said.
'However, we were determined to attract foreign investors as a means of
creating more competition. Look how the French Elf petrol stations managed
to set up here.' However, by the end of this February, only 577 companies
had been bought by foreigners, about 10 per cent of the total. France, which
has invested DM4.8bn, headed the list, followed by the US, Canada and
Britain.
Mr Helmut Ballon, the director of the Treuhand responsible for mining
privatisations, said he and his colleagues had not shied away from seeking
foreign investors. He is active in selling east Germany's lignite mines to
an Anglo-American consortium headed by Britain's PowerGen and NRG of the US.
But he agreed that it was extremely difficult, in the early days, to
increase the flow of foreign investment. There were no proper marketing or
accounting procedures, for instance.
'We lacked basic information about what we were selling. Until about spring
of 1991, we could not even describe accurately what the companies did.'
Other Treuhand officials suggest that even if west German companies have
acquired the largest slice of east German industry, fears that they would
close factories to prevent competition have not materialised. 'We never
privatised with the aim of closing down,' explained Mr Frederick Fucci, from
the Treuhand's investor relations department. 'Indeed, all the contracts are
anchored on three principles.'
First, investors had to commit themselves to a certain level of funding over
a set period; second, they must set up a regional office in eastern Germany;
third, they must guarantee a fixed number of jobs for a specified periods,
depending on the contract.
So while short-term guarantees are in place and provide a measure of
confidence, the long-term outlook is less certain. The success of the
Treuhand will ultimately be gauged by the ability of the privatised
companies to compete. But the collapse of their traditional east European
markets together with the west European recession is likely to delay the
improvement of conditions in the east German economy.
According to a recent Deutsche Bank report, average operating losses last
year in privatised east German enterprises amounted to 20 per cent of total
turnover. But Treuhand officials remain optimistic. Mr Brahms said: 'Every
investor knew they were investing in an economy with rising wages, which
demanded sophisticated strategies. With such strategies, eastern Germany
should reach a higher standard faster than the other east European
countries. It will take time. But I am convinced there was no other
solution.'

The Tory government's ability to sound a bum note when it is trying to blow
its own trumpet never ceases to amaze.
It is justifiably proud of the Pounds 75m-worth of support it is pouring
into Manchester's bid to host the Olympic Games in the year 2000. But wasn't
it a trifle insensitive to make that very bid the centrepiece of the
Department of the Environment's exhibition stand at the City's 93 conference
which opened in Birmingham yesterday?
Brum, which is co-sponsor of the conference, is still smarting at the
government's refusal to back its own attempt. 'I'd like to see the level of
resources provided for Manchester made available to Birmingham,' growled
Labour councillor Albert Bore, chairman of the city's economic development
committee. 'All we got was a letter of support signed by Margaret Thatcher.'

One of the first things that accountant Ian Hay Davison needs to do when he
takes up the chairmanship of Newspaper Publishing, owners of The
Independent, is to get a wider boardroom table.
For Hay Davison, a former senior partner of Arthur Andersen, is a 'restless
man', according to The Independent's company historian, Stephen Glover. The
latter should know, since Hay Davison 'frequently lashed out' at Glover's
shins (unconsciously, of course) when the two of them used to sit around the
Indy's boardroom table. Hay Davison's other failing, according to Glover, is
that he often gets people's names wrong. Indeed, Glover was so irritated by
this that that, when he told Hay Davison that he was resigning, he insisted
on saying 'Goodbye George'. Vicious stuff.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Observer: Willy's final Claes act
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What have Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, and Sir Edward Heath,
father of the House of Commons, got in common apart from an enthusiasm for
the European ideal? They both like conducting orchestras almost as much as
orchestrating their fellow politicians' agendas.
Indeed, Claes is looking forward to Belgium's presidency of the European
Community, which begins on July 1, with a mixture of optimism and sadness.
Optimism, because last week's Danish and British votes in favour of the
Maastricht treaty have given the drive towards European union new impetus.
Sadness, because for six months Claes will be out of action as a conductor.
Claes has made quite a name for himself as a guest conductor of orchestras
worldwide. On an official visit to the Middle East in December, the
54-year-old Flemish socialist caused quite a stir by conducting the
Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra with one hand, while condemning Israel's
deportation of 400 alleged Muslim fundamentalists with the other.
Aides say conducting is the only activity Claes has time for outside his
ministerial duties and the minister's Brussels office features an elaborate
hi-fi system. Sadly, Claes conducts his last concert next month for Belgian
television and then will have to content himself with trying to keep the 12
member states in tune.
Come December, however, the Community baton will be passed on to the Greeks
and Claes will be free to remount the podium: he's already fixed up three
concerts with the Liege opera orchestra and is open to further offers.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Spain's new challenges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHOEVER FORMS Spain's government after the general election on June 6 will
need to face up to uncomfortable realities about the country's economic
structure and its place in Europe. Mr Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government
has fervently desired full Spanish participation in greater European
economic integration. Yet he has failed to put into effect the measures
needed to ensure this aim. The time of reckoning has arrived.
Mr Gonzalez, in power since 1982, starts the election campaign more or less
level pegging in the polls against his conservative opponent, the untried Mr
Jose Maria Aznar. Given that the prime minister presides over an economy in
recession and a party weakened by factionalism and allegations of
corruption, this is not a bad position for him. The country's budget deficit
and large current account deficit, however, along with the latest official
unemployment rate of 21.7 per cent, underscore that Mr Gonzalez has been
unable to make use of previous years of buoyancy in the Spanish economy to
solve some basic economic problems.
Mr Aznar, for his part, has succeeded in modernising his Partido Popular and
moving it towards the political centre. But the lack of detail in Mr Aznar's
prescriptions has added to the difficulty of seeing his party as a credible
alternative to the Socialists.
Peseta devaluation
With the left in disarray in every large European country, it is not
surprising that Mr Gonzalez has lost some of his panache. Most strikingly,
the three devaluations of the peseta since September illustrate the gap
between the prime minister's rhetoric and the real world outside the Moncloa
Palace.
Spain has to come to terms not only with the short-term problems engendered
by the European slowdown, but also with the longer term challenge of life in
a wider Europe. The eastward shift in the continent's centre of gravity has
brought new competition from former communist countries where wages are
roughly one-fifth of Spanish levels. Unless Spain adapts to these
circumstances, its ability to attract grants and investment from the rest of
the EC will be badly constrained.
The latest devaluation of the peseta on May 13 was a setback for Mr Gonzalez
and his finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga. However, after several years
with an over-valued currency, the overall fall of 15 per cent in the
exchange rate against the D-Mark since autumn gives Spain the chance to
bring its economy into better balance.
Fresh priorities
The goal to which the country aspires - economic and monetary union by the
end of the century - has become less feasible even for the stronger EC
economies, let alone Spain. If Spain now realises that it is unlikely to be
among the first group of EC members that go ahead with Emu, this should be
construed not as a failure, but as an opportunity. Above all, Spain should
reverse its order of priorities. Its most pressing task is to construct and
enact policies to correct flaws in the domestic economy and make Spain more
competitive. The time to worry about participation in Emu will come after
these policies are in place, and showing positive results.
Because of the size of the unregistered economy, the official figures
overstate the true level of unemployment. None the less, the recorded level
of 3.3m represents a startling waste of resources in one of the EC's poorest
countries. To realise its undoubted potential, Spain needs to make room for
private-sector job creation.
Crucial to this aim are measures to restructure and privatise public sector
industry, to control public spending more effectively, and to make labour
markets more flexible. Two measures long sought by employers, which Mr
Solchaga has failed to push through because of party and trade union
opposition, are particularly necessary: the ending of administrative
controls over layoffs, and the break-up of rigid centralised wage
bargaining.
Unless Spain makes adjustments of this kind, it will have little chance of
leaving the economic periphery and climbing into Europe's premier league.
Voters do not yet seem fully convinced of the need for a change in
priorities. As the election campaign gets under way, the politicians' task
now is to show it is essential.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Beijing news shocker: The Chinese press is undergoing
radical change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Madam Yang, the Beijing newspaper vendor, had no doubt what sells papers and
magazines. 'News,' she declared. 'That's what sells. You've got to have hard
news.'
'What I'd like to tell newspaper editors,' she added, speaking near her
stand at the entrance to a Beijing subway, 'is to get more original and
bizarre stories in their papers, make them more entertaining. You may frown
on it, but that's what makes a paper sell.'
Madam Yang could have been repeating the gospel according to Mr Rupert
Murdoch, the publishing tycoon who visited Beijing recently, in his efforts
to extend his empire to the Chinese mainland. But her attitude and her
enterprise also reflect the enormous changes that have overtaken China's
press in the past few years.
Take Madam Yang herself. Her small stand, which turns a tidy profit each
month, is a relatively new phenomenon. Back in the days when choice of
newspapers for Beijing's residents was restricted to a few, grey Communist
party-controlled propaganda sheets, such as the People's Daily, distributed
mostly by subscription, there was no need for newspaper vendors.
At the People's Daily itself, located in a sprawling walled compound in a
Beijing suburb, mention of the fate that befell Pravda, its Soviet
equivalent, brings a worried response. Pravda is barely surviving with a
circulation of 500,000, down from 10m in its heyday.
The Daily's circulation has also slumped, to 3m from a high of 6m in the
1970s. Mr Wu Changsheng, a senior People's Daily editor, makes no attempt to
disguise his concerns. 'In the past,' he says, 'We didn't have any
competition, therefore we didn't have to worry much about attracting
readers. Now, our task is to make the paper more attractive and appealing
without losing authority.'
For much of the past four decades since the Communists came to power in
1949, numbers of newspapers had been limited. There were as few as 100
papers in the country, before liberalisation of the market in the 1980s
prompted a proliferation of new titles. By the end of last year, 1,635
newspapers were being published, with combined annual sales of about 25.2bn
copies. Circulation grew by about 20 per cent last year over the year
before.
Mr Shi Feng, an official of China's Press and Publishing Administration,
which is responsible for licensing new publications, says there is enormous
continuing demand for licences, both for newspapers and magazines including
business publications. The surge in magazine titles has perhaps been even
more notable than for newspapers. Some 6,400 magazines, the bulk of them
technical, are published in China with a combined circulation of 2.3bn.
Apart from the big number of periodicals coming on to the market, papers
themselves are also getting bigger - from a typical four pages to as many as
12. Papers are also publishing more supplements and weekend special
editions. In short, Chinese publications are becoming more commercial.
Just how commercial became apparent the other day when the official Shanghai
Wenhui Daily covered its entire front page with a large advertisement for
air conditioners. This prompted an outcry among readers, and a worried
reaction from competitors. But Wenhui business managers were unrepentant
since, as they explained, the paper is now obliged to make its own way in
China's market economy.
China's establishment press and its problems were the subject of a somewhat
plaintive article in a recent issue of Outlook, a magazine published by the
official New China News Agency, whose reporters had conducted an
investigation into the decline of the 'big papers'.
These inquiries yielded some revealing comments, including those of an
anonymous People's Daily editor who said with surprising candour: 'The news
that (People's Daily) publishes is not new, which is not only insulting to
the word 'news', but is also deceiving to the readers.'
The magazine also related several colourful anecdotes to reinforce the
point. In one, an editor of an 'establishment' paper, such as the People's
Daily, returning home one night and finding on the dinner table the same old
fare, asked his wife why? To which, she replied: 'I learn it from your
newspaper. Don't you serve the same thing everyday.'
It is the new papers and magazines which have departed from the 'standard'
fare that are, not surprisingly, doing best. These publications have been
building circulation rapidly by printing titillating and semi-scandalous
reports on subjects ranging from the private lives of film stars and singers
to fairly explicit surveys of such previously taboo issues as homosexuality.
While editors are prepared to countenance fairly racy stories these days,
such daring does not extend to political stories. All practise a form of
self-censorship that would not be required of an editor in the west;
although Chinese editors say that circumstances are becoming more liberal
again after the crackdown that followed the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy
activists in Beijing.
'The political atmosphere is much better now, though it's not perfect,' said
Mr Li of the China Youth Daily, one of the country's 'big papers'. 'There's
always room to improve. But the trend is getting better and easier.'
That may be so, but the battle for real press freedom is only really just
beginning, and there is no indication that the Communist party might allow
real criticism of the political system and its leaders. Nevertheless, the
Chinese word, toumingdu, meaning transparency in the media and in
government, is heard more frequently these days; and some of the more daring
publishers and editors are openly challenging the status quo. Thus, the
publisher of Shanghai's Liberation Daily, probably the country's most
liberal publication, recently argued strongly that all Chinese have a right
to know - a fairly radical concept by local standards.
'If we really want to become an 'open China' in the eyes of the world, we
must first open up the press. Journalists have the right to interview, the
media has the right to report, and the public has the right to know,' he
wrote.
But in a country where the media has long been the exclusive preserve of the
Communist party the notion of the 'right to know' smacks of a dangerous
virus, and one that party officials are coming to terms with only
reluctantly.

FT  25 MAY 93 / The new Lords of Lotto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's new national lottery, which could be in operation late next year,
is expected by its supporters to become a gigantic new business, benefiting
many dozens of suppliers, with a turnover that could top Pounds 6bn. The
devil on my shoulder tells me it could be as exciting, and intellectually
satisfying, as direct mail, on which I am an expert. Bidders for the
principal contract, says one consultants' report, are offered the
opportunity to create a new FT 100 company.
That is only half of it. The lottery will extrude a regular supply of
instant millionaires, not to mention excited winners of lesser amounts, the
more innocent of whom will doubtless be seen as ripe pickings for vultures
from the financial services industry. It will pay taxes, initially a come-on
12 per cent, to the Treasury. The remaining crumbs - at worst under a fifth
of turnover and at best close to a third - will be divided among five 'good'
causes, one of which is the 'millenium fund' over whose celebrations the
prime minister hopes to preside. He should be so lucky.
Knowing all this wealth and power to be at stake, you will not be surprised
to learn that there has been a certain amount of lobbying on behalf of the
three principal interest groups involved: the football pools promoters, the
charities and potential players in the new market. Their efforts are
currently focused on the Lords, where the bill will be debated on Thursday.
Governed, as ever, by the angel on my other shoulder, my sympathies are with
the charities. It has to be said at once that if we soft-hearts have our way
the potential revenue from the lottery business will be cut by 30 to 40 per
cent, or more, the start-up will be slower, and the whole enterprise might
crumble. What a calamity] Let me explain. The establishment of lotteries is
a rapidly expanding global business. It should be categorised under
electronics, telecommunications and computer services. There are two main
types of game. The big, expensive one, entailing huge set-up costs, is
lotto. You buy a ticket regularly and in advance. The prize is drawn on
evening TV shows once or twice a week.
The relatively cheap and cheerful alternative is the instant ersatz
crapshoot. You buy a card on impulse - while shopping, say - and the number
revealed by scratching the card or running it across an electronic reader
tells you at once whether you have won. Charities, whose tombola prizes are
immediate, fear the competition. A report on the national lottery prepared
for the government makes it plain that the instant gratification business is
a key element in the cash flow projections for the entire enterprise. I hope
their lordships are not put off by this argument.
A second threat to Mr John Major's dream comes from the pools promoters. The
government line is that football gambling is largely undertaken by men of a
certain earnings group. Lotto on TV, or scratch-cards bought at the
check-out counter, will attract women, the young, and, if the games are sold
by branch post offices, pensioners and social security beneficiaries. This
has not reassured the pools companies. During the passage of the bill
through the Commons they asked for five concessions. First, a reduction in
taxation to the same level as that proposed for the national lottery. Nice
try. Second, removal of the requirement that 'skill and judgement' be
required of punters. Another failed attempt. The pools promoters did better
on the next three. They won the right to sell their tickets through any
outlets, as opposed to their existing practice of using door-to-door agents
or direct mail. The lottery, on the other hand, is to be excluded from
betting shops and direct sales to households.
The pools asked for the right to advertise on TV, a key to monopoly power at
present available to the lottery alone. So far all they have been offered is
a provision allowing them to sponsor TV programmes, excluding the football
results. Finally, the 'rollover' of jackpots, which in the US has resulted
in prizes as high as Dollars 100m, but which in the UK is likely to be at
lower levels, will be permitted for the pools and the lottery on similar
terms. These two concessions have been offered as amendments to be tabled in
the Lords; we have yet to see the colour of the government's money.
What the third group, those whose snouts are in sniffing distance of this
bountiful new trough, is saying is that if the charities and the pools both
have their way there will not be enough left for the putative Lords of
Lotto. Then sports, the arts, the national heritage and the other potential
beneficiaries of this new business would be that much the poorer. Even
worse, Sainsburys, WH Smith, Granada, Forte, Texas Home Stores and the like
would be deprived of the chance to earn a 5 to 7 per cent rake-off plus
additional walk-through trade expected by the chosen retail outlets.
It all depends. As to the size of the trough, foreign experience is mixed.
Francaise de Jeux sold Pounds 3.7bn worth of tickets last year, following
the introduction of a multiple instant games strategy; CONI in Italy
competes with regional lotteries and brought in only Pounds 1.4bn. Residents
of Massachusetts spend an average of Pounds 200 each a year on lottery
tickets; the New Zealand equivalent is Pounds 56. Australians spend 8.4 per
cent of their discretionary income on their Tattersalls; Westdeutsche
Lotterie brings in only 5.1 per cent from the mad money available to each
inhabitant of its area.
These figures are from GAH Consultants, 4-6 Arne Street, WC2E, from whom you
can buy the whole book for Pounds 695. GAH, which advised the government,
believes that the UK national lottery has the potential to become the
largest in the world, with annual sales of 'anywhere between Pounds 2.5bn
and Pounds 6bn', albeit under Pounds 2bn without instant games.
We come at last to the beneficiaries. Let us be generous. Assume Pounds 4bn
to be the lottery income in a good year, with half going to prizes, 15 per
cent to the operating company, and 12 per cent in tax.
That leaves Pounds 920m for the five causes. Dream a little. Call it a
billion. Now ask yourself the following two questions: will the Treasury
maintain government funding for those who get shares of this billion, or
will it be cut? Will the 12 per cent tax take be kept at that low level or
will it be increased? You know the answers. So do I. There is no need to
send them in on a postcard.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Letter: Most US companies in retaliatory net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr L BLUMENTHAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr John Wosner's letter (May 20) suggesting that UK laws designed to
retaliate against US companies would have a limited effect can be of little
comfort to most US-based companies with UK subsidiaries.
It is true that if such companies (a) do not have their main place of
business in a unitary tax state such as California, or (b) are not subject
to tax by such a state, or (c) have less than 7.5 per cent of their US
payroll, property or sales derived from such a state, then they cannot be
affected by the threatened retaliation.
But given the wealth of California there must be few US-based companies that
are not potentially affected by the legislation. How many of them would be
affected would depend on the form of implementation since the making of a
Treasury order to enforce the provisions would not only give the effective
starting date, but can also say which of the tests listed above would be
applied.

Sir, The culture of late payments has been sown, fertilised and further
grown by large companies. They must be made to mend their ways. Until they
do the poor small business does not even receive the cash to pay its own
bills. It is, therefore, no wonder that research appears to support the
contention that small businesses are as dilatory as the large ones ('UK's
late payment culture attacked,' May 10).
When will the headline writers, authors of financial arguments and others
look at it from this angle?

<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK A COGGRAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was pleased to read your comments ('Cable telecoms') and the sensible
suggestions for overcoming the restrictions placed on BT.
My telephone is connected to the BT network via copper wires. This is, as
you have pointed out, obsolete technology and BT is prevented by government
regulations from replacing this metal based network by fibre optics for its
domestic customers. Thus, we are deprived of services which would otherwise
be available.
The fact that BT has this Luddite ball and chain clamped round its
metaphorical leg only illustrates how daft British governments can get.
These restrictions not only hold back the technical development of BT, but
also manufacturing companies supplying equipment to BT.
Once installed, fibre networks will be able to provide a great variety of
information for the home consumer. However, to be successful this will have
to be cheap, probably at a price comparable to the cost of television film
channels. It will work if the price is right]

<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I noted with interest you editorial comments regarding a compromise
which would allow BT to overcome the asymmetry rule, which remains an
extraordinary restraint on trade.
You are correct in stating (Leading article: 'Cable television', May 19)
that information super-highways should be built because of genuine consumer
demand, although it should be borne in mind that, as a rule,
telecommunications applications are developed only when a network
infrastructure exists to support them - a classic chicken and egg situation
 -of which ISDN is a prime example. The trade and industry select committee
should bear this in mind if and when it launches an inquiry.
If BT is seriously expected to compete as a successful global player in the
US market, then the Department of Trade and Industry will have to lift the
restrictions that prevent BT from making more efficient use of its existing
network.
The asymmetry rule preventing BT and Mercury from using its network for
broadcast entertainment retards the introduction of fibre towards the house
and office, and the development of new services.
My union has been at the forefront of the argument for a national broadband
grid or 'network of the future'. However, this requires a regulatory regime
that encourages modernisation of BT's local loop by making it commercially
viable - and the obvious way to do this is to relax the asymmetry rule. As
John Harper, former managing director of BT, argues, the regulatory regime
and industry structure in Britain acts 'as a drag rather than a help to the
early stages of exploitation and application of broadband technology'.
Few of the UK cable companies are laying fibre to the home. Instead, we are
experiencing a proliferation of co-axial and copper cable - leaving us with
the prospect of two outmoded local loops.
It is essential that, if the government wants to modernise the UK's telecoms
networks in the interest of residential customers, business customers and
international competitiveness, removal of the asymmetry rule must be a
priority.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Letter: Closing Tecs would be a political nonsense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDWARD ROBERTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, No doubt Mr Ansel Harris finds it enjoyably diverting to write
(Letters, May 18), as he so often does, suggesting Training and Enterprise
Councils should be closed down, but that is a practical, as well as a
political, nonsense. If he really cares about training and enterprise he
should make constructive and practical suggestions on how Tecs can deliver
even more than they do already.
In the meantime a few facts.
Tecs are making real progress in training. Forty-three per cent of adults
leaving employment training last July were qualified, compared with 36 per
cent the year before under schemes run by the employment department. In
September 1992, 32,000 young people awaited training under the youth
training system. In April 1993 this number had been reduced to 5,300.
In a typical year there are some 40,000 business start-ups under Tec
support. Some 85 per cent of these are still successfully trading and
growing after one year of operation, making a significant contribution to
employment and economic development. All Tecs have economic regeneration as
the cornerstone of their strategies, based on investment in the business
community and inward investment. Raising skills of the workforce through
training is fundamental to this.
Our targets are ambitious and rightly so if we are to achieve international
competitiveness. Tecs are here to stay. And with their partners in
education, local authorities, chambers of commerce, and enterprise agencies
they are tackling an immense task with increasing success.

Sir, Your article, 'Mitterrand mocks UK as new TGV link opens' (May 19),
states that French rail users are complaining about the higher fares they
will have to pay to help recoup the cost of building the new Paris to Lille
line.
The range of fares quoted in the article is just about the same as we
currently pay in Britain for the comparable length of journey between London
and Bristol, without BR having made comparable outlays on new trackwork and
rolling stock. What prospect is there of high-speed rail links in Britain at
fares we can afford?

FT  25 MAY 93 / Arts: The gospel according to The Five Blind Boys - Summer
festival time has arrived in earnest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Jazz Festival Free jazz audiences seem to have an air of resigned
purpose to them. In the bar beforehand, bearded men holding pints greet one
another grimly as though preparing psychologically for that parachute drop
behind enemy lines or shooting of whitewater rapids which will inevitably
claim a few of them. 'Seen Bill?' 'Nope. Saw him at Spontaneous Music
Ensemble last month and haven't seen him since.' They are survivors and they
know they are all in it together at least until they go the way of all flesh
 -to Radio 2.
The body count from Saturday's free jazz ordeal at the Bloomsbury Theatre
will reveal the diehard ranks to be thinned but no less resolute. An entire
afternoon of London's most free spirits was capped by the appearance of the
testing reeds of American Anthony Braxton - mathematician, chess demon and
musical experimentalist. Pursued by the staccato, attacking piano chords of
Marilyn Crispell, Braxton darted from alto, soprano and sopranino saxes,
clarinet, contrabass clarinet and flute, music charts from both musicians
spilling to the floor around them.
It is said that Braxton often uses formulae and mathematical calculation to
compose a framework for his challenging improvisation. That does not mean to
say there are any obvious points of reference and this work, delivered
without introduction or explanation (if there is any) tumbled out in a great
snow storm of notes, up and down tempo. Musically, however, the performance
was as evocative as a book of logarithms. Abstract jazz, like all 'modern'
art, is not easy and perhaps all the more rewarding for that when it does
actually move the emotions. The trouble with Braxton and Crispell's manic
exchanges this night was that it was not involving, had no heart and did not
swing.
Which is precisely what the gospel of The Five Blind Boys of Alabama,
closing the London Jazz Festival on Sunday, is all about. Formed 50 years
ago at the Talageda Institute for the Blind by Clarence Fountain, who sings
a sanctified bass, and on the road ever since, the Blind Boys' honeyed a
cappella harmonies are a soothing secular balm. Joined by a rhythm section,
elderly lead tenor Jimmy Carter, who at the climax of the show was lowered
into the hollering crowd by his minder, shares a similar bag to James Brown.
'We didn't come to England to find God,' intoned Fountain, who like the
other greying Boys was wearing a sharp double breasted suit and shades, 'We
brought him with us]' Their combination of belief, unashamed sentimentality
and showmanship is irresistible and the congregation on Sunday succumbed
entirely. The salutary advice of a country and western tinged 'I'm not that
way anymore', which concerned gambling and drinking, left bottom lips
trembling while the blues shouting of 'Brother Moses Smote the Water', had
them dancing in the aisles. If Braxton needs reminding of what music ought
to do he should order a copy of the Boys live album Deep River (Elektra 7559
614-40).

FT  25 MAY 93 / Arts: The 'culture of curiosity' - Patricia Morison admires
Cassiano dal Pozzo's Paper Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIAL MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cassiano dal Pozzo looked at the world 'with the true eyes of a lynx'. His
biographer could hardly have chosen an epitaph that would have pleased
Cassiano more. In an age distinguished by voraciously inquiring minds,
Cassiano stands out as a man of boundless curiosity. Patron of Poussin,
close friend and literary midwife to Galileo, correspondent of scholars and
dilettantes throughout Europe, Cassiano is a figure who really repays
discovery.
The Paper Museum of Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588-1657) at the British Museum
does not quite measure up to the fascination of its subject. That would
require an altogether more ambitious exhibition. To get the measure of
Cassiano, you definitely need the catalogue (published by Olivetti Pounds
18.50).
Cassiano and his circle stood at the centre of the scientific revolution.
There was, of course, no sense of any tension between art and science, let
alone of 'two cultures'. Cassiano, a lifelong bachelor, devoted himself to
Art which led him to subjects as diverse as science, museology, collecting,
geology, art-history, botany, architecture, archaeology, libraries, even
sport.
Cassiano was born in Turin in 1588, but the family then moved to Pisa, a
highly cultured city which was, of course, Galileo's home. After his father
died, he established himself in Rome in the service of Cardinal Barberini.
He lived with his younger brother, who helped him amass a great library and
a collection which ranged from flamingoes to antiquities and Poussin's
'Seven Sacraments.'
Many an aristocratic collector could boast a more impressive Wunderkammer.
Cassiano was only ever comfortably off. But his interest in science was on
an altogether more profound level than that of the average collector. Like
Galileo, he was elected to the select, and in some circles highly suspect,
Academy of Lynxes, the ancestor of all modern scientific institutions.
Whatever the subject at issue, nature, art or the manners and customs of
antiquity, Cassiano held that exact visual records were vitally important.
Aristotle's and Theophrastes's verbal descriptions were no longer adequate
for people with inquiring minds.
Cassiano's interest in natural history is well represented, with two of the
earliest microscopic studies ever made and striking studies of animals,
birds, plants, minerals, fungus and petrified wood. Some of these were for
books which Cassiano commissioned from proteges - he preferred to act as
literary midwife rather than publish himself.
Delectable watercolours of citrus fruit by Vincenzo Leonardi (one of few
identifiable artists working for Cassiano) were preparatory drawings for an
astounding compendium on the citrus fruit, the Hesperides. Its author,
Cassiano's friend Ferrari, was a typical polymath of the time. He was a
Jesuit, Professor of Hebrew in Rome, an elegant poet, author of a Syriac
grammar, and he planned the Barberini garden. One of the most attractive
drawings on show is Guido Reni's allegorical scene of Genoa watching as
Daedalus grafts a lemon-tree.
Cassiano's plan was that his Paper Museum (Museo Carteo) of some 7,000
drawings would ultimately be published as the indispensable guide to the
ancient world. Artists were commissioned to copy objects such as mosaics,
armour, reliefs, gems, statuary, inscriptions, and manuscripts. His main
interest was not so much the aesthetic quality of the object copied, but
what it showed about the world of the ancients.
By no means all the drawings are good, but they had to meet Cassiano's
criteria of being informative. The Paper Museum was a project which met with
approval in the highest circles. Cassiano was allowed to borrow two of the
most precious manuscripts from antiquity, the Vatican Terence and Virgil,
for a year so that his best artist, Pietro da Cortona, could copy scenes.
Cassiano also collected older prints and drawings. Like many 17th-century
collectors, he liked plans of fortifications and scenes of warfare. His
collection of architectural drawings were a painful reminder of how much
contemporary architects had departed from classical and Renaissance models.
In 1762 the Adam brothers bought a large part of the Paper Museum for George
III - siphoning off four magnificent books of architectural drawings for
their own purposes. The Royal Collection did not keep all its Cassiano
drawings but still owns the largest share.
An international committee has been coordinating research into Cassiano,
sponsored by Olivetti - a wholly exceptional gesture of corporate support
for scholarship. The exhibition catalogue is volume four of the Quaderni
Puteani, absorbing essays on Cassiano. Eventually the Paper Museum is to be
published in its entirety. The current exhibition is an intriguing dip into
the 17th-century intellectual world and its 'culture of curiosity'.
At the British Museum until August 30

FT  25 MAY 93 / Arts: Moscow comes to Brighton - Summer festival time has
arrived in earnest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moscow Chamber Opera's British debut this weekend has been a highlight of
the Brighton Festival, its first two programmes confirming the company's
reputation as a lively and versatile music-theatre group. Formed 21 years
ago by the veteran producer Boris Pokrovsky, Moscow Chamber Opera has spent
much of its working life in a suburban basement theatre, and its repertory,
which includes works frowned on by the former authorities, has enhanced its
'underground' status.
It was neatly appropriate that the visit should have opened with a work full
of old Russian religious symbolism, The Rostov Mysteries. A Nativity play
framed by an allegorical episode and epilogue presenting the conflicting
forces of Good and Evil, it was first performed in a Rostov seminary in
1702, and revived about 10 years ago.
Friday's performance in St Martin's Church was given on a rough wooden
platform stretching down the nave, which brought the vivid spectacle close
to the audience. Moscow Chamber Opera's singing-actors were wonderfully
communicative in their varied roles, maintaining a well-blended ensemble
without conductor or accompaniment. Among the many characterful performances
Yvegeny Boluchevsky's Astrologer, Marina Zhukova's Rachel and Alexey
Mokhalov's chilling, blood-red Death were outstanding.
More conventional, though hardly familiar, territory was reached in Sunday's
triple bill at the Roedean Theatre, which began with Shostakovich's
torso-version of The Gamblers. This Gogol setting occupied the composer
during 1942, but its anti-heroic story of a card-sharper was perhaps too
flippant for wartime Russia, and he abandoned it; what remains of it lay
unstaged until taken up by Pokrovsky in 1989.
The company revealed its thoroughly Russian approach to drama. This was
satire by overstatement, with emphasis less on singing or highly-produced
staging than on expressive interaction between performers. Notable among
these were Boris Tarkov in the central role of the gambler Ikharyov,
passionate in his aria addressed to a pack of marked cards; Nikolay Kurpe,
who as Krugel disclosed a line in silly walks and twitches; and as the
servant Gavryushka Valery Belykh, whose gravelly bass was heard in a
balaika-accompanied folk song. The score is brittle; Anatoly Levin, in the
pit for the evening, conducted it capably.
Next came the first British performance of Shostakovich's Antiformalistic
Gallery, a private, anti-Soviet joke conceived at the time of the notorious
1948 Zhdanov decree on music - its existence was revealed by the composer's
widow only in 1989. In a gibe at the Composers' Union, which declared that
music should be optimistic and entertaining, a motley crowd of 'musical
functionaries' are addressed in banal tones by caricatured luminaries.
Stalin, resplendent in a tatty vest and angels' wings, was hilariously
mocked by Vladimir Khrulev, and the poker-faced 'KGB' danced in time to a
figure (Eduard Akimov) representing Khrennikov, the much-decorated,
much-hated Soviet Kapellmeister. Westerners can only scratch the surface of
the piece, but its zestful performance made merely watching it seem an act
of sneaky subversion.
Mikhail Kislyarov's production of Stravinsky's Renard was anti-climactic,
illuminating little a piece most commonly heard in concert performance.
Biting satire appears to be Moscow Chamber Opera's strength: there is a
chance to sample more of it in the company's acclaimed staging of
Shostakovich's The Nose this week.

BBC's crime and punishment season continues tonight with an absorbing
Assignment (BBC2, 7.45pm), examining the Japanese way of crime - low rates,
good prisons, but rather nasty prying police plus new ruthless types of
gangsters on the way.
Two excellent nature programmes worth making an effort to see - In Praise of
Penguins (Channel 4, 4pm), splendidly narrated by Richard Briers, and
Wildlife 100 (BBC1, 7pm), on ants in Panama and the Amazon jungle, with
David Attenborough.
Testimonies (Channel 4, 9pm) holds a mirror up to the Israeli army's
behaviour in its combat against Palestinians involved in the six-year old
Intifada. Some may feel its critique of Israeli army violence fails to
address some basic political questions - like, it takes two to be peaceful.
ITV has given up all pretence of scheduling intelligent programmes until
bedtime. Disappearing World (ITV, 10.40pm), one of the last quality
controlled ITV programmes, tonight features the 50 year old bloody civil war
of the Karen tribesmen against Burma's military bullyboys.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Arts: 'The Fairy Queen' in Covent Garden - Summer festival
time has arrived in earnest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So much amusement has been caused by the production of Mozart's masonic
opera The Magic Flute in the Freemasons' Hall that people do not seem to
have noticed how apposite are some of the other venues occupied by the BOC
Covent Garden Festival. Ingenuity has certainly made the most of the
available performing spaces.
In the very centre of the festival's catchment area lies a Wren masterpiece
 -St Paul's Church, with its rear portico (or is it the front?) facing
directly on to the piazza. What better to feature there than the music of
Purcell, Britain's leading Restoration composer? Ideally, one might have had
some of the choral music, at present being recorded complete for the first
time, but that looks as if it will have to wait for another year.
The work that was presented on Sunday was the semi-opera, The Fairy Queen.
The Gabrieli Consort under Paul McCreesh performed it almost complete (a
couple of numbers, including the Plaint, were omitted, presumably on the
grounds that they were added later). Some acting of a sort was invited,
mostly in the lighter passages, but probably should not have been. Singers
need a firm directorial hand if jokey ideas are not to get out of control.
As it was, the comic interludes rather took over and the atmosphere was of a
more plebeian entertainment than usual, which may or may not be true to
Purcell's day. The drunken poet reeled in the aisles; Corydon and Mopsa
camped up their duet something awful, although Mark le Brocq's impersonation
of Benny Hill impersonating a suggestive blonde with pigtails revealed
hidden talents. McCreesh and his musicians supported them all with lively
playing.
It is, however, only a year since William Christie performed The Fairy Queen
at the Barbican, and his subtle and expressive way with the music was the
more rewarding. He also had the better singers, although the bass Peter
Harvey made such a fine job of his Winter solo as almost to tip the balance
the other way. The linking narration was provided by Simon Butteriss, a
couple of sly asides wittily reminding us that this is a festival which is
on the ball.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Arts: Holloway's Fantasies - Summer festival time has
arrived in earnest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two anniversaries, of Grieg at 150 and Robin Holloway at 50, provide the
focal points for this year's Bath Festival, which opened on Friday. The
Grieg celebration ranges widely across the piano works, chamber music and
songs, as well as generating its own secondary theme in the music of
Schumann, such a potent influence on the young Norwegian and vitally
important to Holloway's creative make-up too.
Holloway's fiftieth year has already provided the opportunity to revive two
of his most fascinating scores of the 1970s - the BBC Philharmonic included
movements from the deliciously extravagant Domination of Black in its
Cambridge invitation concert earlier this year, and last month at the
Festival Hall the BBC Symphony Orchestra played again Holloway's Second
Concerto for Orchestra, perhaps his finest work to date. Though there is one
brand-new piece, a Partita for solo horn, in the Bath celebration it ranges
back nicely across two decades of Holloway's output, inevitably
concentrating on the smaller-scale pieces but nevertheless promising a
nicely rounded portrait of one of Britain's most intriguing and often
frustrating composers.
The Nash Ensemble's programme on Saturday evening included two Holloway
works. The Concertino No. 5, Summer Music, from 1991 still seems to me a
peripheral piece, but the 1971 Fantasy Pieces Op 16 again emerged as
powerful and disconcerting, one of the scores (together with the orchestral
Scenes from Schumann and the instrumental Evenings with Angels) that first
established the distinctive tone of Holloway's voice.
The Fantasy Pieces take Schumann's Op 24 Liederkreis as their starting
point. As Holloway suggests they were delivered here with a performance of
the Schumann song cycle (by an urgent, slightly over-insistent Neil Mackie)
placed between the Praeludium and the remaining movements. The result is
sometimes remarkable, sometimes misjudged; the coarse-grained scoring gives
a lurid cast to some of the material as Holloway takes up Schumann's
material, layers and cross-cuts it, refracts it through his transformational
prisms. Given an almost Wagnerian opulence the themes acquire extraordinary
new resonances, the harmony unexpected implications; the expressive world
seems immeasurably broader.
Twenty years on some of Holloway's ideas have become commonplace. But in the
context of the late 1960s his boldness in recognising what he wanted to do
in his music and the source of his creative strength now seems extremely
brave. His subsequent development has not always sustained that early
enterprise, but works like the Fantasy Pieces demonstrate how potent and
invigorating his imagination can be.
The Nash performances directed by Martyn Brabbins were spry and incisive.
They also included Oliver Knussen's Songs without Voices, four portions of
lyrical concentrate first heard in New York and Aldeburgh last year, and the
premiere of a horn trio by Mark-Anthony Turnage, commissioned by the Bath
Festival; At Close of Day is dedicated by Turnage to the memory of Charles
Groves. It is a lucid, uncomplicated piece: an expressive dialogue between
violin and horn is joined by a halting, out-of-kilter piano line, worked to
a weighty climax and allowed to trickle away again. The effect is direct and
impressive.
Bath Festival continues until June 5

A B 'Sandy' Marshall, 68, a former chief executive of P &amp; O, is one of the
great survivors of Britain's declining shipping industry. Hence, he should
have little difficulty stepping in to the number two slot at the Chamber of
Shipping, caused by Les Atkinson's sudden departure for Singapore.
Marshall takes over as vice-president of the Chamber of Shipping at the end
of the month from Atkinson, the chairman of BP Shipping, who has has been
promoted to head of BP's Far East operations. The latter's move to
Singapore, which follows a management reshuffle at BP, left the chamber with
a problem of finding a well-known industry figure willing to take on the
mantle of president from the current incumbent, Edmund Vestey.
Traditionally, the president of the chamber, which represents the owners of
Britain's 12m dwt shipping fleet, serves a one-year term and his successor
is the vice-president.
Marshall worked for P &amp; O for 32 years before losing his job as chief
executive after a boardroom disagreement over P &amp; O's strategy for survival.
He became chairman of Bestobell, Commercial Union and vice-chairman of
Boots. But he kept some link to the sea through chairmanship of The Maersk
Company.
His 'first love' has always been the sea and he is looking forward to his
new role.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Business and the Law: The photocopier as money-spinner - A
licensing scheme which seeks to make UK companies pay for reproducing
copyrighted material
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one is quite certain of the extent of illegal photocopying of extracts
from books, periodicals and journals by businesses in the UK. A pilot study
in 1988 showed that the annual use by commerce and industry of copyrighted
material is about 1.7bn copy pages. That is equivalent to a pile of copier
paper 107 miles high, the distance between London and Nottingham as the crow
flies.
It also represents an enormous loss of copyright income for authors and
publishers, including lost revenue from the export of intellectual property
of British rights holders. Copyright, which is just one form of intellectual
property, is estimated to account for 2.5 to 3 per cent of the UK's gross
domestic product.
Attempts in the early 1980s by the Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA),
Britain's organisation for licensing the reproduction of copyrighted
material, to reach agreement with industry for such a scheme came to
nothing. But following success in establishing licensing schemes for schools
and libraries, and changes in the law made by the 1988 Copyright, Designs
and Patents Act, the CLA was encouraged to make a further attempt to reach
agreement with business. A joint CLA/Confederation of British Industry
taskforce was set up in 1989 to examine the issue. Next week, after almost
three years of discussions, the CLA will launch a copyright-licensing scheme
for business, though complete agreement proved illusive and the CBI did not
endorse the plan.
Nevertheless, a licensing scheme is to become available from June 2, and
that means industry will have to come to terms with paying for something
which it is used to getting for free. Those companies which photocopy from
books and journals but do not become licensed will face an enhanced risk of
legal action by copyright holders.
One of the key issues faced by the CLA/CBI taskforce was how to determine
the volume, value and variety of copying by businesses without imposing
unreasonable administrative costs on companies.
As an alternative to a blanket licence, the taskforce looked at the merits
of a 'transactional licence', where copies are cleared by the copyright
owners as and when needed. Both the CLA and the CBI felt such a scheme would
be too difficult to manage compared with a blanket licence. But the CLA
argued that an unrestricted blanket licence could have a very damaging
effect on primary sales of copyrighted works.
In the end the taskforce settled on a two-tier system. Part A of the CLA's
plan allows multiple copying up to a certain number of copies. Above that
number the licence will not apply. Part B covers access to the CLA's Rapid
Clearance Service (Clarcs), a telephone-accessed data-base designed to
handle individual requests to copy specific titles outside the scope of the
basic licence. Clarcs fees will be payable on a case-by-case basis.
The CBI wanted to make Clarcs available separately from a basic Part A
licence, but the CLA would not agree, arguing that it is uneconomical for
small transactions.
The basic licence will allow copies to be taken from publications within the
CLA's remit. This includes all books and journals published in the UK except
works in categories such as newspapers, maps, exam papers, printed music and
industrial house journals.
The CLA is also able to license copying from works published in other
countries where reciprocal agreements exist between CLA and similar overseas
bodies such as the US Copyright Clearance Center.
The licence allows businesses to make up to nine copies of one article from
a single issue of a journal, or one chapter of a book (or up to 5 per cent
of the publication if this is greater), in connection with any single
occasion (such as a meeting) or for any single purpose. Copies can be
distributed freely within the licensee's business but external distribution
is prohibited.
Licence fees will be calculated by reference to the number of 'professional
employees' within a company, defined as all staff except clerical personnel
and apprentices. No price tags have been set out because collective
price-fixing agreements are outlawed by competition rules. Instead the
taskforce has proposed a basis for a tariff from which a company's charges
can be negotiated.
As the table shows, the tariff of fees proposed by the CLA will vary for
different sectors of industry. This is to reflect the fact that the value of
the material copied and the volume of copying will vary from sector to
sector. According to Mr Colin Hadley, CLA's chief executive, the experience
of foreign copyright licensing agencies, particularly the CCC, makes it
possible to predict sector patterns in photocopying. Industries with
intensive research and development functions such as pharmaceuticals and
energy are by far the heaviest copiers.
Nevertheless, if companies are going to feel confident that the licence fees
paid are reasonable and the CLA confident of a fair distribution of licence
income to individual copyright holders, detailed measurement of volume,
value and variety of copying will be needed.
It was this issue which proved the main sticking point for the taskforce.
Recording the number of copies actually made was rejected by the CBI as too
cumbersome. Eventually, it was agreed that companies taking out licences
would carry out an 'information audit' once a year, the principal component
of which will be a list of periodicals taken by the company. This will give
an indication of the range of publications from which copies could have been
taken.
Licensees will also have to complete an annual return, the contents of which
were not agreed by the taskforce. The CLA acknowledged that information
audits of companies without a formal library or central information centre
were impractical. This is likely to be taken into account when deciding what
information should be included in the annual return.
The issue of confidentiality of information gained through the audit was
also of concern to the CBI. If, for example, information about the type of
material being copied by a pharmaceutical company fell into the hands of a
rival it might provide invaluable information about lines of research being
pursued. But the CLA has assured the CBI that the confidentiality of any
information it requests through the audit will be guaranteed.
Will industry embrace the CLA's licence scheme? A great deal may depend on
the extent to which companies feel they need to be licensed. Many of them
believe their current copying activities are permissible as 'fair dealing'
under the terms of the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act. Fair dealing
is not defined by the act but is restricted to certain purposes (for
example, single copies for research and private study by individuals), and
it must be fair both to the user and to the copyright owner.
Mr Hadley says fair dealing provides industry with 'a convenient excuse to
justify what currently happens'. But multiple copying is unlikely to qualify
as fair dealing, he says, and there is some doubt as to what extent routine
single copying by individuals in businesses is likely to pass as fair
dealing.
If industry continues to assert that it is, the issue may have to be tested
in the courts, he adds. A recent landmark decision in the US involving
Texaco found routine single copying by individuals in businesses was not
'fair use' primarily because the copies were made in furtherance of Texaco's
commercial purposes and the copying was not fair to publishers as it
deprived them of subscription income. Lawyers predict the English courts
will adopt a similar line.
But short of legal action, the success of the licence scheme may depend on
how successful the CLA is at selling it to businesses. The sales pitch will
be concentrated on the heaviest copiers, as well as to law firms, which, if
persuaded of the scheme's merits, are likely to encourage their corporate
clients to become licensed. 'We won't neglect the publishing industry
either,' says Mr Edward Barrow, the CLA's licensing officer. 'If it's going
to work, our clients have to be seen to be taking the medicine too.'

FT  25 MAY 93 / People: Hay Davison's week for chairmanships
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Storehouse and former chief executive of
Lloyd's, is this week picking up two widely contrasting non-executive
chairmanships, that of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems, and, as
expected, of Newspaper Publishing, publishers of The Independent newspaper.
Davison, 61, who admits he has in the past too often been associated with
'disasters' - Lloyd's, which was ' a hefty struggle' and Storehouse which
was in trouble when he took it on - says he is attracted by MDIS as ' a
good-looking little company' that is young and growing.
He points out that he has the advantage of a computer background - his first
job with Arthur Andersen having been as the firm's 'computer expert'.
MDIS was formed in a management buyout from the US aerospace group earlier
this year.
Hay Davison says the company hopes to go public, though not before next year
at the earliest.
Hay Davison is keen to stress how 'sensitive' he is to the possible charge
of accepting too many non-executive directorships - he is on the board of
Chloride, CIBA-Geigy and Cadbury Schweppes - and claims, as a consequence,
to have turned down several other offers to make time to do the MDIS job.
He predicts an announcement about his chairmanship of The Independent, where
he has been a non-executive director since its inception, at a board meeting
on Thurs-day.
He replaces Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, who recently resigned partly because he
opposed plans to buy The Observer, but also because of disagreements about
the management style of Andreas Whittam Smith, who combines the role of
editor and chief executive.
Hay Davison claims to have been in favour of The Observer acquisition.
'It would have been very helpful', he says.

FT  25 MAY 93 / People: Golden days at Vauxhall as appointment raises status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Golden, treasurer of General Motors since 1989, will bring an
enhanced status to Vauxhall, the group's UK subsidiary, when he takes over
as chairman and managing director on June 1.
Golden was appointed a vice-president of GM, the world's largest vehicle
maker, in November last year. He will be the first GM vice-president to head
Vauxhall for a decade.
After many years of losses, Vauxhall turned the corner in the latter 1980s
and last year achieved a record operating profit, despite the recession in
the UK new vehicle market.
Vauxhall has become one of GM's main profit centres, giving it an added
status in a corporation that has been suffering record losses in North
America. The UK has also been attracting GM investment and is becoming an
important source for components purchasing for GM's operations in
continental Europe.
As GM treasurer in New York, Golden, 46, appears to have been on the fast
track at GM.
Of the five key executives at the top of GM today, four are graduates of the
treasurer's office, including Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, based in
Zurich. As executive vice-president responsible for all of GM's
international operations, Hughes is now Golden's immediate boss.
Golden began his General Motors career in 1970 in the treasurer's office
where his responsibilities included overseas financial analysis.
He later had various financial assignments there, at GM's headquarters in
Detroit, as well as at the former GM assembly and Fisher body divisions,
before returning to New York as assistant treasurer in 1984.
With the Vauxhall appointment, Golden is being given his first operational
experience overseas, usually a precursor to bigger things at GM.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Business and the Law: Limits on postal monopoly - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal monopolies given exclusive rights by national laws will be open to
competition in areas which do not threaten their core traditional business
or their economic viability following a ruling by the European Court of
Justice last week.
The court clarified the position of legal monopolies under EC competition
law in a case involving the Belgian postal service. It said that a business
which held a dominant position because it was granted exclusive rights under
national law did not automatically breach EC competition rules.
Member states, however, were under a duty not to adopt or maintain measures
which weakened EC competition rules.
In the context of businesses entrusted with services of general economic
interest, EC competition rules still apply so long as they do not interfere
with the provision of such services.
Belgium's postal monopoly law gave exclusive right to the Belgian postal
authority to collect, transport and deliver post in Belgium. Criminal
proceedings were brought against a Mr Corbeau for providing a service in
Liege.
The Liege court sought guidance from the European Court on the compatibility
of the postal monopoly with the Rome treaty's prohibition of abuse of a
dominant position and the rules dealing with the application of competition
law to the public sector.
The court ruled that the core service provided by the postal authority was a
service of general economic interest and thus EC competition rules would not
apply to the extent necessary for the achievement of the core postal
service. However, it was necessary to establish to what extent the
competition rules must be excluded for that purpose of general economic
interest to be achieved.
Because the Belgian postal monopoly needed to remain economically viable -
by cross-subsidising unprofitable with profitable sectors - it was
justifiable to prevent outside competition from those who only sought to
provide a competing service in profitable sectors of the market. Competition
could be permitted when competing services were specific, such as meeting
particular requirements and therefore distinguishable from the core postal
service.
Supplementary or improved services, such as home collection or greater
reliability within limited areas, would not threaten the economic viability
of the service.
Nevertheless the ECJ left it to the national court to apply these criteria
to the particular facts.
C-320/91: Paul Corbeau, ECJ FC, 19 May 1993.
Spanish aid decision overturned
William Cook, a UK steel castings group, has won its appeal against the
European Commission's rejection of a complaint about state aid granted to a
Spanish competitor.
The Spanish government granted a subsidy to Piezas y Rodajes SA for a
foundry investment programme in Teruel province. Further subsidies were
granted by various local authorities. William Cook complained to the
Commission that the additional aid was unlawful.
The court declared the appeal admissible as William Cook was a party
concerned by the procedure which the Commission should have initiated, even
though the Commission denied there were any big distortions of competition
resulting from the contested aid.
The court repeated its definition of parties concerned in this context as
persons, undertakings or associations whose interests might be affected by
the provision of the aid.
The court overturned the Commission decision because it had not initiated
the procedure provided for by the treaty when it had difficulties in
assessing the compatibility of aid. The court said the Commission may
restrict itself to a preliminary examination when taking a decision to allow
aid, only if it can satisfy itself from this that the aid is compatible.
Otherwise, it is duty bound to obtain all opinions and initiate the full
procedure.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Technology: Trading up in Montreal - A new service at a
Canadian exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every stock exchange aims to make trading in its listed securities as
efficient and orderly as possible. Any market that falls short risks losing
business to its competitors in an era when many companies list their shares
on more than one exchange.
The Montreal Exchange is going one step further. Besides honing its own
trading system, the exchange is in the advanced stages of a project that
will give member firms access to other exchanges and provide the myriad
sources of data required by a securities dealer - all on a single terminal.
'We see it as a normal extension of a stock exchange,' says Keith Gray,
president of TD Green Line, Canada's biggest discount brokerage and one of
six securities dealers that have agreed to install the Montreal system. The
ME's project - known as Platform for Electronic Access to Exchanges (Peace)
 -both competes against and complements services offered by established
systems integrators in the financial services industry.
One Canadian securities firm, RBC Dominion Securities, has shunned the
Montreal project in favour of its own trading platform, which it is
developing with the help of Reuters. Ken Troy, president of Reuters
Information Services in Canada, says that by mixing and matching trading
platforms and data feeds, securities firms can 'get exactly what they need'.
Peace users will be able to use Reuters data and will have access, if they
wish, to a Reuters trading platform through an electronic bridge.
The Peace project has its origins in the long-standing rivalry between the
ME and the busier Toronto Stock Exchange. Most large Canadian companies and
several foreign ones list their shares on both exchanges, with the result
that competition for trades is intense. Trading volumes in Toronto are five
to six times higher than Montreal, and the ME saw a risk of an even greater
imbalance when the TSE unveiled plans early last year to replace its trading
floor with a fully automated trading system.
'It was a cue for everyone that it was time to change,' says Rene Poirier,
the ME's vice-president for development.
Peace will give traders equal access to the ME and the TSE through a single
workstation. Traders will enter buy and sell orders into Peace, which will
search each exchange's electronic order book for the best deal and then
match orders on the basis of price and volume. The system will also be able
to split orders between the two exchanges.
Toronto's automated trading system has similar capabilities but does not
integrate its software with members' other trading and data requirements.
Peace will enable traders to use the same terminal for a variety of other
functions, such as historical market data, information on a trader's limits
and positions, and back-office links. 'The idea is to have one physical
device in front of a trader which can do almost anything,' Poirier says.
A key element in the Montreal package will be a data distribution system
known as Fist, which has been developed by Kapiti, a UK-based systems
integrator. The Kapiti software is already used by, among others, Barclays
Bank's global treasury division and Republic National Bank of New York. 'The
name of the game will be that the best market will win,' Poirier says. 'If
the people in Montreal are aggressive, they'll be in a better position to
get their share of the market.'
The Peace system is due to be commissioned by the first of its six initial
customers in August. If it proves successful, the ME plans to add trading
functions for the Vancouver and New York exchanges, both of which have
several dozen listings in common with Montreal and Toronto. The next step
will be to try to interest foreign securities firms that execute trades on
more than one exchange. New customers would make Peace not just a
technological success, but a commercial one as well.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Technology: Insights pierce Alzheimer's dark - Despite
recent advances in research, effective treatment may still be a long way off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The drugs industry's view of Alzheimer's disease has been transformed during
the past two decades, from an obscure and untreatable form of dementia to a
favourite target for research. Alzheimer's disease probably causes more
human distress, for victims and their friends and families, than any other
single disease of modern industrial society. It is now known to cause 70 per
cent of all cases of dementia, turning healthy brain cells irreversibly into
a characteristic pattern of decaying tangles and sticky plaques of protein.
At least 10m people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease.
The symptoms include progressive memory loss, inability to carry out simple
everyday tasks, breakdown of personality and, after a few years, death.
Alice Zilonka, aged 73, memorably described the early stage to the UK
Alzheimer's Disease Society: 'My brain is like a dark thunderstorm.'
Unfortunately there is no prospect of lightening her personal darkness. But
there is now a glimmer of scientific optimism about Alzheimer's. Researchers
have begun to understand the biological basis of the disease, in particular
the microscopic 'senile plaques' and 'neurofibrilary tangles' that are the
main sign of deterioration in sufferers' brains at post-mortem examinations.
The plaques result from the aggregation of 'beta-amyloid protein' molecules
around the decaying nerve terminals of brain cells. These molecules are
fragments of a much larger parent protein, known as amyloid precursor
protein (APP). Healthy cells produce small quantities of APP (though its
normal function is unknown) but in excess it may lead to toxic accumulations
of beta-amyloid.
Several different factors can trigger the Alzheimer's process. Researchers
at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London have recently discovered that
some rare inherited forms of the disease are due to mutations in the gene on
chromosome 21 which determines the structure of APP.
But inherited genetic defects probably account for only 10 to 15 per cent of
Alzheimer's cases. Many more are caused by environmental factors triggering
excessive APP production in injured nerve cells. One possible factor that
used to be the subject of much interest - but is now rather discredited - is
intake of aluminium. There is more evidence linking severe head injury to
the development of Alzheimer's. Viruses may also be involved. But most of
the risk factors are unknown. Clues may come from epidemiological studies
which show that Alzheimer's is extremely rare among old people in tropical
Africa but common in Afro-Americans who have grown up in the US.
Reports of the recent advances in Alzheimer's research - fuelled in the US
by enthusiastic press releases from young biotechnology companies working on
drugs for dementia - have aroused what many experts believe is an
unrealistic public expectation that there will soon be an effective
treatment for the disease.
'I can't see anything within 10 years that is really going to make an impact
on Alzheimer's,' says Geoffrey Dunbar, director of SmithKline Beecham's
central nervous system therapeutic unit. 'Yes, there's a lot of interest in
APP but we're a long way away (from an actual drug) even in that area.'
Michael Traub, director of clinical neuroscience at Merck's UK laboratory,
looks even further ahead. 'Someone might come up with a fundamental
understanding of Alzheimer's disease within the next 20 years but that
doesn't mean there'll be a drug in 20 years,' he says.
The types of treatment now undergoing clinical trials can do no more than
relieve temporarily some of the symptoms, particularly memory loss. The most
popular approach is to improve the function of neurotransmitters, the
chemical switches by which cells pass messages. The main target is
acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter essential for memory) in which the
Alzheimer's brain is severely deficient.
A class of medicines called aminoacridines achieve this by blocking the
enzyme that destroys acetylcholine in the brain. Two such drugs, velnacrine
(Mentane) from Hoechst of Germany and tacrine (Cognex) from Warner-Lambert
of the US, are awaiting approval from regulatory authorities on both sides
of the Atlantic.
Several more are at an earlier stage of development. But they are
controversial because they only work in a minority of patients - improving
memory slightly for a year or two - and they can cause side-effects such as
liver damage.
In addition, several existing drugs that help other disorders of the nervous
system are being tested for their effect on Alzheimer's. An example is
selegiline (Eldepryl) from Sandoz of Switzerland, which slows the
progression of Parkinson's disease by reducing the damage done to brain
cells by oxygen-free radicals.
However 'the holy grail of Alzheimer's research must be to prevent
beta-amyloid deposition,' says Jim Edwardson, director of the MRC
Neurochemical Pathology Unit in Newcastle upon Tyne. 'Many pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies are investing considerable money and skill,
trying to develop drugs that would prevent amyloid deposition.'
Several companies are concentrating on the enzymes involved in amyloid
metabolism, seeking a way to block the destructive formation of beta-amyloid
from APP. But they are a long way from clinical trials of candidate drugs.
A complementary avenue of research is to use natural chemicals known as
nerve growth factors to regenerate brain cells damaged by Alzheimer's. Then,
in the distant future, it might be possible to stop the amyloid deposition
process at an early stage and to repair any damage that had taken place.
If effective drugs are developed for Alzheimer's disease, it will be all the
more necessary to have accurate tests to diagnose the disease in the early
stages, so that treatment can begin before serious symptoms appear. At
present there are no simple diagnostic tests to distinguish even advanced
Alzheimer's from other forms of dementia with different causes (such as
multi-infarct dementia, the next most common form in elderly patients, in
which a series of small strokes interrupts the blood supply to tiny areas of
the brain).
Only a post-mortem examination of the brain - such as Alois Alzheimer
carried out for his original description of the disease in 1907 - will tell
definitely whether someone suffered from Alzheimer's. But two approaches to
a diagnostic test for living patients are giving promising results in
research.
Brain scans will soon be accurate enough to show the changes characteristic
of the disease. For example, the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and
Ageing, based at the Radcliffe Infirmary, is using X-ray computed tomography
(CT scanning) to reveal Alzheimer's-related shrinkage in part of the brain
that is important in memory, the medial temporal lobe. And Nicholas Fox, an
Alzheimer's Disease Society fellow at St Mary's Hospital Medical School,
plans to detect early degenerative changes in the brain through magnetic
resonance imaging.
Biochemical markers may be used to diagnose the disease and follow its
progress. One candidate is the level of APP in spinal fluid, lower in
Alzheimer's patients (possibly because it is being deposited as beta-amyloid
protein in the brain). Sibia, a Californian biotechnology company, is
developing an antibody-based test based on this observation.
Any company developing an effective drug for Alzheimer's would create a new
world market potentially worth several billion dollars a year. But it would
save at least as much as that by enabling old people to continue living at
home, instead of becoming dependent on the health care system or on family
members who assume what can become a crushing physical and emotional burden
by caring for them.
Above all, an Alzheimer's cure would end the agony for millions of people
who end their lives with minds like dark thunderstorms. A realistic
assessment suggests that people who are now young adults can look forward to
an old age free of Alzheimer's.
The series will continue next month with a look at treatments for the
menopause.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Furnishing a label of
quality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bernstein Group, a manufacturer of fitted kitchens, faced a problem common
to many companies. Its products met half a dozen British Standards governing
matters such as strength and hinges and it had qualified for the FIRA Gold
Award, a furniture industry quality label.
But while the FIRA award, introduced in the early 1980s by the Furniture
Industry Research Association, was well known in the industry, it was not
familiar to most of Bernstein's potential customers. Bernstein needed a more
readily recognizable quality label.
At the same time, FIRA and the British Standards Institution felt fitted
kitchens would benefit from a purpose-designed British Standard. This would
allow BSI to create a Kitemark which manufacturers could place on their
products.
At FIRA's prompting BSI put together a furniture industry committee which
wrote BS6222, covering domestic kitchen equipment. The first part, relating
to the strength of the 'carcass' was published last year and further parts,
covering surface finishes, adhesive bonding, humidity performance and
packaging are due to be finished shortly.
Bernstein, a Manchester-based company with sales of Pounds 100m and a
workforce of 950, did not have to change its kitchens because it already met
the existing, fragmented standards and it had also qualified for BS5750,
covering its quality systems. BSI now insists that companies seeking
Kitemark approval also have BS5750.
Bernstein became the first fitted-kitchen manufacturer to obtain the
Kitemark last August though it has since been joined by a second company,
Hygena. Maintaining the Kitemark involves two visits a year from FIRA, which
has been authorised to carry out regular tests by BSI and costs about Pounds
1,500 a year, says John Atherton, Bernstein's quality systems manager.
(Though initial testing of a kitchen range could cost between Pounds 5,000
and Pounds 10,000).
It is difficult to quantify the impact of the Kitemark on sales, he says but
he is happy to have a better-known quality label.
FIRA is aware of the problems national industry organisations face in
getting their quality labels better known. 'The problem for organisations
like FIRA is we can't afford a massive national promotion,' says Colin
Aitkenhead, chief executive.
It was partly for this reason that FIRA became a co-founder, 18 months ago,
of the European Association of Research Institutes for Furniture, linking 12
national organisations. The European furniture industry is awash with
national labels including the FIRA Gold Award, the mobelfakta label used in
the Nordic countries and the French Norme Francaise.
The European association hopes to achieve an agreement on mutual recognition
by the different national organisations and is working on creating a common
label for furniture. But these hopes depend on the creation of European
standards for furniture manufacture and these are still some way off.

British Standards Institution. The title conveys a feeling of solidity,
establishment, of being above the commercial fray. In fact the BSI has a
monopoly in only one area of activity - that of standard writing.
In the fields of testing and certifying products and companies, BSI faces
tough competition from a range of commercial rivals. Even so, the widespread
recognition in industry of BSI and its kitemark seal of product approval do
give it an advantage in the market place.
On the international scene, BSI's dominance of standard setting and the
range of its other activities also give it an undoubted advantage over its
continental counterparts such as DIN in Germany and AFNOR in France, says
Michael Sanderson, chief executive (pictured below).
Established in 1901 as the Engineering Standards Committee, the BSI has a
wider range of activities than any of its national or international rivals.
BSI also avoided the split between the electrical sectors and the rest of
industry which has marked other standards organisations. These arose because
the International Electrotechnical Committee was founded in 1907, 40 years
before the International Organisation for Standardisation, responsible for
all other industry areas, and has never merged. All the standards
organisations which were subsequently set up mirrored this split.
One of BSI's first actions was to bring order to the manufacture of
structural steel sections used to make tramway rails. Within a year of the
introduction of a kitemark for tramway rails in 1903 the number of steel
sections used had fallen from 75 to five and industry made an estimated
saving of Pounds 1m a year.
Despite Britain's early lead in standard setting, quality slumped after the
Second World War. It was a realisation of just how far standards had slipped
which prompted a revival of interest in the 1970s and the creation of
BS5750, a quality assurance standard, in 1979.
That standard has proved phenomenally successful for BSI and quality
assurance work, certifying, approving and testing companies to BS5750,
accounted for 45 per cent of BSI's total 1992 turnover of Pounds 74m and
nearly two-thirds of its Pounds 7.5m operating income. The growth in quality
assurance work is almost solely responsible for the rapid rise in staff
numbers to more than 2,000 in the past two years.
BSI's monopoly of the standards setting business gives it an undoubted
advantage in the market for its other services but also helped foster a
sleepy, bureaucratic atmosphere. A programme to improve efficiency was
launched in the late 1980s. A layer of committees has been removed and a
smaller main board created.
In the early 1980s BSI made an unsuccessful attempt to gain a monopoly over
certification, alongside its existing exclusive mandate for
standard-setting, but was rebuffed by the government. This has no doubt
played a part in its becoming more commercial.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Standard bearers -
Writing the norms for products and services is moving centre-stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creating standards for industry is the essential but humdrum task of an army
of committees. Now, however, a rumbling controversy about one particular UK
standard, BS 5750, regulating quality assurance systems, has focused
attention on the standards and the organisations which write and police
them.
Small firms have complained that BS5750 is unduly bureaucratic and is being
foisted on them by their large customers. Others say the standard has been
widely misunderstood as guaranteeing product or service quality, whereas it
really only guarantees consistency in the way systems are operated.
At the same time, the establishment of the single European market and the
prospect of the enlargement of the European Community have increased
pressure on the committee draughtsmen to produce a pan-European library of
standards so that products and services can cross borders more easily.
This spotlight on the traditionally low-key world of standard-writing has
revealed the intensely commercial nature of the standards industry.
Creating, monitoring and testing standards can be big business for the
organisations involved and can produce lucrative spin-offs for the
consultants who help companies meet the criteria set.
In a broader context, nations can gain a crucial competitive advantage by
ensuring that their standards are the ones which determine international
norms. Britain, France and Germany have each been responsible for drawing up
more than 20 per cent of international standards.
The Japanese, for all their well-earned reputation for manufacturing
quality, have contributed only about 2 per cent but are showing an
increasing interest.
US standards organisations, meanwhile, are fragmented and lack a coherent
voice in international standard-setting.
Despite the importance of standards to industry, the process by which
standards are created and the organisations involved in the task are a
mystery to most outsiders.
The picture is made no clearer by the range of overlapping national,
European and international bodies involved and the pea-soup of acronyms used
to label the organisations and the standards they produce.
In Britain, for example, the British Standards Institution, co-ordinates -
but does not control - the writing of new standards. At the European level,
most standards are set by CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation,
but electrical products and telecommunications have their own organisations.
International standards, in turn, are set by the Geneva-based International
Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).
Once again, however, electrical standards are created by a different
organisation. The result is that the same standard can appear in many
different guises. BS5750, the British quality assurance standard, pops up in
continental Europe as EN29000 and on the international stage as ISO9000.
BSI is unique among world standards organisations in having responsibility
for overseeing the writing of standards as well as the capacity to test
products to see they meet the standard and to certify companies. Its
counterparts in Germany, DIN, and France, AFNOR, restrict themselves to
standards writing.
The breadth of BSI's activities, and its status as an 'institution'
incorporated by Royal Charter, provide the organisation with a considerable
marketing advantage. In fact, testing and certification are intensely
competitive and there are no fewer than 26 organisations which have been
accredited to certify products and companies.
Some are small, newly created consultancies, while others are large,
long-established companies such as SGS Yarsley, Lloyd's Register Quality
Assurance and Bureau Veritas.
'BSI does nothing to reduce the impression (that it has a special status)
but we compete by being more efficient, offering a better service and on
price,' says Ian Williams, UK chief executive of SGS Yarsley. 'We aim to
give our client more than just a certificate on his wall.'
Just who can issue certificates is also a subject of some complexity. In
theory anyone can set up in business to check that companies meet a
particular standard. In practice the certification companies must themselves
be accredited. In the UK this is controlled by the National Accreditation
Council for Certification Bodies but accreditation is catching on around the
world.
The council does not give blanket approval to a certification organisation
but accredits them by industry. BSI is accredited for 900 of the 1,000 or so
standard industrial classifications. SGS Yarsley has made a speciality of
the health care and software sectors.
Despite the move to creating more European standards, certification and
testing are still carried out on a national basis and seals of approval and
certificates are not always acceptable to customers in other countries.
It was to overcome this problem that the European Organisation for Testing
and Certification was set up, after a two-year trial, last January. The aim
is to persuade testing laboratories and certification bodies to recognise
each other's work and agreement has already been reached in the information
technology and electrical sectors.
The UK already has some 11,000 standards covering everything from the
dimensions of twist drills, through the lower explosion limits of coating
powders and methods of testing cereals, to the fungal resistance of wood
panels. In addition, there are about 2,500 European standards, though many
overlap.
Despite these impressive numbers there is no slackening of demand both for
new standards and the updating of old ones. 'There is always more demand
than we can meet, and the single market and new technologies mean it will go
on increasing,' says Michael Sanderson, BSI chief executive. Requests for
standards come from government departments - the Treasury has put in a
request for a credit management standard - from individual companies and
from trade associations.
When a request comes in, BSI's standards-making division puts together a
drafting committee made up, where appropriate, of manufacturers, purchasers,
local authorities, government departments, trade associations and consumers.
Representatives give their time free and do not claim expenses.
No fewer than 35 organisations sat on the committee which last year drew up
BS7750, specifying environmental management systems. 'It can be a thankless
task, trying to bring together mutually antagonistic forces,' comments
Sanderson, 'But we have been doing it for 90 years and we have got quite
good at it.'
Once a draft has been agreed, it is made available for public comment for a
three-month period. It is often difficult to achieve agreement at a national
level, but a further complication is added if, as frequently happens, the
standard has international implications. BSI will then send a representative
to CEN or ISO to steer the standard through the European or the
international discussions.
From gleam in the eye to published document takes, on average, two years in
the UK, four years in Europe and more than six years at international level,
says Sanderson. He claims that Britain has a better record than many other
countries for piloting European and international standards through the
committee maze on time and close to the original specification.
Once a standard has been written, companies may buy a copy and then apply
its criteria to their products or services or their entire operation. If
they can meet the standard's specifications, they may then attach the
appropriate seal, often in the UK the BSI's Kitemark.
Regular testing and inspections continue for as long as the company
continues to comply with the standard. In theory, companies could falsely
claim compliance but competitors will be quick to point this out. Customers
also provide an important control mechanism and local authority trading
standards officers keep a close watch.
Despite their importance to industry, standards have been very much a
back-room activity, largely because each one is specific to a particular
industry sector.
But, as more and more 'horizontal' standards are created, covering areas
such as quality assurance and environmental management and applicable to
companies across a broad swathe of industry, they will move to centre stage.

International glossary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ISO, the International Organisation for Standardisation. Set up in 1947, the
ISO is a federation of 96 member countries which appoint committees to
establish international standards. More than 8,600 international standards
have been created.
Responsibility for heading each standards committee is allocated to a
country with experience in that area, with the result that seven members
carry out 90 per cent of the work. Germany leads with 24 per cent of
standards work, Britain with 23 per cent and France with 22 per cent.
If the ISO creates a standard this takes precedence over national or
European standards. The only area where the ISO is not active is in the
electrical industry. Electrical standards are the responsibility of the
International Electrotechnical Commission, set up in 1907. International
standards carry the ISO prefix.
CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation. CEN groups the national
standards bodies of the 12 European Community member countries and the six
members of the European Free Trade Association. A further eight countries,
mainly from eastern Europe have affiliate status.
CEN was established in 1961 but had little to do for its first 24 years
because standards setting was dominated by the national organisations or
ISO/IEC. But in 1985 the European Community instituted a new approach to
standard setting because it needed standards to back up the directives it
was starting to produce for its single market initiative.
CEN attempts to avoid duplicating the work of other organisations, so where
possible its standards are based on national or international ones. They
carry the EN (Euro-norms) prefix. CEN has just published a book describing
its work and the system of European standards. CEN Standards for Access to
the European Market costs Ecu38 (Pounds 31) plus postage from CEN, Rue de
Stassart 36, B-1050 Brussels. Tel: +322 519 6811.
In common with ISO, CEN has no responsibility for the electrical industry.
This is handled by CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical
Standardisation, while telecommunications standards are dealt with by ETSI,
the European Telecommunications Standards Institute.
The European Organisation for Testing and Certification (EOTC) was set up
last January following a two-year pilot. Its aim is to establish the mutual
recognition by certification and testing organisations in Europe of each
others' work so that companies do not need to obtain certification in each
country.
The CE Mark. Is probably best known to the general public because it appears
on the packaging for toys but is applicable to a wide range of products
including construction products and gas appliances. Partly because of its
use on toys it has come to be seen as a general consumer guarantee of
quality or safety. In fact it is intended to show that a product meets the
minimum specification required by the underlying EC directive. In some cases
this is underpinned by independent certification, in others it hinges only
on a manufacturer's declaration.
The BSI Kitemark is perhaps the most widely known UK seal of approval and is
awarded, or licensed, by BSI to companies which produce goods to accepted
national or international standards. Compared with the nearly 12,000 British
Standards in existence there are fewer than 1,800 Kitemarks and lesser known
Safety Marks. This is because Kitemarks apply to products and not services
or procedures, while some of the older product standards would need to be
revised to make them suitable for kitemarking.
The launch of the CE mark is a possible threat to the Kitemark and has
prompted BSI to consider how to promote its 'label'.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Worry over postbags and pills -
Tory MP's advice for ministers on public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS should listen to their backbenchers' views on public spending,
then shut themselves up in an extended cabinet meeting and announce their
decisions in 'one fell statement', according to Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former
minister and member of the executive of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs.
With a government majority in the Commons of fewer than 20, ministers have
no choice but to listen.
Sir Rhodes' own views are clearly and vigorously stated. Any move that would
hit pensioners - even though above the level of income support - would be
'immoral and politically disastrous', he said yesterday.
Tory MPs have been shaken by the impact of the spate of reports on possible
public spending measures. Many are expecting postbags bulging with letters
from pensioners worried about the prospect of having to pay for
prescriptions.
'Anything to do with prescriptions and health would be almost impossible to
sell,' Mr Ian Bruce, an officer of the Tory backbench social security
committee, said yesterday. The small majority meant that any changes had to
be 'gradualist'.
Not all Tories, however, are against the idea of making wealthy pensioners
and parents pay for prescriptions. One described the present range of
exemptions as 'lunatic' while others have expressed support for setting a
limit to the exemptions, provided it was set in the right place.
For the Tories, that means drawing the line so that people on moderately low
incomes should not be penalised. It highlights the problem at the heart of
the idea of directing benefits only to those who need them most - the lack
of a sophisticated method of targetting. Many Tory MPs are deeply worried
this means that changes will badly affect pensioners who are on relatively
modest incomes and have made some provision for their retirement - the very
people who should be among the government's core support and whom the
government should wish to protect.
Other spending options are unpopular for practical and principled reasons.
Mr David Congdon, a Tory member of the cross-party health committee,
expressed the view of several Tories in arguing that the bureaucracy needed
to introduce 'hotel' charges for the better-off while they are in hospital,
together with the likely scale of exemptions from the charges, made it a
course 'not worth pursuing'.
There was, however, less antipathy towards making employers rather than the
state responsible for some work-related benefits.
Mr David Willetts, a Tory member of the social security committee, said
there was a case for making employers responsible for industrial injury
benefits. Other MPs believe that maternity pay and sick pay could be
transferred, especially as the Budget did not impose any new burdens on
business.
As for child benefit, its protection in the manifesto seems secure. 'The
furthest you could possibly go on child benefit is taxing it,' one
backbencher said. Whether it will continue to enjoy cast-iron support after
the next election is more in doubt: another MP talked of being 'trapped' by
the manifesto promises on benefits.
For the longer term, MPs argue, the debate should be about the sort of
welfare state the country wants to see. This should include discussion of
how people can take more responsibility for providing for themselves, even
though such options tend to involve short-term costs for savings that may
not materialise for some years.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith might offer deal on block
vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday took his campaign for
one-member-one-vote and an end to the union block vote in the election of
the party's parliamentary candidates to the MSF general technical union.
There are signs that Mr Smith will have to compromise with the unions to
avoid a split over the issue at this autumn's party conference.
He told delegates to the MSF's conference in Blackpool he wanted to offer
trade unionists who pay the political levy a special lower party membership
rate to encourage them to become 'full participating members' in Labour
constituency parties.
But Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union said last
night that although this was 'a first step in the right direction', it 'did
not address the problem of what to do about political levy payers in the
unions'.
He said they should be entitled to a direct say in the selection of Labour
candidates.
At present the larger unions including the TGWU transport workers' union and
the GMB want to retain a link through their political levy payers in
candidate selection.
Their view looks likely to prevail among the unions that will account for 70
per cent of the vote at party conference. The MSF will debate the issue
tomorrow.
In the past few weeks the Usdaw shopworkers' union conference voted narrowly
against the idea and the NCU communication workers' union also looks likely
to reject it.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Inner-city funds contest may reopen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the environment secretary, yesterday held out the
prospect of a further round of City Challenge, the government programme
which invites local authorities to bid for funds for inner city
regeneration.
Opening the Cities '93 conference in Birmingham, Mr Howard said a further
round would depend on the results of an assessment of the first two rounds
of City Challenge, in which 31 of the 57 urban priority areas each won
Pounds 75m a year over five years for regeneration.
No further money is available for City Challenge in this year's public
spending plans. But funds will be available in 1994-95 as three-year urban
programme projects come to an end.
Mr Howard said about half of the government's Pounds 4bn budget for urban
develop-ment was already allocated through competitive bid-ding.
He was looking at ways of increasing competition among local authorities for
his department's funds.
'If money is handed out as a matter of routine and accepted as a matter of
routine, it will be spent as a matter or routine,' he said. 'Competition
provides an escape from the dead hand of routine.'
Even areas which were unsuccessful in City Challenge find that the process
of bidding sparked the imagination and energy of local people and
businesses, he said.
'Far more is achieved than before, and lasting relationships are formed.'

FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith accuses Major of preparing to
'turn on the sick'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR LEADER Mr John Smith yesterday accused the prime minister of
preparing to 'turn on the sick' in the government's search for savings in
public expenditure.
Renewing his attack on the ideas of severely reducing the exemptions from
prescription charges and of 'hotel charges' for some people in hospital, Mr
Smith told the MSF technical union's conference that the prime minister was
prepared to go even further than his predecessor.
'Even Mrs Thatcher realised that the National Health Service occupied a
special place in British society,' he said. 'But not Mr Major; he now seems
set to turn on the sick to pay for his mistakes.'
Mr Smith added that Tories were suggesting that only a small number of
people would have to pay more. But the changes would affect 'ordinary
families up and down the country'.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Deal may defuse rebellion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS were last night confident of heading off a backbench revolt over
British Rail privatisation as they neared agreement with rebel Tory MPs over
protection for concessionary fare schemes.
A compromise plan that may require franchise operators to provide discount
fares for the elderly, families and young people, is likely to be announced
by Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, when the Commons resumes debate
on the Railways Bill today.
Mr MacGregor, whose conciliatory approach appeared to have calmed many of
the potential rebels' concerns, held a series of individual meetings with
MPs yesterday and will hold more today. He is trying to balance Tory rebels'
demands for discount fare schemes to be mandatory with his determination to
ensure maximum flexibility for franchise operators.
Sir Keith Speed, Tory MP for Ashford - who is leading the revolt - said
after his meeting with Mr MacGregor there had been a 'meeting of minds'. But
if a deal was not reached, he reckoned at least 12 MPs could rebel - enough
to wipe out the government's majority.
Protection for discount fares for the disabled is already in the Railways
Bill. Ministers argue other discount schemes make commercial sense but the
rebels want assurances written into the bill.
Under pressure from MPs from London and the south-east Mr Roger Freeman,
transport minister, told the Commons last night 'we mean to control fare
increases where it is appropriate'. He promised that detailed proposals
would be outlined later today when MPs resume debate on the bill.
Sir John Stanley (C Tonbridge and Malling), won support from other prominent
Tory backbenchers when he complained about the lack of any provision in the
bill to moderate fare increases.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister minimises Jubilee Line
snag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday played down reports that negotiations to secure
financing for the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line Underground extension were on
the point of collapse, David Owen writes.
It said it was 'hopeful' the talks would soon be successfully concluded.
Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, said there had been 'no change
whatever' in the government's position.
Ministers remained committed to putting money into the project once a Pounds
400m private-sector contribution had been approved.
'We are making progress,' he said. 'That progress will continue. When the
process is complete . . . we will begin the line.'
Negotiations between bank lenders to Canary Wharf and the government on the
private-sector contribution to the line have been going on for about a year,
following the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian company which built
the east London property development.
Mr Norris admitted yesterday that the complexity of reaching an agreement
with O&amp;Y's creditors had been underestimated.
Mr Tony Banks, a Labour frontbench transport spokesman, urged ministers to
make clear they were not being pressed by the Treasury to scrap the
extension.

The Department of Transport yesterday started discussions with the private

early July.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: More franchises for BR sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday signalled its determination to proceed with the
privatisation of British Rail by setting out its detailed plans for
transferring the whole of the passenger network to the private sector.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced that BR's passenger
services would be divided into 25 geographically based business units which
would ultimately be taken over by private sector franchisees.
Mr MacGregor predicted that the first franchises would be handed over to the
private sector in the second half of next year and that a 'substantial
proportion' of passenger services would be in private hands within the
lifetime of the current parliament.
However, he said it was impossible to predict how long the process would
take to complete.
Mr MacGregor said he placed particular importance on the fact that
franchising would be an 'evolutionary' process. 'There won't be sudden
dramatic difficulties in terms of big closures or anything like that,' he
said.
'As people see their services improving, as people start to see the
individual franchises working, they will start to see the whole point of
it.'
The 25 franchise areas - which include seven announced in February - will be
operated by BR as 'shadow' franchises until they pass to the private sector.
The aim is that they build up a trading record that will be known when the
bidding begins.
Mr MacGregor said the precise boundaries of the franchise areas could change
if that helped the pro-cess.
The Department of Transport has also yet to settle on a final scheme for
franchising Regional Railways' sprawling central division, the Regional
Railways long-distance services and InterCity's cross-country operations.
Mr MacGregor confirmed that overseas railways such as SNCF, the French
national railway, would not be precluded from bidding, but said the
franchising director would be looking for bidders with a commercial
orientation.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Insurers told to cut storm cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS could come under pressure to reduce cover for storm damage to
homes, a conference on global warming and catastrophic weather losses was
told yesterday.
Mr Jeremy Hindle, a senior underwriter with Swiss Re, the world's second
largest reinsurance company, said that the excess (the amount a policyholder
pays of any claim) on household buildings policies 'must be raised to Pounds
250 immediately, with a move to Pounds 1,000 being the target.'
Swiss Re is one of a number of reinsurers providing cover to UK insurers.
Insurers have introduced higher excesses for subsidence but for most claims
householders pay a compulsory excess of about Pounds 50. Some insurers offer
lower premiums for customers who choose to take a higher excess.
Household insurance premiums have risen in recent years, partly reflecting
steep rises in rates charged by reinsurers to insurance companies.
Mr Hindle told the conference, organised by environmental pressure group
Greenpeace, that changes in terms and conditions of buildings policies were
needed to reduce exposure to storm damage.
Reinsurers have put the UK in the list of five international regions most
exposed to catastrophic weather or earthquake risk, after two of the
costliest storms on record in the past six years.
But he said reinsurers could also press for further changes. Insurers could
restrict coverage to a percentage of the sum insured in some areas or follow
the example of insurers in the Virgin Islands - badly hit by hurricane Hugo
in 1989 - where excesses are a percentage of the property's value.
AA Insurance, one of the UK's biggest brokers, criticised the move to raise
excesses. Mr Noel Privett, AA head of information, said such it would
represent 'a huge overreaction. A more creative solution is called for'.

FT  25 MAY 93 / ITC set to clear Tyne Tees TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission will today give Yorkshire-Tyne Tees
Television a clean bill of health on how the merged ITV region is being run.
The commission launched a formal investigation after Ms Ann Clwyd, the
shadow heritage secretary, complained that Tyne Tees was in effect being run
by Yorkshire from Leeds and was being destroyed 'as an autonomous and
independent broadcaster'.
The commission, which has sought to preserve the autonomy of Tyne Tees with
its own separate regional licence, is happy with both the business and
programme commissioning structures now in place.
But it warns that it will continue to monitor the performance and to ensure
that there are no moves towards unacceptable integration at Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant
stake.
Ms Clwyd had argued that the destruction of Tyne Tees as an autonomous
broadcaster 'demands an urgent and decisive response from the ITC'.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Trade deficit narrows: Devaluation of sterling sharply
boosts exports to non-EC countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S visible trade deficit with countries outside the European
Community narrowed again last month, amid fresh signs that the devaluation
of sterling has given a sharp boost to British ex-ports.
In April the value of imports from countries outside the EC exceeded the
value of exports by Pounds 831m. However, the overall deficit was Pounds 98m
less than in March.
The better news on the trade balance was backed up by a sharp growth in
export volumes in the past three months. The Central Statistical Office
reported yesterday that total UK export volumes - excluding oil and erratic
items such as ships and precious stones - had grown by 6 1/2 per cent
compared with the previous 3 months. By contrast, imports rose by only 2 per
cent over the same period.
There has been an increase in exports to North America in the past month,
and an improvement in the terms of trade with non-EC European countries. For
the first time since May 1992, the UK registered a trade surplus with North
America in April. UK traders registered a seasonally adjusted surplus of
Pounds 85m compared with a deficit of Pounds 43m in March.
Yesterday's figures were seen as a further indication that the devaluation
of sterling is helping to promote economic recovery through the exports
boost. Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at SG Warburg, said the figures
suggested that the UK's gross domestic product would show an increase in the
second quarter of this year. 'The UK is winning market share even though
economies in the rest of Europe are slowing down,' he said.
Since the beginning of the year, the CSO has not provided data for UK trade
with European Community countries because a new system of measuring intra-EC
trade is being introduced.
When the March trade figures were released a month ago, the unit value index
 -which is a method of measuring the cost of goods that are traded - showed
a sharp rise between February and March.
However, the figures show that export prices have returned to their levels
at the start of the year, implying that exporters have not used the sterling
devaluation as an opportunity to mark up prices.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Nadir trustees investigate Turkish bank over loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRUSTEES in bankruptcy to Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, are
investigating a Turkish bank which made a loan last year secured against a
house bought for Mr Nadir's girlfriend.
The new probe follows the discovery of documents during a second raid by the
trustees on the home of the former head of Polly Peck International that
took place a few days after Mr Nadir's flight to northern Cyprus earlier
this month.
Among the information retrieved by the trustees was correspondence with
Turkiye Turizm Yatirim ve dis Ticaret Bankasi - the Turkish Tourism Trade
and Investment Bank which was founded in 1988 and owned by the Lapis Group,
an industrial group engaged in tourism.
The bank made a loan last summer to a company based in London. The loan was
secured against a property to which Mr Nadir's trustees have laid claim.
Documents at the land registry in London show that a charge was made against
22 Glebe Place in Chelsea, London, on July 13 last year by the Turkish
tourism bank.
They show that since March 1990 the owner of the house has been Ms Lesley
Ellwood, a girlfriend of Mr Nadir who had two children by him. She was not
available for comment yesterday.
Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, who is Mr Nadir's trustee in
bankruptcy, has taken legal action against Ms Ellwood in a dispute over a
transfer of about Pounds 900,000 to purchase the house.
The land register shows that Mr Cooper issued a 'caution' over ownership
last September which led to a High Court order in November to prevent any
further transactions relating to the property.
The Turkish tourism bank confirmed yesterday that it had extended a loan to
a UK-based trading company in July 1992 to finance the export of UK goods to
Turkey.
It would not name the company or the amount involved, but officials said
they had a 'long relation' with the company.
One employee said he was not aware of 'any connection with Mr Nadir,
although in reality it is out of our limits to make that sort of
connection'.
In addition to the documents, the trustees they found two safes at Mr
Nadir's home in Eaton Square, London, which had been overlooked during a
previous raid which took place shortly before Mr Nadir fled. One safe was
empty and another has not yet been opened.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Unit trust sales hit a record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NET SALES of unit trusts in April reached their highest level since the
stock market crash of October 1987, the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds reported yesterday.
Gross sales in April were Pounds 1,592.9m while repurchases from investors
were Pounds 637.8m. The net sales figure was thus Pounds 955.1m. Funds under
management were pushed to a record of Pounds 71.77bn.
Interest rate falls since the UK left the exchange rate mechanism have
undoubtedly helped the industry, as returns on equity products now closely
match those available from building societies.
Figures published last week showed that building societies also had a good
month in April.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Cinema audiences increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CINEMA is making a strong comeback in the UK with audiences higher last
year than in any year since 1980, the latest Cultural Trends report shows.
More than 60 per cent of the population aged 7 and older goes to the cinema
and more than 30 per cent of the 15-24 age group does so once a month or
more. The estimated total audience last year was 101m.
Cinema box-office takings, at under Pounds 300m, account for little more
than a fifth of the Pounds 1.4bn total consumer expenditure on films. The
balance comes from expenditure such as video hire and subscriptions to
television film channels.
Radio is the other expanding media sector highlighted in the report compiled
from available statistics and published today by the Policy Studies
Institute, an independent research organisation.
Helped by the launch of Classic FM, radio attracted 41.6m listeners a week -
89 per cent of the population - during the last quarter of 1992. BBC Radio,
which had a record budget of Pounds 338.2m in 1991-92, is gradually losing
audience share to its commercial rivals, but still has more than 58 per cent
of the market.
Mr Jeremy Eckstein, editor of Cultural Trends, believes the picture in the
television market is one of remarkable stability. 'The whole thing is
operating within a fully saturated market,' he said. 'There have been
enormous changes in production, but so far as viewers are concerned there is
no change at all.'
Overall the impact of cable and satellite television was still very modest,
accounting for around 5 per cent of total viewing and 30 per cent in cable
and satellite homes. The recession is blamed for slowing cable and satellite
growth.

Board changes announced at the company probably helped the commission take a

Yorkshire region, and Mr John Calvert will remain managing director of Tyne
Tees Television, the wholly-owned subsidiary for the Tyne Tees area.
Earlier this year the ITC rejected a Labour complaint that Granada
Television was in breach of its broadcasting obligations. Pearson, owner of
the Financial Times, has a significant stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees
Television.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Nursery school class size increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIZE of classes at state-maintained nursery schools in England rose last
year, education department figures showed yesterday.
There were 25 pupils for every teacher last year compared with 24.2 in 1991
and 23 in 1983. If nursery assistants are taken into account, the ratio last
year was 11 children for every staff member, which was similar to 1991. The
figure in 1983 was 10.4.
The total take-up of education by children below compulsory school age
increased by one percentage point to 49 per cent. If the 52,000 pupils aged
less than five who went to independent schools are included, the total
participation rate in education before it becomes compulsory is 53 per cent.
The number of maintained nursery schools in England fell from 566 in 1991 to
560 last year. In 1983 there were 575, but the number of primary schools
with nursery classes was 4,874 last year compared with 4,815 in 1991 and
3,764 in 1983.
The department revealed wide regional variations in nursery provision. For
example, 19 local education authorities have no nursery schools.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Education voucher scheme proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT may introduce a common credit for the education and training
of 16 to 19-year-olds, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary,
hinted yesterday.
She told senior managers the move would be a 'step we might consider in
opening up a real market in training and education.' The government is
understood to be considering publishing a white paper on the issue.
The option of a common system of funding for academic, vocational and job
specific training, first proposed by the Confederation of British Industry,
was endorsed in a ministerial review of the education and training of 16 to
19-year-olds conducted by the education and employment departments. The CBI
has developed its idea into what it calls Careership, under which all
16-year-olds would receive a voucher or financial credit which they could
exchange for training or education. The CBI says this would enable people to
shop around for the best opportunities, and open up competition among
providers.
Three years ago, the government set up pilots of a more limited scheme -
involving young people undertaking vocational training - which is due to be
extended nationally in 1996. Take-up in pilot areas has been uneven. Mrs
Shephard said yesterday: 'What the CBI is saying is that we should look to
market mechanisms to express choices and achieve value for money.'
The size of classes at state-maintained nursery schools in England rose last

FT  25 MAY 93 / Curriculum for technology rapped: National Institute attacks
'demotivating' syllabus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL curriculum for technology in England and Wales has led to
'great difficulties in teaching' and leaves less academic children
'disadvantaged and demotivated', the National Institute for Economic and
Social Research says.
It adds that the quality of practical learning opportunities is below that
in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
The institute article, written by Helvia Bierhoff and Sigmund Prais,
criticises technology teaching in the last two years of compulsory schooling
for being too intellectualised, and for requiring pupils to work in a broad
range of materials. They say national curriculum requirements 'have led to
inadequate specialisation, inadequate progression, and to poor quality of
finished work'.
They also criticise the attitude adopted in English and Welsh schools,
saying: 'Unless practical subjects are intellectualised and linked to
academic subjects and bulky paperwork activities, they continue to be
regarded as not having a wholly legitimate place in the school curriculum.'
New proposals for the national curriculum published late last year would
encourage higher-quality work by allowing greater specialisation and more
practical work, the report says. But it suggests schools are not equipped
with the specialised workshops teachers need to take advantage of the
proposals.
The report criticises attainment targets set by the national curriculum,
including a requirement for pupils to 'identify needs and opportunities' for
technology in different contexts.
The aim is to free pupils from the 'straitjacket' of doing what the teacher
told them, but the institute found some national curriculum targets to be
irrelevant to pupils' everyday lives.
The institute's authors prefer the Continental approach of concentrating on
practical subjects.
They found that Continental schools allowed a third (or more) of their
pupils between the ages of 14 and 16 to do systematic courses in specialised
disciplines such as woodwork, metalwork and textiles. Continental employers
believed that pupils taught this way were more motivated, had better work
habits, and learned how to respond responsibly to instructions in applied
contexts.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Challenge on power prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO main electricity generators for England and Wales were warned by the
industry regulator yesterday that they might face a monopolies referral if
they failed to explain adequately why their prices have risen since March.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of the Office of Electricity
Regulation (Offer), also said he was investigating complaints about the
attitude of National Power, the main generator, to potential buyers of plant
it plans to close.
The two issues are among several potential areas of conflict between the
regulator and the generators. Prof Littlechild, who is also investigating
the generators' costs and margins, has said he will decide on a referral to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission by 1995.
'Perhaps the decision will have to be taken earlier,' he said yesterday.
A growing number of analysts believe a referral is inevitable, although some
believe the regulator would be unwilling to let the future of the industry
be decided by authorities outside his control. Prof Littlechild, publishing
his annual report yesterday, said improvements in the industry since
privatisation included a sharp reduction in domestic disconnections - down
62 per cent 1991 and 1992 - and the growth of electricity supply
competition.
The main area of difficulty was the market power of National Power and
PowerGen, the two main generators, he said, even though competition was
increasing through the expansion of independent power plants.
He said he had received little response from the generators following his
request three weeks ago for an explanation of price rises in the electricity
wholesale pool this month and in April. 'I am treating this as a serious
matter,' he said. 'It is extremely important that pool works efficiently.'
Although he has also asked National Grid for an explanation of why
pool-associated prices have risen, he said that company's role was not a
cause for concern.
Prof Littlechild also said he believed there was scope for development in
the way the pool operated. Because prices were determined only by bids from
the generators of electricity it was only 'half a market'. He said
demand-side bidding, under which large users could be paid to reduce demand
at short notice, could lead to more stability and efficiency. Prof
Littlechild said he hoped to complete a review of price controls of the
regional electricity companies' supply businesses by the end of June.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Inflation 'may go beyond Treasury range by 1994'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES WILL be rising smartly by the end of the year as inflation pushes
through the upper limit of the government's target range, according to the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research.
In its latest quarterly review of the UK economy, the institute predicts
that underlying inflation - the retail prices index excluding mortgage
interest payments - will be just over the top of the government's target
range of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent.
A 10 per cent rise in import prices over the year will be the driving force
behind inflation, it adds.
The institute's expectations for growth are unchanged since the last
forecast in February. It expects the economy to grow by 2 per cent this year
and by 2.8 per cent next year.
It suggests that the trade deficit is widening and 'may well be over 3 per
cent of GDP for the year as a whole'.
Growth next year will be fuelled by strong investment and consumption as
recent interest rate cuts feed through. This will more than offset the
effects of tax increases announced in the March Budget, says the institute.
The forecast for unemployment has been revised down slightly for the rest of
the year. In an article, Mr Andrew Britton, director of the institute, says
the best way to achieve full employment would be to expand the current
system of special employment measures such as Employment Training and
Workstart in the short term, while improving productivity and
competitiveness in the long term by providing better education and training
for the population as a whole.
The new jobs created by improved competitiveness would be filled by the
newly-trained workforce, leaving vacancies that the unemployed would fill,
says Mr Britton. 'Thus the unemployed would find 'real' jobs indirectly as a
result of a general economic expansion. Eventually the special employment
schemes could be run down.'

FT  25 MAY 93 / Rowland assaults biography with fax barrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TINY ROWLAND, joint chief executive of Lonrho, and his wife Josie last
night issued statements criticising an unauthorised biography, A Rebel
Tycoon. The book is by Mr Tom Bower, whose last book was The Outsider, an
acclaimed account of the life of Robert Maxwell.
Mr Rowland dealt yesterday with his unsolicited biography in just three
sentences. 'I very much regret that a boring and unrecognisable account of
my life should have been published today,' he said in a faxed statement to
the media. 'None of the interesting bits are in. I know many people, but,
thank God, not the author.'
Mr Bower laughed last night when told of the Lonrho chief's statement and
added: 'It's his way of trying to minimise something that he would have
preferred hadn't happened.' Mr Rowland's fax was followed by a more
threatening one from Mrs Josie Rowland. 'Apart from the fact that I love my
husband every other reference to me is untrue and denigratory,' it said. She
was demanding an apology from Mr Bower and publishers Heinemann within 48
hours or she would issue writs. Mr Rowland's statement did not threaten
legal action.
To avoid the possibility of an injunction to prevent publication the book
was printed in Finland and copies were brought into the UK and distributed
only last Thursday.
The book makes serious allegations about how Lonrho is run and behaves in
Africa.
In Sunday's Observer, Mr Rowland published an account of his life and also
swiped at Mr Bower.
'My life has been my own, and I feel that it's copyright,' he wrote. 'A man
I have never met or spoken to, to my knowledge, is going to exhibit me for
commercial gain on his part, smearing and distorting everything that belongs
to me and giving me a character of his own choosing.'
Mr Bower said last night there was nothing new in the 'rather fanciful'
Observer account, 'except I didn't know he was so high up in the Hitler
youth.' Mr Rowland wrote in the Observer that he had reached the rank of
troop leader in charge of 150 boys.

THE NUMBER of people claiming income support rose to more than 5m last year.
Department of Social Security figures published yesterday showed an increase

Numbers of claimants have risen every year since 1989, with unemployed
people and single parents accounting for most of the increase during the
1990s. There were 1.7m unemployed claimants last May, and nearly 1m single
parents.

The change was agreed in a last-minute amendment to the Employment Bill

FT  25 MAY 93 / 'Failures' admitted by ECGD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPORT Credits Guarantee Department, the government-owned export credit
agency, yesterday admitted that it had failed to observe Treasury rules,
failed to report fraud and failed to keep records in a transaction in which
it lost Pounds 41.4m.
The loss was disclosed in the ECGD's most recent accounts, which reveal the
department's involvement with a Mexican oil rig operator which left it the
owner of two rigs.
Details of the ECGD's handling of the affair emerged yesterday when Mr Brian
Willott, head of the department since January 1992, gave evidence to the
Commons public accounts committee.
He said the affair was a 'built-in disaster'. Admitting to the 'very large
number of serious management failures' listed by Mr Robert Sheldon,
committee chairman, Mr Willott insisted that the ECGD had taken steps to
tighten its claims and underwriting procedures: 'The lessons of this case
are branded rather deep in the collective conscience of the ECGD.'
The affair dated back to 1980, when the ECGD insured loans totalling Dollars
53.5m for the Mexican company Perforaciones Maritimas del Golfo (Permago) to
buy two oil rigs built by the Marathon yards in Scotland.
In 1982, almost immediately after delivery, drilling contracts for the rigs
were cancelled and the company defaulted on loan repay-ments.
Over the next 10 years, the ECGD opted to refinance the company rather than
press for sale of the rigs; discovered two frauds linked with Permago, which
it did not report to the government's Fraud Investigation Branch; failed to
keep records of meetings about the case; and provided overdraft facilities
in contravention of Treasury rules.
It made the refinancing decision without seeking advice on prospective oil
price movements - critical to the likely profitability of the rigs.
It failed to have departmental lawyers present in negotiations with Permago.
The case was not referred above the ECGD's claims department until late
stages. Mr Willott did not even pay 'serious attention' to the case until
July 1992, six months after assuming office, he told the committee.
In February this year the ECGD repossessed the rigs, but not before a lack
of main-tenance resulted in repair costs rising from Dollars 500,000 to
Dollars 5m.
It is now trying to sell the rigs, and hopes to recoup between Pounds 12m
and Pounds 20m - leaving taxpayers to carry a net loss of Pounds 20m to
Pounds 30m.
Mr Willott admitted that for most of the period concerned, the ECGD had
failed to consult with other government departments, since 'it tended to
regard itself as having the sole expertise in this area. We are now less
reluctant to consult others'.
He said no one in the department had been punished, but said all concerned
had retired.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Union threatens Post Office sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNION of Communication Workers, the postal workers union, yesterday
voted at its annual conference to consider industrial action if the
government moves to privatise the Post Office.
The 700 delegates at the conference voted unanimously to take action if
necessary. Mr Alan Johnson, general-secretary designate, said industrial
action might be needed 'to protect pensions, jobs and services'.
The government has yet to announce whether it will sell the Post Office as
one unit, or split it into its constituent parts - Royal Mail, Post Office
Counters and Parcelforce. Whichever option is chosen, the government has
decided to delay privatisation until the 1994-95 parliamentary session at
the earliest.
Last week Mr John Major, the prime minister, ruled out making compulsory the
payment of state benefits direct into bank accounts, in an effort to
reassure Tory backbenchers over the future of rural post offices.
The union, with 160,000 members in the Post Office, is mounting an
anti-privatisation campaign. It yesterday said a survey of Conservative MPs
showed more than 50 were opposed to Post Office privatisation.
The union said the survey 'clearly reflects the concern that many
Conservatives have over the threat to services, particularly in rural areas,
if the Post Office was run purely for profit'.
The union said most of the MPs who opposed privatisation also said there
should be a relaxation of Treasury restrictions to enable the Post Office to
operate more commercially within the public sector.
The union wants to see post offices allowed to offer more services over the
counter, such as selling theatre, travel and national lottery tickets.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Bill from Ulster bombs put at Pounds 22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR powerful car bombs detonated in Northern Ireland since last
Thursday will cost the taxpayer an estimated Pounds 22m in compensation,
estimates from the Northern Ireland Office indicated yesterday.
The first bomb last Thursday, which contained 1,000lbs of home-made
explosive, exploded near the headquarters of the Ulster Unionist party in
Belfast, causing damage estimated at Pounds 6.5m.
A 1,000lb bomb exploded in the centre of Portadown in County Armagh on
Saturday morning, causing Pounds 8m damage. On Sunday, a 300lb bomb caused
Pounds 2.5m damage to the Drumkeen hotel in Belfast, and was followed in the
evening by another 1,000lb bomb in the town of Magherafelt in south
Londonderry, which devastated its commercial centre and caused Pounds 5m
damage.
Speaking in Londonderry yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland
Secretary, said: 'We have been through a hard period of four days. There may
be more to come; I cannot guarantee that there will not. What I can
guarantee is that the IRA are not going to succeed.'
The new bombing campaign has been met with calls from unionist leaders for a
return of internment of IRA suspects. Mr John Taylor, an Ulster Unionist MP,
said the security situation in the province was 'deteriorating' and called
on Sir Patrick to introduce internment and identity cards.
Mr Sammy Wilson, an official of the Democratic Unionist party warned at the
weekend that 'many sincere young men' from the Protestant community will
take the law into their own hands if the security forces do not crack down
on IRA suspects.
Sir Patrick was conferring with police and Army chiefs in the province
yesterday, but it is unlikely that he will be rushed into action. When
internment was first used in the 1970s it provoked a violent backlash from
the nationalist community, and was generally considered a political blunder.
Today Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are
meeting in Dublin in the latest of Anglo-Irish conference meetings.
The main item on the agenda will be how to get the province's political
parties back around the negotiating table to discuss a new political
framework for Northern Ireland.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Belfast airport to be sold next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday confirmed that it would sell Northern Ireland's
largest airport, Belfast's Aldergrove.
A six-week consultation period will be followed by legislation in autumn.
The government's advisers hope the sale will take place in the summer of
1994 and will fetch between Pounds 25m and Pounds 40m.
The sale will probably be to a single buyer or a consortium rather than by
flotation, which would cost too much in relation to the likely proceeds.
Aldergrove, also called Belfast International, is owned by Northern Ireland
Airports and handled about 2.17m passengers last year, making it the UK's
seventh largest airport. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.14m on
turnover of Pounds 21m and last month announced the start of scheduled
services to New York.
Possible bidders include Canadian transport group Bombardier, which owns
both Short Brothers, the Ulster aircraft manufacturer, and Belfast City
airport.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, yesterday announced
completion of plans to dispose of Farnborough airfield.
They include the development of a new site for the government's Defence
Research Agency, a new aviation museum and a hotel overlooking the
aerodrome.
The Farnborough air show would continue, he said.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Barclays freezes pay for 3,000 managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK has imposed a pay freeze on a third of its 9,000 managers
after a breakdown of negotiations with its staff union.
It is also refusing to go to the independent Advisory Conciliation and
Arbitration Service to resolve the conflict on the grounds it cannot improve
its offer.
Mr Paul Snowball, general secretary of the Barclays Group Staff Union, said
yesterday he was still hopeful that an agreement could be reached over
managerial salaries. Much will depend on how quickly the bank can improve
its financial performance.
According to calculations by the staff union, Barclay's managers will
receive salary increases ranging from zero to 1.2 per cent this year, with
as many as 3,000 receiving no rise.
Under the pay offer, which came into force yesterday, bonuses are being held
at last year's levels and no changes are being made to the salary grid which
decides the size of merit awards.
In a ballot, 92 per cent of management rejected the bank's offer. But the
bank told the staff union it could not improve its proposal for managers and
was imposing the new deal from this month.
As many as 470 managers are being made redundant this year. Last year the
bank made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m.
The executive of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation - the tax officers'
union - is writing to its 53,000 members this week to tell them it will
ignore the union's conference rejection last week of their 1.5 per cent pay
rise. The members voted in a ballot to accept the pay offer by 63.6 per cent
for and only 36.4 per cent against in a 70 per cent turnout.
At last week's annual conference delegates rejected the 1.5 per cent pay
offer and refused to accept the ballot result of the union's membership.
They also called for an overtime ban until a satisfactory agreement had been
reached and declared the ballot null and void.
But after legal advice the federation executive decided to go ahead and
accept the pay increase in line with the government's public-sector pay
limit.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Budget reform idea 'inadequate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT proposals for reforming the budget make no concessions to
'widespread' demands for better consultation on taxation issues, a cross
party report said yesterday.
The committee was looking into government plans for a unified budget
bringing together spending and revenue statements in November, rather than
the existing system where revenue-raising measures are announced in the
spring and spending plans in the Autumn.
The report said existing consultation with outside bodies was insufficient
and the white paper proposals were unlikely to alleviate the situation.
The report says: 'The government's new budgetary time table is a modest step
towards the modernisation of budgetary procedures. It goes only a small way
towards meeting the concerns of either parliamentary reformers or of
lawyers, accountancy bodies or business organisations with an interest in
improving the presentation, scrutiny and control of public expenditure,
taxation and borrowing.'
The Treasury and Civil Service select committee has long supported the idea
of a 'green budget', under which the government's taxation and spending
proposals are presented to parliament for public and parliamentary scrutiny
before final decisions are announced.
The report concludes that the proposals do not 'meet the needs for the House
to improve its procedures for responding to the government's proposals for
public spending, taxation and borrowing'.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Attack on Daf buy-out 'subsidy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR-controlled Lancashire County Council yesterday asked Mr John Major to
intervene in the receivership of Leyland Daf trucks and confirm whether
rival bidders to a management buy-out team have been offered government
financial backing.
Lancashire Enterprises, the county council's privatised economic development
agency, is supporting the team trying to buy out the truck assembly plant in
Leyland. The agency suspects rival bidders have been offered help by the
Scottish Office to bid for both Leyland Daf's axle plant in Glasgow and the
Lancashire plant.
Mrs Louise Ellman, deputy chairman of the agency and leader of the council,
said this would be a misuse of public funds, favouring Scottish jobs at the
expense of English ones.
Under the management bid, Lancashire Enterprises would buy the Leyland
factory, lease part of it to the management for production and develop the
rest, together with the 230-acre surrounding site, as a business and
technology park. Barclays Development Capital is providing equity support.
Arthur Andersen, the receiver, agreed the Pounds 40m-plus deal in principle
a month ago, but said it would continue to talk to other bidders during
completion negotiations. The receiver hopes to complete any deals by
mid-June and said there were several other bidders. Only one, Mr Ian
McKinnon, a former chief executive of Leyland Bus, had agreed to be named.
Mr McKinnon has refused to name his financial backers. The Scottish Office
last night refused to comment on the grounds of commercial confidentiality.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Pipeline may supply gas to Belgium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM EGGAR, energy minister, is expected to announce in the Commons today
the publication of a prospectus for the Pounds 300m gas pipe project between
the UK and the Continent.
A group of companies including British Gas, British Petroleum and Norway's
Statoil have been involved in an initial feasibility study which could
involve the export of UK gas to continental Europe.
Mr Eggar will refer to the prospectus in a parliamentary answer. It should
set out details of the so-called Europipe venture in an effort to gauge the
amount of interest among energy companies for the private-sector project.
A steering committee of seven companies involved in the initial technical
studies is considering a plan to build a pipeline between Bacton, in
Norfolk, and Zeebrugge in Belgium, with export capacity of 15bn cu m a year,
or a third of current UK output.
However, companies are not sure of the commercial viability of such a
scheme. Statoil said yesterday it had not yet decided whether to participate
in the project.
Mr Eggar is understood to have told the companies involved that the UK
government is ready to negotiate a treaty with the Belgian authorities about
the proposed Europipe linking up with the Belgian national grid.
The government is keen for the Europipe project to go ahead and is linking
the success of the venture to a decision to allow additional supplies of
Norwegian gas to flow into the UK. But there has been some scepticism about
the viability of the planned project because it is unlikely the gas could
compete with lower-cost supplies from Russia.
Other companies involved in the plan include Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian
resources group, Elf Aquitaine, France's energy group, Conoco UK and
Distrigaz of Belgium.

FT  25 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Review makes China a most fazed nation -
Beijing waits anxiously on Clinton trade move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEIJING will be monitoring signals from Washington this week with more than
usually obsessive interest. A decision on its Most Favoured Nation (MFN)
trading status is due by June 3. Also in the melting pot is the likely
course of the broader Sino-US relationship during the Clinton
administration.
Chinese officials make no secret of their concerns that a narrow focus on
issues surrounding renewal of China's MFN status - the principle of
according equal conditions to all trade partners - at the expense of wider
interests will deflect US policy makers from recognising what is at stake.
'We want to see more mutual confidence, less trouble, closer co-operation
and no confrontation between us,' Mr Jiang Zemin, China's party boss, said
at the weekend.
Chinese officials have also been talking worriedly about what they perceive
as a lack of direction in President Bill Clinton's foreign policy on such
issues as Bosnia and international trade. They fear that China policy may
also be prey to such a muddling approach, and differences on issues such as
human rights and weapons transfers will prove more difficult to contain.
In the meantime, China has made some limited gestures to appease its human
rights critics in the US, such as releasing several relatively high-profile
dissidents from jail early, which Americans cynically refer to as the annual
MFN releases, and hinting at a willingness to do more without being
specific. The process has taken on the aspect of a fairly unedifying shell
game.
China has also sought to address concerns about weapons transfers, assuring
Mr Shimon Peres, the visiting Israeli foreign minister, that it was not
selling missiles to either Iran or Syria. No mention was made of Pakistan, a
recent recipient of Chinese missile technology and a country thought to have
close defence links with Tehran.
Beijing would be well aware that the US administration has not completed its
review of China policy to guide Mr Clinton in his decision next week. He is
universally expected to renew MFN for 1993-94, but what is at issue is
whether he will at the same time announce conditions on renewal for the next
year. If he does so, trade-related investment is likely to be affected
immediately.
If the Chinese were seeking clues to US thinking they might consider
testimony given to the Senate foreign relations committee on March 31 by Mr
Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs. 'Our
policy challenge,' Mr Lord told senators, 'is to reconcile our need to deal
with this important nation with our imperative to promote international
values. We will seek co-operation with China on a range of issues. But
Americans cannot forget Tiananmen Square.'
It is stark observations such as this that make the US-China business
community nervous, raising as they do the spectre of tougher and more
specific conditions on renewal of MFN than the Chinese may be prepared to
live with.
Among the many provisions of a draft bill before the US Congress are: China
should allow unrestricted emigration of political and religious prisoners;
provide an acceptable accounting for and release of Chinese citizens
detained, accused or sentenced as a result of non-violent expression of
their political beliefs; and cease religious persecution in China and Tibet.
In Beijing, attitudes within the US business and official community seem to
range from optimism to a lingering dread that a distracted Washington may
miscalculate. Mr John Hart, president of the American chamber of commerce,
believes that continuing uncertainty over MFN is affecting trade relations
and if it persists US business is in danger of being disadvantaged.
'We think it's a fairly high risk game they're playing,' Mr Hart observed.
'The biggest problem, as I see it, is the climate of uncertainty. The
situation is much more difficult this year than last when we knew what the
scenario was going to be.'
Mr John Frisbie, director of the US-China Business Council, a lobby group
representing US business interests in China, takes a more sanguine view. 'I
don't expect Clinton to be extremely specific (on MFN conditions). Why would
a president want to reduce his flexibility over a decision he is not obliged
to make for a year.'
The US-China Business Council has been at the forefront of lobbying efforts
with the administration, arguing that trade with China has helped create
150,000 additional jobs in the US; and that the Chinese market with its
insatiable demand for passenger aircraft is vital to the health of the
American aerospace industry - an industry targeted for growth by Mr Clinton.
'This is not just American companies salivating over the China market,' Mr
Frisbie said. 'The business presence here in all its forms has been the
single most pervasive force for change in the past decade. To take that away
would be counter-productive to the goals of those in Congress seeking to
change China.'
According to US figures, Chinese imports are Dollars 25.7bn (Pounds 16.6bn)
and the US market accounts for 25 per cent of China's global exports.
Removal of MFN preferences may cause a drop of as much as 10 per cent in
China's export earnings.

FT  25 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Cairns Group to press G7 over Gatt
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries is to hold a meeting
next month aimed at pressing for agreement at the Group of Seven's Tokyo
summit in July on a framework for completing the Uruguay Round this year,
writes Alexander Nicoll, Asia Editor.
Mr Peter Cook, Australian trade minister, said in London yesterday that the
meeting in Bangkok on June 26-27 would ensure the interests of the group's
14 members were reflected in Tokyo. He saw encouraging signs that Gatt talks
were producing a 'decent' market access package and that differences between
the US and the European Community were being bridged.
G7 countries, he said, 'must understand that other countries expect the
outcome to be genuinely trade-liberalising, and that it will reflect the
legitimate interests of all countries, not just the majors'. The importance
of agriculture must not be lost in the struggle to resolve differences
between the US and EC, he added.

FT  25 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Hotels in Americas see better prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOTELIERS in the Americas are gaining confidence, but Europeans and Asians
say prospects are gloomy, according to a survey by leisure consultants
Horwath International.
It found that 54 per cent of North American hoteliers were more optimistic
than they were six months ago, with only 8 per cent saying they were less
optimistic. In Latin America, 70 per cent were more optimistic and none was
less.
In Europe, only 20 per cent said they were more optimistic than six months
ago, with 38 per cent saying they were more pessimistic. This was an
improvement, however, over six months ago, when 10 per cent were optimistic
and 48 per cent pessimistic.
In the Asia-Pacific region, the optimistic proportion shrank to 33 per cent
from 36 per cent six months ago. However, the pessimistic proportion also
fell - from 33 per cent to 15 per cent.
With the exception of North America, hoteliers worldwide said they had
reduced their workforces and would continue to do so. In Europe, 68 per cent
of hotels said they had reduced employee numbers over the past six months
and 39 per cent said they would do so over the next six. Only 2 per cent
said they had increased staffing levels over the past six months and only 13
per cent said they would do so over the next six months.
More than 40 per cent of Asian hotels had reduced workforces and nearly half
intended to do so in the next six months. Even in Latin America, half the
hoteliers said they had fewer workers than they had six months ago and 20
per cent said this trend would continue in the next six months.
Only in North America were staff numbers expected to rise, and then only
slightly. Staff increases were planned by 24 per cent, with 23 per cent
planning reductions in the next six months.

FT  25 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US plans to broaden trade index - Private
sector services and merchandise trade balance to be combined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, is to clarify the US trade picture by
ordering a new quarterly index which will combine private sector services
and the merchandise trade balance.
He said in a letter to Mr Harry Freeman, executive director of the MTN
Coalition, a US business group, that this would allow the US to move beyond
the conventional definition of the trade balance. The department's
statisticians were also 'assessing the feasibility of producing monthly
estimates of trade in goods and services,' he added.
The new index, which will be introduced in June, will demonstrate the point
that services lobbyists have long been stressing: that the US trade deficit
is not as bad as it looks.
From the quarterly current account figures a new entry - called private
services - will collate exports and imports from the US services sector,
bringing in air passenger travel, inbound tourism, professional services,
financial services, audio/video rentals, construction and engineering
services, education of foreign students, and insurance and medical services.
In 1992 the trade in private services between the US and the rest of the
world gave the US a Dollars 59bn (Pounds 38.3bn) surplus. If this is
subtracted from the Dollars 96bn merchandise deficit, the trade deficit was
Dollars 37bn.
Trade in services is an important issue in the US relationship with Japan.
In a defence of its trade regime, released last week by the Japanese
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Tokyo claimed its surplus had
failed to take into account services, such as transport and travel. The US
surplus in the services sector would grow, it added, as Japan was not
competitive there.
Indeed, the US has been making slow gains in the balance of its trade in
services with Japan - the surplus rose from Dollars 8.9bn in 1989 to Dollars
13.2bn in 1992.
This is likely to continue. The US had a Dollars 10bn surplus last year with
Japan in travel and passenger fares, one of the biggest growth areas for
receipts. As long as Japan remains prosperous and expensive it is unlikely
to draw more American tourists than the US does Japanese.
The US ran a Dollars 2.7bn surplus with Japan on 'other services' - which
include telecommunications. Most telephone calls and data transmissions are
initiated from the US, where the industry is deregulated and its services
comparatively cheap.
The fifth largest US services export is education, a sector which includes
thousands of students studying at US colleges and which holds growth
promise.
Mr Freeman sees a time when US - and perhaps Canadian - schools will form
consortiums to bring foreign students to North America for study in
programmes funded by development banks or governments.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Eduardo Frei, leader of Chile's Christian Democrats, looks set to secure
the presidential nomination of the country's ruling coalition after primary
elections on Sunday, Reuter reports from Santiago.
He took more than 60 per cent of the votes of some 600,000 party members and
supporters, electoral officials said. His Socialist rival, Mr Ricardo Lagos,
received about 38 per cent, the officials said.
Under the coalition's complex selection procedure, the votes on Sunday were
assigned to delegates to cast at a final convention next Sunday. However,
the winner last Sunday is sure of victory at the convention, where the
coalition will unveil its campaign manifesto.
The winner of the primary, the first in Chile, which returned to democracy
in 1990 after 17 years of military rule, will be the strong favourite to
become the next president, to be elected on December 11.
Opinion polls before the primary gave Mr Frei, from the same party as
President Patricio Aylwin, some 49 per cent of national support, compared to
3.5 per cent for his nearest right-wing rival. The polls also showed support
from the ruling coalition's left-wing parties could mean Mr Frei taking more
than two-thirds of the presidential vote.
From Stockholm: A group of Chilean exiles protesting against a visit by
President Aylwin hurled eggs at him during a demonstration in the centre of
Stockholm yesterday.
Organisations representing some of the 30,000 Chileans living in Sweden have
stated Mr Aylwin is not welcome because of what they see as his moral
support of the coup in Chile that toppled President Salvador Allende in
1973.
Mr Aylwin repeated yesterday that he had never endorsed the coup.

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Octavio Lepage, Venezuela's caretaker president, indicated yesterday that
reducing the country's high domestic interest rates was one of his first
priorities.
He said he would meet the board of the central bank in an effort to
encourage it to 'design measures to correct this problem immediately'.
However, given the independence of the bank, it was unclear how Mr Lepage
would achieve a rate cut.
With annual inflation at more than 30 per cent in the past 12 months,
Venezuela has real interest rates of 30 per cent or more for commercial
loans.
Having met business leaders at the weekend, the acting-president also said
he would review national economic policy and decide whether changes were
needed.
Mr Lepage, a senator in the ruling Democratic Action party, was sworn in as
acting president on Friday after President Carlos Andres Perez was suspended
to face a charge of misuse of public funds. The trial will be before the
supreme court, which is expected to take this week the first steps towards a
hearing.
Mr Lepage admitted he was not 'an economic expert' but said he believed Mr
Perez's unpopular free-market reforms of the past four years were 'correct
in strategic terms'. However, he rejected what he called 'dogmatism and the
use of foreign models' in implementing 'IMF-style' economic adjustments.
The acting president, although the focus of a controversy over how long he
should stay in office, said the situation in Venezuela was 'critical, but
perfectly manageable'. He admitted that the government was 'weak' and needed
a stronger base through some 'national understanding' among the political
parties'.
Congress, caught in the storm over Mr Perez, has not acted on bills aimed at
economic and political reform. These include new taxes to help close the
fiscal gap, reductions in the national oil companies' tax burden, as well as
proposed reforms of the financial system.

FT  25 MAY 93 / White House defends energy tax as rift grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration opened the first of several critical weeks for
its deficit reduction package by insisting, in the face of significant
opposition in Congress, that it stood by the principle of a broad-based
energy tax.
Following President Bill Clinton's weekend broadside against the 'big oil
lobby', Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said in a television interview
yesterday morning that the president felt the energy tax was still central
to the overall plan.
Senator Daniel Moynihan of New York, chairman of the finance committee,
predicted that some form of energy tax would be passed on to the full Senate
from his committee, although he conceded amendments to it could be made.
Senators David Boren of Oklahoma and John Breaux of Louisiana, both
representing oil states, have qualified their opposition to the tax, based
on the energy content of fuels measured in British thermal units (BTUs).
However, Mr Boren, the principal sponsor of an alternative plan to put
ceilings on social spending and increase taxes on the elderly, said he would
still vote against the energy tax as it was now constituted in the
committee.
Mr Breaux said he could support a straight petrol tax, but at a rate (eight
cents to the gallon) that would generate less than half the projected
Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.2bn) a year revenue of the BTU tax once fully in
place.
The Senate machinations have cast a cloud over the more imminent
deliberations in the House, which is due to vote on the overall package,
including the energy tax, on Thursday.
The general assumption has been that the bill will pass the House, where the
Democrats have a comfortable majority, in spite of last week's rebellion by
mostly conservative southern Democrats demanding deeper spending cuts and
less reliance on tax revenues. As Mr Moynihan has indicated, the precise mix
of the package may yet be altered.
But even Mr Clinton's supporters in the House are concerned that their
politically difficult vote on Thursday may be rendered null and void by
subsequent amendments in the Senate. Recalling that the House passed the
economic stimulus package only to see it killed in the Senate, Congressman
Craig Washington, a Texas Democrat, questioned whether members 'are willing
to fall on their swords again'.
Among Democrats, fault lines other than that on the energy tax are becoming
increasingly apparent over Mr Clinton's general approach to cutting the
budget deficit.
Mr Clinton came to office as a self-proclaimed 'new kind of Democrat', a
believer in individual responsibility rather than the pre-eminence of
government's role. But, in the opinion of old allies like Congressman Dave
McCurdy of Oklahoma, he has become increasingly captured by the party's 'tax
and spend' and traditionally liberal forces.
It is the emphasis on new taxation - a contradiction of Mr Clinton's
campaign promise to lower taxes on the middle classes - that most disturbs
these centrist Democrats. Senator Boren, for example, has justified his
opposition to the energy tax as a way of reminding Mr Clinton to go back to
his roots. 'Sometimes,' he said in a weekend talk show, 'when you see a
friend go astray, the best thing to do is to tell the friend the truth.'
Mr McCurdy said his opposition to the president was 'the most painful thing
I've had to do in Congress'.

BRITAIN will be asked this week to take a more active role in efforts to
resolve the political situation in Haiti, and to encourage its European
Community partners to support moves to restore democratic government to the
Caribbean state.
The request will be put to Mr John Major, UK prime minister, by Mr Patrick
Manning, his Trinidad and Tobago counterpart and chairman of the Caribbean
Community. He will arrive in London today on an official visit.
'We have managed to get the matter to the United Nations, but we do not have
a resolution of the Haitian situation,' Mr Manning said. 'We need the
attention of the EC and to bring more pressure to bear', so as to resolve
the dispute between exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the military
which ousted him.
Mr Manning will also discuss with Mr Major the continuing concerns of
Caribbean Community leaders over access of the region's bananas to the EC.
He will repeat these concerns when he visits Germany this week. The Germans
are unhappy with proposals from the EC farm ministers which would put under
quota bananas imported from Latin America, while guaranteeing access for
fruit from traditional suppliers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific
Group.
The Trinidadian leader will also meet representatives of the British
financial services sector and the oil industry, seeking investments in the
Caribbean republic. His administration is trying to make the country the
business and financial capital of the Caribbean.
Last month, the Trinidadian government deregulated the local foreign
exchange market.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Latin American growth 'slower'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC growth in Latin America outside Brazil will slow this year while
the region's current account deficit will continue to widen, according to a
new survey of economic and financial forecasts for the region.
The survey, published for the first time this month by the London-based
Consensus Economics, reckons inflation (outside Brazil) will stay on its
downward track.
Latin America, again excluding Brazil, will grow by an average 3.4 per cent
this year and 3.6 per cent next year, compared with 4.5 per cent last year.
Including Brazil, which is forecast to grow 2.7 per cent this year following
a 1 per cent shrinkage of the economy last year, growth in Latin America
will accelerate to 3.1 per cent this year and next, from 2.2 per cent in
1992.
The region's current account deficit, excluding Brazil, will widen to
Dollars 41.6bn (Pounds 27bn) this year and Dollars 42bn next, from Dollars
37.7bn in 1992.
The survey says Mexico's current account deficit will widen to Dollars
24.7bn this year and Dollars 26.5bn next, from Dollars 22.8bn. Argentina's
current account deficit is forecast to come down from Dollars 7.8bn to
Dollars 7.7bn this year and Dollars 7.2bn next. Brazil's surplus would
shrink from Dollars 4.8bn last year to Dollars 3.1bn this year and Dollars
2.1bn next.
Inflation in Brazil - forecast to rise to 1,631 per cent this year from
1,129 per cent last - is expected to push average inflation for the region
higher this year. Excluding Brazil, the trend is downward to an average 18.6
per cent this year and 16.2 per cent next year, from 23.1 per cent in 1992.
The survey, conducted among 60 international and domestic forecasters, will
be repeated and published every two months.

FT  25 MAY 93 / S Korean military chief sacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korean President Kim Young-sam yesterday sacked the chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff in a continuing purge of the military under the new
civilian government.
In his first three months in office, Mr Kim has replaced many senior
commanders in an attempt to impose firm civilian control over the military,
which ruled the country for the past 32 years.
Most of those dismissed have been army officers who are members of the
Hanahoe (One Mind) society, which plotted the last coup in 1979 and includes
the two previous presidents, Mr Chun Doo-hwan and Mr Roh Tae-woo. Hanahoe
consists of the graduates from the Korean military academy in the 1950s.
In what is regarded as a move to reduce the influence of the army, the
biggest and most powerful service, Mr Kim appointed the air force chief, Gen
Lee Yang-ho, as the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to replace Gen
Lee Pil-sup of the army. The position has previously been held only by army
generals.
The appointment of the air force chief may also be an attempt by Mr Kim to
make amends to the junior services after the recent arrest of a dozen air
force and navy officers on corruption charges including bribery to obtain
senior commands.
The air force and navy complained they were being unfairly punished, since
Mr Kim was ignoring suspected cases of corruption in the army.
The corruption charges have threatened to damage severely relations between
Mr Kim and the military when tensions are growing with North Korea over its
suspected nuclear weapons programme.
Mr Kim then tried to improve ties with the military by cancelling plans to
prosecute the officers for corruption, although they were dismissed from the
service.
The current purge, however, has support within the military, particularly
among younger officers who have seen their chances for promotion blocked by
the older generation affiliated with the former military dictatorship.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Museveni seeks to lift Uganda's business profile: African
country is darling of the World Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda opens today's Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) conference on investment in his country it will mark
a significant step forward in the rehabilitation of an economy that all but
collapsed in the mid-1980s.
The country has since become the darling of the World Bank, thanks to its
strict adherence to economic reform. In 1993, gross domestic product growth
could be as high as 5 per cent, while tight monetary policy has brought
inflation down from around 60 per cent last year to just 3 per cent.
'We think growth prospects are very good. The government is committed to the
reform programme and it is making progress. In fact I think they are way out
in front,' said a World Bank official.
Although the figures make good reading, the government complains that the
austerity programme has left little to spare for raising living standards.
As a result, Mr Museveni is having to raise Uganda's business profile, after
a decade which has seen investment flows to sub-Saharan Africa slow down to
a trickle.
'We have to tell the world that we are new people in power' he said in an
interview. 'The atmosphere has changed over the last seven years we have
been in power. Ugandans have stopped concentrating on killing each other and
are instead ready to work.'
Both the civil service and the once large army have been cut substantially,
while dependence on the export of raw coffee, which last year earned the
country Dollars 102m (Pounds 66.2m), has fallen to less than 75 per cent of
total exports from some 94 per cent in the late 1980s.
The country has lifted curbs on the repatriation of profits and instituted a
one-stop investment authority to provide information and licences. The
privatisation programme has also been stepped up, with many government-owned
industries now for sale.
'I have seen great changes,' says Mr Gerry Parfitt, partner at conference
co-sponsors Coopers and Lybrand. 'We think there is a lot of potential.'
For all the praise, however, a catalogue of problems remains. A 1992 United
Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido) study highlighted the
cost disadvantages of Uganda's land-locked position, suggesting emphasis
should be put on small-scale and resource-based industrial development.
The government has also failed to root out corruption, and the incidence of
Aids remains a costly challenge.
Sporadic fighting in the north of the country and large numbers of refugees
from the country's troubled neighbours of Rwanda and Sudan continue to place
strains on an overstretched administration.
The president is also at odds with the donor community over multiparty
democracy. 'It brought us nothing but chaos,' says Mr Museveni. 'We are due
to elect a constituent assembly at the end of the year, which will decide
our form of government, and we shall have parliamentary and presidential
elections. But I remain opposed to a multiparty system. We can still have
democracy, but without parties.'
He claims he has not decided whether to run for the presidency: 'It is no
fun trying to balance a budget without resources. It is not a privilege,
just a duty which had to be done.'
That said, some investors are declaring their confidence in the new Uganda
that Mr Museveni has created. Mr Christopher Green, a director of Barclays
Metals, which is developing cobalt bearing tailings in western Uganda, says:
'We have sufficient trust in the changes for us to feel comfortable with
investing.'

FT  25 MAY 93 / Palestinian curbs 'hurt Israel'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Jerusalem Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S treasury forecast yesterday that a closure imposed on the occupied
territories two months ago is slowing Israeli economic growth in 1993 and
accelerating inflation.
It said the closure, limiting the number of Palestinians from the
territories allowed to work in Israel, had mostly hurt building and farming
sectors.
The treasury report, given to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's cabinet on
Sunday, predicts the closure will slow economic growth by 0.5 to 1
percentage point while boosting annual inflation by 2 to 3 percentage
points.
For the moment, however, the economic strictures are confined to the
Palestinians.
At Rafiah's fruit and vegetable market in the Gaza strip, dozens of boxes of
loquats and peaches have been slowly spoiling for a week. 'There are no
buyers because there is no money. And there is no money because nobody in
Gaza can work these days,' says one of the market stallholders.
Introduced following the killings of 15 Israelis by Palestinians in March,
the closure was initially welcomed by some Palestinians. Israel, they
reasoned, was, in effect, returning to its pre-1967 borders, acknowledging
that it could not guarantee its own security. Surely withdrawal could not
now be far away.
But two months on, harsh economic reality has replaced such thinking. Before
the closure, about 130,000 Palestinians from the occupied territories
crossed the checkpoints daily to jobs in building, agriculture and industry
inside Israel. Today, only about 45,000 have permits. The rest are jobless
and, after Sunday's Israeli cabinet rejection of proposals to award them
unemployment pay, increasingly short of cash.
Palestinian economists told Mr Ilter Turkmen, the visiting
commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works agency, last
week that they estimated the closure was costing them Dollars 5m a day in
lost wages and other side-effects. 'And with their depressed economy,' noted
Mr Turkmen, 'that is a huge sum.'
Sunday's cabinet meeting did approve the allocation of Shk30m (Pounds 7m) to
create 20,000 jobs in the territories in the next two months. But even
assuming that many jobs can be created so quickly, this would leave another
65,000 Palestinians out of work as a direct result of the closure.
Mr Rabin is apparently so delighted by the marked reduction in Palestinian
attacks on Israelis since the closure began that he would like to maintain
it for weeks if not months to come.
But the policy is facing growing opposition from a variety of sources. The
UN secretary general, the UNRWA commissioner-general, the president of the
International Red Cross and the US State Department have all in recent days
urged Israel to ease conditions in the territories.
The Israeli security forces too, are expressing the concern at the 'pressure
cooker' atmosphere building up among jobless, impoverished, frustrated
Palestinians.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Chinese police fire tear gas at Tibetan protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINESE POLICE yesterday fired rounds of tear gas for two hours to quell
protests by several thousand people in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.
It was not known whether there were casualties or how many people had been
arrested. Westerners were confined to their hotels and police were
patrolling the streets in strength last night.
A protest by about 800 people, apparently against price rises, began
peacefully during the morning outside a main government building. The
demonstrators initially met no response from police, but were eventually
moved on.
During the evening, the crowd swelled to between 1,000 and 4,000 and
attacked shops, almost certainly those run by Chinese, said Mr Robbie
Barnett, director of the London-based Tibet Information Network. An influx
of Chinese traders into Lhasa has aroused enmity among Tibetans.
Reuters news agency, quoting travellers in Lhasa, said protesters were
throwing rocks at the police headquarters and chanted slogans calling for
Tibetan independence.
Public demonstrations of Tibetan hostility to Chinese rule are rare because
of tight control by the authorities. The protests came the day after the
42nd anniversary of the surrender document being signed following China's
1951 invasion.
A dozen senior European diplomats are due to produce a report on human
rights in Tibet after a week-long visit which ended on Sunday. They had
abandoned plans to hold a dinner for their hosts because of continuing
arrests of Tibetan dissidents.

EGYPT could move swiftly to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa
once Pretoria names the date for its first all-race elections and
establishes its advisory transitional executive council, Egyptian Foreign
Ministry officials said yesterday.
Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, arrived in Cairo yesterday
for a three-day visit during which he will discuss establishing diplomatic
links with Mr Amr Moussa, his Egyptian counterpart.
These will be the first bilateral talks between the two countries. The South
African minister's arrival in Cairo follows his tour last month to Jordan,
Oman and Qatar. It underlines Pretoria's determination to increase trade and
investment and develop political relations in the region.
Egypt, which formally applies the international embargo against South
Africa, has very limited ties with the republic. These amount to the
exchange of a handful of tourists and a small amount of informal import and
export trade.
But Egyptian officials said that once an election date and transitional
executive council - which will advise the South African government before
the planned elections - were named, Cairo would see no great impediment to
diplomatic relations. Parties to constitutional talks in South Africa
earlier this month said they hoped to fix an election date by early next
month.
The officials did not expect any progress on South Africa's desire to join
the Organisation of African Unity, which will hold its annual summit in
Cairo at the end of next month.

FT  25 MAY 93 / World Bank plans Dollars 1bn loans to Pretoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank has Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) worth of development projects
in the pipeline for South Africa. They will be implemented once a non-racial
transitional government is in place, Mr Edward Jaycox, the World Bank's
vice-president for Africa, said yesterday.
Mr Jaycox, who was on a brief stopover in London en route to the World
Economic Forum in Cape Town, said the projects aimed to improve health,
housing and education for South Africa's poor blacks.
The World Bank stopped lending to South Africa when international sanctions
were imposed against Pretoria's apartheid regime. But after two years of
talks with both the government and the African National Congress, Mr Jaycox
said prospects for renewing relations with South Africa were 'excellent'.
Mr Jaycox stressed that World Bank loans to South Africa would not be on
concessional terms, because of the country's relative wealth. The Bank's
pledge follows similar promises of economic support for a democratic South
Africa by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state.
The World Bank official was also keen to dispel the widespread image of the
continent as a region of 'victims and losers'. For the first time in a
generation, many countries were enjoying growth rates higher than the
expansion of their populations.
He was confident that tough structural adjustment programmes were beginning
to bear fruit, despite an adverse international economic climate and the
lukewarm commitment of many African governments to reform.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Cambodian Elections: Khmer Rouge allows guerrillas and

THE KHMER ROUGE surprised UN officials in Cambodia yesterday by allowing
some of its own guerrillas and civilians living in its territory to vote in
this week's election, only days after warning Cambodians not to go to the
polls on pain of death, reports Victor Mallet from Phnom Penh.
About 200 Khmer Rouge cadres emerged from the wilderness to vote at Poipet
on the Thai border on Sunday, UN officials said yesterday. In some districts
the Khmer Rouge instructed its supporters to vote for Funcinpec, the
royalist party and the main electoral rival to the Phnom Penh government.
The Khmer Rouge pulled out of a peace accord signed by the four main
Cambodian factions in 1991 and threatened to disrupt the UN-organised
elections, but it may have decided to renew ties with its old allies in the
royalist camp in the hope of a Funcinpec victory.
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the Funcinpec leader, and his father Prince
Sihanouk, the former 'god-king', have called for reconciliation with the
Khmer Rouge, whereas the government says it will treat the guerrillas as
bandits if it wins the election.
According to the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, between 60 and 70
per cent of those registered have already voted; the voting ends on Friday.

A PARTIAL settlement was reached yesterday in a 25-year dispute between the
Japanese government and protest groups which have blocked the construction
of the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita.
The continuing Narita protests and the opposition of local farmers' groups
have succeeded, to the embarrassment of the government, in crippling plans
for two runways and a high-speed railway link from the airport to central
Tokyo.
At a meeting yesterday, the government agreed to halt preparatory work on
the two runways and withdraw applications to seize land which residents have
refused to sell. In return, an influential protest group, Atsuta, will join
a forum to plan the final stages of the airport's construction.
The agreement does not include two other farmer-backed protest groups which
still own land in the path of the proposed runways. One of those groups
insists that the entire Narita project, including the buildings already
completed and open for business, must be scrapped.
However, the government hopes those groups will join Atsuta in the forum,
due to be established late this year. Mr Ihei Ochi, the transport minister,
hailed the agreement as a 'new beginning', but it still remains unclear as
to when the dispute will come to an end.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Cambodian Elections: Cambodia shatters myth of Japanese
warrior - Timidity among Tokyo's UN contingent has embarrassed the
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW of the foreign contingents working for the United Nations in Cambodia
can have been as pleased as the Japanese that the first two days of the
UN-organised election this week passed off much more peacefully than
expected. Japan's attempt to forge a new and more prominent role for itself
on the international stage - symbolised by the choice of the Japanese
diplomat Mr Yasushi Akashi as chief of UN operations in Cambodia - has been
afflicted by both tragedy and ignominy.
The killing of two Japanese peacekeepers in separate attacks in April and
May prompted anxious Japanese at home and fearful Japanese policemen in
Cambodia to ask the Tokyo government to withdraw its nationals and thus end
its first use of ground forces abroad since the second world war.
Such a move would probably have put an insurmountable obstacle in the way of
Japan's efforts to earn a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.
For the time being Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, has held
firm, reiterating his country's commitment to the UN Transitional Authority
in Cambodia (Untac) while sending senior officials to Phnom Penh to plead
for improved security for Japanese and other forces.
Japan, whose contributions to Cambodia included 600 members of an
engineering battalion and 75 unarmed policemen, has had an unhappy record in
the country, although there is so far no evidence that its nationals are
being targeted by Khmer Rouge guerrillas as the 'soft underbelly' of Untac's
22,000 peacekeepers.
Atsuhito Nakata, an idealistic and dedicated 25-year-old civilian volunteer
working as a district electoral supervisor, was ambushed and murdered with a
Cambodian assistant in Kompong Thom province in April. It is not clear
whether he was killed by the Khmer Rouge or by frustrated job seekers denied
lucrative employment with the UN.
Haruyuki Takada, a 33-year-old policeman, was killed in north-western
Cambodia earlier this month in a Khmer Rouge attack on a UN convoy.
After the second killing, several Japanese policemen deserted their posts
and sought the safety of the capital, to the intense embarrassment of the
Japanese government and Mr Akashi. Mr Hiroto Yamazaki, head of the Japanese
police in Cambodia, asked for his men to be withdrawn from the country.
'It's absurd,' said one diplomat from another nation contributing forces to
Untac. 'You can't have countries taking that sort of unilateral action.'
At least four of the policemen are still in Phnom Penh, although Untac and
Japan have found a solution of sorts by declaring them to be ill. Japanese
journalists say they are suffering from 'mental exhaustion'. Brig-Gen Klaas
Roos, the Dutch chief of Untac police, says they have medical certificates
and will be sent home.
The humiliation of the Japanese contingent was compounded when two prisoners
linked to the Cambodian government and suspected of murdering an opposition
politician escaped in a jailbreak in Prey Veng; two Japanese policemen were
supposed to be guarding them 24 hours a day precisely because Untac did not
trust the prison authorities to keep the suspects behind bars.
Outdated western images of the 'warrior' Japanese dating back to the second
world war have quickly been dispelled by the reality in Cambodia, and
replaced with a sense of resentment that the Japanese appear to be receiving
special treatment.
The Japanese engineers, and the 40 newly-arrived Japanese international
polling station officers, have been posted to Takeo province near Phnom
Penh, which is regarded as one of the safest areas of Cambodia.
In Takeo the engineers live in a luxurious camp which boasts everything from
air-conditioning and video games to herbal baths, karaoke machines and cold
Sapporo beer. All polling station officers were allowed to receive a light
flak jacket but some non-Japanese complained that their Japanese colleagues
had been issued with full bullet-proof vests by Tokyo.
Part of the problem for the Japanese policemen and soldiers is that their
government, in its eagerness to play an international role, deliberately
painted too rosy a picture of the situation in Cambodia.
Among the principles laid down by the government for Japanese participation
in peacekeeping operations - to conform with Japan's pacifist post-war
constitution - was that there should be a ceasefire agreement in place.
However the Cambodian ceasefire has been more honoured in the breach than
the observance.
'We are interpreting (our constitution) to the maximum possible so that our
government can contribute to international peacekeeping operations,' admits
one Japanese diplomat in Phnom Penh.
This stretching of the rules is confirmed by Japanese officers from the
engineer battalion in Takeo. Faced with the threat of Khmer Rouge attempts
to disrupt the election, the Japanese are mounting armed patrols around
their camp, but they have to say publicly that they are just driving around
and having a look. 'In the Japanese area, it's not called a patrol, but it
is a patrol,' says one officer.
Japan has learned the hard way from Cambodia - where the Khmer Rouge has
flouted a 1991 peace agreement - that peacekeeping is an unpredictable and
dangerous business which demands flexibility rather than a set of rules
insisting blindly on real peace as a condition for participation.
'I received a message from the secretary-general of the ruling (Japanese)
Liberal Democratic party reminding me that the Japanese peacekeepers in
Cambodia are still at the kindergarten stage,' Mr Akashi, the Untac chief,
told reporters recently.
'Even though they may seem to you very cowardly and timid, you have to give
them time and experience,' he said. 'I am sure that in the future they can
contribute very positively to peace in the world.'

<TEXT>
Milan magistrates have opened another significant line of enquiry into
corruption in the form of political kick-backs on contracts controlled by
the Culture Ministry, Robert Graham reports from Rome. Yesterday, police
arrested Mr Alberto Ciampaglia, former treasurer of the small Social
Democrat party, for allegedly receiving a L400m (Pounds 175,510) payment
from an architect for restoration work. Last week Ms Vincenza Bono Parrino,
Social Democrat culture minister from 1988 to 1989, was warned she was under
investigation for allegedly receiving L2.5bn for restoration contracts for
historic monuments.
Mr Ciampaglia was one of four people arrested yesterday in connection with
the culture ministry enquiry. In another development, Mr Francesco Forte, a
prominent Socialist senator and former finance minister, announced he had
received notice that he was under investigation for allegedly receiving
illicit funds.

FT  25 MAY 93 / New leads in Italy scandal: Telecoms industry widens tangle
of inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY arresting a string of leading telecommunications executives, including
the local heads of multi-nationals such as Siemens and Ericsson, Italy's
magistrates have plugged into an important new line in the political
corruption scandal.
Cynics have already renamed the ministry of posts and telecommunications the
ministero delle poste e tangenti (bribes), reflecting the stream of
allegations regarding billions of lire in kickbacks on big telecoms
contracts.
The information, based largely on the leaked testimony of Mr Davide
Giacalone, a former adviser to Mr Oscar Mammi, the former posts minister,
has proved a deep embarrassment to the Republican party. Small but
influential, the Republicans have managed to remain relatively unscathed by
the corruption scandal, in spite of a warning to Mr Giorgio La Malfa, their
former leader, of possible prosecution on allegations of illegal party
funding.
That calm was shattered at the weekend after leaked testimony by Mr
Giacalone alleged the Republicans received about L9bn (Pounds 4m) in
kickbacks on telecoms business between 1987 and 1990. The allegations
prompted magistrates to inform Mr La Malfa and Mr Mammi that they were under
investigation on more serious charges of receiving illicit funds and illegal
party funding. Both politicians protested their innocence, and Mr Mammi is
to resign as an MP, which removes his parliamentary immunity.
The revelations also embarrassed Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's media
magnate, after it was learned Mr Giacalone worked as an independent
consultant to Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group on leaving the ministry. Among
Mr Giacalone's tasks for Mr Mammi was advising on the highly sensitive
allocation of valuable broadcasting frequencies, an issue of concern to
Fininvest, which controls Italy's three biggest private TV channels.
Telecommunications are likely to keep magistrates engaged for some time. In
the past 10 days, they have arrested the heads of the Italian telecoms
subsidiaries of Sweden's Ericsson, GEC Marconi of the UK and, most recently,
Germany's Siemens. Both Alcatel and Pirelli, leading cables producers, have
also reportedly admitted to paying kickbacks.
In the past three days, magistrates have made two further calls. Mr Luigi
Montella, managing director of Sirti, the network engineering subsidiary of
the huge, public-sector Stet telecommunications group, was arrested at the
weekend. And yesterday saw the arrest of Mr Tommaso Rea, a senior Stet
executive who headed its Seat yellow pages divisions until last year and now
runs its AET subsidiary. The involvement of Stet, one of Italy's biggest
companies and closely followed by international investors, marks a
potentially explosive development in the inquiries, which have so far
focused on the former ASST state telecommunications agency.
Unlike the UK, France or Germany, Italian telecommunications is split
between seven different companies. Stet, which is majority-owned by the Iri
state holding company, is the umbrella group for Sip, the main telephone
utility; Italcable (international calls); Telespazio (satellite
communications); Sirti and Italtel (equipment manufacturing).
The group is notorious for its political appointees. Top executive posts
have mushroomed to accommodate the political parties' desire for
representation, while co-ordination is limited and in-fighting endemic.
Until this year, ASST was an additional player in the telecoms game.
Directly controlled by the post ministry, rather than Iri, the agency in
theory dovetailed between Sip and Italcable. ASST handled inter-city trunk
traffic (leaving Sip to make local connections at either end) and
shorter-distance international calls (with intercontinental business left to
Italcable). In a belated attempt at rationalisation, ASST was transferred to
Iri this year, and renamed Iritel. The company which employs about 18,000,
is expected to disappear in a restructuring which may leave just one
telephone utility by the late 1990s.
Both ASST and Stet have invested massively to bring the once lamentable
telephone system up to date. Sip alone had a L5,000bn-a-year investment plan
for 1988-91, which was stepped up to L11,000bn yearly for 1992-95.
The allegations of kickbacks have so far been restricted to ASST, with
indications that the agency, linked directly to the political establishment,
was used as a direct source of funds. The investigations started after Mr
Giuseppe Parrella, former director general of ASST, was arrested in
connection with alleged kickbacks of L40bn on L2,500bn of business involving
domestic and multinational telecoms group between 1987 and 1991. Soon after
came the arrest of Mr Giuseppe Lo Moro, a former assistant to Mr Parrella,
and then Mr Giacalone.
The telecoms inquiries are probably still in their infancy. Magistrates are
already looking into the links between ASST and the posts ministry. So far,
Mr Antonio Gava, Mr Carlo Vizzini and Mr Mammi, the three post ministers
between 1987 and 1991, have all been told they are under investigation for
alleged political corruption. However, Mr Mammi is the only one so far
facing allegations specifically relating to his term of office.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Owen to consult EC over role as mediator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD OWEN, who drew up the ill-fated Bosnian peace plan with Mr Cyrus Vance,
yesterday hinted that his future role as a mediator might be in doubt.
He told journalists he wanted to consult European leaders over the next few
days before making a statement on the subject. Many observers believe the
plan has been sidelined by the new international strategy on containing the
conflict.
Lord Owen said he was facing a 'new situation' following last weekend's
meeting in Washington at which the US, its European allies and Russia agreed
to press ahead with 'safe areas' for Moslems in Bosnia and proposed the
monitoring of the Serbian-Bosnian border to ensure that essential supplies
to the Bosnian Serbs would not get through.
'My role as a negotiator stems from the European Community and I want to
talk to them,' Lord Owen said.
He declined to answer when asked whether the Vance-Owen peace plan,
providing for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous
provinces, might be dead following the Washington agreement.
However, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, firmly rejected any such
suggestion at a news conference in Copenhagen. The new peace efforts in
Bosnia should be seen as a prelude to the Vance-Owen plan, not as its
replacement, he said. 'What we were doing in Washington was to agree on the
steps which are immediately possible to stop the fighting and bring the
bloodshed to an end.'
In Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, defended the
new policy of limited steps to contain the war in Bosnia as serving the
interests of the American people.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, the special Russian peace envoy, also denied that the new
strategy meant an end to the Vance-Owen plan. Mr Churkin, who met Yugoslav
and Serbian leaders in Belgrade yesterday in a bid to persuade them to
accept deployment of UN monitors along Serbia's borders with Bosnia, said
the new Bosnian strategy reflected 'some aspects of the implementation of
the Vance-Owen plan'.
At the UN in New York, Islamic member states sharply criticised the
Washington agreement, saying the Security Council, by failing to take
stronger action, had yielded to 'Serbian blackmail'.

MR Franz Steinkuhler, leader of Germany's powerful IG Metall engineering
workers' union, yesterday offered to resign after accusations that he
benefited from insider dealing in the shares of Daimler-Benz.
At the same time he appealed for support from his union members to let him
stay in office and win back their confidence.
In a separate letter to Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of the supervisory board
at Daimler, of which he is a member, Mr Steinkuhler said he would not attend
any further meetings until an inquiry into insider dealing on the Frankfurt
stock exchange reported on his particular case. He will not attend the
company's annual general meeting tomorrow, at which his position on the
board is certain to be an issue.
His move was seen yesterday not as an admission of defeat by the most
powerful union leader in Germany, but as a calculated gamble to maintain his
position.
In a letter to top officials of the 3.3m-strong union, he admitted he made a
'political mistake' in buying and selling the shares of two companies
closely linked to Daimler.
Although he denies the charge of insider trading in the shares of both
Fokker, the Dutch aerospace manufacturer controlled by Daimler, and Mercedes
AG Holding, the Daimler holding company, he admitted that it was wrong to
have bought and sold them at all as a board member.
He promised that all the shares had now been sold, and the profits paid into
the solidarity fund for the recent strike by union members in the east
German engineering and steel industries. Mr Steinkuhler bought DM1m (Pounds
390m) worth of MAH shares, and earned a profit of at least DM64,000 on the
sale of a first tranche, after Daimler decided to dissolve the holding
company and exchange its shares for full company shares.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S ruling Socialist party yesterday moved a step closer to defeat in
the June 6 election after a Madrid newspaper published allegations that the
party may have illegally financed the 1986 referendum campaign to remain in
Nato.
The Socialists, while not denying the charges, said they were a political
attack. The income was not illegal, the party said, since it pre-dated the
current party financing law. The allegations, published so close to the
election, are bound to affect wavering voters. The conservative Partido
Popular and the Socialists continue to run neck-and-neck. Although the
Socialists appear to have escaped from the recent peseta devaluation and
increase in unemployment with little damage, a new corruption scandal could
be much more wounding.
Polls suggest that up to half the electorate is undecided, and many former
Socialist voters have been dismayed by the torrent of corruption charges
made against the party in the last four years. El Mundo, the newspaper which
published the charges, alleged the party raised more than Pounds 3.2m in
1986, mainly in the form of commissions paid to it by construction
companies. El Mundo has been responsible for uncovering nearly all the
scandals that have weakened the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
including the so-called Filesa scandal, which is credited with having forced
Mr Gonzalez to call an early election.
Filesa was a dummy consultancy company run by Socialist party officials,
which raised more than Pounds 6.4m in the late 1980s by selling reports and
services to client companies. None of the reports has ever been produced and
Treasury inspectors suspect they do not exist. The Filesa cash is alleged to
have been used to finance the Socialists' 1989 election campaign.
The new El Mundo claims came just before Mr Gonzalez held a televised
election debate with his main political challenger, the Partido Popular
leader, Mr Jose Mara Aznar.
Up to 5m people watched a dull late-night debate in which Mr Gonzalez
unexpectedly failed to dent his increasingly confident opponent. Often on
the defensive, the prime minister failed to force Mr Aznar to speak in any
detail about the Partido Popular's economic plans, which remain the
campaign's best kept secret.

<TEXT>
A POLISH government decision to suspend the sale of the Szczecin shipyard,
at the behest of President Lech Walesa, has provoked strong protests from
local unions.
Mr Walesa made the move after meeting Mr Marian Jurczyk, the leader of the
radical Solidarity 80 union, which wants the yard to be privatised through
an employee buy-out. However, the Solidarity union and the local branch of
the former communist OPZZ have criticised Mr Jurczyk's proposals and back
the original privatisation plan. The shipyard is one of Poland's most
successful enterprises.
The original plan involved the sale of 30 per cent of the yard's equity to
its domestic creditor banks and 30 per cent to the 5,000-strong workforce. A
further 9 per cent would be sold to management and 10 per cent would go on
public offer.
Last year, the yard negotiated a reduction of its near 2,000bn zloty (Pounds
73.3m) debt. Poland's Bank Handlowy has also opened a three-year Dollars
110m (Pounds 71.4m) credit line for the yard. Sales last year reached over
Dollars 180m, with the yard, which receives no subsidies, breaking even.
Cuts in delivery schedules and low labour costs have made it competitive on
the German market, where it is supplying 60 per cent of medium-sized
container vessels.
The yard's managing director, Mr Krzysztof Piotrowski, called the
government's decision 'tragic'.
The yard had hoped to establish an 'industrial group' modelled on Japanese
giants such as Mitsubishi or even Kvaerner, the Norwegian shipping group.
Kidder Peabody, the US investment and brokerage house, has been appointed by
Poland as its adviser on restructuring the country's Dollars 12.1bn
commercial bank debt. Negotiations on the debt are expected to last until
the end of the year.

THE Russian government and the central bank have agreed ambitious targets to

receive the first half of the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) systematic

The government and the bank said they would retain tight control of credit

budget deficit to 5 per cent of gross national product by the end of the
year.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic affairs,
yesterday said he expected the first Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the facility
within a month, and the second tranche in the second half of this year. A
further Dollars 4bn should also be paid over in the latter half of 1993, he
said, as the largest part of the IMF stand-by loan which is conditional upon
Russia getting economic reform back on track.
Mr Shokhin hoped the July meeting of the heads of state of the Group of
Seven industrialised nations in Tokyo would agree a further Dollars 4bn
fund, proposed by the US, to assist with the privatisation process.
Privatisation of small, medium and large enterprises is proceeding rapidly
in Russia, although the newly privatised companies desperately lack capital
and management expertise. Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister in
charge of privatisation, admitted at the weekend that he had been 'very
concerned' before the referendum that reform and privatisation would both
fail.
But since the referendum, all those regions that had refused to sell off
state companies through auctions had now agreed to do so. 'By June 1 not one
region will stand out against the government's programme,' he said.
The price of the privatisation vouchers, which had sunk below Rbs4,000, had
risen to Rbs5090, and the federal parliament had given up attempts to stop
the privatisation process, he said, 'not because they have become supporters
of privatisation, but because they know they would lose support if they
tried to stop it'.
Mr Chubais also thought further reforms of the Russian cabinet were
imminent, with radical officials likely to be promoted in order to encourage
reform.
However, Mr Shokhin sounded a note of caution on reform when he expressed
some scepticism over the agreement between the bank and the government
because of the difficulties of controlling credit emission from the central
bank under the chairmanship of Mr Victor Gerashchenko. Mr Gerashchenko has
recently commented that the agreement to limit credit expansion to 30 per
cent in the current quarter and a further 30 per cent in the second half of
this year could not succeed.
The deputy prime minister also said that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, is to go to Copenhagen from June 19 to 21 for talks with the
leaders of the European Community on a possible agreement between Russia and
the EC on what Moscow alleges are discriminatory practices against its
products. Mr Georgy Gabunia, the deputy trade minister said that the EC had
designated Russia as a state-aided economy in which large subsidies were
paid on its goods.
However, the Russian side will argue that prices have largely been freed and
that it is inconsistent to end discrimination against the Baltic states -
whose economies are still substantially state-owned - while retaining them
against Russia and other former Soviet republics.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Protest fear over Bonn's asylum bill vote

DEMONSTRATORS are expected to gather in Bonn today and tomorrow to protest
against the German parliament's plan to change the constitution and curb the
influx of asylum seekers.
An additional 3,000 policemen and border guards will patrol the city to
prevent the protest turning to violence ahead of the parliamentary vote, due
tomorrow.
The government said that it feared trouble after learning that extreme
left-wings groups had vowed to prevent the parliament from voting. Some
10,000 people are expected to take part in the demonstration. The largest
protest action will be headed by Support Action for Asylum, an umbrella
organisation gathering together various church groups, the Greens, the small
German Socialist party, and movements against racism.
The demonstrators are protesting against changing article 16 of the German
constitution which grants any refugee the right to seek asylum in the
country.
However, the parliament is expected to vote for an amendment allowing
asylum-seekers to be sent back over the German border to third countries
such as Poland and the Czech republic.
The constitutional amendment, which requires the support of the opposition
Social Democrats (SPD) in parliament, was drawn up after two years of heated
debate over Germany's liberal asylum rights.
Since the beginning of the year, some 150,000 refugees have applied for
asylum. Eighty per cent of the asylum seekers entered Germany from Poland or
the Czech republic.
SPD leaders have appealed to their party's MPs to vote in favour of the
proposal. But a strong minority of left-wing deputies is fiercely objecting
to the amendment.
The SPD parliamentary whip, Mr Peter Struck, says there are about 100 rebels
among the SPD's 259 deputies in parliament.
This is too few to block the bill, for which Chancellor Helmut Kohl needs
only about 45 SPD votes.
They argue that countries such as Poland and the Czech republic do not have
the infrastructure to house large numbers of refugees and lack the legal
environment to ensure fair asylum proceedings.
Germany and Poland recently signed an agreement to allow refugees to be sent
back across the border.

MR Martin Bangemann, European Commission vice president, yesterday
criticised European governments for limiting spending on drugs. He warned
that measures to hold down costs would affect drug companies' profitability
and their ability to develop new medicines.
'Departments of health are waging an increasingly desperate struggle to
control costs and the pharmaceutical industry is their favourite target,
even though it accounts for only a small proportion of health care
spending,' he said. This year the German, British and Italian governments
have introduced or proposed measures to rein in drug spending.
Mr Bangemann told the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries'
Associations conference in Salzburg that if companies continued to negotiate
separate deals with governments, such as agreeing to invest in a country in
exchange for high prices, they would not benefit from the single market.
This was a vicious circle involving both companies and governments.

FT  25 MAY 93 / 'Healthy' ERM could still grow into Emu: Lionel Barber
assesses EC finance ministers' steps likely to restore confidence in
currency system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO TALK of a new realism permeating the affairs of the European Community
may be premature. But after two days of talks in a former sanitorium in
Kolding, Denmark, over the weekend, EC finance ministers took several steps
likely to rebuild confidence in the European exchange rate mechanism, while
keeping the more ambitious project of European Monetary Union in their
sights.
Mr Horst Kohler, German state secretary of finance, picked up the meeting's
central theme: the need to regain credibility. He doubted whether a majority
of EC member states would be ready for monetary union by 1997, the earliest
date set down in the Maastricht treaty, and he served notice that Germany
would not support moves to water down the targets on inflation, budget
deficits and government debt - the so-called 'convergence criteria'.
Without as much as a whimper, all present agreed. Mr Jacques Delors,
European Commission president and one of the architects of Emu, declared
that there was no need for change.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, who just a week ago
predicted that member states would have to alter the targets if the
recession continued into 1994, said he had been misunderstood.
'There is not going to be a fast-track to monetary union,' said an EC
official. 'It's going to be a long hard slog.'
Clearly a funny thing happened on the way to Kolding. There are two likely
explanations: one is that ministers are desperate to capitalise on the
Danish Yes in the (second) referendum last week on the Maastricht treaty,
and are well aware that loose talk about amending its provisions would scare
the markets.
Just as important is the influence of the two high-level official
investigations into the exchange rate crisis last autumn which led to the
forced departure of the British pound and the Italian lira from the ERM,
followed by devaluations of the peseta, the escudo and the punt.
In a commendable exercise in transparency, the Danish presidency of the EC
won agreement to make public the reports, one by the committee of central
bank governors and one by the EC's monetary committee. Both reject wholesale
reform of the ERM, emphasising instead the need to apply the rules more
rigorously.
By spreading the blame for the crisis, the committees defuse the
Anglo-German row that followed it: the Bonn government is criticised for
financing unification through borrowing, a policy mix which forced up
interest rates and deepened the recession in Europe. The UK is implicitly
rebuked for sticking to an overvalued exchange rate and for failing to raise
interest rates to deter speculators.
The reports' conclusions could have come out of the mouth of the Bundesbank:
each member state must first put its own economic house in order, and no
member state has an obligation to intervene in the markets to prop up weaker
currencies.
Ministers supported a call for an 'early warning system' whereby the
monetary committee or central bankers would use confidential economic
indicators to strengthen the case for a member state to devalue.
The call for frank, if confidential, discussions prior to devaluation may be
easier said than done, according to an EC official involved. As was evident
during the crisis last September, ministers and officials prefer to use code
rather than spell out the case for a general realignment in the ERM.
Yet Kolding's achievement was to produce a consensus on the ERM - even among
the weaker currency members such as Spain and Portugal and those outside the
system such as the UK and Italy. This consensus is an essential building
block for Emu, said one EC official.
Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer and an outspoken critic of
the Bundesbank, conceded that the German central bank had fulfilled its
obligations in support of sterling in the run-up to Black Wednesday.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Hoover confirms closure of cleaner factory at Dijon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOOVER said yesterday it had decided to go ahead with its controversial plan
to close its vacuum cleaner factory at Dijon, France, and move production to
Scotland.
The decision, announced in Paris by Mr Gerald Kamman, president of Hoover
Europe, follows a sweeping management review of the company's operations
designed to cut costs and restore profit.
The production transfer, which will create about 400 jobs at Hoover's plant
at Cambuslang, near Glasgow, was first disclosed in January. It enraged the
French government and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, who accused Britain of poaching jobs.
Mr Kamman said last month he was reconsidering the move and would be
prepared to cancel it if he judged that it did not enhance the viability of
the company. He said then that the Dijon plant was close to a profit on
manufacturing, but that Hoover's sales in France had fallen sharply this
year.
Mr Kamman was appointed head of Hoover's European operations and its UK
business two months ago after Mr Bill Foust, his predecessor, was dismissed
over the company's free flights promotion fiasco.
The planned closure, to be staged over the rest of this year, will mean the
loss of about 600 of the 705 jobs at the Dijon plant. Mr Kamman said
yesterday Hoover had drawn up a 'social plan' costing FFr185m (Pounds 21.9m)
to cover the redundancies.
Hoover said yesterday that the terms of the move to Cambuslang, for which
the British government has offered Pounds 2.5m in regional aid, had not been
changed. The company was still considering further cost-cutting measures.
Hoover Europe lost Dollars 67.1m last year, including a Dollars 55m
restructuring charge, on sales of Dollars 501.9m.
Maytag, the company's US parent, lost Dollars 315m last year and a further
Dollars 10.5m in the first quarter of this year.

FT  25 MAY 93 / EC draws up jobs strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community could begin to roll back unemployment by such
measures as reducing employers' social security contributions to cut labour
costs and more sharing-out of jobs. This is the main conclusion of the
'Community-wide framework for employment' the European Commission is set to
adopt tomorrow.
The framework policy, approved in its essentials yesterday by the chefs de
cabinet of the Commission, puts forward a jobs-crisis agenda for the next
three presidencies of the EC, to the end of 1994.
It starts from the premise that a return to the high economic and
productivity growth of the late 1980s 'would still leave the Community well
short of a target such as 5 per cent unemployment'. The EC now has 17.4m
jobless, 10.3 per cent of the workforce.
But the Commission confidently says 'there is sufficient evidence and
experience to suggest that ways of, at least, improving the situation can be
found - over and above those which can result from higher levels of economic
growth.'
The proposed strategy, likely to be near the top of the agenda at next
month's Copenhagen summit of EC heads of government, is the first EC-wide
attempt to deal with structural unemployment. It focuses on ways of creating
more labour-intensive growth.
The document notes that while Belgium and the Netherlands have similar
labour productivity, the Dutch provide jobs for 10 per cent more people of
working age. The Danes earn less per head in real terms than western
Germans, but have a much higher portion of their people at work.
'You can have labour-intensive work while still providing a highly
competitive product,' said one senior Brussels official. 'It's a question of
how you share a given volume of employment between people.'
The Commission is at pains to stress that its strategy is consonant with the
'economic and social aims' of EC member states. It would 'not exploit
workers in a weak position in the labour market, or inhibit the development
of the high value-added, knowledge-based jobs which will be the key to
future competitiveness.'
But it suggests employers' 'social contributions' - averaging 15 per cent of
wages across the EC but varying between member states from virtually nil to
over 20 per cent - affect job creation. The five main points of its
framework therefore call for: 'reducing labour costs. . . notably by
modifying the incidence of taxation systems'; new working time structures to
share out jobs; 'adaptability at the workplace' and 'new forms of work
organisation'; training systems to bring more people into work and
'anticipate structural change'; and exploitation of 'new areas of work' such
as the environment.

<TEXT>
MR Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, is to launch a FFr40bn (Pounds
4.73bn) bond issue to finance job-creation measures and speed up public
works to help revive the economy and cut France's 10.7 per cent unemployment
rate.
After talks with employers and unions in recent days, the prime minister has
decided to use the parliamentary debate on the budget today to announce the
'acceleration' of measures to raise employment, which he had intended to
leave until the autumn.
The measures could include an extra FFr2bn to keep young people in work
experience schemes, in addition to the FFr7bn payroll tax cuts in the May 10
budget and accelerated spending of FFr1.3bn already pledged for public
works.
According to French television, the bond will be convertible into shares in
newly privatised companies. The privatisation plan is scheduled to be
discussed at a cabinet meeting tomorrow and sent to parliament in the
autumn.
Mr Philippe Auberger, the parliamentary budget rapporteur, welcomed the
government's intention to fund a job-creating initiative through a special
bond issue. The government could thereby take advantage of the fall in the
cost of money - which continued its decline yesterday when the Bank of
France cut its intervention rate from 7.75 per cent to 7.5 per cent and the
five-to-10-day lending facility from 8.75 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Mr
Auberger said investors might hurry to subscribe to a new loan before rates
fell any further.
Economists are now waiting to see whether the commercial banks will follow
the Bank of France's lead by cutting base rates as they did two weeks ago -
from 9.25 per cent to 9 per cent - following the last cut in official
interest rates.
Yesterday's cut means that the cost of France's official short-term facility
has fallen from 12 per cent to 8.5 per cent under the new government.
So far, lower interest rates have had little impact on the economy, which is
plagued by sluggish consumer spending and industrial investment. Norway's
central bank yesterday announced a cut in the key overnight lending rate to
7.50 per cent from 7.75, the 12th cut this year.

A single currency and European monetary union are opposed by 60 per cent of
Germans, according to the latest Eurobarometer poll on EC opinion, which
more predictably shows 65 per cent of Danes and 60 per cent of British
against, writes David Gardner in Brussels.
Overall, however, 52 per cent of Europeans favour a single currency, with 38
per cent against.
However, there are big majorities for a common foreign and security policy -
averaging 66 per cent to 19 per cent across the EC - and wide support (77
per cent against 13 per cent), everywhere except Denmark, for a common
defence regime. Majority opinion in all countries except Denmark, Germany
and Greece, moreover, supports EC military intervention in Bosnia to
establish peace.
Support for the EC has nonetheless dropped since the twice-yearly
Eurobarometer last appeared in November.
Maastricht is supported by 41 per cent, with 24 per cent against and 35 per
cent undecided. More strikingly, 47 per cent are unhappy about democracy in
the EC. The Commission withheld the poll results until the Danish referendum
on Maastricht was over.

FRENCH Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is to announce a job-creating package
to help bring down France's 10.7 per cent unemployment rate, possibly funded
out of a special state loan.
After talks with employers and unions in recent days, the prime minister has
decided to use today's parliamentary debate on the budget to announce the
'acceleration' of measures to boost employment which he had intended to
leave until the autumn.
According to La Tribune newspaper, the measures could include an extra

accelerated spending of the extra FFr1.3bn already pledged for public works.

EUROPE must develop an independent army to tackle security threats on the
continent rather than rely on the US to come to the rescue, Mr James
Dobbins, outgoing US ambassador to the European Community, said yesterday.
In a reference to recent divisions within the alliance over how to respond
to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, Mr Dobbins said: 'The American people,
in my judgment, are unlikely to support a long-term US troop commitment to
Europe if they see its purpose as protecting rich, prosperous Europeans
against two-bit outlaws like Serbia.'
Mr Dobbins, who was speaking in Brussels at the Centre for European Policy
Studies, acknowledged his speech was drafted before the latest alliance
moves to end divisions over how to respond in Bosnia. But they also mark a
shift in thinking in some US circles toward a sharing of burdens in the
post-cold-war era, between the Nato alliance and an emerging European
defence identity, probably the Western European Union, particularly where
there was no vital US interest involved.
Mr Dobbins also urged the EC to integrate Russia, along with other east
European countries into a new Euro-Atlantic community.
He suggested parallels between Russia's position in 1993 to Germany's
position in 1945.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Ministers consider flotation to fund tunnel rail link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering a plan to fund the Pounds 2.5bn rail link
between London and the Channel tunnel by inviting the public to buy shares
in the project through a stock market flotation.
The plan could end the long delay in starting the project by overcoming the
government's difficulties in raising the finance necessary for construction.
Last week the delay led to diplomatic embarrassment when President Francois
Mitterrand of France marked the opening of a high-speed rail link on the
French side of the Channel tunnel by deriding the lack of progress on the
British side.
If the plan goes ahead, the most likely timing of the flotation will be
around September 1995 - after the government has obtained the necessary
legislation, but before construction work begins.
This means private sector investors will run the risk of seeing their
returns diminished by unexpected increases in construction costs, so
bringing comparisons with Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel concessionaire,
which was floated on the stock market in 1987.
The government's advisers are likely to claim, however, that lessons have
been learned from the cost runs that have hit Eurotunnel, and that the
construction risks involved in building a railway are in any case far fewer.
The flotation plan emerged yesterday as the Department of Transport opened
discussions with the private sector about ways of involving private capital
in building the link.
The project cannot be funded entirely by the private sector because it is
not sufficiently profitable.
The department has therefore sent out a consultation paper to banks,
construction companies and other institutions looking atthe options for
funding the project jointly. One option explored in the paper is that the
government could say what contribution it was prepared to make and then let
private sector companies compete to take the project over at an early stage
of the planning process, towards the end of this year.
But an alternative plan explored in the paper is for the public sector to
hold on to the project through the design and legislative phases until
construction is ready to begin in September 1995, and then float the project
on the stock market with a government grant big enough to turn it into
profit.
A possible vehicle for the flotation would be Union Railways, the British
Rail subsidiary in charge of the project.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Spending review vital, says Major: PM stresses need for cuts
but will uphold election pledges on welfare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night sought to calm the political storm over the
Treasury's scrutiny of the welfare state with an assurance that its
conclusions would respect 'the spirit as well as the letter' of his general
election manifesto.
In a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times during which he
rejected attacks on his leadership style and left open the possibility of an
early cabinet reshuffle, the prime minister defended the spending review as
essential to allow the government to 'save where we can, to spend where we
must'.
Speaking last night in 10 Downing Street, Mr Major also acknowledged that
the looming summer battle over next year's public spending total has sparked
a cabinet debate on whether to maintain for another year the formal pay rise
ceiling applied to public sector workers.
Extension of the present 1.5 per cent ceiling is being sought by a number of
Whitehall spending departments, but the idea is vigorously opposed by the
Treasury. The prime minister would say only: 'We will be discussing that in
the very near future.' Mr Major confirmed the fundamental nature of the
expenditure review - focused initially on health, social security, the home
office and education - being carried out by Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the Treasury, commenting: 'Don't make any mistake about that.
We will have to select priorities.'
But he refused to be drawn on reports in recent days suggesting that Mr
Portillo wants to combine a range of new charges in the National Health
Service with closer targeting of social security benefits. Although clearly
irritated at some of the reports, he said that ruling out publicly on a
'one-by-one' basis changes in any individual benefit or service would
undermine the review.
Mr Major insisted that the government's decision to examine the principle of
universal welfare benefits was not designed to restrict the benefits to
those reliant on income support. His comments came as Whitehall officials
pointed out that suggestions the government planned to tax child benefit
ignored the immense complexities of such a move under an independent tax
regime for husbands and wives.
Acknowledging the concern of people - particularly the elderly - whose
income keeps them not far above the social security net, the prime minister
said: 'We do have a particular concern for people on modest incomes who have
worked through their lives to provide for themselves rather than depend upon
the state. What we are not in the business of doing is sweeping away
necessary spending. But we can't let the total grow faster than the economy
can support.'
Clearly stung by the political uproar, he added: 'We are emph-atically not
targeting special reductions on the poorest and most vulnerable members of
society. We have a responsibility to the poorest and most vulnerable members
and we will meet that.'
Pressed on the calls from ministers and backbench MPs for an early cabinet
shake-up which could see Mr Norman Lamont's departure as chancellor Mr Major
replied: 'In due course, I have no doubt I will (reshuffle) but when that
will be, I have no intention of telling anybody.'
In a clear reference to the growing attacks on Mr Lamont, he added: 'I will
tell you now - neither now nor at any stage in the future are my reshuffles
going to be preceded by assassinations of my colleagues. When, and if, I
reshuffle my cabinet, I hope the first that anyone will hear about it is the
day on which it begins.'
The prime minister dismissed charges from sections of the Tory party that he
had not offered decisive leadership. He had stuck with a firm
counter-inflation strategy when the 'easy option' would have been to relax
policy. He had also rejected the escape route of a referendum on the
Maastricht treaty despite the rebellion in his own party.
Mr Portillo's review was not simply a reaction to the growing borrowing
requirement. Citing longer-term pressures on expenditure, Mr Major said: 'We
have got to look across the whole range of public expenditure to see where
it is possible to trim back in order to meet the essential growth areas.
That would have needed doing whether or not we had a deficit.'
Pressed on the government's pledges in last year's manifesto to maintain and
increase in line with inflation the universal state pension and child
benefit, he said: 'We are sticking to our manifesto pledges - the spirit as
well as the letter, of course.'
A fuller account of this interview with John Major will appear in tomorrow's
FT. In it, the prime minister sets out his agenda for change in the European
Community and addresses the question: are you a consolidator or a radical
Conservative?

FT  25 MAY 93 / Inquiry wants overhaul of EBRD loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE audit committee of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
yesterday urged the bank to achieve 'greater efficiency', in response to the
slower than expected rate of loans and investment being made.
It urged the bank, which was set up to stimulate the growth of the private
sector in eastern Eur-ope, to introduce new budget disciplines, so
executives cannot offset overspending in some areas by underspending in
others.
The question of whether budgetary allocations should be transferable was the
focus of a meeting yesterday of the bank's directors, who are officials
representing the banks and agencies that own the bank.
The board meeting also confirmed the appointment of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountants, to assist the audit committee in its investigation into whether
the Pounds 55.5m spent on furnishing the bank's City of London headquarters
was excessive. It emerged yesterday that the Swedish finance minister, Ms
Anne Wibble, has called a meeting of finance officials of the leading
industrial countries to review the audit committee's investigation into the
bank's cost controls.
Ms Wibble called the meeting in her capacity as chair of the bank's board of
governors. It is being hosted in London today by the UK Treasury and will be
chaired by Mr Claes de Neergaard, chairman of the EBRD's audit committee. Mr
Jacques Attali, the bank's president, has not been invited.
A Treasury official said yesterday the British government was pleased with
the way the audit committee had 'got stuck into' the task of reviewing
financial controls at the bank.
Mr de Neergaard presented to the board meeting a report on the audit
committee's work on improving budget controls and reviewing the spending of
the Pounds 55.5m.
The report noted that Mr Cedric du Monceau has taken over on a temporary
basis as director of the budget from Mr Pierre Pissaloux, who remains the
director in charge of Mr Attali's cabinet. The bank is looking for a new
permanent budget director.
Mr de Neergaard's report said the audit committee was concerned at the 'very
low' level of commitments and disbursements of loans and investments by the
bank in the first quarter of 1993. It 'requested management's opinion as to
whether it would be possible to reach even the lower end of the targeted
commitments (of Ecu 2bn - Pounds 1.7bn) for the year as a whole'.
As a result of this 'low output', Mr de Neergaard urged the bank to place
'particular emphasis . . . on achievement of greater efficiency in merchant
banking and development banking operations; the scrutiny of non-operational
expenditure; the reduction of the ratio of consultants to permanent staff .
. . and the high proportion of centrally managed overheads'.
Before the board meeting there had been discussion between the audit
committee and the bank's finance department on whether the department should
give a commitment to restrict the bank's ability to use underspending in
some areas to offset overspending elsewhere without seeking board approval.
Some bank executives have been concerned that a reduction in their ability
to transfer budget allocations would place excessive constraints on them.
But Mr de Neergaard's report says: 'Committee members believed that, whilst
there had been a need for considerable flexibility in the bank's early
stages, this need was now less.'

FT  25 MAY 93 / McGowan to resign as chief executive at Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of Britain's best known management double-acts will be dissolved today
when Mr Brian McGowan announces that he is to resign as chief executive of
Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate.
Mr McGowan, 48, will tell shareholders at the annual meeting that he will be
stepping down at the end of the year.
He is to be replaced by Mr Roger Carr, the managing director, who has headed
Williams' so-called hit squad, which is sent into every company Williams has
acquired. Mr Nigel Rudd will remain as executive chairman.
There had been no hint from the group until now that Mr McGowan was about to
break the successful partnership he has had with Mr Rudd since they acquired
a controlling stake in the company at the end of 1981.
However, Mr McGowan had privately made clear for some time that he was
considering retiring, though it is understood he first told Mr Rudd two
months ago about his intention to resign at the year-end.
While both men have proved to be expert in identifying undervalued
companies, Mr McGowan has concentrated more on the mechanics of takeover
bids.
Last night a friend of his said the company had not made a substantial bid
for the past 18 months. 'It is time for the group to grow organically. As
the acquisition man, he decided it was time for a change.' It is understood
there was no acrimony between the two men.
Mr McGowan is to remain chairman of Burnfield, a small industrial equipment
company, which will only take up part of his time. He is to pursue his
private interests such as fishing.
Mr McGowan and Mr Rudd have transformed Williams from a small, lossmaking
engineering group - in effect a shell company - into a diversified
conglomerate which last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 161m and is a
member of the FT-SE 100 share index.
In a string of substantial acquisitions, they have bought such well-known
businesses as Yale locks, Swish curtain rails, Rawlplug, Polycell and Valor
Heating.
At the end of last year, Mr McGowan owned 766,000 Williams shares, worth
Pounds 2.5m at yesterday's closing share price of 320p, which was 2p lower
on the day. He also had options over a further 2.2m shares. His 1992
remuneration was Pounds 670,000.

FT  25 MAY 93 / Devaluation of sterling gives sharp boost to UK exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S visible trade deficit with countries outside the European
Community narrowed again last month, amid fresh signs that the devaluation
of sterling has given a sharp boost to UK exports.
In April the value of imports from countries outside the EC exceeded the
value of exports by Pounds 831m. However, the overall deficit was Pounds 98m
less than in March, underlining the trend of the last three months which has
seen the trade gap narrowing.
The better news on the trade balance was underlined by a sharp growth in
export volumes in the last three months. The Central Statistical Office
reported yesterday that total UK export volumes - excluding oil and erratic
items, such as ships and precious stones - had grown by 6 1/2 per cent
compared to the previous 3 months. By contrast, imports rose by only 2 per
cent over the same period.
Yesterday's figures were seen as a further indication that the devaluation
of sterling is helping to promote economic recovery through the exports
boost.
On the foreign exchange markets, sterling received a boost from the trade
figures following its 4 pfennig rise against the Germany currency last week.
The pound closed in London at DM2.5125, up half a pfennig on the day.
The CSO's figures indicated that, despite a sharp increase in March, the
prices of exported goods returned to their levels at the beginning of the
year. This implies that exporters have not used the devaluation of the
currency to the very low levels seen in the spring as an opportunity to mark
up prices.
The CSO's figures also indicate that UK exporters are winning a greater
share of markets outside Europe, as those in the EC continue to fall into
recession.
For the first time since May 1992, the UK registered a trade surplus with
North America in April. The UK is also increasing the volume of its exports
to developing economies, in a trend which has continued unbroken since
November of last year.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at SG Warburg, said the figures underlined
that the UK's Gross Domestic Product would show an increase in the second
quarter of this year. 'The UK is winning market share even though economies
in the rest of Europe are slowing down,' he said.
Since the beginning of the year, the CSO has not provided data for UK trade
with European Community countries because a new system of measuring intra-EC
trade is being introduced.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Business Post plans flotation for July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS POST, the UK's biggest independent parcel and express mail company,
is planning a flotation in early July, expected to capitalise it at more
than Pounds 50m.
It is the latest in a long line of public offers, which include RPC Group,
the rigid plastic packaging company, and Carpetright of London, to be
brought forward before the mid-July sale of the government's remaining BT
shares.
Business Post was formed in 1971 by Mr Peter Kane, chairman, who along with
family trusts, owns 85 per cent.
He was joined three years later by his brother Mr Michael Kane, managing
director, who owns the remaining 15 per cent.
Around 25 per cent of the new share capital will be placed with institutions
by Baring Brothers and UBS.
The group expects to raise up to Pounds 15m, of which Pounds 3m will go to
the Kane brothers.
A further Pounds 12m is to be invested in three new national hubs, in
Manchester, Bristol and Leeds, bringing the total number of hubs to 14.
The latest results show revenue rose to Pounds 33m at the end of March 1993
with a forecast of Pounds 44m by the end of 1994.
The group made operating profits of Pounds 3.2m at the end of March 1992.
The Kane brothers have recruited Mr Dudley Fishburn, the Conservative MP, as
a non-executive director and plan to appoint a second.
The group is expected to concentrate on expansion within its parcels
business.

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Banesto to scrap payout and seek
New York listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANESTO, the Spanish commercial bank which recently outlined plans to raise
Pta130bn (Dollars 1.04bn) in new capital, told a tumultuous shareholders'
meeting at the weekend that it would not be paying a final dividend for
1992.
Mr Mario Conde, Banesto chairman, said he would follow a very conservative
policy on dividends and provisions for this year, but promised shareholders
the bank would establish open dividend guidelines for this year and 1994
soon.
Banesto has already declared a zero profit for the first quarter of 1992,
transferring its income to provisions to cover bad loans, which have
rocketed as a result of the slump in the Spanish economy in the last six
months.
The bank paid Pta205 overall for 1991 and has so far paid an interim Pta95
for 1992. Analysts had been expecting a sharply lower final dividend, given
Banesto's ambitious cash call, a 55 per cent fall in net profits at the
parent last year and the likelihood that the Spanish recession will damage
most bank income statements this year.
Mr Conde, who said Banesto would seek a listing on the New York Stock
Exchange after its capital increase, spent most of the meeting pressing the
3,000 shareholders present to support the plans. 'I am asking you to
sacrifice today's profits for reasonable expectations for tomorrow,' he
said.
Mr Conde, personally, and a group of investors led by J. P. Morgan, the US
investment bank, are committed to big investments in the bank during the
raising of new capital and Mr Conde was at pains to assure shareholders that
the operation was not speculative.
He said J. P. Morgan's Corsair fund, which includes leading US institutions,
had agreed to hold the investment it would pick up in Banesto during the
capital increase for at least two years. The intention was to hold the
shares for up to five years, he said. The three-stage capital increase will
raise Banesto's BIS capital adequacy ratio from 9.3 per cent to 12 per cent.
Shareholders approved the capital increase and the appointment of Mr Roberto
Mendoza, J. P. Morgan vice-chairman, to the Banesto board. In spite of Mr
Conde's efforts to sway shareholders, it is understood that the bank and its
new partners would be satisfied if they managed to raise even half the
Pta130bn they have set their sights on.

FT  24 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are several ways of going global in the airline industry. British
Airways' expensive strategy has been to buy minority stakes in other
national airlines and develop closer operational links. But the proposed
integration of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines Systems,
Swissair and Austrian Airlines suggests another way forward. The four
medium-sized carriers are discussing how to pool their resources to create a
fleet of more than 270 aircraft. This would make the merged airline the
second largest European carrier after BA and the seventh biggest in the
world.
The theory is attractive. The proposed integration, though, would be fraught
with operational difficulties making many doubt whether the airline will
ever get off the ground. The airlines have declared their determination to
set up a jointly-owned company with a unified management and balance sheet.
But the trade unions are already questioning which national hubs will suffer
as a result. The complexities of unifying operating systems and corporate
cultures would be immense. The venture would also have to leap some high
regulatory hurdles. Still, SAS is itself the product of the merger of three
airlines, and its history highlights the possibilities.
If the venture does proceed, BA would certainly face far stiffer competition
in Europe. Those with the most to worry about, however, would be Air France
and Lufthansa. Both carriers suffer from high operating costs. Moreover,
neither has yet charted a viable route to a global future.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Economic Notebook: China's unique path towards the free
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S leaders call their approach to reform the 'socialist market economy'
or 'socialism with Chinese characteristics'. This is an attempt to give
ideological grounding to the communist party's maintenance of firm political
control while switching from central economic planning to the free market.
However, there are a number of ways in which the rapidly growing Chinese
economy really does have distinguishing characteristics from other reforming
countries.
First of all, there is its sheer size. The World Bank's exchange rate
conversion methods give China a per capita GNP of Dollars 370 (Pounds 240)
in 1990, the latest year for which figures are available. But figures from
the United Nations International Comparison Program, based on purchasing
power parities, give per capita GDP as Dollars 1,950. This would make China
the world's second biggest economy, larger than Japan but well behind the
US. The International Monetary Fund will shortly publish similar statistics,
though it is understood to put China's per capita GDP at about Dollars
1,300, ranking the economy among larger European countries.
The significance of such figures should not be overdone. China is still a
low income country with a huge population. Professor Nicholas Lardy of the
University of Washington, Seattle says that if per capita output continued
to grow at four times the pace of the US, it would be nearly 30 years before
the economy's size surpassed that of the US. If the early boost given by
reforms to productivity wears off, it would not pass the US until the middle
of the 21st century. 'On a per capita basis China would not catch up to the
US until the end of the 22nd century,' Prof Lardy writes in International
Economic Insights.
Though China's growth has many similarities with that of the four 'dragons'
 -Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan - Professor Lardy argues that
China will not become a newly industrialized country in the sense of growing
per capita income leading fairly rapidly to developed, high income status.
However, Prof Lardy notes: 'In terms of economic impact, China could soon
become the dominant player in Asia.'
Deng Xiaoping's open-door policies have produced export growth rates to
which countries such as India at present only aspire. China is uniquely
placed to have a big impact on the region - and the world - because of the
scale of growth of its imports and exports in periods, such as at present,
when a renewed push for reform triggers rapid economic expansion. The
numbers are big. The Asian Development Bank projects China's exports and
imports this year at nearly Dollars 80bn each.
Chinese import growth opens new markets for exports from Asian and other
countries. But its growing industrial export capacity is replacing that of
its neighbours, and its exports of low-technology labour-intensive products
such as toys and shoes are capturing significant shares of the world market.
Moreover, its reforms are drawing large flows of funds from the region,
partly due to another unique characteristic: the diaspora of well-off ethnic
Chinese abroad keen to make profits in the motherland, and in particular the
existence of Hong Kong as an entrepot of trade, investment, technology and
management skill.
While the scale of China's potential distinguishes it from other countries
in the eyes of foreigners, size and its external impact are not what China
means by emphasising the singular nature of its reforms. It is seeking a
middle way between capitalism and socialism. For political survival, the
communist party is trying to achieve market-led prosperity without the
social disruption of the former Soviet bloc and the political pressures on
reformers in the Indian sub-continent.
Unchallenged political control has meant that unlike the east Europeans,
China's leaders have been able to adopt a gradualist and experimental
approach to reform, described by former premier Zhao Ziyang as 'crossing a
river by feeling stones on the river bed'. They started with some
advantages: a narrow industrial base, a high savings rate, a decentralised
provincial system. Starting from this base, piecemeal reform had substantial
benefits. Initial agricultural reforms reduced innate fears of basic
shortages and created a new store of wealth as well as available labour
which assisted subsequent reform. Most importantly, rather than attempting
privatisation of loss-making state industries, China has fostered the
development of non-state industry. This has dramatically cut the state's
role in the economy, and has put competitive pressures on state industries.
Mr Cyril Lin of St Antony's College, Oxford, notes in a recent paper 'the
overwhelming importance of the market mechanism in China today: only 12 per
cent of total industrial output was subject to planning in 1992, and is
expected to fall to 7 per cent this year'. He says only 25 per cent of
investment is centrally planned, and 83 per cent of sales are through the
market.
China, says Mr Lin, is unique among former Soviet-type economies in that it
has excess aggregate supply. 'An overstocked supply of consumer goods is
chasing recalcitrant buyers.' By contrast, countries in the former Soviet
bloc face declining output coupled with instability, making it impossible
for them to be gradualist. For them debates about the value of shock therapy
compared with China's evolutionary approach are merely academic, as Mr Lin
notes. Economists seeking direct parallels with China which could help the
former Soviet bloc are fairly hard pressed to do so.
Unique though it may be, China cannot escape the need for sound economic
management. It needs to cut the budget deficit by curbing losses and
subsidies of state-owned enterprises. Financial reforms, including a greater
a role for interest rates, are urgently required. With these deficiencies in
macro-economic control - the credit gates are either fully open or fully
closed - it is quite likely that China will continue to lurch through
boom-bust cycles. However, the fluctuations should become less violent, and
they seem unlikely to halt either growth or reform unless there is serious
political turmoil or severe external shock.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Investors turn up their noses at food shares: Guy de
Jonquieres explains a change of recipe as markets look for defensive stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK markets have long viewed food manufacturing as a safe haven in harsh
economic times. Yet despite deepening recession in continental Europe and
uncertain recoveries in the US and Britain, many branded food stocks on both
sides of the Atlantic have recently sunk to low levels.
Last week, prices of European industry leaders, including Cadbury Schweppes,
Unilever and United Biscuits fell further after Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman
of BSN, said France's biggest food company was ready to cut prices to hold
its market share of difficult markets.
How difficult is clear from the 5.7 per cent drop in BSN's first-quarter
sales. In the same period, Unilever's operating profits stagnated in Europe
and North America, while at Nestle, the world's largest food company, sales
volumes rose only 1 per cent.
This gloomy news comes less than two months after Philip Morris, the world's
biggest tobacco company, rocked confidence in the power of consumer brands
by slashing the US price of Marlboro cigarettes to keep market share.
There is growing evidence that the industry is gripped by fundamental
forces, which augur yet fiercer competition and further structural change.
The recent worldwide fixation among consumers of all income groups with
price and value is viewed by many manufacturers as a permanent trend.
One reason is the widespread expectation that economic recovery will be
sluggish. 'In earlier recessions, people thought that when it was all over,
they would board an express train again,' says Mr John Campbell, an industry
analyst with County NatWest. 'That is not their perception this time.'
But consumers are also becoming more discriminating as they are bombarded
with an ever wider choice of products by manufacturers seeking growth in
food markets where overall volumes are flat. That is particularly true in
the US, where many product categories are contested by more numerous,
equally-matched companies than in Europe.
In many European countries, by contrast, competition in the food industry is
more often imposed by retailers. As they concentrate into fewer, bigger
groups, with greater buying power and scale economies, they are dictating
terms even to their largest suppliers.
Retail pressure is intensifying at both ends of the market. At the lower
end, hard discounters such as Aldi of Germany have prospered by offering a
narrow line of keenly-priced basic products.
After expanding strongly across the continent in the 1980s, Aldi and other
European discounters have begun moving into the UK.
Simultaneously, many continental supermarkets are intent on emulating the
success of British chains such as J. Sainsbury, which earn large profits
from high-quality own-label ranges.
Mr Ian Davis, head of the European consumer industries practice of McKinsey,
the management consultants, argues that own-label pricing is fast setting
the standard to which branded products must compete.
Both trends - also evident in slightly different forms in the US - threaten
to squeeze the profit margins of branded food manufacturers long after
recession is over. How can manufacturers fight back?
Recent industry developments point to four broad answers:
Accelerated restructuring and cost-cutting to improve margins and price
competitiveness. Such initiatives have recently been taken by companies
including BSN, Procter &amp; Gamble of the US and PepsiCo's Frito-Lay snacks
division.
More rigorous weeding out of weak businesses and a tighter focus on those
with solid market positions. Though some companies, including Cadbury
Schweppes, Unilever and United Biscuits, took action in the 1980s, others
have been much slower.
For instance, Nestle's towering strength in chocolate and soluble coffee
masks mediocre performances by several other businesses in which it is a
marginal player. The company recently signalled that it may start making
disposals, possibly by swapping assets with competitors.
More selective brand support. Cadbury has halved to six the number of brands
at Trebor Bassett, its sugar confectionery division, to concentrate
resources on the strongest. BSN may soon start axing brands which are not
market leaders.
Speedier innovation. This is the industry's current buzz-phrase, as
manufacturers strive to tempt consumers and earn higher margins by
developing more distinctive new products and variations of existing ones.
However, the exercise has limitations. The cost of marketing new products
continues to rise, and nine out of ten usually fail. Even successes can be a
mixed blessing. Some manufacturers admit that the more new products they
launch, the less loyal consumers are to established brands.
Furthermore, some types of product, such as mineral water and baked beans,
are inherently resistant to innovation.
These trends together point to a more volatile and unpredictable future for
an industry once renowned for its monolithic stability. But are they also a
recipe for sustainable profits?
Many experts agree the answer will depend on manufacturers' success in
cutting costs. But even then, some believe shifts in consumer psychology and
the retail environment will make really high returns increasingly hard to
achieve.
'I think things are going to get a hell of a lot tougher for brands,' says
Mr Davis of McKinsey. 'The real survivors will be those which can prosper on
margins of 5 to 10 per cent, instead of 25 to 30 per cent.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / Exchange paid Rawlins Pounds 348,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER RAWLINS, who resigned in March as chief executive of the London
Stock Exchange was paid Pounds 348,500 last year, 28 per cent more than his
1991-2 remuneration of Pounds 272,500, according to a draft of the
exchange's 1993 annual report.
It says Mr Rawlins's pay included a Pounds 75,000 performance-related bonus
'against the achievement of specific objectives achieved during the year'.
In the previous year, Mr Rawlins received a Pounds 60,000
performance-related bonus. Mr Rawlins resigned after the exchange was widely
criticised in the City for its abortive attempts to set up a computerised
settlement system called Taurus. The project was abandoned on March 11,
forcing the exchange to write off Pounds 75m.
Mr Rawlins said: 'I had one of the biggest jobs in the City and I received
bonuses based on meeting objectives which were set a year ago.'
The draft report and accounts, which cover the year to March 31, 1993, has
been sent to board members but has not yet been approved by the board.
The accounts, due to be published in June, also say Mr Rawlins received
payments following his loss of office. The amount is omitted from the draft,
though it will be included in the final version. The accounts also say Mr
Rawlins was given a Pounds 9,500 car.
A member of the board's remuneration committee, which is chaired by Sir
Anthony Tennant, the retiring chairman of brewing group Guinness, said: 'Mr
Rawlins did a good job at cutting expenses and costs at the exchange . . .
We went out of our way not to give him anything more than was necessary.'
The exchange refused to make any official comment. Other members of the
remuneration committee include Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of brokers
Smith New Court and Donald Brydon, chairman of BZW Investment Management,
Barclays' fund management business. The accounts will also show that the
highest-paid director after Mr Rawlins, who is not specified, received
remuneration of between Pounds 215,000 and Pounds 220,000. In the previous
year, the highest-paid director after Mr Rawlins received between Pounds
115,000 and Pounds 120,000. Mr Andrew Hugh Smith, the exchange's chairman,
received a small fall in remuneration from Pounds 180,600 to Pounds 171,900
last year.

FT  24 MAY 93 / BTR close to Pounds 100m investment in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial holding company, is expected today to announce a Pounds
100m investment in mainland China via its Australian subsidiary, BTR Nylex.
The company is planning a move into the country's bottling industry, which
is failing to meet national demands at a time when beer production is
forecast to overtake that in Australia.
A BTR executive said the company's investment was expected to be at least
ADollars 200m (Pounds 93m) during three to five years. This is a substantial
direct investment in China, where foreign companies' involvement has to date
been modest.
Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, has been travelling in Hong Kong and
southern China during the past week and was expected yesterday to be signing
completion documents in Guangzhou, southern China.
Mr Norman Ireland, the group's new chairman who has just taken over from Sir
Owen Green, BTR's founder chairman, said he was unable to comment until an
announcement had been made to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. He expected a
statement would be made in the UK today.
The deal would fit in with the conglomerate's strategy for Asia - BTR Nylex
last week announced a ADollars 115m deal in Indonesia for its wholly-owned
Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company subsidiary.
When Sir Owen was asked by a shareholder at BTR's annual meeting last week
if he was planning to expand into Asia he reportedly said: 'Watch this
space. If you are patient the question you ask will be answered in a very
full and satisfactory way.' Further signals of an impending deal were picked
up by financial analysts when Carlton United Breweries, a subsidiary of the
Australian Foster's lager group, last week signed a brewery deal in China.
Foster's USDollars 7m (Pounds 5m) agreement with the state-owned Princess
Brewery in Guangdong province, south China, is part of an anticipated
USDollars 140m involvement by the end of this century in a network of
breweries across the country. Foster's expects to sign a further agreement
soon in northern China and anticipates that within five years it will
produce more beer in China than in Australia.
BTR Nylex is a big supplier to Carlton in Australia and the company's
presence in China would be reassuring to the Australian brewer.

FT  24 MAY 93 / HK offers third plan for funding airport: Chinese want to
see project built to schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government has passed to China a third set of options for
financing the colony's HKDollars 165bn (USDollars 21.2bn) airport and
related infrastructure developments. Officials gave no details of the new
financial plan but said it was given to Chinese government officials a few
weeks ago.
The timing of the proposal appears to have coincided with senior Chinese
officials' remarks that they wanted to see the airport built according to
schedule.
Since the first financial plan was given to the Chinese more than a year
ago, the airport has been hostage to an agreed Sino-British solution to Hong
Kong's political development.
News of the new plan comes amid signs of markedly better Anglo-Chinese
co-operation on economic aspects of Hong Kong's development which have
followed the resumption of bilateral talks about the colony's future
political arrangements.
Late last week the Chinese government approved three business franchises
which span June 1997, the date when China resumes sovereignty of Hong Kong.
There are also indications that Beijing may re-enter discussions on the
development of the colony's container port.
Last March the Hong Kong government presented its first financial plan to
Beijing for the colony's planned new airport.
It envisaged a small up-front equity injection into two government
corporations charged with building the airport and its connecting railway,
with the remainder funded by debt. An implicit guarantee to fund
unanticipated cash deficiencies, known as callable equity, was also
promised.
China rejected this financial plan, claiming that it breached a memorandum
of understanding signed in 1991 and placed a financial burden on the
colony's post-1997 government.
Last September, the government proposed substituting most of the debt
allowed for in its first plan with equity.
Beijing rejected this proposal and told the Hong Kong government to think
again.
Tony Walker adds from Beijing: China and Britain agreed to resume discussing
the wider issue of Hong Kong's future later this week after their third
round of discussions in Beijing ended yesterday without apparent
breakthrough.
A joint statement said that a fourth round would be held on May 28-29 in
Beijing. Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador to Beijing and head of his
country's negotiating team, described the atmosphere of the latest round as
good. 'The work we're doing is quite complicated,' he said. His remarks
indicated the two sides may have moved on to more substantial discussions.
The first two rounds were dominated by a Chinese re-statement of 'guiding
principles' for a resolution of the Hong Kong issue.
Beijing has charged that a proposal advanced by Governor Chris Patten for
Legislative Council elections goes beyond understandings reached with London
on Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule in 1997.

EUROPEAN Community envoys visiting Tibet abandoned a planned banquet at the
weekend for their Chinese hosts in protest over the arrest of Tibetan
dissidents.
In Beijing, Ambassador William Friis-Moeller of Denmark, leader of the EC
delegation, said it would have been 'inappropriate' to hold the banquet in
view of the arrests.
Negative publicity associated with the EC mission in Tibet is likely to
prove an embarrassment for the Chinese. Beijing had been seeking a
favourable account of conditions in Tibet to balance recent bad publicity
about alleged human rights abuses there.
The EC mission is preparing a report which will be presented to their
governments by the middle of this week.
The EC envoys had spent about a week in Tibet at the invitation of the
Chinese authorities.
The diplomats were due to hold a reciprocal banquet for Chinese officials in
Lhasa on Saturday before their return to Beijing yesterday.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Clouds over the Clinton plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's economic plan got off to a wonderful start. At
last, it was said, somebody is facing up to the US's long-term economic
problems; somebody is treating the electorate like adults. Since those heady
days in February, support has melted away. Today, Mr Clinton is facing
vociferous congressional opposition, not just from die-hard conservative
Republicans but from moderate Democrats such as Senator David Boren of
Oklahoma, the kind of person whose support ought to be automatic.
'If this president were to get his wish of passing this budget . . . it
would be the surest formula for the destruction of the Democratic party and
any chance he has for reelection,' Mr Boren told the Washington Post last
week. He had just unveiled an alternative budget plan co-sponsored by two
leading Republican senators. As Mr Boren represents an energy-producing
state and is proposing, among other changes, the abolition of the planned
energy tax, the White House tried to dismiss his challenge as mere
special-interest pleading.
But the heart of his objection is that the Clinton deficit-reduction plan
relies too heavily on tax increases and not enough on spending restraint.
Spending 'cuts' represent only about a third of the net deficit reduction
proposed by the White House. Mr Boren is demanding that each dollar in new
taxes should instead be accompanied by at least Dollars 2 in spending cuts,
thus effectively reversing Mr Clinton's priorities. He would more than make
up the revenue lost in scrapping the energy levy by imposing tougher curbs
on 'entitlement' spending, such as federal health programmes.
The Boren amendment is not reckoned to have any chance of passing in the
Senate. But the doubts he raises about the balance between new taxes and
spending cuts are shared by many moderate and conservative Democrats, and by
nearly all Republicans. Even if the beleaguered Clinton plan survives a vote
by the full House of Representatives next week, it will face an uphill
battle in the Senate. Since Democrats have only a 11-to-9 majority on the
crucial Senate finance committee, a single defection by Mr Boren or one of
his colleagues could threaten the legislation.
Polls suggest that Americans accept the need for the modest deficit
reduction proposed in the Clinton plan, which would stabilise the structural
budget deficit (the deficit adjusted for the economic cycle) at about 3 per
cent of gross domestic product. But with the economic recovery still
perceived as fragile, there is great unhappiness about the reliance placed
on new taxes.
The energy tax is unpopular but economically defensible. But it seems
perverse to be calling for a steep increase in the top marginal income tax
rate from 31 per cent to more than 40 per cent (before allowing for state
taxes of 6 to 9 per cent). Businessmen are also worried about a higher
corporate tax rate and the prospect of new payroll taxes to pay for what
promises to be an expensive reform of the healthcare system.
Mr Clinton's plan is meeting stiff opposition because there is nothing in it
that seems likely to stimulate growth or entrepreneurship immediately. The
White House says this is the fault of Senate Republicans, who killed the
Dollars 16bn short-term fiscal stimulus planned for this year, and Democrats
such as Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means committee,
who axed the proposed new investment tax credits.
But neither of these proposals was sound. It made no sense to begin a
programme of deficit reduction by raising the deficit. Investment tax
credits, meanwhile, merely represented the reintroduction of fiscal
loopholes that Mr Rostenkowski's committee had sweated blood to eliminate in
1986.
What Mr Clinton needed was a deficit reduction programme that preserved or,
better still, enhanced existing incentives for work, saving and investment.
This was perfectly possible. Mr Clinton did not need to raise marginal tax
rates on anybody; he could have raised huge sums by restricting concessions
such as mortgage interest relief (available on loans up to Dollars 1m) and
by taxing fringe benefits including generous corporate health plans.
If he still needed revenue he could have proposed a broad value-added tax at
a rate of under 10 per cent. At minimal cost, he could have bought many
Republican votes by indexing the capital gains tax for inflation. The
present 28 per cent rate on nominal gains is high by international standards
and may be impeding entrepreneurial activity.
Why were none of these economically rational options considered? The answer
is simple. Mr Clinton believes higher public investment is necessary to
raise productivity growth. And he wants to reverse what he regards as the
unfair tax policies of the Reagan/Bush years. The plan has to be top-heavy
with new taxes because 'cuts' in old spending programmes are largely offset
by new spending in areas such as education, infrastructure and technology.
It has to raise top rates on the rich so as to be seen as fair.
In reality, the share of federal taxes paid by the wealthy rose in the 1980s
while US manufacturing productivity growth outpaced that of rivals such as
Japan and Germany. In a parliamentary democracy, Mr Clinton's plan would be
invulnerable; that it is not is part of the strength of the US system.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Monday Interview: Flinty foe of market friction - Sir Bryan
Carsberg, UK director-general of fair trading, talks to Hugo Dixon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the UK director-general of fair trading, is making
himself unpopular with large swathes of British industry. This month he has
referred three industries to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on
anti-competitive grounds: ice-cream companies, the home-valuation market and
the record industry. The latter followed widespread complaints about compact
disc prices.
As Sir Bryan approaches his first anniversary in the job, an ever-increasing
number of industries is coming under investigation. Doctors, the perfume
business, condom manufacturers, the ITV companies - even the Financial
Times's data-base service - have been referred to the MMC. He has also
started his own investigation into office-equipment leasing, and proposed
controversial disclosure rules for the life assurance industry.
Sir Bryan originally made a name for himself as an enemy of monopolies
during his eight years as director-general of Oftel, the telecommunications
regulator, when he pitted himself against British Telecommunications'
dominance in the newly privatised industry. His current job has given him
the responsibility of investigating monopolies, cartels and other
restrictive practices throughout British industry.
In doing so, Sir Bryan, once an accountancy professor at the London School
of Economics, admits he is often tempted to tear up his textbooks. Adam
Smith's model of many players in 'perfect competition' with one another is
comparatively rare, he says, while oligopoly and monopoly are common.
Sir Bryan acknowledges that it would not be sensible to try to turn
oligopolistic markets into 'Adam Smith-type models'. But he argues that it
is possible to tackle 'frictions' that stop the market working as well as it
might. By focusing on such frictions, he hopes to encourage more competitive
markets which, in turn, he believes would benefit customers through lower
prices and more choice.
Sir Bryan's most potent weapon is to refer a case to the MCC, which then
reports on whether the practice in question is against the public interest.
In deciding whether to make a reference, Sir Bryan has to exercise his
judgment. This reflects the fact that there is a dispute among economists on
where to draw the boundary between anti-competitive practices and acceptable
business behaviour. Most of the controversial cases where Sir Bryan has
acted can be sorted into three families.
First, restrictive distribution arrangements - in which a manufacturer
refuses to supply certain retailers or attaches conditions to the supply of
its products. Sir Bryan's concern is that these arrangements may be used to
keep competing manufacturers out of the market or prices artificially high.
Such was the consideration behind the probe into the ice cream industry,
where there is a widespread practice of supplying freezer cabinets free of
charge to small retailers provided they are not used to stock competitors'
products. Another example is last November's referral of perfume
manufacturers which were refusing to supply their fragrances directly to
Superdrug, a discount retailer.
Both probes have been challenged. Wall's, the main focus of the ice cream
investigation which followed complaints by rival Mars, argues that it should
be allowed to reap the rewards of investing in its distribution outlets. The
perfume makers meanwhile say that they must be allowed to choose retailers
to ensure their products are sold in high-quality surroundings.
In the case of perfumes, Sir Bryan responds: 'It was not in my mind to
prevent manufacturers maintaining quality standards. It was much more a
question of whether they were applied objectively. Superdrug was prepared to
do the same as Boots in terms of quality.'
A second type of case involves alleged exploitation of copyright. While Sir
Bryan acknowledges that copyright law is necessary to 'give encouragement to
intellectually productive activity', he is concerned that the monopoly
control it gives can be abused.
This was the thinking behind his MMC referral last month of FT Profile,
which has refused to allow competitive data-bases to stock FT articles.
Copyright considerations - in particular, the ban on imports of recorded
music from the US, where wholesale prices are lower - also underlie the
MMC's investigation of compact disc prices.
The FT has argued that it would be unfair to require it to make its text
freely available to competitors while being denied the right to publish
electronically foreign papers such as The Wall Street Journal. The music
industry says that the right to ban 'parallel imports' is essential to
exploit intellectual property rights and hence encourage investment in new
artists.
A third group of cases involves failure by marketers to provide full
information about their products. Sir Bryan believes that competitive
markets only work properly if consumers know what they are buying and how
much a product or service really costs. Otherwise they can be hoodwinked
into buying inappropriate goods.
These were the concerns which led to Sir Bryan's assault on the lack of
transparency in charges and benefits in the life assurance industry. They
also explain his investigation of office-equipment leasing, following
allegations by customers of high-pressure sales techniques, in particular by
photocopier suppliers.
In such cases, the question is whether Sir Bryan is guilty of 'nannying'
consumers. If he tries to protect people from their follies, will they ever
learn to be shrewd buyers? Shouldn't the principle of caveat emptor apply?
Sir Bryan admits there is 'an element of nannying' but argues that he has to
make a judgment about the 'practical balance of economic power' in cases
such as these.
'It would be nice to think that people came out of school with a working
knowledge of life assurance,' he says. But, given that they do not, 'by the
time they have learned, it is already too late'. He also argues that even
fairly shrewd people can be hoodwinked: 'One hears of leading competition
lawyers who got caught on photocopier leasing.'
Sir Bryan's vigorous approach to rooting out alleged anti-competitive
practices has provoked disappointment and anger among companies being
investigated. They argue that he is taking an excessively interventionist
line. While there is no sign that he lacks the courage to carry through his
investigations in the face of such criticism, the efficacy of his actions
will largely depend on how other bodies react.
It is too early to say whether the MMC will back his views on what
constitutes anti-competitive behaviour. The commission typically takes nine
months to complete its investigations and has yet to report on any of Sir
Bryan's monopoly references. On mergers, it has made two reports  -
concluding in one case that the merger was against the public interest and
in the other that it was not.
There is also a question of how much support he will receive from ministers,
in particular from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
So far, the signs are not very encouraging. In February, Mr Heseltine twice
overruled Sir Bryan's advice that proposed mergers should be referred to the
MMC: the merger of GEC's and Philips Electronics' infra-red defence
businesses, and Airtours' bid for rival holiday company Owners Abroad.
Mr Heseltine also decided last month not to move ahead with a proposal to
outlaw abuses of market power, despite advice from Sir Bryan. Instead, he
decided to beef up the existing approach - under which practices are not
deemed anti-competitive unless an MMC investigation finds them to be so.
Sir Bryan, however, professes not to be worried by these developments. He
explains the two merger decisions by saying that these were issues on which
it was possible to have different opinions. Similarly, he understands why a
desire to reduce industry's regulatory burden prevented the government
taking a tougher line on abuses of market power. 'I don't actually think the
government is going soft on competition policy.'
But, even if the government's commitment to competition were to waver, Sir
Bryan would be determined to continue his fight against market frictions:
'If I thought a case was a good one to go to the MMC, the thought that
ministers might not agree would not divert me.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / No more Maastrichts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The one thing we have learned for sure from the Maastricht treaty is that we
must never go through that kind of thing again. We do not need and cannot
handle another European treaty such as Maastricht; we must avoid a re-run of
a ratification process, the main effect of which has been to drive a deep
split through the centre of the European political establishment, and turn a
large proportion, perhaps a majority, of the voters against the European
Community.
The prolonged uncertainty over UK and Danish ratification has effectively
paralysed the EC for about a year. That paralysis should now end. But in the
meantime whole chunks of the treaty, starting with economic and monetary
union (Emu), already look in need of an overhaul. The 12 member governments
must do their best with the treaty they signed. But the voter support that
would enable them to make a fresh start has been seriously alienated by the
various struggles over ratification.
In the course of these struggles, the treaty has come in for many detailed
criticisms, starting with the standard complaint that it is a confusing
farrago of heterogeneous ingredients, prepared according to different
recipes. Almost no one has a good word to say for it, unless they are being
provocatively unconventional. But many of the specific criticisms of the
Maastricht text are of little consequence compared with the central flaw
which we can only now see with hindsight - the purpose of Maastricht was to
take Europe a great stride forward, but the real political effect of the
treaty-making process has been to make European integration more unpopular,
divisive and difficult.
Unless we draw the right conclusions from the Maastricht experience, the
inherent stresses of treaty negotiation, revision and ratification are
likely to sandbag the Community over and over again, at considerable cost
and no advantage.
Some say the Maastricht programme for Emu was always unworkable; others say
that it is unworkable now. We shall see. But the really serious political
flaw in the programme was not in the details, but in the attempt to make it
compulsory.
We know why. The French wanted a binding commitment from the Germans now,
because they were not sure they would get it voluntarily later. But this
attempt to pre-empt the future was a fundamental strategic mistake, because
it stirred up gratuitous opposition. Anxiety among the Danes was so intense
that they have been allowed to opt out of virtually the whole of the treaty.
The UK is excused from monetary union and the social chapter. And on the
day, even the Germans will need a vote in the Bundestag to go ahead with
monetary union.
We should not be surprised by this outbreak of political reality. If the big
day ever comes, the transition to monetary union will obviously be a
conscious act of choice, by each of the governments, with the explicit
consent of their parliaments. It will not be made in obedient submission to
the Maastricht treaty. If this simple truth had been clearly built into the
treaty we might have had less trouble. There would have been no need for
superfluous opt-outs, and the treaty could probably have been ratified with
more speed and less fuss.
The lesson is obvious. With each new phase of integration, the EC is
increasingly likely to encroach on national sensitivities. That will mean a
simple three-way choice: to move at the pace of the most reluctant; to force
the reluctant off the bus; or to embrace the principle of a variable-speed
Europe as a desirable characteristic of the integration process, even more
important than subsidiarity. If these are the options, the choice is easy. A
Community of mature democracies should not compel the reluctant to act
against the will of their electorates; and it should not allow the reluctant
to exercise a veto on the enthusiastic.
The corollary is that future Community treaties need to be different in
spirit from Maastricht: more general, less prescriptive, more elastic, less
formalistic, more evolutionary. In the Maastricht treaty, the general and
the particular are all bundled up together. As a result, if the Danes had
said No the second time round, the others would have had no idea what to do
next. It is absurd to walk into that kind of mess, and the 12 must make sure
that they do not do it again.
This is not a purely theoretical problem. The Maastricht treaty provides for
a review and renegotiation in 1996. But some elements of renegotiation need
to happen earlier, partly to bring the Emu plan into line with economic
reality, and partly because of the membership negotiations with four member
countries of the European Free Trade Association. In these negotiations the
12 will ask the four to declare their whole-hearted commitment to the aim of
a common foreign and security policy. But since three of the four are
neutrals, such promises will be unreliable, and perhaps hypocritical. The 12
would do better to address openly the issue of a variable-speed Europe.
With the Danish vote, Maastricht has a reprieve, but it is no more than
that. A very large minority voted against the treaty in France and Denmark.
The polls suggest that popular opposition may be even greater in Germany and
Britain. This is not a satisfactory basis for implementing the treaty. In
domestic politics, perhaps, a majority is a majority, however small. But an
evolving Community needs a much broader acquiescence. That in turn may
depend on the recognition of national idiosyncrasies through the principle
of variable geometry.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK weakened inside the European exchange rate mechanism last week
and dealers will focus in the next few days on indicators that test the
D-Mark's strength against the dollar and other currencies, writes James
Blitz.
One reason for the softening of the D-Mark is that currency dealers continue
to think that the Bundesbank is set to cut short term rates further. This
week's provisional data for consumer price inflation in Germany should
indicate by how much they intend to do so.
The market is expecting another monthly rise in the German CPI, by about 0.3
per cent. This would help to bring down the headline rate of inflation, from
4.3 per cent in the year to April to 4.1 per cent in the year to May.
Anything higher than this might alter the Bundesbank's perception of how
quickly it should ease monetary policy, keeping the D-Mark firm.
The outlook for the dollar/D-Mark rate swill also depend on economic data in
the US, including the Conference Board's consumer confidence figures (due
tomorrow), the Michigan University consumer confidence figure (due Friday)
and the Revised First Quarter GDP figure (also due Friday).
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, believes
these figures are likely to underline the sluggishness of the recovery,
proving to be dollar negative.
In Europe, the key question will be whether sterling, the French franc and
high-yielding currencies can consolidate last week's gains against the
D-Mark.
There are strong expectations, in particular, that the Bank of France will
cut its intervention rate today, pushing its repo rate below Germany's for
the first time since the winter of 1991. The intervention rate is currently
at 7.75 per cent.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE main British economic indicators this week are the April non-European
Community trade figures, detailed first quarter GDP figures, and the
Confederation of British Industry monthly trends inquiry for May.
Although the UK's trade deficit with non-EC countries in March was
considerably smaller than in February, economists are gloomy about the
general state of UK trade. The non-EC figures have painted a bleak picture
since the beginning of the year when they became the only trade statistics
to be published.
Central Statistical Office statisticians have cautioned against reading too
much into the figures - they represent less than half of the UK's total
trade - but economists are bracing themselves for bad news when the complete
figures, including EC trade, are published next month.
This week also brings a string of US economic indicators. April existing
home sales published tomorrow are expected to show a bounce back from the
generally bad winter figures. Since December existing home sales have
dropped a sharp 16.8 per cent, after winter storms hit the nation. Durable
goods orders should also have advanced in April following a drop in March.
The other economic highlights and statistics of the week are listed below.

RESULTS DUE
THE music industry is in the news with the announcement that the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission is to investigate the price of compact discs.
Tomorrow, Thorn EMI, one of the largest music companies in the world, is due
to announce its full-year results and any comments on CD prices by Sir Colin
Southgate, the chairman, will be regarded with interest.
Under the old accounting system, pre-tax profits of Pounds 330m are expected
compared with Pounds 255.1m in the previous year.
This does not take account, however, of exceptional items relating to Thames
Television, which the group recently sold to Pearson. With results reported
under FRS3, this and exceptional items related to smaller disposals will be
included.
Supermarket stocks have been in the doldrums recently as investors have
focused on recovery plays and Argyll Group, the UK's third largest food
retailing group, is no exception. The stock has been trading around its lows
for the year. Nevertheless Argyll, which runs the Safeway and Presto/Lo-Cost
chains, is expected to report up to a 15 per cent increase in full (53-week)
year pre-tax profits to between Pounds 415m and Pounds 420m when it
announces its results tomorrow.
Courtaulds is expected to report on Wednesday pre-tax profits for the year
to March of about Pounds 190m, down slightly from Pounds 201m a year
earlier.
Carlton Communications is forecast to report today a modest increase in
interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 53m from Pounds 49m. The improvement
will be in spite of an operating loss of about Pounds 5m by Carlton
Television, the new London weekday ITV franchise.

FT  24 MAY 93 / US Money and Credit: Investors seek guidance over interest
rate worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION worries ebb and flow in the US bond markets at the moment, as
traders try to decide whether the Federal Reserve will take any action on
the interest rate front and the economic data provides disturbing, but not
conclusive, guidance.
Such volatility was particularly noticeable last week. On Monday, as
investors chewed over the previous week's inflation news, the benchmark long
bond sank by almost half a point; on Tuesday, as the Fed's policy-making
Open Market Committee held its monthly meeting, it plunged more
dramatically. The yield rose above 7 per cent for the first time in over a
month, to end at 7.01 per cent.
But a day later, a growing conviction that the Fed would not move on
interest rates, sent prices higher and the yield back below the 7 per cent
mark. Finally, in the last two sessions of the week, bond prices recommenced
their slide, leaving the yield on the 30-year long bond at 7.04 per cent by
Friday night - the highest figure seen for about seven weeks.
In all of this, there was precious little hard news for the market to
digest. The most meaningful information arrived late on Thursday afternoon,
when the Fed's weekly money supply numbers proved to be way above
expectations.
The M2 money supply measure, for example, surged by over Dollars 20bn in the
week ended May 10, following a Dollars 13.2bn advance in the previous week.
That said, analysts were quick to note that M2's growth - including this
late uptick - relative to the fourth quarter of 1992, is still below the
lower end of the Fed's target range.
Still, the inflation worries may have gained an extra boost from the
continued rise in the gold price; the metal is, after all, the traditional
hedge against inflation.
Moreover, on Friday, when minutes of the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting
on March 23 were released, it was revealed that two Fed governors were
pushing for higher interest rates at this stage. The majority of the group,
however, voted against a change.
Conversely, there was some more evidence of continued weakness in the
economy itself which, to a certain extent, mitigates against the inflation
fears. The latest University of Michigan index of consumer expectations
showed a sharp drop in May, reaching its lowest level since last Octo-ber.
The initial unemployment claims numbers for the week ended May 15 also
suggested that any improvement in the labour market is marginal, at best;
claims increased by 7,000 to 344,000, reversing the fairly modest declines
seen over the previous three weeks.
So will events in the coming week shed any more light? Again, the flow of
economic statistics will be fairly modest. The Conference Board's survey of
consumer confidence is due to be released on Tuesday, and - like other
surveys - is expected to show that consumers' morale dwindled during May. On
Friday, some analysts are looking for a downward revision to the first
quarter output growth numbers, from 1.8 per cent to perhaps 1 per cent.
But few think that these indications of a stalling economy will avert the
inflation concerns. The most that seems possible is that the interest rate
policy remains steady.
On expectations of a 2.5 to 3 per cent economic growth rate and inflation in
the 3 to 3.5 per cent range, 'the Fed would leave policy alone, as it would
perceive the economic recovery to be self-sustaining,' predict analysts at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, for example. 'At the same time, the Fed would
view the inflation numbers as not warranting a firming of monetary policy.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / UK Gilts: Inflation clues remain thin on the ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S lowest retail price inflation figures for 29 years failed to
excite the gilt market on Friday, when investors sold securities amid
uncertainty over gilts price levels ahead of this week's big auction.
Such a decidedly sniffy approach to a set of figures, hailed by the Treasury
as 'astonishing', was partly because they failed to cause any real
surprises. Also, they provided no firm clues as to the direction of
underlying inflation.
Over the week, yields for long-dated gilts dropped slightly to just under
8.5 per cent for bonds around a 25-year maturity. At the short end, yields
were little changed on speculation that the government was unlikely to hurry
over any further cut in base rates, held at 6 per cent since January.
The retail prices index (RPI) last month rose by 1.3 per cent compared with
April last year, after a year-on-year rise of 1.9 per cent in March. The
figure was last bettered in February 1964.
Excluding mortgage interest payments, the RPI rose 2.9 per cent between
April 1992 and last month, after increasing 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to
March. This increases the likelihood that this measure will stay below the 4
per cent upper limit set by the Treasury.
However, fractionally worse news on inflation comes from a study of the
various underlying measures produced by government and City statisticians.
The RPI - less both mortgage payments and local-tax payments - showed a
small rise between March and April from 3.2 per cent to 3.3 per cent. The
year-on-year rise in this measure stood at 3.3 per cent in December last
year and reached a low of 2.9 per cent in January.
A series calculated by Greenwell Montagu - which as well as excluding
mortgage payments removes movements in utility prices, seasonal foods and
other variables thought to distort the underlying pattern - puts inflation
at 2.9 per cent last month, the same as in March. In January it was 2.5 per
cent and in February 2.7 per cent.
These figures all indicate that in recent months inflationary pressures have
ticked up somewhat, an impression underlined in last week's Bank of England
inflation report which predicted that the RPI less mortgage payments would
rise to about 3.5 per cent in June from the 2.9 per cent figure in April.
Even though virtually every measure of inflation shows a fall since August -
when the Greenwell measure puts the figure at a high 3.9 per cent - some in
the gilt market are worried that the pressures will build up, assuming
Britain is on track for a recovery of some sorts later this year.
This worry is shared by Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at the London office
of Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house, who says: 'People should be on
guard against any mood of complacency that may be creeping in over the
inflation outlook.'
Last week's labour markets data provided, however, a few encouraging signs
about future inflation. Average earnings grew an underlying 4 per cent in
the year to March, the slowest rate of increase for 25 years and 0.5 of a
percentage point lower than in February.
Even though the March figure was affected by advance payments of bonuses and
salaries in March last year ahead of the general election, the numbers
indicate the generally depressed state of wage pressures. With many
employees settling for wage increases of around 3 per cent or less, there is
a fair chance that these pressures will stay muted for some time.
On the other hand, there is a clear danger of the 4 per cent limit being
breached next year, as the Bank's inflation report points out.
Such sentiments did little to help the enthusiasm of gilt investors during
last week's relatively quiet trading, especially as they looked forward to
Wednesday's Pounds 3bn auction of 7 3/4 per cent stock due 2006 which
underlines the large amount of stock due to be sold by the Bank this
financial year.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Italian Government Bonds: Signs of stability foster
reassurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT Italy's recent political upheavals, the bond market has been a
hostage to fortune, with prices unable to uncouple themselves from the
political uncertainties linked to the corruption scandal and the formation
of a new government.
Last week, matters started to change. Signs of greater political stability,
both domestically and in the European Community, reassured investors.
Together, the relaxation of political tensions combined with unexpected news
on accelerated repayment of withholding tax to refocus attention on economic
fundamentals, giving the market one of its best weeks for a long time.
News that the government plans to repay withholding tax to eligible foreign
investors within 30 working days was the biggest surprise. Repayment delays
have shortened, but the system remains cumbersome and highly unpredictable.
The move to accelerate repayments, to be introduced later this year, was
warmly welcomed, although investors will wait for results before giving
unreserved support.
Denmark's decision to back the Maastricht Treaty on European union in its
second referendum also proved a tonic. Doubts about the future of closer
economic and monetary links within the EC had been a big factor depressing
bonds after the first Danish referendum last year, as the market widely sees
Italy to be a leading beneficiary of the 'external discipline' EMU entails.
Domestically, investors have taken heart from the greater stability of Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's new government after its rocky start. Although the
basis of Mr Ciampi's political support remains somewhat nebulous, market
sentiment has been greatly boosted by dealers' confidence that the
government includes competent ministers who will meet its commitment to
tackle the budget deficit.
Credibility is paramount. Mr Ciampi's expertise and deficit-cutting zeal are
not doubted. Dealers are confident the prime minister - who spent much of
his time as central bank governor criticising politicians' inaction - means
what he says and is much less constrained by party political ties than his
predecessors.
The market has already taken heart from the government's plan to bring
forward the 1994 budget process to July and readiness to meet 1993 budgetary
targets set when seeking a special EC Ecu loan. The only change has been to
adjust the targets slightly to accommodate lower-than-expected economic
growth.
Thus Friday's L12,400bn mini-budget to bring this year's finances in line
with forecast was welcomed. Dealers believe ministers are not only setting
feasible targets - never a certainty in the past - but also showing a
willingness to stick to them.
The mini-budget will be followed by a further package of tough measures for
1994. Figures are still imprecise, but Mr Riccardo Barbieri, of J. P.
Morgan, expects the adjusted 1993 deficit target to be about L155,000bn and
that for 1994 to be between L140,000bn and L145,000bn.
The promise of action on the deficit has been accompanied by
better-than-expected inflation figures. In spite of the lira's sharp
devaluation, there has as yet been little sign of the 'J-curve' effect
usually caused by higher import prices pushing up inflation. Although March
industrial prices rose sharply, preliminary retail price figures showed May
inflation fell to 4 per cent, against 4.2 per cent in April.
Advance knowledge of the May figure - the lowest since 1969 - may help to
explain the Bank of Italy's 0.5 percentage point discount rate cut to 10.5
per cent late on Thursday. The reduction, expected to accompany the 1993
mini-budget, came earlier than forecast but was no less welcome for it.
The market was happy to digest the stream of news. Yields on 10-year
government bonds fell to close at 12.23 per cent on Friday from 12.43 per
cent last Monday morning. Rates on three-month Eurolira deposits declined to
about 10.43 per cent on the bid side from 10.62 per cent over the same
period, while the lira strengthened to around L907.50 against the D-Mark
from L915 last Monday.
After weeks of grim news, it is the sort of thing dealers like to hear.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Asset-Backed Securities/ECU Bonds: Economic recovery may
prompt rise in activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLURRY of asset-backed deals came to the international capital market last
week. While this area of the market has been relatively quiet so far this
year, asset-backed specialists expect activity to pick up gradually in the
second half of 1993, especially as the economic recovery gets under way in
the UK and mortgage business improves.
Last week saw the launch of a Pounds 116m deal for European Bank Investment
Trust, which holds 20 per cent risk-weighted assets with Credit Suisse
Financial Products providing the cash-flow from swaps.
Goldman Sachs, which arranged the deal, said investors had two lines of
security - a guarantee from Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), and
a pool of assets. These consist of senior, fixed-rate sterling obligations
such as bonds, letters of credit or loans from European banks with a credit
rating of AA-/AA3 or above. The coupon, backed by swap payments from CSFP,
is three-month Libor plus 20 basis points.
According to figures provided by Euromoney Database, there have been only 14
asset-backed deals so far this year, although in a couple of cases these
represent different classes of issues for the same borrowing vehicle. In the
UK, activity in the mortgage-backed sector has been subdued.
'The lack of activity reflects the lack of origination of new residential
mortgages in the UK,' points out Mr Patrick O'Sullivan, general manager for
Europe for FGIC. 'Currently there is no loan growth  - when the economy is
well into the upturn we would expect activity to pick up,' he adds.
Other asset-backed specialists point to European countries such as Sweden,
Finland and Spain as the likely source of asset-backed deals in the next few
months. S-E Banken of Sweden has done several asset-backed deals - known as
the Osprey series - which were collateralised by residential mortgages, and
other banks in Sweden and Finland are expected to follow suit.
Using the asset-backed route has several attractions for many of these
Nordic banks, given that Scandinavia has suffered a deep recession leading
to an increase in state borrowing in the international capital markets as
well as deteriorating credit ratings for both state and bank borrowers.
Naturally the issue of asset-backed deals provides the usual capital savings
for the banks concerned. But in the case of Swedish and Finnish banks it
also has the advantage of providing access to a completely different
investor base (in other words, the insurance companies and US banks which
are big players in the sector) at a time when both the Kingdom of Sweden and
Republic of Finland are proving to be frequent borrowers in the
international bond market.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Risk and Reward: Loss focuses attention on detecting
unauthorised trades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m loss suffered by Sumitomo Finance International
on its interest rate options book last autumn, after a desk manager
concealed his real trading position from senior management, has highlighted
once again the importance of tight management controls in the derivatives
markets.
Details of the loss emerged on Friday, when the Securities and Futures
Authority expelled and fined the manager.
Although failure to report true positions to management is not a risk
peculiar to the derivatives market, it may be less likely to be detected,
because the valuation of positions is so much more complex, and senior
management, or in some cases the traders themselves, may not fully
understand the instruments they are dealing with. In the case of
over-the-counter options, as in this instance, the lack of liquidity and
ready price information is a further element.
There is some evidence that management controls were tightened following a
Pounds 150m loss incurred by Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, in
1991, when large options positions on the dollar went wrong. Particularly on
the corporate treasury side, the Allied-Lyons debacle shifted the trend
towards assigning a servicing, rather than a profit-generating function, to
treasury depart-ments.
Within banks and securities houses there has been a concerted effort by
senior management, at board level, to get to grips with the technicalities
of the business. The concerns over derivatives risk expressed by regulators
such as New York Federal Reserve chairman Mr Gerald Corrigan, although
widely criticised within the derivatives industry as alarmist, have served
an important function in refocusing the attention of senior management on
how their derivatives business is run.
One of the recommendations made by the Bank of England's internal report on
derivatives published last week was that 'a guiding principle might be that
at least two members of the board should be sufficiently knowledgeable to be
able to ensure that the business is controlled effectively'. The Bank plans
to adopt this recommendation as policy.
In the Sumitomo Finance case, it appears that tighter controls might have
forestalled the problem.
The manager of the interest rate options desk had to record the value of his
positions in management reports submitted to his chief executive, but he
gave falsely inflated values in order to hide his true position. He then
persuaded an employee with another firm, which he knew was used by
Sumitomo's accounts department to check those valuations, to quote inflated
prices that corresponded with those in his own internal management reports.
'In my experience there are a lot of banks where a trader believed to be of
exceptional quality reports direct to the top,' said Mr Derek Ross, a Touche
Ross partner who advises banks and securities firms in this area. 'It's easy
to develop a culture which allows the trading room to develop without
controls.'
There are several important principles to be followed, according to Mr Ross:
the segregation of duties between the dealing function and the exchange of
confirmations (which is part of the pre-settlement function); payment
instructions must also be independent; and the management reporting function
(usually provided by the accounts department) should be responsible for
performance measurement.
'When you get into a complex capital markets environment, the back office
staff usually have to rely on front office computer systems for valuation,'
points out Mr Ross. It is therefore important to ensure that the input to
the valuation model is not provided by the trader.
While a collusive fraud may still be hard to detect, controls involving a
range of different functions in the trading, settlement and reporting
process at least reduces the opportunities for trading positions to be
hidden.
'You can't stop somebody doing an unauthorised trade,' admits Mr Ross. 'But
you can make sure it can be closed out the following day.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Kiss of life fof Ecu bond
market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S ratification of the Maastricht Treaty last week provided a welcome
kiss of life for the Ecu bond market.
And with the Danish referendum out of the way, the Ecu Committee of the
European Bond Commission - an industry organisation - was quick to announce
clarifications over the role of the Ecu as the single European currency for
the benefit of market participants.
Mr Bob Tyley, chairman of the Ecu Committee and an economist at Paribas
Capital Markets Group, said the committee had received clarifications from
the European Commission and the European Council on the role of the Ecu.
'We found that certain aspects of the Ecu were not very well understood,' he
said, but added that the clarifications provide market operators with a
'concise and reliable reference for the development of the Ecu' which can be
seen as an appendix to the Maastricht Treaty.
'With regard to the current basket Ecu prior to the commencement of European
Monetary Union, its currency composition will be frozen once the treaty has
been ratified,' Mr Tyley said. The European Monetary Institute, which will
be set up on January 1 1994, will facilitate the use of the Ecu and oversee
its development.
The Ecu will lose its current basket nature and become a currency in its own
right on the first day of monetary union, and rapid introduction of the Ecu
as the single currency will ensue. On the first day of EMU, the exchange
rates between participating national currencies and the Ecu will be fixed
irrevocably, and the Ecu will rapidly replace those currencies.
EMU will start on January 1 1999 unless another date has been decided
beforehand. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the EC, stressed in a letter to
the Ecu Committee that this could take place well ahead of 1999.
'Sufficient conditions for this to be the case are that a majority of
countries qualify for membership (on the basis of the convergence criteria)
and that the European Monetary Institute has completed its work of
preparation of Stage 3 (which it will start to do after its creation on
January 1 1994 and must finish by December 31 1996 at the latest).'

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Italy in new move to cut costs
of borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S treasury has received the go-ahead to issue domestic debt in a
variety of foreign currencies, providing an important new weapon in its
battle to reduce borrowing costs and the budget deficit.
The deficit, expected to be about L155,000bn (Dollars 104.8bn) this year,
represents almost 11 per cent of gross domestic product. Although a variety
of new borrowing instruments have been introduced in the 1990s to extend
maturities and reduce debt servicing costs, the huge accumulated debt
continues to overshadow attempts to cut spending.
The treasury will also be allowed to accept government securities in lieu of
cash from investors buying shares as part of the privatisation programme.
The move should help smooth the way for the government's ambitious asset
sales and help overcome contraints on the domestic stock market.
No details have been given of what type of bonds will be acceptable for
swapping into equity.

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Pioneer tumbles 50% and sees
bleak outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIONEER Electronic, the Japanese audio and video equipment maker, suffered a
50 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y16.5bn (Dollars 149m) in the year to
March and forecast another 60 per cent drop this year, which it blamed on
weak domestic demand for consumer electronics.
Consolidated net profits were also down 62 per cent to Y10.8bn, partly due
to a Y4.86bn provision for losses on investment in Carolco, the US film
company, which is being restructured.
Parent sales for the year fell 8 per cent to Y382.8bn, with a 17.7 per cent
drop in domestic sales and a slim 0.4 per cent increase in exports. Audio
equipment sales were 24.4 per cent lower, while those of video products
slipped 12.9 per cent.
Car electronics sales advanced 10.5 per cent, and the company hopes demand
for car navigation systems will increase this year to counter a continuing
fall in demand for karaoke singing systems and other audio equipment.
Pioneer recently caused controversy in Japan by suggesting that 35 managers
take early retirement, prompting debate over whether the country's famed
lifetime employment system was crumbling.
Hit by two years of declining consumer electronics sales in Japan, the
company is still attempting to cut costs. It said capital spending and
manufacturing expenses would be trimmed further this year in the face of
'unpredictable world economy, uncertain currency rates, and intensifying
competition'.
But the outlook for the company remains bleak. For the current year, Pioneer
is expecting sales of Y368bn, down 3.9 per cent, and a 71.8 per cent plunge
in net profit to Y3bn.

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japan constructors hit by weak
demand
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading construction companies forecast sharply lower profits this
year, expecting that the fall in private orders would outweigh the new
contracts arising from a planned expansion of public works spending.
Apart from weak orders, several companies were bruised by their own
financial exposure to projects. Shimizu reported a 56.5 per cent fall in net
profit after writing off losses of Y75.5bn (Dollars 638m) related to its
involvement in developments in the UK and Australia.
The company said further write-offs would be necessary this year for US
projects, and net profit was expected to be halved again to Y10bn. Shimizu
was forced to sell short-term holdings of stocks, whose book value fell from
Y46.7bn in March last year to Y6.2bn at the close of the year.
Sales last year at Shimizu were 1.8 per cent higher at Y2,168bn, although
orders were down 19.9 per cent. Most Japanese contractors are suffering
because of weak demand for new commercial buildings and a continuing fall in
corporate capital spending.
At Kajima, pre-tax profit fell 29 per cent to Y87.9bn, which it blamed on a
slowing of orders for office buildings and an increased interest burden.
There is still an excess of office space in Tokyo and Osaka, where rents
fell almost 20 per cent last year, making developers wary of launching
projects.
A similar fall is expected this year at Taisei, which managed a 4.8 per cent
increase in pre-tax profit last year to Y101bn on a 15.3 per cent increase
in sales to Y1,980bn. Orders last year were down 20 per cent, and the
company expects another 4 per cent decline this year.
However, Obayashi is expecting 6 per cent growth in pre-tax profit to Y52bn
after a 7 per cent fall to Y49bn in the year just ended. Orders were 19 per
cent lower and sales were 0.8 per cent higher at Y1,519bn.

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Stage set for an end to E-II
melodrama - A long-running tussle due to be culminated in a courtroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLD financiers don't die; they just land on E-II. This exotically-named
company owns some familiar businesses, including Samsonite luggage, Culligan
water treatment systems, and Botany 500 menswear.
But for months it has been notorious as the subject of an intense tussle
between Mr Carl Icahn, the former corporate raider who until recently owned
Trans World Airlines, and Mr Leon Black, once a senior banker with Drexel
Burnham Lambert and now running his own investment business.
Finally, it seems, matters will come to a head in a Manhattan courtroom
today.
E-II's affairs have been byzantine for years. In the late-1980s, the company
comprised a clutch of businesses spun off from Beatrice Foods, and was based
in Chicago. Rather cheekily, it built up a stake in American Brands and, in
1988, threatened the large Connecticut-based conglomerate with a proxy
fight. In response, American Brands bid for, and acquired E-II for Dollars
1.1bn in cash and Dollars 1.5bn in assumed debt.
A few months later, the new owner decided to recoup its money. It sold the
bulk of E-11 on to Mr Meshulam Ricklis' privately-owned Rapid-American
company. Mr Ricklis, husband of film actress Pia Zadora and perhaps
best-known to UK investors for his role in the Guinness scandal, was one of
the stable of 1980s financiers who drew on Drexel's junk bond financing
capabilities. He paid around Dollars 1.2bn for the E-II operations, and took
over Dollars 1.5bn of subordinated debt.
Peace did not descend. In late-1990, E-II's disgruntled creditors ousted Mr
Ricklis, alleging he had milked the company in an effort to prop up other
personal interests. A legal action ensued, withMr Ricklis claiming that he
was within his rights.
While all this was going on, E-II caught the eye of Mr Icahn, whose
successful money-making image was becoming badly tarnished by the management
debacle at TWA. In early-1992, and in line with his new enthusiasm for
'workout' situations, the financier bought over 31 per cent of the junior
subordinated debt for an estimated Dollars 77m.
Simultaneously, Mr Black - who, in the wake of Drexel's demise, set up his
own investment firm Apollo Advisers - had come into a 27 per cent interest
in the junior bonds. This was largely thanks to Apollo's acquisition (along
with Credit Lyonnais) of the large junk bond portfolio which once belonged
to Executive Life, a Californian life company. In contrast to Mr Icahn,
however, Mr Black also acquired a 24 per cent stake in senior debt
securities.
Soon the two businessmen, who sometimes play each other at tennis, had
started a game of financial ping-pong - which intensified once E-II filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last summer. Essentially, their contest
was over what rights the different classes of debt-holders would have under
E-II's reorganisation plan - in particular, to equity in the ongoing,
'reorganised' company.
So far, Mr Black is winning. The bankruptcy court judge has allowed the
company to retain the sole right to put forward a reorganisation plan and,
under its current proposal, the former Drexel banker stands to gain control
just over 50 per cent of E-II.
Apollo's potential stake comes from two sources. First, the reorganisation
plan entitles junior debt holders to exchange their claims for a combination
of new debt and equity. Secondly, holders of the senior debt, who are being
offered a mixture of new debt and cash under the plan, also get the right to
swap some of that new debt for equity. Critical to determining the amount of
equity which they can get is the assumed price of E-II shares at which the
swap would take place. Mr Icahn says it has been set too low.
In typical fashion, the latter has been hustling to the end. Ten days ago,
he threw in a Dollars 1.18bn bid for E-11, claiming he would pay in cash.
On Friday, the company and creditors' committee politely declined the offer,
adding that Mr Icahn was welcome to resubmit an offer after the
reorganisation plan has gone through. But they also said they would modify
the plan, although details will not be released today's bankruptcy court
hearing.
So the final act in this long-running melodrama promises to be as lively as
the rest of the production. The original purpose of today's hearing was to
confirm the reorganisation plan, voting on which had already taken place
before Mr Icahn's cash offer was ever made. Now the deal is being tweaked at
the last minute - giving Mr Icahn more grounds for complaint.
Still, no one should weep too hard for either investor, whatever the
outcome. Mr Icahn will probably double his money, even under the company's
original plan. Mr Black, meanwhile, could do substantially better.

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Komatsu plunges 72% as sales
decline to Y870bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KOMATSU, the Japanese construction equipment maker, reported a 72 per cent
fall to Y3bn (Dollars 27m) in consolidated net profits for the year to
March, as an increase in public works projects failed to counter a sharp
fall in private construction and in orders for construction machinery.
While many Japanese companies have been trimming their product lines,
Komatsu has expanded its range of construction machinery and said demand
increased for some new products, but this was 'eclipsed by decreased demand
for mainstay products such as regular hydraulic excavators and bulldozers'.
Sales for the year fell 5.4 per cent to Y869.9bn, with a 5.2 per cent
decline in construction equipment, a 26.4 per cent slide in industrial
machinery, an 8.8 per cent drop in electronics, and a 16 per cent rise in
civil engineering contracts.
A recent government economic package to stimulate demand, which included a
sharp increase in public works spending, is likely to increase further the
demand for equipment for public projects, but private construction demand is
still weakening.
This year, Komatsu expects the government's package to lead to a gradual
increase in private business orders, and sees sales rising to Y910bn and net
profit to recover to Y10bn.

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: C&amp;W considers taking stake in
Telecom Eireann
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE and Wireless is exploring the possibility of taking a stake in Telecom
Eireann, the Irish state-owned telecommunications company, as part of its
strategy to strengthen its position in Europe.
C&amp;W said yesterday that discussions were in progress at a senior level
between the UK telecommunications group and the Irish government which could
lead to a strategic alliance or a joint venture.
C&amp;W was not prepared yesterday to give further details of the discussion now
in progress, which it said were at an early stage. No indication was given
of how large a shareholding was under consideration.
Telecom Eireann is the Republic of Ireland's most profitable public sector
company. It made a pre-tax profit of IPounds 94m (Pounds 85.5m) in the year
to end-April 1992 on revenues of IPounds 782m. With 1m customers and 13,500
staff its value has been estimated at IPounds 1bn were it to be privatised.
The possibility of a UK group taking a stake in the company is likely to
ruffle Irish sensibilities. Last year the prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds,
then finance minister, caused a storm of protest when he indicated that part
of TE could be up for sale.
TE is overmanned, is carrying a heavy debt burden and has need of
technological and financial support to carry through an ambitious
development programme.
C&amp;W, which dominates the Hong Kong telecommunications market, has a presence
in some 50 countries through a series of alliances with local operators.

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: RJB reassures investors over
pension fund shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB MINING, the coal-mining group formed in a management buy-out from AF
Budge and which is due to be floated next month, yesterday reassured
employees and investors over a Pounds 1.1m shortfall in funds owed to its
pension fund.
The company's flotation document last week revealed that only Pounds 2m had
been paid to its pension fund out of Pounds 3.1m which had been agreed for
transfer in December from the pension fund of AF Budge, the construction
group which collapsed last year.
The company said its directors were confident that the pension scheme would
receive all outstanding payments and that the delay would not affect its
flotation, due on June 7.
It said they were confident that assets controlled by the Budge pension
fund, including an office block currently under offer in Leeds, would more
than cover the shortfall and interest in compensation for the delay.
It said it had received more than 15,000 applications for shares. The
flotation will raise up to Pounds 50m and the company will be capitalised at
Pounds 103m.

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Texas to make UK-designed chip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK-designed microprocessor chip chosen to power an innovative electronics
product has also won the endorsement of a leading US electronics
manufacturer.
The endorsement by Texas Instruments, the world's sixth largest
semiconductor maker, means the chip will be used in cars and portable
telephones and could give Europe its first significant success in
microprocessors.
Texas Instruments said it had agreed to manufacture and market chips
designed by Acorn RISC Machines (Arm), a Cambridge-based joint venture owned
by Acorn of the UK together with Apple Computer and VLSI Technology of the
US. Olivetti, the Italian office equipment supplier, has a majority stake in
publicly quoted Acorn, which supplies most computers used in UK schools. The
world microprocessor market is dominated by US manufacturers, notably Intel
and Motorola. The Arm chip is one of only two European microprocessors, both
designed in the UK, to have made any impact on the market. The other, the
transputer, developed by Inmos (now part of French Italian group SGS
Thomson), has been used chiefly for high-power applications including
supercomputers.
The Arm chip has been selected by Apple as the heart of its 'Newton'
personal digital assistant to be launched later this year, an innovative
computer which is said to accept handwritten input.
The chip is physically smaller than others but powerful and consumes little
power. This makes it ideal for consumer electronics products such as mobile
telephones or 'smart' cards. Texas Instruments intends to build it into
systems for controlling car engines.
The success of a new microprocessor design depends on the number of
manufacturers who will licence the design. Arm has already licensed its
design to GEC Plessey of the UK and Sharp of Japan in addition to VLSI
Technology and Texas Instruments.

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Pioneering a path through a
legal minefield - After an 18 month wait MCC creditors have a dividend in
prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MARK HOMAN, head of insolvency at Price Waterhouse, gestures towards the
broad window-sill of his office in central London. A chart of more than 400
companies in Maxwell Communication Corporation spreads across its entire
length.
After a year and a half working on the case, the joint administrators to MCC
 -including Mr Homan - are reaching the point at which they be able to
squeeze some returns for creditors from these remnants of the late Mr Robert
Maxwell's empire. Creditors have in the last few days received three
documents which offer them the prospect of a first dividend towards the end
of the year. They have just over a month to respond.
On December 16, 1991 the directors of MCC filed a petition for protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. The next day,
they petitioned the English courts for administration under insolvency law.
The frenetic activity in the months before the death of Mr Maxwell, its
chairman, was to take many months to untangle. It would involve not simply
trying to understand a series of highly complex and poorly documented
transactions from the past, but also negotiating a pioneering arrangement
through two separate and fiercely independent legal jurisdictions.
'It's just mind-boggling having two courts each seeking to assert its
authority over each other,' says Mr Homan. 'It had never been done. It could
have been a recipe for disaster.'
Initially the administrators considered applying to have control moved
solely into the UK courts. But the US judge made it clear she had no
intention of relinquishing power. Two entirely separate liquidations under
the different systems would have been costly, complex and lengthy.
Co-operation seemed the only answer, creating a series of logistical and
diplomatic demands. While the administrators at Price Waterhouse had
day-to-day control, the US court appointed an 'examiner' to scrutinise the
process.
Many actions left to the discretion of administrators in the UK required
court approval in the US. A series of procedures had to be drawn up
specifying who had power to make decisions. One of the administrators took
25 transAtlantic flights in nine months. 'You live your life on an
aeroplane,' says Mr Homan, who himself travelled across more than once a
month during 1992. 'It's absolutely shattering.'
The results of the negotiations are highlighted from the front cover onwards
of the three documents now circulating among creditors. The proposals are
called both an English 'scheme of arrangement' and a US 'plan of
reorganisation'. Mr Homan says: 'We have one concept and one exit plan with
two different wrappers.'
The text is the culmination of many months of delicate negotiations and
compromise between lawyers and accountants on both sides of the Atlantic.
There were five principal distinctions between Chapter 11 and administration
which needed to be overcome:
Barring of claims. Chapter 11 debars new creditors from coming forward and
claiming in an insolvency after a fixed date. English insolvency has no such
provision and allows new creditors to catch up with distributions from any
remaining proceeds. The MCC plan leans towards the US, but allows the
English courts to recognise new creditors at their discretion.
Currency conversion. Chapter 11 converts claims into dollars at the time of
filing. English law converts claims into sterling at the start of the
scheme. Under the plan, all claims will be held in whichever currency they
were denominated, and liquid assets already realised in MCC are currently
being held in a basket of currencies weighted according to these
denominations.
Rights to interest. In the US, interest-bearing claims stop paying interest
at the time of the Chapter 11 petition. In England, they would continue
until the start of the scheme. The proposal will follow the US rules and
stop paying on December 16 1991.
Preferential and priority creditors. US priority and English preferential
creditors - such as payroll costs - are defined differently under the two
laws. Rather than cause tensions, the widest definition has been used. That
gives all of these claimants first access to any distributions from
realisations of MCC assets.
Voting. In the US, creditors can vote by post and approval needs a
two-thirds majority by value. In England, they must vote in person and have
a three-quarters majority. Creditors will be required to vote under both
arrangements, but the English ruling will hold most importance since its
threshold is higher.
Mr Homan says: 'We had to come up with a solution which was legal in both
countries and didn't cause any creditor group any significant disadvantage.
We have done things which disadvantage most creditors a little, but don't
create a separate class of disgruntled creditors. We give the advantage to a
minority rather than creating a blocking majority against the proposals.'
His work was also helped by the fact that MCC had no secured creditors. More
than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) was loaned without any security against the
assets of the group. 'If we had lots of different classes of creditors, it
might not have been possible,' Mr Homan says.
Now the onus is on creditors. If they vote in favour, and the proposals are
sanctioned by the English and US courts, the scheme and plan could begin at
the end of July and there may be a first distribution as soon as November.
From unsecured liabilities in the range Dollars 3.2bn-Dollars 3.6bn, the
administrators estimate realisations of Dollars 781m-Dollars 1.36bn. That
gives a dividend of 22-43 per cent, to which could be added a further 9 per
cent in realisations from potential litigation with a value of up to Dollars
300m.
'It's taken a lot of effort to find the common ground,' says Mr Homan.
'Given these circumstances we would probably do the same again. But if
creditors vote this down I don't know where they will go. There would be a
clash of jurisdictions which would lead to an Armageddon scenario.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Lazard bids for Grahams Rintoul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAZARD Brothers, the merchant bank, has made an agreed bid for Grahams
Rintoul &amp; Company, the specialist investment management company.
The move, announced yesterday, marks a return to the investment trust market
for Lazard. It provides Grahams Rintoul with a high-profile name and it
enables Lazard, which is fifty per cent owned by Pearson - the conglomerate
that also owns the Financial Times - to expand its private investor base. Mr
Jimmy West, chief executive of Lazard's investment management arm, said:
'Investment trusts are a growing market and an area in which we could do
with some expertise.'
The acquisition of Grahams Rintoul, for an undisclosed sum, brings two
trusts with a combined net asset value of about Pounds 55m - the Grahams
Rintoul, which concentrates on smaller companies, and the North American Gas
trust which is geared for the specialist investor.
Lazard has been absent from the investment trust arena since it was faced
with a hostile bid for its Romney and Raeburn Trusts in 1988. The attack
prompted the bank to turn the trusts into an open ended Guernsey-based
investment company called Lazard Select. Subsequently, Lazard took on Mr
Jimmy West from Globe Investment Trust to head up Lazard Investors and in
January this year Investors became the fund manager for Crown Financial
Services' Pounds 680m assets. The Rintoul acquisition is small by comparison
and even smaller in the light of the Pounds 4.2bn of assets managed by
Lazard Investors but it is the merchant bank's first fully-fledged return to
the investment trust area.
However, funds managed by Lazard are smaller compared with the tens of
billions managed by its merchant banking rivals, Schroders, Robert Fleming,
SG Warburg and Morgan Grenfell.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Abu Dhabi close to charges over BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of Abu Dhabi is close to bringing both civil and criminal
actions against the key individuals from the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International who it believes defrauded it of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds
1.42bn).
The government, which is the majority shareholder in the bank, is at an
advanced stage of determining whether to sue for compensation former BCCI
directors and employees it alleges stole money it entrusted to the bank
through ICIC, a Cayman Islands subsidiary.
The money came from the private departments of Sheikh Zayed, the ruler of
Abu Dhabi, and Sheikh Khalifa, the crown prince. These men, along with the
state department of finance and Adia, the state investment authority, hold
77 per cent of BCCI's shares.
The public prosecutor's office is believed to be near bringing criminal
charges against 13 individuals detained in the country since BCCI was closed
in July 1991, including Mr Swaleh Naqvi, its former chief executive.
The action comes as the liquidators to the bank at accountants Touche Ross
are believed to be close to making a decision on whether to issue writs
against the Bank of England for its role as lead regulator to BCCI. The
liquidators have already issued writs for damages of more than Dollars 8bn
against accountants Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part of Ernst
&amp; Young, for their role as auditors to the bank, and of Dollars 10.5bn
against the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin
Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer, for fraud and racketeering.
The government of Abu Dhabi would itself sue the individual BCCI employees,
while all other litigation is being handled by Touche Ross. Any proceeds
will be split equally between the two parties.
The prospect of new litigation comes as Touche Ross prepares for the
election of a formal five-strong creditors' committee from 24 candidates
this Thursday, at what is expected to be the world's largest creditors'
meeting at London's Wembley arena. The committee will approve the firm's
fees and sanction its future actions.
Adia, the Abu Dhabi investment authority, which is owed at least Dollars
72m, has put up a candidate. Also standing is Mr Adil Elias, owed Dollars
2m, who is a member of the existing informal creditors' committee and who is
opposing in the Luxembourg courts the settlement between Abu Dhabi and
Touche Ross.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Government to consider safeguards for cheap BR fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night hinted it might agree legal safeguards for
concessionary rail fares in order to avoid a Commons defeat at the hands of
Conservative backbench rebels.
With the British Rail privatisation bill returning to the House of Commons
today for its report stage, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said he
was willing to look at possible statutory protection for railcards.
But Mr MacGregor indicated the government would not yield to a separate
demand by some Tory MPs that BR be allowed to compete for service franchises
once the railways are thrown open to private competition.
The two-day debate on the bill's report stage threatens to be stormy with
concern among the government's supporters about the political impact of
privatisation underpinned by evidence of overwhelming public opposition.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, pledged the opposition to
return the rail network to the public sector if it won the next general
election.
A Gallup poll last week suggested that more than two-thirds of commuters
opposed the privatisation of services. Yesterday a report commissioned by
the public transport pressure group Transport 2000 said fares would have to
increase sharply and rural services shut to meet a Pounds 500m 'bill' for
privatisation.
Legal guarantees for the concessionary fares enjoyed by the elderly and
students have been demanded by about a dozen Conservative backbenchers,
threatening the government's 18-seat majority in the Commons.
Mr MacGregor had suggested that they could be protected in agreements
reached between the new franchise authority and private sector operators.
But Sir Keith Speed, the MP for Ashford who is leading Tory calls for
tighter safeguards, said that the government risked defeat unless it was
prepared to enshrine the principle of concessionary fares in the
legislation.
That brought a statement from Mr MacGregor: 'If we can find a way of meeting
some of the concerns obviously I will do so because . . . I am well aware of
the importance of railcards.' The Tory rebels now expect the government to
table its own amendment to protect the cheap fares.
Mr MacGregor refused to offer a comparable olive branch to the rebels on
their demands that BR should be able to compete equally with private sector
companies in bidding for franchises.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Lopez encounters GM's action: VW executive will issue
complaint defending professional reputation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CLASH between Volkswagen and General Motors, two of the world's leading
volume carmakers, threatened to develop into an open court battle after a
new outbreak of hostilities at the weekend.
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's production and purchasing director,
is to issue a complaint against General Motors, his former employer, to
counter legal moves made by the US group against him.
Mr Lopez's professional reputation had been so damaged that he wanted to
defend himself legally, a VW spokesman said.
His move followed GM's announcement on Friday that it had filed a legal
complaint in Germany against Mr Lopez 'for what we believe is the taking of
confidential documents'.
Officials from the public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt near Frankfurt
are expected to question Mr Lopez, his colleagues and representatives of the
US concern to find if there are grounds for further action.
The renewed eruption follows successful legal action last month by Adam
Opel, GM's German subsidiary, in which it won an injunction preventing VW
from poaching its employees. Opel had alleged that some 40 German personnel
had been approached by Mr Lopez or his associates.
Mr Lopez, formerly head of GM's global purchasing, with a formidable
reputation for cost-cutting, was lured to VW in March by Mr Ferdinand Piech,
VW's new head, who recently announced a DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) loss for the
first quarter.
Although VW said at the weekend that the group had 'absolutely no' GM
documents, Mr David Herman, managing director of Adam Opel, said responses
from Mr Lopez to a series of requests for assurances that he had not taken
confidential information had not been 'satisfactory'.
The news magazine Der Spiegel added to the controversy on Saturday with
allegations that Mr Lopez had thousands of documents, including parts
purchasing lists and details of all Opel's engine and model plans for the
next 10 years. VW dismissed the claims as 'untenable and unbelievable'.
According to Mr Herman, settling the issue was 'of the utmost importance for
the future competitiveness of Opel and GM'.

FT  24 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Rentokil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One day Rentokil will certainly regret its stated target of 20 per cent
compound growth a year. Indeed the 20 per cent fall in its shares since
early March suggests the market already has its doubts. It is thus natural
to look with suspicion on last week's bid for Securiguard.
The argument is beguiling. Rentokil needs a new source of growth, not least
to offset the impact of the recession in Europe. Last year's profits were
flattered, not only by currency gains, but also because Rentokil took the
last available opportunity under the old accounting standards to make an
extraordinary provision of Pounds 7.8m to cover the cost of meeting US
environmental standards. Its accumulation of net cash inhibits growth, while
the company is now large enough to need more than bolt-on acquisitions.
Hence the interest in Securiguard, whose operating margin of 5 per cent
compares with 25 per cent at Rentokil.
Assuming the bid eventually succeeds, Rentokil would have to raise
Securiguard's margins significantly to justify its move. That is quite a
challenge. Securiguard's cleaning focuses on the local authority market
which is price rather than quality sensitive. Nor is there any certainty
that companies will pay, as Rentokil believes, a premium for a quality
security package. It would not do to write Rentokil's chances off too soon.
At constant exchange rates earnings grew 20 per cent last year: turnover in
the recession-bound UK was up 7 per cent, operating profit up a commendable
12. Still, on a historic multiple of 23, the company cannot afford to
falter.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the Marlboro cowboy revealed as a bit of a wimp and BSN admitting
mineral water may be little more than water after all, worry about the
demise of the brand is flavour of the month. UK investors, though, have had
nothing to learn that they did not already know. For years, the competitive
UK food market has stripped commodity businesses and poorly-managed brands
of their value. Companies, like Hillsdown Holdings and Ranks Hovis
McDougall, have suffered in this way.
UK food retailers have been in the vanguard of developing private label
products: J. Sainsbury's Novon detergent range shows it can penetrate the
best defended markets. The emergence of more discount retailers will further
exacerbate competition. Their growth may win them greater buying discounts
which they can pass on to shoppers, building structural deflation into the
system. The recent spell of low inflation  - and even severe deflation in
some products - has made life painful for brand managers.
Such trends mean industry polarisation will accelerate. Only strong and
innovative manufacturers, such as Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes, are likely
to survive in the branded game. Failure, though, does not necessarily spell
financial ruin. Northern Foods shows respectable returns can be achieved
from manufacturing retailers' own label products. The beneficiaries of the
branded manufacturers' discomfort should logically be the food retailers.
Curiously, the stock market has de-rated their shares too. This may reflect
the turn in the investment cycle. It also suggests the big superstores' own
brand franchises are threatened by the discounters.

FT  24 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Stores of value
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some sparkling results and upbeat trading statements from UK retailers last
week were not enough to lift the gloom from the stores sector. April's
consumer spending figures were a touch disappointing, but they followed
something of a mini-boom in April last year. About the only concrete bad
news was the average earnings figures which suggested that wage increases
are likely to continue at a very low level. But the rumblings about public
spending cuts also reminded investors that consumers are likely to be
squeezed.
Marks and Spencer's announcement that its wage bill would rise by 6 per cent
also focused attention on costs, and the success of its 'outstanding value'
promotion on price competition. Both will be critical factors for a sector
unlikely to return to 1980s-style easy living. Marks has turned up the heat
on those clothing retailers which rely on high margins. Kingfisher's
consistent low pricing efforts in DIY, perfume and sun care products are
doing the same to Texas, Do It All and Boots. The recent spat about the
relative prices of CDs in the UK and the US has brought the high cost of UK
retailing to consumers' attention.
Perhaps most significantly the advent of several US discount retailing
formats such as Warehouse Clubs will undermine the price structure of a wide
range of retailers. Marks and Kingfisher have at least focused on the
problem. Sleepier stores which do not dominate their categories with low
cost operations had better wake up.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Cambodians defy poll threat by Khmer Rouge guerrillas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH, BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of thousands of Cambodians, guarded by United Nations troops,
flocked to vote yesterday in the country's freest and fairest election since
independence from France 40 years ago.
They braved the threat of attack by Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who have vowed
to disrupt the polls, and were undeterred by torrential rain at the start of
the monsoon season.
In spite of at least three violent incidents, officials of the UN
Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) were jubilant about the
electorate's enthusiasm and estimated that at least a third of the 4.8m
registered voters went to the polls yesterday.
The voting, which continues until Friday, is the culmination of a Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.20bn) UN operation to bring peace and democracy to Cambodia
following an accord signed by the four main Cambodian factions in Paris in
1991.
Cambodians will elect a 120-member assembly, which should draft a new
constitution within three months and then give birth to a new government.
The extreme leftwing Khmer Rouge was one of four parties to sign the Paris
peace agreement, but it later reneged on the deal, refused to disarm its
guerrillas and threatened to disrupt the election.
'I would say the Khmer Rouge have failed today,' said Mr Charles Twining,
chief of the US mission in Cambodia. 'That simply leaves the Khmer Rouge in
the forest.'
Mr Yasushi Akashi, Untac chief, said the turnout was 'very, very
gratifying', although he acknowledged that a fifth of Cambodian territory
was inaccessible to Untac and the election process because of Khmer Rouge
threats.
The two main contenders in the election are the present communist
administration - installed by Vietnam when it invaded and overthrew the
brutal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 - and Funcinpec, the royalist party which
joined the Khmer Rouge in an uneasy alliance against the Vietnamese
occupation until the 1991 peace agreement.
Mr Chea Sim, leader of the governing Cambodian People's party, was greeted
with silence when he arrived to vote at a sports stadium in the centre of
Phnom Penh. But the crowd cheered when Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the
Funcinpec leader, arrived at the same polling station.
In the southern province of Kampot about 100 Khmer Rouge guerrillas briefly
occupied a polling station, and fired into a ballot box.
In Poipet on the Thai border, two voters were slightly injured when mortar
rounds apparently fired by the Khmer Rouge exploded near a polling station.
On Friday night, two Chinese UN staff were killed by what appears to have
been a Khmer Rouge rocket aimed at a police station in Kompong Cham
province. The attack was condemned by the UN Security Council.
Tony Walker adds from Beijing: China also condemned the attack yesterday.
Beijing's criticism did not refer directly to the Khmer Rouge, but this
incident seems certain further to cool relations with its former close
allies, and could even lead to a complete break.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Leading Article: No U-turns on the railway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has scarcely a friend in the world when it comes to the
privatisation of British Rail. That much has long been evident. Now even its
own backbenchers are in ferment, threatening to revolt against the Railways
Bill in parliament this week if the government fails to accept new clauses
that would protect network-wide rail-card schemes and give British Rail the
right to bid for franchises.
The fact that such hostility exists is hardly surprising. It is an
indictment of the government's failure to provide satisfactory answers to
many legitimate questions about how privatisation will work. The consequent
vacuum of information has been filled by the belief that the complexities of
the government's plans will far outweigh any benefits they bring, and that
passengers will be left worse off than ever.
This is a more than a pity, for some simple truths have been forgotten as a
result. One is that few people believed Britain's railways were satisfactory
before the government came up with its privatisation plans. Another is that
few people thought the railways had been satisfactory at any time during
their 45 years of state ownership, whatever the political complexion of the
government in office. A third is that few who give much serious thought to
the matter would forecast a change in this state of affairs in the next 45
years, particularly in the light of the competing demands on public
expenditure which the railways must expect to face.
Freedom of access
It remains the case that privatisation offers the best hope of giving
Britain the railways it wants. A simple sell-off would have been one way of
achieving that, but the scale of British Rail's losses militated against
that option, and it would simply have converted a public-sector monopoly
into a private-sector one. So instead, the government has decided to create
an environment for competition by separating track infrastructure from train
operations and giving freedom of access to all would-be train operators. The
same trend is taking hold across Europe.
In fact, the first stages of this process constitute a very modest step
towards privatisation. For the present, virtually all the railway's assets,
including the tracks and the passenger trains, are staying in state
ownership.
All the private sector is being asked to do is to bid for franchises to
operate passenger services on British Rail's behalf. But even this small
step brings the prospect of significant benefits - worthwhile improvements
in productivity, a management motivated by financial rewards, and, it is to
be hoped, the beginning of private-sector investment in rolling stock. And
because the chosen structure sensibly avoids a 'big bang' approach in favour
of a piecemeal allocation of franchises over a period of years, there will
be every opportunity to learn from experience as privatisation progresses.
In short, for all the understandable concerns about the government's plans,
the real danger is not that they go too far, but that they may not go far
enough.
Risk of concessions
Clearly a government with a small majority must take heed of political
reality. But the risk is that each time it wards off critics with
concessions on issues such as the preservation of discounted rail-card
schemes for special interest groups, it restricts the commercial freedom of
would-be train operators and so diminishes the likelihood that privatisation
will succeed.
Worst of all would be to accept the backbench amendment suggesting that
British Rail should be allowed to bid for franchises. This is a wholly
unnecessary provision since it will in any case be open to British Rail's
existing management to participate fully in the privatised railway through
management buy-outs. The amendment could easily lead to an outcome whereby
the operation of most trains remained in the public sector, so eliminating
the opportunity for introducing private-sector capital and blunting the
potential for private-sector management to get to work on running efficient
and innovative services.
Those now calling for a U-turn on railway privatisation must explain how
preserving the political and managerial status quo is going to deliver the
improved services everyone would like to see.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Credit where it is needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sitting in the front room of her council house in Coniston Grove, Bradford,
Ms Lesley Clayton watches Pounds 200 counted out in front of her. The money,
which she will use to buy clothes and birthday presents for her two small
sons, is to be repaid at Pounds 6 a week for a year. The annualised
percentage rate of interest (APR) on the loan is 168.2 per cent, writes John
Gapper.
Ms Clayton, an unemployed single parent living on social security of Pounds
88 a week, is content with the terms. It is the second time the credit
company Provident Financial has lent her money. She did not consider asking
a bank. 'I've never dealt with a bank. If you don't have capital, they won't
lend to you. You can't blame them really,' she says.
Ms Clayton's assessment of the attitude of banks towards the unemployed and
the low-paid is increasingly accurate. Many were welcomed by banks in the
1980s - 45 per cent of the 1.3m customers who repay loans weekly to
Provident Financial have cheque accounts. But now they are less in demand.
'In an ideal world, we wouldn't have them on the books,' says a banker.
Yet as banks concentrate their sales efforts on 'high net worth'
professionals, other lenders are flourishing. Provident Financial is the
biggest provider of unsecured credit to poor people. The company, founded in
1880 by a non-conformist philanthropist, raised profits on weekly credit by
18 per cent to Pounds 45.7m last year.
Despite criticism of collected credit by consumer groups, 'the Provi', as it
is known, also appears to be popular. In a survey by an independent market
research company, its service was rated at 4.5 on a scale of 1 to 5 by its
customers, compared to an average 3.8 rating for other banks. Ms Clayton
agrees. 'They show you what you're letting yourself in for,' she says.
The person showing her is Mrs Eileen Bosher, one of 10,000 collecting agents
for Provident. Ms Bosher, who lives nearby, spends about 15 hours a week
collecting weekly payments from her 88 customers. She earns abut Pounds 95 a
week from the 7.5 per cent commission on gross collections of Pounds 1,250.
'It's a bit like being a social worker. I even do the shopping for some,'
she says.
Provident makes small loans - an average of Pounds 330. For most banks,
loans of less than Pounds 1,000 do not cover costs. The APR rates on its
Handycash loans range from 105.4 for a two - year term to 353.9 for a
20-week loan. Provident emphasises that its APR rates include all charges,
in contrast with banks' rates on overdrafts which are around 20 per cent.
It allows borrowers to miss occasional payments, but is strict about
pursuing loans. Although it makes full provisions against all loans more
than 12 weeks in arrears, it takes borrowers it believes are capable of
paying to court. It also insists on agents continuing to call years after a
loan has been written off, even in search of repayments as low as 50p.
In the 1960s, Provident diversified into retailing through catalogues and
stores where vouchers could be exchanged for goods. It feared that the
ending of the weekly wage packet in manual jobs could doom weekly credit by
taking cash from households. But the fears were unfulfilled, and it is now
disposing of catalogue and store businesses to concentrate on cash loans.
Mr Howard Bell, managing director of personal credit, says it is returning
to its roots partly because it no longer feels threatened by banks. 'Banks
moved down market in the 1980s, and they got their fingers burned,' he says.
He says banks lack a network of local agents to judge the risk of unsecured
lending to people with few or no assets.
Provident is also at odds with banks in its scepticism about selling other
products through its network. Having experimented with agents selling
products such as holidays, it has given up. 'Our agents are simple folk, and
everything else is more complex than cash loans. If people want to buy
insurance, we'll lend them the money,' says Mr Bell.
As banks spurn the poorer customers they took on in the 1980s, the prospects
of the 900 credit companies that lend to 4m people appears healthy. Banks'
increased use of credit ratings to repel such customers is only likely to
add to demand for Mrs Bosher's loans. 'Let's face it, we're all human.
Anyone can have a bad time,' she says.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton and Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and four fellow members of the United Nations Security Council have
acknowledged, by the intensity of their weekend negotiations over Bosnia,
that the moment of truth in this war has arrived. The 13-point communique
proclaims international determination to contain the war. But the clearest
if unstated message from Washington is that this common front is more facade
than reality, largely because the US is unwilling to get involved on the
ground.
If there is any chance of exerting effective pressure on the Bosnian Serbs
through non-military means, it lies in tightening the blockade at the
Bosnian frontier. Ostensibly, Serbia has now changed sides, backed the
Vance-Owen peace plan and declared its intention to put pressure on the
Serbs in Bosnia, by co-operating in the imposition of international
sanctions. The statements of the Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic,
cannot be taken at face value, however. Preliminary indications are that he
is not carrying out his newly declared policy.
Monitoring sanctions
If tighter sanctions are to be effective, they must obviously be monitored
internationally at the Serbia-Bosnia frontier. But the Yugoslav authorities
have already announced their rejection of international monitors, and the
Washington communique meekly indicates that there will be no attempt to
override Serbian objections. If this is a measure of the determination of
the international community, we may be sure that Mr Milosevic will conclude
that he is free to pursue a goal he has always pursued - a greater Serbia.
The five-power communique also endorses the concept of 'safe areas', but it
does so in terms so lukewarm that it is hard to believe that this is the
prelude to serious guarantees of territory for the Bosnian Moslems.
That Russia is considering sending troops is good news, though Russians,
traditionally allies of the Serbs, may not be ideally qualified for
protecting Moslem areas. That the US will not be sending forces is
decisively bad news. Safe areas cannot be protected except by putting troops
on the ground, and this policy cannot carry real political conviction unless
there is a military contribution from a wide range of countries. The
(unstated) US undertaking, that it may go so far as to use air power to help
to protect UN troops in the safe areas, is manifestly no substitute. It
merely reinforces the message that the US administration does not want to
get involved.
Clear message
President Clinton's wariness is understandable, to the extent that there are
no good options facing the outside world. But caution is not in itself a
policy, and by now American hesitation has become profoundly
counterproductive, because of the clear message of tacit acquiescence it
sends to the Serbs. An American contribution to an international contingent
for protecting the safe havens would reverse that message and so reinforce
the credibility of the undertaking that the numbers of soldiers required,
and the dangers facing them, might both be much reduced.
The European Community is under a similar imperative. So far the main burden
of Europe's military contribution to the humanitarian operations in the
former Yugoslavia has been borne by France, Britain and Spain, in that
order. Even if Germany can claim particular impediments, it must soon decide
whether to exercise the political responsibilities consonant with its newly
recovered sovereignty. The other member states should already be pulling
more weight, as required by the declared objectives of the Maastricht
treaty. In partnership with the UN, the European Community has been in the
forefront of international efforts to press for a settlement in the former
Yugoslavia. Logic and self-respect demand that all the member states which
can should live up to the responsibilities they have implicitly claimed.
This is a moment of truth, not just for the war in Bosnia, but for the
claims of the international community to promote a better world order. If
these efforts fail in Bosnia, then the US, the EC and the new Russia will
all bear a heavy responsibility. And the new but fragile role of the UN as
an instrument for peace-making in the post-cold war world will suffer a
lasting blow.

FT  24 MAY 93 / For richer, not poorer: UK banks are trying to increase
revenues by devoting more time to selling services to high earners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along Upper Grosvenor Street in London, near the chic hotels of Park Lane,
some familiar symbols have started to appear. A couple of brass plates
alongside the street's private banks now bear trademarks seen on suburban
high streets throughout the country. The British high street banks are
starting to treat richer customers differently.
Barclays has just joined Lloyds by opening a private bank for British
customers on Upper Grosvenor Street. The bank has started to make discreet
approaches to the richest individuals in its 2,200-branch network. It is
asking to manage the funds of those with Pounds 250,000 or more in liquid
assets. In return for substantial fees, it offers them an elite service.
Private banking services are one part of a much larger effort by British
banks to end a tradition of offering largely the same service to everyone.
For years, anyone who has walked into one of their 12,000 branches has been
given an account, the chance of an occasional chat with the manager and some
leaflets about other products.
This is now changing, as banks strive to sell more products and services.
Most believe they have wasted money by offering the same products through
the same delivery channels to all. They are trying to increase revenues by
allocating more management time to customers who are likely to repay the
effort, and devising new ranges of products to suit them.
Most banks think the most worthwhile customers are likely to be the
better-off. This does not mean just the wealthy who are enticed into private
banks. Banks such as Barclays and National Westminster have launched
experimental services for professional employees. They are being allocated
individual managers to deal with.
Few banks will admit this strategy of 'segmentation' means a reduced service
for mass market customer. Yet managers who now advise professionals will not
be advising others. 'Our more junior staff are being trained to a level
where they can deal with most customers' needs,' says Mr Geoff Ellerton,
Midland's planning director.
This drive is partly to cope with the spread of accounts in the 1980s. 'As a
colleague said the other day, 'Only posh people used to have bank accounts,'
' says Mr Larry Cattle, NatWest's head of customer relationships. But the
demise of weekly pay packets and competition to attract customers have
substantially widened access to accounts.
The democratisation of bank accounts did not matter much in the economic
expansion of the 1980s. Most people had disposable income for mortgages, and
banks could earn high levels of interest on their deposits. But with the
recession, many newer customers no longer have the surplus cash required for
profitable accounts.
Yet the drive is mainly an attempt to combat a basic problem with personal
customers: that they do not buy enough products. Most people are accustomed
to buying mortgages from building societies, and savings products from
insurers. They do not regard high street banks as retailers of a variety of
products in addition to money transmission services.
Thus Lloyds Bank sells life insurance products through its Black Horse
Financial Services to only 16 per cent of customers, although 61 per cent of
British people hold such policies. 'We are trying to ensure our customers do
not just spend a tiny amount of their disposable income with us,' says Mr
Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds.
The first step is to identify customers who may buy other products. Not
surprisingly, the banks' first target has been the better-off. All of them
insist that is not the sole criterion. 'It would be far too crude just to
divide our customers into socio-economic groups. People are different ages,
and come from different places,' says Mr Pitman.
Nonetheless, income is a prime factor. NatWest has divided its customers
into segments based on age, family status and income. The list comprises
students and graduates; independent young people; families with young
children; and the retired and those near retirement age. But its hardest
marketing effort is aimed at professionals without children.
'Banks are now working very hard to satisfy what the person with a bob or
two more wants,' says Mr Cattle. There are two reasons. First, such
customers have money for mortgages, insurance, and savings products. Second,
although they may not have bought these from their bank in the past, many
have limited time outside working hours to shop around.
The second step is to devise products that such customers will buy. The
traditional way of doing so among retailers is to develop a product to suit
the desired market segment. The difficulty for banks is that Midland tried
this approach in the 1980s and has abandoned it. Midland found neither staff
nor customers really understood the services it combined in single brands.
The brands were accounts called Orchard, Meridian and Vector. Vector, for
example, was intended for professionals, offering linked current and savings
accounts, with a free overdraft in return for a monthly fee. Midland also
produced a proliferation of products intended for different market segments.
By the end of the 1980s, it had 25 different savings accounts alone.
'We began to differentiate what we offered, but in the end we also confused
people,' says Mr Ellerton, 'New customers do not want a huge choice, they
want something quite simple'. It found its own staff were unable to
understand the products well enough to advise customers on what suited them.
The lesson learned by Midland is emphasised by Mr Pitman at Lloyds: A bank
sells a mixture of financial products and advice. The more complex the
product, the more expert the advice must be. This means banks cannot sell
their products the way supermarkets sell theirs. They must disentangle
delivery mechanisms to allocate more expertise to more complex products.
This had led to the third step. Banks are trying to ensure that managers
spend their time with customers who will pay for it - either directly or
indirectly. Both Barclays and NatWest are now experimenting with new
services for professional and managerial customers. They are being allocated
a manager who will visit them and then supervise their account.
Barclays charges Pounds 40 a year for what it calls its Premier service,
which now covers 16,000 customers. NatWest does not charge the customers to
whom it allocated 'personal account executives', but instead relies on
raising the value of the accounts by selling its financial products. Each
executive has a target of about Pounds 80,000 of new business a year.
Mr Gordon Rankin, Barclays' deputy director of personal sector marketing,
says the bank is aiming at customers who earn at least Pounds 30,000 a year.
'Of course, we recognise that very few are going to put all their financial
eggs in one basket, but we want to get a greater share,' he says. It
believes personal managers will achieve this objective.
But there is limited evidence so far. NatWest says that the value of
accounts managed by personal account executives rises after 18 months,
partly through the selling of other products and partly because cash
balances increase. Yet there is reason to doubt whether such customers will
buy many products from their banks, despite having the money to do so.
The problem is that professionals and managers are likely to be more
discriminating about what they buy. The TSB, which has relatively few
highly-paid customers, has been far more successful than other banks in
selling insurance and other financial products. About 90 per cent of its
customers are from outside the highest AB social groups. Yet one-third of
its customers who have life insurance bought it from TSB, roughly double the
proportion at Lloyds.
Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB's chief executive, rejects the view that banks should
concentrate on higher paid customers. He argues they will continue to shop
around for financial products. 'People with that amount of discrimination
demand the most competitively priced products,' he says. Mr Ellwood argues
the average TSB customer is more likely than a richer consumer to buy its
own products.
If so, the banks that are expending increasing amounts of management time on
the better-off face a stiff task. But they are already concentrating their
efforts on carefully chosen customers. And whether they succeed or not, they
have started to withdraw their old welcome for all-comers.

What's Dollars 20m between friends? Not much if the friends are the
creditors and administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation, it seems.
Unkind sorts might suggest that accountants Price Waterhouse can't add up,
since their letter to creditors last week suggests asset realisations of
Dollars 775m-Dollars 1,350m, while the accompanying detailed disclosure
document suggests a range of Dollars 781m-Dollars 1,364m. But the firm
assures Observer that the discrepancy is simply due to rounding the figures
to the nearest, hey, Dollars 25m.
One thing is certain. The discrepancy is nowhere near enough to cover all
the professional fees involved - more than Dollars 78m to date . . . and
rising.

Imagine the horror felt by gold bulls, who have been bellowing like mad
about the recent gold price rise, when the latest International Monetary
Fund statistics showed that in March Belgium's central bank had sold another
60 tonnes of the metal.
For there is one thing virtually guaranteed to send the gold price
spiralling back down again - any clear indication that central banks have
once again started to sell off their gold stocks, about 34,000 tonnes or 10
years' supply.
Belgium appeared to have chosen the moment when the gold price in US dollar
terms hit its lowest level in seven years for its third sale of central bank
bullion. It previously sold 127 tonnes in 1989 and 202 tonnes in 1992.
But there were sighs of relief all round when the Belgian bank admitted that
it had sold no gold. It had provided the IMF with the wrong figures because
of 'human error'.

Still on the subject of the captains of industry and their peccadillos, Tiny
Rowland's farewell article in The Observer yesterday was more interesting
for what the Lonrho chieftain left out, than what he said. The late Sir
Basil Smallpeice, who led the famous move to oust Tiny 20 years ago, does
not even rate a mention, for example.
However, Rowland does have one sound business tip picked up from his
one-time business partner Daniel Ludwig, the reclusive US shipping tycoon
who died last September: 'Never get into a pissing match with a skunk.'
'I haven't always found it easy to follow this sage advice,' admits the
75-year-old Rowland who obviously feels that in Ludwig he had met one
businessman who really understood him.

<TEXT>
It is not only a love of opera that GEC boss Lord Weinstock and soprano Dame
Elizabeth Schwarzkopf share. They also have a rather specific taste in
records judging by their choices for the BBC's Desert Island Discs
programme.
The German-born opera singer made a name for herself by choosing eight of
her own records, and yesterday Lord Weinstock restricted his musical
selections to the works of his old friend, the 51-year-old conductor
Ricarrdo Muti. He admitted he was a 'Muti groupie' and said that he had been
present at all the performances chosen. His choice of book was If This Be a
Man, by Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi, and his luxury was a photo album of
his family, friends and horses.
GEC seems to be on a bit of a roll at the moment judging by the improvement
in its share rating. Indeed, Lord W, 69 in July, let slip that he has just
had his office repainted.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Observer: An insider speaks out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So who knew what, and when? These are the questions being asked as Franz
Steinkuhler fights to retain his job as Germany's most powerful union boss
in the wake of the disclosures about his recent winning streak on the German
stock market.
Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the German Bundesbank, is in no
doubt that Steinkuhler must have had some idea of the impending decisions at
Daimler-Benz where he is on the supervisory board.
'As a private citizen I am convinced that Steinkuhler had information, for I
was myself deputy chairman of the supervisory board at VW during the 1970s,
and I know how it works. Of course there is no officially recorded
information,' he told Welt am Sonntag, the leading German Sunday newspaper.
Even if Steinkuhler did not know about the plans which led to a sharp rise
in the share price, there were others who probably knew something was afoot.
Prior to the event, Deutsche Bank chief executive Hilmar Kopper, whose group
has a big stake in Daimler, was asked about plans to do away with MAH, which
holds a big stake in Daimler. All he would say was 'watch this space'. But
two weeks before, Deutsche board member Ronaldo Schmitz had hinted to fund
managers in Dusseldorf that action was likely before Deutsche would do
anything to reduce its 28 per cent Daimler stake.
Pohl's real concern is that the allegations of insider-trading against
Steinkuhler could damage Germany's international reputation as a financial
centre, especially in the US. American investors found it hard enough to
understand why leading trade unionists were on the supervisory boards of
German companies in the first place, says Pohl.
If they now believed that such board members were speculating in the shares
of their companies, 'they will prefer to avoid the German share market
altogether'.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Two deficits worse than twice one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A three-month period of falling UK unemployment is still not enough to
establish that the peak has passed. The probability, however, is that
unemployment has levelled off.
Even that, however, is remarkable, given that unemployment is usually a
lagging indicator and that the forecasting fraternity expected much worse.
The main danger to UK recovery now lies in a delayed effect from the
European recession, which started after Britain's but is now of comparable
severity.
There is not all that much scope for domestic demand to rise more quickly.
The 5 per cent 'output gap' shown at the bottom of the table is the Bank of
England's central estimate of the gap between the actual level of output and
that consistent with a stable rate of inflation. This could be an
over-estimate and would have to be filled gradually and without more
sterling depreciation.
Some 3 percentage points of the gap corresponds to the UK current balance of
payments deficit. A sustainable recovery would involve taking up this part
of the slack with exports or import savings. There is thus, at most, 2 per
cent that could be taken up by an above-trend rise in domestic spending. If
growth is already, or is likely soon to be, above trend, there is, as the
National Institute for Economic and Social Research rightly says, little
scope for further stimulus.
The main longer-term problem comes, of course, from the twin deficits:
budget and balance of payments. The twins have long been familiar from
discussions of the US economy. What no one can say is whether they are like
a bomb on a very slow fuse - as in the US - or one liable to blow up early,
as in the UK in the 1970s.
The twin deficits have connected remedies: cutting the growth of spending,
or raising taxes. (If such curbs are in the end offset by higher
private-sector borrowing, they will still be worthwhile. For the balance of
payments 'problem' will then become a self-correcting private-sector one, as
the Treasury once correctly argued.)
The usual argument against restrictive fiscal measures is that they just
make a hole in the economy which would worsen the recession. That was the
valid argument for Norman Lamont's 'Augustinian' policy of Pounds 10bn pa of
deferred tax increases. But, now that there are fairly strong signs of
domestic recovery, it is time to start complementing them by a similar
spending package.
It so happens that, by one of those suspicious arithmetical coincidences,
the size of the current payments deficit, estimated by the NIESR at just
under 3 per cent of GDP, is almost identical to that part of the budget
deficit believed by the Treasury to be structural.
Many mainstream economists argue that freeing resources for exports and
import-saving will not be enough without another devaluation. That is highly
perverse counsel. Even the UK's ERM departure was widely seen as competitive
depreciation. A further dose would confirm the worst suspicions and help
unleash a beggar-my-neighbour trade and exchange-rate war.
If a further improvement in UK competitiveness is required, the most
promising route would be a rate of inflation below that of competitors.
Evidence that this is achievable is that UK pay costs per unit of output
have been falling by nearly 3 per cent a year.
There are more signs that UK industry is competitive already and that the
payments gaps reflects a combination of overseas recession and insufficient
UK capacity. In the 1980s, the UK share of world manufacturing exports was
stable or even rising slightly, in strong contrast to the 1970s. This is
despite the fact that the real exchange rate (measured by price
competitiveness) was much less favourable than it has since become.
UK budgetary retrenchment will not close the payments gap while Europe goes
into recession, but it will prepare the ground for improvement later and,
meanwhile, sustain confidence.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Letter: Threat posed by cuts in ECGD staffing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A J SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your story 'ECGD review' (May 20) requires some comment in order to
alert UK exporters to the likelihood that recent increases in the cover
available from the Export Credits Guarantee Department may prove difficult
to access if trade secretary Mr Michael Heseltine's review of staffing
levels results in reductions in the already overstretched workforce.
The business of ECGD has recently increased, in some areas by as much as 50
per cent, and this trend is expected to continue. Yet cuts in staffing were
already proposed before the launching of this new review. The fact that the
review may leave ECGD so understaffed that it will be unable to provide the
promised service to exporters is not the only cause for concern. Following
numerous previous reviews, morale among ECGD staff is extremely low, the
result being that those with the most experience will take any opportunity
to leave.
The impression given by your article is that the review will only concern
itself with 'overheads'. This is not the case. The number of staff who
directly deal with exporters will also be reviewed.
Morale is worst hit in ECGD's Cardiff offices, which are now threatened with
closure. Instead of announcing a further review, it would be of more
assistance if Mr Heseltine provided these staff with a guarantee that ECGD's
operation will remain open there.
In order to ensure that the government provides a level of export credit
support to UK marketers which is comparable to that available to our
overseas competitors, it is not enough just to announce increases in the
amount of cover offered and reductions in premium rates. The government must
also motivate the staff who provide the service. A J Sharpe,

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your correspondent, Mary Bowerman (Accountancy Column, May 20),
correctly identified that the National Audit Office audits The Audit
Commission, but questioned whether this was not 'a rather incestuous
relationship'.
We have no evidence to support this assertion. We have attempted to be
accessible by promoting the publication of internal and external assessments
of our performance. We are subject to periodic financial management and
performance reviews by our sponsoring ministry, the Department of the
Environment. One such review has just been completed and we are encouraging
the ministry to publish the report as part of the process of opening up the
Audit Commission to public scrutiny.
It is for government, and not the commission, to define our audit
arrangements. If it were to respond to this demand and create a new
independent auditing body for this purpose then we would welcome the new
arrangement.
But I wonder how long after its formation we may expect a further article in
the FT asking who audits the new auditing body?

FT  24 MAY 93 / Letter: Assessment of UK beer prices supported by the facts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs JOHN WAKELY and CHRISTOPHER WICKHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to Robin Simpson's criticism (Letters. May 19) of our
report on the European brewing industry ('UK brewers top list for dear
beer', April 5), let us point out a few facts.
Productivity figures which feature in our report came from data published by
Efta/Combined Statistics, a body that receives its information from brewing
societies, including the UK Brewers Society.
On price, we deliberately focused on list price to aid European comparisons.
Is Robin Simpson suggesting the UK brewers give a larger discount to
supermarkets than, say, German brewers give to German supermarkets?
In summary, the UK Brewers Society seems to suggest that UK beer wholesale
prices are not high. It would appear the UK government disagrees - thus, the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission's supply-of-beer order which resulted in
extensive pub disposals by brewers. Foreign brewers disagree - none has made
any move to acquire a UK brewer. UK customers disagree - the trade deficit
in beer continues to worsen. Finally, the stock market appears to disagree,
otherwise the share price of brewers would not be so low.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Where federalism isn't a dirty word: Whether a sea change is
likely when Belgium assumes the EC presidency in July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest bogeyman of British Euro-sceptics is likely to be a portly,
bespectacled 52-year-old Fleming with a passion for soccer and federalism.
He is Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, which takes over the
presidency of the European Community in six weeks.
Mr Dehaene's arrival at the helm of the Community could mark a sea change in
the management of the EC. It will follow 12 months of cautious EC captaincy,
first by Britain, then Denmark, both of which had to navigate through
tortured domestic debates about the content of the Maastricht treaty on
European union.
Mr Dehaene believes the Danish vote in favour of Maastricht last week
provides a firm foundation for a more positive presidency. As he said in a
speech on Thursday, the best response to the EC's political and economic
problems is 'not less, but more Europe'.
With that in mind, Belgium has made implementation of the treaty its main
objective in the presidency, whether or not the British parliament has
approved the text by the time Belgium takes over on July 1.
On paper, Belgium's credentials for leading a renewed drive for closer union
are impressive. But recently, economic problems and separatist pressures -
notably in the Dutch-speaking north - have taken their toll on the country's
longstanding reputation as a laboratory for practical European federalism.
One of the six founder members of the Community, Belgium has been part of a
formal economic union (with Luxembourg and the Netherlands) since 1944 and
of a full currency union (with Luxembourg) since 1921. What is more, two
weeks ago, the country's parliament approved reforms which transform Belgium
into 'a federal state'.
This is the sort of record which has British opponents of closer integration
reaching for their invective. But, in constrast with British Euro-sceptics,
ordinary Belgians' principal fear is not that federalism will increase the
power of the central state, but that it might abolish it.
A month ago, thousands of Belgians marched in Brussels against separatism.
They worry that the reforms will provoke a split between Dutch-speaking
Flanders in the north, and French-speaking Wallonia in the south, with the
bilingual capital - a region in its own right - torn between the two.
The chances of this happening are easily exaggerated by outsiders. The
reforms are part of an evolution, the latest phase of which began in the
1960s with calls for more autonomy for Flanders and Wallonia and for the
Dutch- and French-speaking communities. Legislative changes, including the
latest, have introduced direct elections for regional parliaments and left
the central government with responsibility only for the main lines of
foreign and defence policy, internal security, the budget and social
security.
It is true that a number of prominent politicians - most notably Mr Luc Van
den Brande, the head of the Flemish government - see this latest reform as
part of a wider process which could lead to even greater fiscal and
financial autonomy for the regions. But this is unlikely to happen soon.
For Belgium, the development of European political union is essential to the
success of its own constitutional reforms. 'There is no contradiction
between the reform of the Belgian state and the European integration
process,' says Mr Dehaene. 'In my view, they are complementary.'
He explains that both Belgian federalism and closer European political union
should involve a decision-making hierarchy which responds to the needs of
citizens - in other words, subsidiarity. In contrast with their counterparts
in some other member states, Belgian politicians are trying to delegate
appropriate responsibilities both to Europe and the regions.
But although Belgium sees no contradiction between its own brand of
federalism and the EC's objectives, its experience may illustrate in
miniature some of the potential problems of closer European union, based on
subsidiarity.
In Belgium, the process has been slow, and compromises have resulted in a
very complicated political structure.
For Mr Dehaene, this spirit of compromise is an asset and the complexity of
the solutions a necessary evil, because it avoids damaging confrontation.
But the bickering between Belgian politicians on the often incomprehensible
detail of the latest constitutional reforms has alienated the Belgian
people. That was part of the reason why centrist parties lost support in the
November 1991 general election, and extremist and maverick politicians
cashed in.
Some senior Belgian politicians fear the latest reforms will merely
aggravate that. As Mr Pierre Harmel, a former Belgian prime minister and
elder statesman, pointed out this month: 'Some of these reforms are going to
make the healthy management (of the country), and co-operation between the
federal state and its components very difficult.'
Belgium is already suffering early symptoms of such a malaise. The three
regional governments have just managed to arrange a meeting to discuss their
different responsibilities, after two months of argument about who should
invite whom.
At the same time, as Mr Dehaene admits, arguments about the economic balance
of the federal state threaten to upset the political consensus.
Flanders, economically more powerful than Wallonia, argues it should not
have to 'subsidise' social security payments in the south. Mr Dehaene
insists social security rules will continue to apply uniformly throughout
the country.
The debate echoes the EC's often-acrimonious discussions about 'cohesion'
funding for poorer member states. In Belgium, the imbalance means national
decision-making, notably on budget measures, is blighted by the need to keep
both sides happy: raising taxes punishes the north, while cutting welfare
penalises the south.
Just such an impasse nearly derailed the government itself in March during a
cabinet debate on how to cut Belgium's large budget deficit in line with
tough Maastricht economic criteria. Mr Dehaene had to offer the resignation
of his centre-left government to persuade the coalition partners to agree an
austerity package.
Such structural difficulties - and the complexity of the Belgian federal
solution - are bound to have an impact on the six-month presidency.
Mr Dehaene has already made clear that, in areas where Belgium's regions now
have responsibility for international relations, they will be represented at
EC councils, further prolonging and complicating the lengthy round-table
discussions at meetings of, say, culture ministers.
Britain and, to a lesser extent, Denmark - both criticised for putting
self-interest above the spirit of compromise - will be watching carefully to
see how the Community's most enthusiastic member manages the next six
months.
There are already some indications that Belgium's aspirations to run a
neutral presidency, free of self-interest, may be only skin-deep. Although
preparations for the next phase of European monetary union (Emu) are a top
priority for the Belgian presidency, it is Belgium which has suggested in
the past week that those criteria limiting debt, budget deficits and
inflation may have to be amended if recession continues.
Mr Dehaene says Belgium will not propose a debate on the subject. But the
fact that Belgian ministers have already indicated their concerns about the
Emu conditions shows that even the most enthusiastic EC members cannot
always subordinate their domestic problems to federal ambitions.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Letter: BBC's Business Breakfast - its audience and its
objectives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL GIBBS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Financial Times is regarded - rightly - by most people in business
as a journal of record. It is unfortunate therefore that the review by Bruce
Fireman of BBC's Business Breakfast (Arts: Television, May 19) should have
drifted so far from the standards of accuracy and fair reporting which the
paper normally sets for itself.
First, let me correct factual errors. It is not true, as Mr Fireman says,
that 'Business Breakfast has an average of only 199,000 viewers'. According
to the industry figures, our audience ranges from 200,000 at 6am to 400,000
at 7am. The weekly audience reach - the number of people who tune in for
some part of the programme - is around 1m.
Now the distortions: It is simply not a fair description to say that we
present national, international and local news, sport and weather, broken up
with reports from our correspondents around the world. The non-business
components account for about 18 minutes of an hour's programming.
Mr Fireman glibly suggests that the presenters are arithmetically challenged
because in our market reports there is occasionally a difference between the
figures which are read out and those which appear on the screen. The
explanation is simple - the data we are giving comes from a live screen
which is being continuously updated. The presenter reads directly from the
screen. The studio graphics system takes a little time to convert the
figures into caption form.
He says that we have fallen back on the idea of importing journalists as
experts. We have not. But when it is clear that the most knowledgeable
person on any subject is a journalist, we turn to that journalist.
Finally, Mr Fireman charges us with failing to do something we are not
attempting to do. He suggests that we should realise - as Earl Brian of the
Financial News Network in the US did - that 'the real demand for a daily
business programme was from the sort of people who sat around watching the
screens in stockbrokers' offices'. He must be aware that the reason FNN went
bust was because it failed to find a viable audience.
While we are interested in being watched in the City, we are also concerned
to address a much larger public by making business, economic and industrial
news accessible to the widest possible audience.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: Heart of the Church of England - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are not many architects who have written the biography of one of their
clients. Sir Herbert Baker (1862-1946) is the exception with his book Cecil
Rhodes by his architect, published in 1934. The meeting between Baker and
Rhodes in South Africa in the 1890s was crucial for both of them. Rhodes saw
in the English architect the man to create his dream of an Imperial culture
and architecture in southern Africa. It was through Rhodes that Baker
acquired his knowledge of ancient classical architecture, since Rhodes sent
Baker off on a tour in 1899 to look at Rome, Paestum, Agrigentum, Thebes and
Athens as well as ancient Egypt. The story of this shared vision of the role
of architecture by both architect and patron is a revealing and fascinating
one.
Rhodes' vision extended beyond architecture and politics to the permanent
encouragement of learning through the Rhodes Scholarships at Oxford. It was
appropriate that Rhodes House in Oxford, where his scholars live, should
have been designed by Baker in 1929 in an unusual blend of classical and
Cotswold styles.
These thoughts about Herbert Baker and that curious world of 'Scouting for
Boys' Imperialism that he shared with Rhodes, have been prompted by a recent
visit to one of Sir Herbert Baker's masterpieces in London: Church House,
Westminster, which was completed in 1940, and has recently been completely
refurbished.
The Church of England does not have a Vatican; if it did it would be a
combination of the offices of the Church Commissioners, Church House,
Westminster Abbey and Lambeth Palace. In fact Church House has become
increasingly important in the life of the Church of England as it is now the
permanent home of the General Synod and its Boards and Councils. As the
Church of England seems now to define theology by the strange and unreliable
processes of human democracy, this home of the Church's Parliament has
acquired extraordinary significance.
In 1988 a decision was made to sell off Church House in much the same way as
the Church has sold so much of its property. But this decision was
determinedly challenged by the remarkable Mr Roy Lyon, a member of the Synod
from Liverpool. He sensed the disastrous consequences of such a pointless
move and fought like a tiger to persuade the authorities to change their
minds. It was like David and Goliath - a victory for reason against
bureaucracy and the property market.
Sir Herbert Baker was a contemporary and sometime collaborator (in New
Delhi) of Sir Edwin Lutyens. The two men were to fall out in Delhi - perhaps
friendly co-operation on that scale was doomed. Both men produced a vast
number of important buildings in Britain and the Empire. Both men were
building at a time when craftmanship was still at a high level. Both men, in
different ways, wanted to reinterpret architectural traditions for the
Imperial age. Baker believed in associational architecture; Lutyens believed
in the pure aesthetics of architecture. Lutyens was the better architect.
This is not to say that Baker was a bad architect. If as thorough a
reappraisal of his work was to be carried out as has been started by
historians looking at Lutyens' achievements, then Baker's achievements might
also shine. Church House is a very characteristic Baker building. He took
the commission very seriously and wrote, with no modesty at all, 'I was very
happy at having this opportunity in perhaps my last great work of expressing
in the fabric of the building some little of the story and the ideals, as I
conceived them, of the Church of England.'
Baker's expression of ideals largely takes the form of heraldry, symbolism,
inscriptions and an enthusiasm for Rupert Brooke. He collaborated with the
sculptor Charles Wheeler and the artist Thomas Monnington to embellish his
building. Like so much of Baker's work - South Africa House in Trafalgar
Square, India House in the Aldwych and the Bank of England - the symbolism
is only skin deep. Handsome though the circular assembly hall is in Church
House, it is not a great piece of architecture. What is memorable is the
great golden inscription taken from the old Church Service Book: 'Holy is
the true light and passing wonderful, lending radiance to them that endured
in the heat of the conflict; from Christ they inherit a home of unfading
splendour, wherein they rejoice with gladness evermore.'
Baker saw this beauty as taking the form of what he called in his memoirs,
'a galaxy of heraldry and symbols representing the different centres of the
Empire'. Somewhere at the centre of this galaxy was the Church of England.
The chapel is the most successful part of Church House, with its stalls for
all the bishops and an altar which is a slab of black marble carried on the
shoulders of eight winged angels. As at the chapel for Haileybury School and
the sanctuary at Pretoria Cathedral, Baker has designed here a curved apse
with a sense of spaciousness and dignity.
I greatly enjoyed seeing the interiors of Church House because - although
they can all now be hired for conferences and functions, and they have been
well modernised and refurbished - they are not easily visible. What
interested me most of all was the strange period atmosphere created by Baker
for the peculiar world of official Anglicanism and English Imperialism. God
and the royal family are intermingled in an English dream world of order and
history. Church House is reticent behind its flint facade on Dean's Yard but
within its heart are passions that are only hinted at in the architecture
and sculpture. Sacrifice and service and the safety of democratic religion
are all here in a building that conceals a potent message beneath its
comfortable surfaces.

What would we do without BBC2? It is beginning to look like the last bastion
of intelligent programming.
Tonight it continues the Crime and Punishment short season with two
likely-looking offerings. Horizon (BBC2, 8pm) is subtitled 'Wot U Looking
At?', that popular greeting familiar from almost all venues featuring
contact sports, pop music and Oxbridge May balls.
It's a stitch-up (BBC2, 9pm) is an inventive attempt to bring the arcane
obscurities of the judicial system into closer focus, by turning it into a
game show. But everything that happens to the hapless defendant is quite
accurate and rather unfunny.
But for bad taste, tonight's Singles (ITV, 10.40pm) is unbeatable. The
unwitting buffoon of this edition is Nick, who believes that dressing up as
a bear will help him find true love - or at least quick sex. Compellingly
awful and genuinely more damaging than Arnold Schwarzenegger's biceps.
To end the evening, Channels of resistance (C4, 10.55pm) is the final
programme in a splendid documentary series examining the workings of
television.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: Mozart in the round - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The big event of the first BOC Covent Garden Festival is the
specially-mounted production by British Youth Opera of The Magic Flute in
Freemasons' Hall. The recent vogue for seeking out 'authentic' settings for
opera - Aida at Luxor, say - promotes a kind of artistic tourism that at its
banal worst can work crushing restrictions on the audience's own creative
imagination.
In advance, one feared that the staging of an opera imbued with Masonic
symbolism in the London home of the United Grand Lodge of England might risk
just such touristic banality. Happily, such fears were groundless. This is a
hugely enjoyable Flute, and the use of Freemasons' Hall has in no way
limited its artistic vision.
It is indeed intriguing to sit beneath ceiling and stained-glass windows
rich in images already well-known to every Flute-lover, but the advantages
of this space for opera performance turn out to be much more basic ones.
With its galleried arena configuration and acoustics reverberant without
cloudiness, Freemasons' Hall proves itself an inspiring location for opera
in the round; and the British Youth Opera production team - producer Jamie
Hayes, designer Ruari Murchison, lighting director Paul Pyant - have taken
up that inspiration with wit, economy and flair.
Like the best of Earl's Court or Wembley opera productions, this Flute
catches fire from the populist nature of the performance circumstances. A
simple pyramid-shape crowns the centre stage area, on which the action
unfolds at speed, with flashes of light and puffs of smoke to signal the
scene-changes. No less but also no more is made of the opera's Masonic
rituals than aptly chimes with the overall production stance.
It is a Flute in modern dress (the Queen and her Ladies in Zandra Rhodes
black leather and lace, the temple priests in suits with yellow shirts and
shawls) and in Jeremy Sams's sparkling modern English translation. Apart
from a disappointing marionette representation of the wild animals, it all
comes together to provide fresh, truthful insights into the opera's many
levels of meaning.
Under Jane Glover's alert, springy baton, the musical character of the
performance is exactly gauged. Thomas Randle's manly, poetic Tamino is its
star; Rosemary Joshua's bright-toned Pamina, Elisabeth Vidal's clean-toned
Queen and Jonathan Veira's jolly, roly-poly Papageno bulk large among its
assets. Good Ladies and chorus, excellent (real) Boys. There is a particular
sound made by a large audience - of pleasure, sympathy, happiness - as it
falls under the sway of this opera. It was a sound much heard on Saturday
evening.
*
Mozart similarly divested of proscenium-arch formalities, Mozart not in the
round but on the Queen Elizabeth Hall's open thrust-stage, is to be heard
and seen in the current revival of Opera Factory's 1991 Marriage of Figaro
production, conducted by Mark Wigglesworth. The blessings here prove rather
more mixed. By plumping out the stage with Aguas Frescas household
activities around the main scenes, David Freeman transforms the opera into
an Ayckbourn 18th-century farce with score by Mozart.
It is keenly, at times brilliantly done. For my taste, however, it is
hectically over-detailed, and its amplifications of character and situation
end up by somehow limiting imaginative response to the emotional content of
the music: in this case, more increasingly becomes less. The strength of the
revival lies in its fine principals - Geoffrey Dolton's rubber-faced Count,
Mary Hegarty's endearing, limpid Cherubino, Susannah Waters's quicksilver
Susanna, above all Janis Kelly's Countess, who with a look, a gesture, a
vocal inflection reveals more of Mozartian meaning than all of Freeman's
narrative ingenuities put together.
(Magic Flute, Freemasons' Hall, WC2, royal gala perfor- mance this evening;
Figaro, Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1, in repertory until June 12, then
Birmingham and Reading)

FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: Bruce Springsteen - Rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Boss is back. No, not Margaret Thatcher - I can't imagine her in a black
vest doing the business in the Milton Keynes Bowl - but Bruce Springsteen,
dropping into middle England for his only visit this year.
You know where you are with Springsteen. He may be one of the dinosaurs of
pop, with his man-of-the-people, belt-and-braces, rock and roll, but there
has to be one big star who sings for the guy on the petrol pump, the girl at
the supermarket check-out. And although a 44-year-old millionaire might not
be the obvious candidate, Springsteen gives his all. He looks so much the
part, the muscular trucker who would stop to help a buddie with a blow-out,
although his designer stubble has been cultivated into an Errol Flynnish
beard and moustache.
The raspy voice is now almost a croak, but at the perfect moment he cracks
the mirror between the star and his fans, darting across the stage like a
young 'un, dangling over the ravine to press flesh, and flopping into the
throng before being restrained by two hefties. He blows his harp, he belts
his guitar, he leers into the mike, and sweats for us. He injects total
passion into his songs of urban alienation, of the American dream unstuck,
of innocence betrayed by the system. He is the American rebel whom time has
converted into the American hero, even for the Establishment. And he seems
to enjoy it all so much.
There is the odd sign of ageing. The subdued acoustic introduction where he
seemed to parody Bob Dylan; the songs that dwell on the lack of choice on
television as much as unemployment; the rather disappointing announcement
that his message for the people of Britain is 'everybody needs somebody to
love'; the need for an interval after only 70 minutes. He also tried to
inject some unconvincing gospel into his act with 'Satan's Jewelled Crown':
sentiment is not his strength.
As twilight darkens, the man pulls out his heavy guns, those dramatic
soaring rock ballads that may not be immediately distinguishable but which
represent one of the most compelling riffs in contemporary music. You really
believe 'The night is made for lovers' while 'The River' seems like the
short story that sums up America. It may be an illusion: it is getting
rather cold, and your neighbours in the throng are crashing down like
drunken ninepins.
But that is a great Springsteen attraction. He makes mundane reality heroic
while really it is sitting for hours in a Milton Keynes car park waiting for
the world to go home.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: Radiant at 100 - Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The music of Dutilleux is Gallic refinement at its most quintessential, hard
to bring off without finely-tuned orchestral playing. We found that out a
couple of years ago, when the Orchestre de Paris came to the Proms and
turned the composer's Second Symphony into a thick and congested melange of
noise.
On Saturday more music by Dutilleux - his Timbres, espace, mouvement - came
to the Royal Albert Hall, but this time it shone with crystalline radiance.
The improvement was thanks to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, playing
with all the fastidious care that the Parisians lacked. This is a comparison
worth making, as there is a tendency not to judge the British regional
orchestras on an international level, which may be unfair. Several major EC
countries do not have even one orchestra that can match the Bournemouth SO's
standards.
With this visit to London, under its principal conductor Andrew Litton, the
orchestra was inviting applause. This year marks the centenary of its
foundation and at a time when every orchestra in the country must be
becoming nervous about funding, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra wanted a
programme to make a splash and show how adventurous it is - a major
orchestral score, a brief British fanfare (Tippett's No. 5) and a UK first
performance.
The Dutilleux counted as that, because the composer has recently added an
extra section to the score, where cellos unwind a long, unhurried theme to
add to the feeling of far horizons (the 'espace' of the title). In its
unshowy way, the piece works quite well as an orchestral showpiece.
Everything was perfectly detailed, but also hazy, atmospheric, imaginative.
The main work, however, was Mahler's Second Symphony. For this, Litton must
have worked hard with his musicians to get the playing so assured all round,
from the strings sinking their teeth into their first violent phrases with
ferocious unanimity, to the proud brass perorations at the end (botched high
C's from the trumpets apart). With Jean Rigby and Yvonne Kenny as soloists
and a commendable showing from the City of Bath Bach Choir, this was in
every way a technically impressive performance.
It was also exciting now and again, but not all the way through. Litton let
the temperature drop in between Mahler's heated climaxes; but all the big
moments came off splendidly, and the finale's vision of resurrection was
properly awe-inspiring. When the Arts Council's own day of judgement
arrives, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra will have done itself no harm
with performances like this.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: On a Level - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If your experience of theatre-going usually lies in the West End, you hardly
know the half of what live theatre can be. The great marvel of the Theatre
Royal, Stratford East, is its audience, which is harmoniously multi-racial,
largely working-class, and highly appreciative. If a show like On a Level
was given somewhere in the heart of London, it might just be a success -
that is, after all, what happened to Five Guys Named Moe - but it would not
belong there as it does in Stratford East, where viewers whoop at its every
hint and take it to their hearts.
On a Level is written, directed, and performed by seven talented young black
British women who call themselves the Bibi Crew. The show is a revue that,
item by item, takes the life of black women from birth and childhood through
to old age and widowhood.
Most of the items are comic, and at first the humour veers between Victoria
Wood-type satire and teenage silliness. But, during the second half, all the
skits start to add up to something larger than humour - to a warm, simple,
lyrical, tender, funny, unpretentious and open-hearted idea of what it is to
be black in Britain today.
There is no serious racial tension about the show. You see and hear the
comedy of blacks trying to conform to white ideals - kids with clothes-pegs
on their noses (to make them sharp and pointed), women at the hairdressers
desperate for 'relaxed' hair. But you see too the lyricism of ordinary daily
black life, and honour given to the black influence on Eurocentric culture.
The Bibi Crew are black artists who can take pride in black British culture
and yet make its many absurdities funny (especially to black viewers).
You have to have an ear for the finer points of Afro-Caribbean dialect to
get all the jokes in On a level, and at Stratford East the audience has such
ears. But, even if such delicacies were lost on this white male middle-class
ex-Home-Counties-public-school viewer, he gradually fell for the show as a
whole and three performers in particular: (in rising order) Suzette
Llewellyn, Beverley Michaels and Joanne Campbell. Llewellyn in one sketch
plays a frustrated teenage boy with such brilliantly acute energy that, even
as you guffaw, you find you are also moved.
Michaels, a tall performer with an often cool, melancholy, even severe air,
impersonates a wide range of roles with striking aplomb. And Campbell, a
wide-eyed performer with darling charm or deadpan delivery, has variety,
authority, and complete ease. She recreates the 1930s choreographer Buddy
Bradley, who found that in Britain he could choreograph West End shows and
receive credit for doing so.
But to single out these three is to omit the show's most expansive moment -
the song 'Natural Love' sung by Janet Kay with great beauty and humanity.
And it is to omit the fact that most of these numbers are feats of ensemble
playing. These performers are happy to work together, and happy to make
their audience happy.
At the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, until June 12

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOVIS CONSTRUCTION (SCOTLAND) has begun work on a Pounds 24m design manage
construct contract to build new premises for the Inland Revenue in
Lanarkshire.
Schedu1ed for completion at the end of 1994, the new Centre 1 is at Kittoch
Glen, a greenfield site at Phillipshill, a mile and a half from East
Kilbride town centre.
The P&amp;O company is managing the design and construction of the new
development, a single building, comprising some 25,000 sq metres, of
variable height up to a maximum of 20.5 metres over four storeys.
In addition to the provision of office accommodation for around 1,600 staff,
the premises will include a restaurant, leisure, social and child care
facilities.
The linear plan of the building is designed to allow for naturally
ventilated office space. Energy conservation through careful temperature
control, zoning of heating controls and use of solar gains when available,
together with a state of the art lighting system will ensure that greenhouse
gas production is minimised.
Each wing of the building will be connected to one of three triple height
internal atria. These spaces will connect the various departments to each
other by accommodating communal lifts, staircases and meeting rooms; they
will also act as thermal stacks which considerably increase the efficiency
of natural cross-ventilation.
The project is on schedule to be completed by Christmas 1994 and staff can
expect to relocate to their new premises in January 1995.

FT  24 MAY 93 / People: Aspiring novelist shunts coal into private sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ray Proctor, 48, British Coal's new finance director, retains a surprising
sense of humour for a man who, if he makes a success of his new role, may
work himself out of a job in a couple of years.
Proctor, who has spent his whole life in the nationalised coal industry
since leaving Oxford in 1967, does not view his career quite so bleakly.
Having trained as a management accountant, he worked on the financial side
before moving into line management in 1983. Following the death of deputy
chairman Ken Moses, Proctor was given responsibility for preparing the
industry for privatisation.
He will retain his responsibility for privatisation when he takes over from
Michael Butler as finance director at the end of next month. It is a two
year appointment which should cover the period up to privatisation.
Proctor sees his role as twofold - making sure that costs have been driven
down to the level where the industry is profitable on a sustainable basis,
and helping organise a successful privatisation.
Unlike some old mining hands, Proctor is one executive who seems perfectly
happy with the prospect of taking the industry into the private sector.
However, he is not forgetting his outside interests. During his time as
director of studies at the National Coal Board staff college he penned a
well received paper-back, 'Finance for the Perplexed Executive', and is
toying with writing a novel. ' It's easier to write than a textbook, and you
don't need to check the figures' jokes British Coal's new financial supremo.
Meanwhile, Andrew Horsler, 45, who like Proctor is another ex-Leeds grammar
school boy and Oxford graduate, has also been appointed a member of the
British Coal Corporation. He is executive director of marketing and replaces
Malcolm Edwards who was ousted last year.
The Government has also reappointed Albert Wheeler, 59, deputy chairman and
operations director, for a two year term running till March 31, 1995, and
Kevan Hunt, 55, the employee relations director, has been reappointed for a
one year term.

Having amassed a long string of advisory positions at blue chip companies
across Britain since his retirement from the diplomatic service last summer,
Sir John Whitehead, the former ambassador to Japan, has now topped up his
collection with a non-executive directorship at Cadbury Schweppes.
Cadbury's chairman Sir Graham Day retired recently as did non-executive
director Richard Hornby, and the beverage and confectionery company says
that the combination of Whitehead's 'experience in international affairs and
his specific Pacific Rim region expertise' made him a suitable addition to
the board. The Pacific Rim last year accounted for 13 per cent of group
sales and 14.5 per cent of operating profits.
But Whitehead is already a senior adviser to Morgan Grenfell, an adviser to
Inchcape, Cable &amp; Wireless, and Guinness as well as to the president of the
Board of Trade and the Welsh Development Agency. How does Cadbury Schweppes
think he will find the time to make a worthwhile contribution? 'I would cite
the example of Sir Graham Day' a spokeswoman rejoins. 'He was an extremely
effective chairman but also a very busy man. It can work well.'

<TEXT>
WALLACE EVANS has won two contracts in Turkey with a combined construction
value of Pounds 130m. Both have been won in conjunction with its Turkish
associated practice, Seyas.
The largest contract is for the design of a new sewage disposal system for
Buyukcekmece on behalf of Iski, the Istanbul water supply and sewage
disposal authority. Buyukcekmece is located west of the Bosphorous, and the
treatment works will serve a population in excess of 800,000 people.
Valued at Pounds 100m, the work includes the design of 18km of tunnel, 11km
of open cut sewer, a new sewage plant for tertiary treatment utilising the
latest techniques for nutrient removal, and a 1.5 metre diameter sea
outfall. The design team was selected both on price and track record in
solving environmental and engineering problems similar to those confronting
Iski.
Work on the project commenced in April with Wallace Evans' involvement being
managed at Haverfordwest.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Fyfe, managing director of a division of specialty chemicals group
Hickson International, is resigning to join the board, as chief executive
designate, of a food company. An announcement is expected this week.
Fyfe had been managing director at MTM but left at the end of 1990 after
disagreements with the then chairman Richard Lines.
MTM, most of which has just been sold to BTP, has been under investigation
by the Serious Fraud Office concerning a shortfall in the 1991 profits.
Dennis Kerrison, chief executive of Hickson where management turnover has
been considerable in recent years, says there has been 'no falling out',
adding that 'for someone with his temperament, (the opportunity to be at the
top of a company again) was an offer he could not refuse. There was really
no chance of him coming on the main board here and he did have a bit of a
problem adapting.'
The only executive directors on Hickson's main board are Kerrison and the
finance director Michael Rowley. 'We have a number of strong non-executive
directors, including from the chemical sector. Also our chairman (Sir Gordon
Jones) is of the very firm opinion that people have to earn a place on the
board.'
Kerrison said he was looking internally and externally for a replacement but
that he himself would take charge of the division in the meantime. 'We are
in no rush' he added explaining that it was important to get the right
person, given fine chemicals, the division Fyfe ran, contributed about half
of group profits.
Fyfe, who has just turned 50, was on a trade delegation to Japan last Friday
and hence unavailable for comment, but Kerrison said he expected him to
depart form Hickson 'within a week or so.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / Management: Stepping out in a new direction - Process
re-engineering is sweeping across the Atlantic / In a new series Christopher
Lorenz looks at its disciples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until last year it took Bell Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based
telecommunications company, between a fortnight and a month to connect
customers to the long-distance carrier of their choice - unless they
defected in the meantime to speedier rivals. By late 1992, waiting time was
down to a highly competitive three days and it is about to be cut to just a
few hours.
In Dallas, an AT&amp;T unit which makes custom-designed power supplies for
personal computer manufacturers has slashed its design-to-delivery cycle
tenfold since 1991, from 53 to five days.
And in Connecticut, IBM Credit, one of the few increasingly profitable parts
of beleaguered 'Big Blue', has squeezed from a week to four hours the time
it takes to approve and issue financing deals.
These quantum leaps in productivity and competitive performance have all
been achieved in the same way: by a radical type of organisational
re-shaping called 'process re-engineering'.
Though the term was scarcely known when IBM Credit began its redesign in the
late 1980s, 're-engineering' has now become one of the biggest fashions ever
to grab western business.
Confusingly, it also masquerades under about a dozen variants of that name,
depending on which consultancy is trying to promote its services, or which
author wants to sell his book - of which no fewer than five have been
published since December.
The fashion also misleads: Many a conventional 'delayering', 'downsizing' or
'restructuring' (ie redundancy) exercise is being relabelled as
re-engineering, to the extreme annoyance of the 'father' of the subject,
American consultant Michael Hammer. He also distinguishes re-engineering
entirely from the popular 'continuous improvement'.
False impressions have also been created about its impact on employment.
Re-engineering can cause striking job losses, but in many cases it creates
none at all, Hammer says. Instead, companies often find that it improves
their competitiveness to such an extent that they generate considerable
extra business - and work to be done.
With a surging market share, IBM Credit now handles 100 times as many deals
as before and has had to trim its headcount only slightly. Bell Atlantic and
the AT&amp;T unit have also boosted their market shares sharply and people
displaced from their old jobs have been transferred to others.
Purist though he is, even Hammer hypes a little. In Re-engineering The
Corporation*, his book with James Champy which was published in the US this
month, he allows the chief executive of Taco Bell, the American-Mexican
fast-food chain, to apply the re-engineering label not only to his
organisation as a whole, but also to the rearrangement of his kitchens. That
is over-egging things.
The hype is misleading in a different sense, too. Many consultants claim to
be re-engineering 'the organisation' or 'the business', when in reality the
human, political and technical challenge of the exercise is such that, at
least in large companies, they have not got much further than re-engineering
one or two processes in a single subsidiary.
Exceptions in the US include parts of Texas Instruments, Ford, Kodak,
Motorola and Hallmark Cards - where re-engineering has been far more
extensive than a recent consultancy study suggested. As in almost all
re-engineering, Hallmark's organisational changes are much more significant
than those in its information technology, on which the study focused.
In Hammer's words, the essence of re-engineering is 'starting over:
beginning again with a clean sheet of paper'. It does no less, he claims,
than 'reject the assumptions inherent in Adam Smith's industrial paradigm' -
including both the division of labour and the need for hierarchical control.
Better than any expert's formulation, the practical actions of Bell
Atlantic, AT&amp;T and IBM Credit provide the key to what proper re-engineering
is all about. Its essence lies in the way they have abandoned their
traditionally fragmented, start-stop myriad of work tasks, routines and
procedures, and have replaced them with a handful of unitary processes which
have been designed from scratch to operate smoothly from end-to-end,
starting with first customer contact and going right through to completion.
In most western organisations, orders and projects pass tortuously up, down
and across a succession of separate, vertically structured departments of
'functional' specialists, often waiting hours or days for each next task to
be carried out. As Hammer puts it: 'Companies consist of vertical silos
built on narrow pieces of a process.'
For Bell Atlantic, its original 15-30 day cycle contained only about 10-15
actual hours of work on each project; the rest of the time was consumed in
waiting and departmental hand-offs.
For AT&amp;T, the proportion of real work in its product development cycle was
higher, but was slowed as badly, by 80 hand-offs and 24 meetings; these have
now been cut to 17 and one respectively. For IBM Credit, there was a
similarly slow hand-off process as each financing request passed through the
hands of four different specialists.
In a re-engineered organisation, these previously separate tasks are
replaced by a seamless process and functional boundaries are either bridged
or removed entirely, with a 'process owner' often overseeing everyone
involved. Narrow job descriptions are abandoned.
At IBM Credit the four types of specialist have been replaced by a single,
multi-skilled 'deal structurer', who can call on a small central pool of
specialist back-up staff in the few cases where they are needed. At AT&amp;T the
succession of specialists in five different departments has been supplanted
by a set of multi-functional 'design cells' which handle each project from
customer request right through to delivery. And at Bell Atlantic a 'case
team' now carries out all the previously separate tasks; soon, all their
work will be combined into the hands - and brain - of one multidisciplinary
'case worker'.
A further facet of the changes at Bell Atlantic helps explain why there are,
as yet, so few other convincing examples of 'real' re-engineering.
To make its process changes effective, the company has already had to spend
four years on a 'culture change' programme aimed at replacing the old
'command and control' mentality of managers and employees with 'new
behaviours' such as empowerment, teamwork, coaching, feedback and
customer-responsiveness. That programme is still running.
Bell is no isolated case. A cultural transformation of this magnitude is
vital to the success of re-engineering within any company, according to four
Coopers &amp; Lybrand consultants whose book is published on Thursday**. Since a
string of other changes must be also made at the same time - notably a
refocusing of performance measurement and incentive systems from individuals
onto teamwork - they argue that re-engineering requires sustained commitment
by top management over a matter of years.
Thomas Davenport, an Ernst &amp; Young partner, whose book*** on what he prefers
to call 'process innovation' is one of the most comprehensive, goes further.
In many companies radical culture change has proved unpalatable and has
blocked re-engineering, he says.
Even if re-engineering does not hit the cultural buffers, it is certainly a
very tall order. As the Coopers team says, the financial, emotional,
organisational, training and time-costs of 'ramping up into a
process-oriented business' are 'not insignificant'.
Re-engineering promises glowing rewards, in other words, but also great
risk.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Management: Training lessons from Germany - Alcan's UK mill
needs to catch up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask Rheinhold Wagner why productivity is so much higher at Alcan's aluminium
rolling mills in Germany than at those in the UK and immediately he points
to vast differences in the way employees are trained to look after the
expensive equipment they operate.
Alcan Deutschland employs 3,800 people and 250 of them are apprentices, each
one being trained for 3 1/2 years. The total includes 175 craft apprentices,
and Wagner says that, as a matter of policy, Alcan always finds craft
apprentices a job at the end of their training, even though the work at
first might not be what they were trained for. The idea, he says, is to keep
them in the production system. 'This gives us a tremendously skilled
workforce.'
In 1991, when he took over responsibility for Alcan's UK metal rolling
operations, which employ about 1,450, Wagner was surprised to find no
similar apprentice programme existed.
When he began, each UK employee was taking twice as long to produce a tonne
of finished metal. But that has been improving. UK operations are now 10 to
15 per cent less productive than in Germany.
One way Wagner measures productivity is mill 'uptime' - or time the mills
are working normally against the total time available. Wagner says Germany
needs to improve because 'uptime' is about 85 per cent. In the UK it is only
70 per cent.
The big deficiency in the UK he says, is that equipment is not maintained
carefully enough. 'And if the mill is not reliable, you can't expect to
deliver on time.'
At the begining of the rolling process, aluminium is heated in re-melt
furnaces. Wagner says that furnaces at Alcan's mill in Rogerstone, south
Wales, consume 40 per cent more energy than comparable furnaces in Germany.
Partly this is due to differences in equipment, but it is also partly
'because of less attention to detail. And that comes back to training.'
Alcan, based in Canada and the western world's second-largest aluminium
producer, started to reorganise its European operations as long ago as 1976
in order to prepare for the unified European market.
In 1987 Wagner, already chief executive of Alcan Deutschland, was handed
extra responsibility when the parent company disbanded its European
headquarters in Geneva to save money and to flatten its international
management structure. He was also put in charge of Alcan's operations in
Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Another reorganisation in 1991 gave him
responsibility for Alcan's rolling operations in the UK and, therefore, all
the European rolling operations.
Alcan has been spending heavily on these rolling operations. It has a
half-share in Aluminium Norf in Germany, already the world's biggest
aluminium rolling mill, where annual capacity is being doubled to 1.4m
tonnes at a cost of DM900m (Pounds 360m). Another Dollars 100m (Pounds
66.2m) has been spent on a new, wholly owned foil mill in Italy linked with
Norf. This has raised fears at Rogerstone that the 240,000-tonne-a-year
plant has no future. These concerns intensified last month when another 200
job losses were announced there and 46 at associated mills in Glasgow and
Falkirk. Rogerstone employed 3,000 at its peak; now the workforce will drop
to 770. But Wagner insists the cuts simply reflect the sharp drop in demand
from export markets, mainly Germany, and a need to bring capacity and costs
into line with depressed circumstances.
He points out that Alcan has spent Pounds 64m modernising Rogerstone since
1984 - including Pounds 8m of the Pounds 23m spent in the UK last year - and
the plant is needed to provide specialised rolled products for the whole of
Europe. It is also part of his strategy to build Rogerstone's share of the
UK market to 60 per cent, a target it is close to achieving.
That is why, says Wagner, he must find ways of improving training - and
consequently productivity - at the UK mills.

FT  24 MAY 93 / BCCI victims gather to stage the big one: Costly
preparations at Wembley for the world's largest creditors' meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S biggest creditors' meeting is expected to attract an audience
from as far afield as Egypt, Zimbabwe and China this week as aggrieved
victims of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International gather in
London.
About 1,000 people are expected to attend to elect a creditors' committee on
Thursday afternoon at Wembley Arena in London, at the culmination of a
process costing Pounds 1m.
The arena, better known for ice-skating shows and pop concerts, was chosen
for its location and size. It is the second-largest indoor stadium in the
UK. In theory several hundred thousand individuals are eligible to attend
the meeting.
Observers expect to see some drama as Mr Christopher Morris, a liquidator
for the bank, delivers a speech about the handling of BCCI since it was
closed in July 1991.
The formal part of the meeting should be over relatively quickly. All the
law requires is a vote to choose the five-strong creditors' committee, which
in turn approves the liquidators' fees and sanctions their legal actions and
decisions.
Then comes the unknown. Mr Morris's speech - which is being finalised - will
include answers to some of the 300 questions already received. Others will
be submitted in writing as creditors arrive at the meeting. A lawyer will be
on hand to urge caution in the replies.
Mr Fred Goodwin, a Touche Ross partner, said: 'We believe there will be a
lot of questions and a lot of emotion. We want to be as open as we can, and
we will answer every single question in writing afterwards.'
There were about 730,000 BCCI bank accounts worldwide, and several thousand
other creditors.
The liquidators advertised in 50 countries and sent out 50,000 letters. More
than 3,600 responded, of whom just fewer than 3,000 turned out to be
creditors.
They were sent nomination packs with the manifestos of 25 candidates. One
has since withdrawn and a further six were excluded because they were not
creditors.
Those remaining include an Egyptian diplomat, the liquidator of Rhodesia
Railways, and a representative of the Isle of Man, residents of which have
lost Dollars 99m.
So far 533 creditors have said they will come. Another 528 have given their
proxies to 177 others. Many may bring family and friends. A further 716
proxies have been allocated to the chairman.
The High Court called for the election of a creditors' committee in January.
Until this stage of the liquidation the court had argued that it would be
too complex and costly to arrange an election.
Preparations are almost complete for the 100 staff to be involved on the day
at Wembley, and on the fifth floor of BCCI's former principal office in
Leadenhall Street in the City of London.
Three staff are taking about 100 calls a day from creditors - down from
1,100 on the day the bank was closed in July 1991. They have answered more
than 2,500 questions on the creditors' meeting since February.
Around the corner a dozen more are sifting records to ensure that those
attending or sending proxies are creditors. Several employees of the
Electoral Reform Society are also in place, overseeing preparations for the
ballot.

FT  24 MAY 93 / City watchdog starts to win friends: The state of support
for the proposed Personal Investment Authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW months ago conventional wisdom in the City had it that the awkward and
contradictory efforts by regulators to create a new umbrella body for retail
financial services were heading nowhere.
Proposals for the Personal Investment Authority, which would include the
members of the self-regulatory bodies Fimbra and Lautro, and a few others,
pleased no one. The life insurance members of Lautro and the independent
financial adviser members of Fimbra jockeyed for control of a board which at
one time was proposed to consist of 30 people.
Meanwhile, the life insurers said they would not join unless the financial
services arms of banks and building societies joined as well and the banks
complained, in turn, that their interests would be under-represented.
The efforts by each industry to have its members dominate the new body
created widespread scepticism that the authority could be an effective
regulator.
But lately a big change has occurred and the authority's odds of a healthy
birth have dramatically improved.
Industry officials are saying privately that the Treasury and Bank of
England have quietly let it be known that they are determined to see an
authority emerge. This new tone was accompanied by a version of the Riot
Act, read to the authority's formation committee last December by Mr Andrew
Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board.
Mr Large told the committee that the SIB would not approve a self-regulatory
body which did not raise standards of investor protection. He also spelled
out exactly how that should be done.
His comments produced howls from sectors of the industry, but relatively
enthusiastic expressions of support from the banks, which said Mr Large was
at last describing an organisation they might join.
So the committee, which itself consists of representatives of the
constituent parts of the industry, had to find a way forward which would
keep the banks on board while forestalling revolt among independent
financial advisers.
Sir Brian Jenkins, senior partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand and a former Lord
Mayor of London, retained as a consultant to find a way forward, has come
down hard on the side of tougher regulation.
While offering a modest compromise on the touchiest issue of all - minimum
capital requirements for advisers - he has urged a series of other tough
requirements, including:
Firms must be able to provide adequate explanations of lapse rates for any
distribution channel which have been over 20 per cent for the previous two
years.
Firms must provide adequate explanations for a turnover of over 50 per cent
in salesmen, advisers or tied agents in either of the previous two years.
Firms handling client money must have at least two executive principals.
Salesmen and advisers must pass competency exams.
While Sir Brian's report seems to have earned the endorsement of the banks,
support for it among advisers, particularly smaller ones, is much less
certain.
Mr Trevor Humphreys of the British Insurance and Investment Brokers
Association, whose members are independent financial advisers, said the
compromise on capital adequacy would probably be opposed. 'My initial
reaction is that we have fought hard to get rid of the European Community
capital requirements,' he said. If a member's business plan raised questions
in regulators' minds about its future, 'then the regulator should tell the
member to get his plan in order'. Requiring capital guarantees were beside
the point, he said.
Mr Humphreys said, however, the association firmly supported the need for
higher standards, provided they did not constitute 'overkill'.
The association's stance suggests that a lobbying effort to weaken some of
the proposals is about to start. Bankers believe that the extent to which it
is successful will reflect the level of political support for advisers in
parliament and in the Treasury.
But even if independent financial advisers are unhappy with the proposals,
there is the widespread view in the industry that there is little they can
do about it. If the majority of the industry - banks, life insurers and
large independent adviser networks - all vote to join the new body, the
small advisers will be left in Fimbra, an organisation whose finances are
already precarious.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Employers to gain more rights on unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to press ahead today with moves to strengthen employers'
rights to derecognise trade unions and introduce personal contracts, in
spite of opposition from some Conservative MPs and peers.
An amendment to be introduced during the House of Lords' third reading of
the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill today will make it clear
that employers have the right to deny pay increases to staff who refuse to
sign personal contracts.
The Department of Employment said yesterday the amendment was necessary to
clarify the law in the wake of a Court of Appeal ruling last month that it
is unlawful for employees to be offered financial inducements to sign
personal contracts.
The court upheld appeals by employees of Associated British Ports and
Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, who had refused to sign
personal contracts. The two companies offered pay increases to those
employees who agreed to sign personal contracts but not to those who wanted
to remain union members. The employees refused pay increases were members of
the RMT transport union and the National Union of Journalists.
The department said the court rulings had resulted in a different
interpretation being placed on existing employment law from that which the
government had originally intended.
In the Court of Appeal ruling Lord Justice Dillon said offering inducements
to staff to sign personal contracts was in breach of the Employment
Protection Act 1978, which protects employees' right to belong to a union.
He rejected the employers' argument that staff were not penalised when they
were offered a choice between signing personal contracts or remaining in the
union.
The Associated British Ports case involved a group of dockers who refused to
sign personal contracts. In the case against Associated Newspapers Mr David
Wilson, a Daily Mail journalist, had been denied a 4.5 per cent salary
increase for refusing to sign a personal contract.
Mr Peter Bottomley, a Conservative MP and former minister, yesterday sharply
criticised the amendment, saying it was an attack on freedom of association.
He said the government had acted with undue haste, announcing its intention
to introduce the amendment within days of the court's ruling.
Mr Bottomley added: 'If the government wants people to be able to be
penalised for being in a trade union, they ought to say so openly. Unless
there's some explanation I haven't been given, this is an open attack on
freedom of association.'
Lord Gilmour, the Conservative peer, said yesterday he was concerned that
the amendment was being introduced at such a late stage of the legislative
process.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Rises 'higher' in small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALLEST and largest companies gave their managers and directors the
highest pay rises last year, research published today by the Institute of
Management shows.
Managers and directors of companies with a turnover of less than Pounds 25m
had an average 6.6 per cent increase in the 12 months to January. Other
institute studies have shown that those working in companies with a turnover
of Pounds 25m to Pounds 125m had average rise of 5.5 per cent last year.
Those in companies with a turnover of Pounds 125m-Pounds 600m received 5.1
per cent.
In the largest companies - above Pounds 600m - the trend reverses, with
managers getting increases averaging 7.2 per cent and directors 8.6 per
cent.
According to the latest study, in businesses with a turnover of less than
Pounds 25m the average manager now earns Pounds 27,504 and the average
director Pounds 50,803. The survey, covering nearly 2,500 people in 127
companies, was carried out by Remuneration Economics, the pay research
group.
Women directors fared significantly worse last year than their male
counterparts. Women's earnings increased by just 2.9 per cent, compared with
7 per cent for men. The gap between male and female managers' increases was
smaller - women had 6.4 per cent and men 6.5 per cent.
Large regional differences were highlighted by the survey. In central London
smaller businesses average pay for managers is Pounds 34,383 and for
directors Pounds 60,121. Managers in the south-west and Wales receive Pounds
22,270, and directors Pounds 43,435.
Mr Roger Young, the institute's director, said smaller companies were
catching up on pay after holding back for the past five years. 'The more
companies have delayered, the more responsibility has been taken by those
managers who have been left,' said Mr Young. Companies have had to give
above-average increases to remaining managers to 'build up morale', he
added.
The survey found the best-paid executives in smaller businesses worked in
computing, telecommunications and marketing. The worst-paid were in
production, distribution, personnel, and research and development.
April pay deals confirm the downward trend in settlement levels, according
to the research group Incomes Data Services. Three quarters of the increases
monitored in April were worth 1.5 per cent to 3.9 per cent. Pay had been
frozen in one case in 10.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Manufacturing growth plans 'cannot bear fruit'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING companies are forecasting a bright future for the next three
years but their growth plans are 'fundamentally flawed', says a study by
Pera International, a business consultancy.
A Pera survey of 345 companies released this week - mainly in mechanical
engineering, medical engineering, and the electronics and automotive
industries - finds that 82 per cent expect business growth this year and 96
per cent predict significant growth within three years.
But nearly a quarter of respondents admitted they could not develop a growth
strategy, while nearly a third could not implement development plans.
In addition a fifth were unable to pinpoint their company's own strengths,
identify new business opportunities or recognise the factors critical to
their success.
The survey found that nearly 90 per cent of manufacturers had survived the
recession by cutting costs. This made them 'leaner' and more efficient but
had not increased or even protected their market share.
Pera says: 'Come the economic upturn, these companies will not be able to
capitalise on their own leanness.
'Many of their planned growth strategies cannot bear fruit, due to a lack of
specific skills to implement them. A lack of adequate financial resources is
also likely to scupper many hungry companies' plans for growth.'
Manufacturers, understandably cautious, are mainly looking to develop within
their current core business. But if most organisations are adopting the same
development strategies only the 'outstanding few' will gain increased market
share.
Most manufacturers surveyed also gave their employees, especially the sales
team, little credit for the company's success.
'This attitude contradicts respondents' desires to grow the business,' says
Pera. 'The traditional notion that 'the product sells itself' still
prevails.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / Meeting on Ulster initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AND IRISH min-isters will tomorrow try to dispel some of the gloom
over the prospects for talks on the political future of Northern Ireland
following last week's local elections in the province.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, will discuss in Dublin with
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, how unionist and nationalist
political leaders can be persuaded to resume the negotiations which
collapsed last November.
Even before last week's local elections, which saw a better-than-expected
performance by the hardline Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, ministers from both governments were envisaging
another Anglo-Irish conference before talks would resume. Now they may
consider putting off the resumption of talks still further.
With the Reverend Ian Paisley, DUP leader, insisting his party will not
return to talks until the Irish Republic compromises on its territorial
claim to the north, the sense of political polarisation has increased.
The moderate Ulster Unionist Party, led by Mr James Molyneaux, is also
expected to be more cynical about further talks.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Companies warned on terror cover: 'Immense pressure' to
raise rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS have warned that moves to increase the cost of terrorism insurance
following last month's Bishopsgate bomb in the City of London could reduce
the effectiveness of a new government-backed re-insurance scheme and leave
many businesses unprotected from the IRA.
One insurer close to Pool Re, the mutually-owned reinsurer, said: 'The real
danger is that higher premiums may discourage people from taking out the
cover.' The company was 'coming under immense pressure' from the government
to increase its rates, he explained. But this would undermine the scheme and
'send the wrong signals to business'.
Pool Re was set up after insurers withdrew terrorism cover from commercial
policies in the wake of the IRA's mainland bombing campaign last year. The
reinsurer pays claims only until its own funds - which are generated by new
terrorism insurance premiums - are exhausted, with the government meeting at
least 90 per cent of further costs.
Take-up of the new terrorism policies has been more limited than expected
and claims of more than Pounds 400m from the Bishopsgate bomb will exhaust
the new company's funds.
Last week Mr Eric Coward, chief executive of Pool Re, said in a letter to
insurance companies - which collect premiums on Pool Re's behalf - that a
rate review was under way. He said companies should not quote rates for
terrorism cover for policies coming into effect after July 1. Any quotation
already offered should be withdrawn immediately unless it had been accepted.
The Department of Trade and Industry said on Friday that no decision about
rate increases had been taken, although the department pointed out that
insurance companies themselves had signalled that rate increases would be
necessary following last month's bomb in London.
The DTI also stressed that for most businesses terrorism premiums
represented a relatively small proportion of overall costs. A city-centre
office block valued at Pounds 10m would pay a premium for terrorism of
between Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000, an amount equivalent to rental
payments for two days.
Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the Association of British Insurers, said,
however, that costs were sufficient to lead many businesses to take a chance
on terrorism. 'The more premiums go up the more businesses and local
authorities will not buy the cover.'
Failure by government and the insurance industry to agree rate rises could
increase pressure for a compulsory levy. The Association of Insurance and
Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (Airmic), which represents insurance
buyers at about 300 UK companies, favours such a solution.

FT  24 MAY 93 / 'Threat' to advertising industry

ADVERTISING agencies could face an exodus of key staff, off to find richer
pickings from competitors once the recession lifts, according to a study of
the industry by accountants Arthur Andersen.
The survey - which questioned 180 individuals in 18 UK agencies - said 73
per cent of agencies believed their employees understood their 'benefits'
yet only 26 per cent of employees could put a cash value on them. 'More than
80 per cent of employers claim to use personal interviews for communicating
about pay and reward, but only 42 per cent of employees say they participate
in these'.
A further finding is that only 16 per cent of agencies made a direct link
between individual performance and reward while 87 per cent of employees who
felt there was no link would like one. Andersen warns that staff may switch
to agencies where terms of employment are better explained.
Even though agencies' profitability have suffered badly in the recession,
the company car is still a dominant feature of agency life, with more than
90 per cent of those participating in the survey driving one.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Ministers meet to dispel gloom over Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AND IRISH ministers will tomorrow try to dispel some of the gloom
over the prospects for talks on the political future of Northern Ireland
following last week's local elections in the province.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, will discuss in Dublin with
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, how unionist and nationalist
political leaders can be persuaded to resume the negotiations which
collapsed in November last year.
Even before last week's local elections, which saw a better-than-expected
performance by the hardline Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, ministers from both governments were envisaging
another Anglo-Irish conference before talks would resume. Now they may
reconsider putting off the restart of talks still further.
With the Reverend Ian Paisley, DUP leader, insisting his party will not
return to talks until the Irish Republic compromises on its territorial
claim to the north, the sense of political polarisation has increased.
The moderate Ulster Unionist Party, led by Mr James Molyneaux, is also
expected to be more cynical about talks.
Sir Patrick has not commented on the local elections but the mood at the
Northern Ireland Office at the weekend was that whatever the impact of the
elections, there was no alternative to pressing ahead with restarting talks
as originally hoped.
It is also clear that Sir Patrick's personal initiative for restarting talks
 -a paper being drawn up which will set out British government proposals for
how Northern Ireland might be governed - will not provide an immediate
catalyst to the resumption of negotiations.
The proposals for a new devolved government in the province will not be
presented to participants for some time. These suggestions may divide rather
than unite them, by satisfying the demands of neither unionists nor
nationalists.
A crumb of comfort for Sir Patrick is the relatively good performance last
week of the non-sectarian Alliance party in Northern Ireland.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Better direction of training urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH OF the Pounds 20bn which companies spend on training each year is
wasted or misdirected, says a report by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the management
consultants.
The report, by Mrs Sheila Drew - Smith, head of employers' training and
development policy, will be presented today at a training conference
organised by the Confederation of British Industry.
Mrs Drew-Smith said yesterday: 'Employers must recognise that training has
to be related to their business needs.'
She said companies often viewed training as a waste of resources. 'Even some
who learned the lesson of the recession of the early 1980s and continue to
support investment in their employees' training still use a scattergun or
avalanche approach and train for training's sake.
'In these firms management concentrates on inputs, such as training budgets
or the time spent on training, rather than outputs. As a result much of the
training will have been wasted or misdirected. The evidence suggests that
there are still many such firms.'
The report recommends the government - sponsored scheme Investors in People
as a powerful tool for employers seeking to assess themselves against a
standard.
It says the scheme measures the effectiveness of training and helps with
cost - effectiveness because it requires evaluation of the commercial return
from training.
The report gives several examples of companies which have tailored their
training more effectively to their business needs.
Lawson Mardon, the plastics company, concentrated its training on quality
improvement. The result was an 80 per cent decrease in returns from
customers combined with a 10 per cent increase in sales.

FT  24 MAY 93 / British Gas set for more rows with its regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS could face further damaging clashes with its regulator following
the outcome of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's investigation into
the company which is due by the end of July.
Instead of clearing the uncertainty surrounding the company's future
business, as British Gas had hoped when it agreed to the inquiry last
August, the commission could pave the way for further legal wrangles.
The legal complexities could arise from the way in which the referrals to
the commission were made and the expected complexity of the eventual
reports.
Four separate referrals to the commission were made about different parts of
the company's business and under different pieces of legislation. British
Gas could end up challenging any of the commission's recommendations that
are implemented by its regulator.
Mr Jonathan Stern, industry consultant at Gas Strategies group, said: 'There
are two ways British Gas can play it. They can filibuster or they can fight
it.'
Sir James McKinnon, the regulator, made two of the referrals to the
monopolies commission under the 1986 Gas Act and Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, made the other two under the Fair Trading Act.
The commission must report on each one of these, delivering its verdicts to
the body that made the initial referral.
This complicated situation arose because Sir James was involved in a bitter
row with British Gas last July which prompted the decision to call in the
commission.
Sir James had been unable to agree an appropriate rate of return for the
company to earn from its pipelines business and asked the commission to
investigate.
British Gas retaliated by asking Mr Heseltine to widen the inquiry so that
it looked at the entire market supplied by British Gas and the operation of
its pipelines division. Ofgas countered with a further referral on the
household supply market.
The commission must firstly decide whether British Gas's monopoly in gas
supply to households and in operation of the pipeline network has acted
against the public interest. If it decides this has been the case, there are
various remedies it can suggest.
The government will have to decide whether to implement any of the
commission's recommendations once it has seen its reports.
This could involve passing new legislation after the commission's report has
been put before parliament.
Mr Heseltine can remove sensitive information from the commission's report
on his referrals, before he lays it before parliament. British Gas will not
receive a copy of this report until the day before publication.
Separately, however, the regulator can go ahead and implement changes to the
pipelines business suggested by the monopolies commission in an additional
report to Ofgas without agreement from Mr Heseltine.
This could draw Ofgas into conflict with the government over the details of
pipelines operations.
It also leaves room for British Gas to challenge Ofgas's interpretation of
the commission's findings. To do this British Gas would have to request a
judicial review.
Ofgas will receive reports on its own referrals which it must send to
British Gas straight away. The regulator must then wait until two weeks
after Mr Heseltine receives his reports before it can make public the
commission's findings on Sir James's referral.
The number of reports and the different powers of the regulator and
government over parts of British Gas's business means the outcome of the
monopolies commission investigation will not be clear-cut. It could lead to
months of further disagreement and shadow-boxing between British Gas, Ofgas
and the Department of Trade and Industry.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Salmon succeeds beer and sandwiches: Praise and criticism
for Heseltine's lunch with industry leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE government steps up its efforts to create a new framework for talking
to industry, the initiative has sparked applause from the business community
but scepticism among former advisers to Baroness Thatcher, who think it may
mark the return to a more corporatist style of government.
Tomorrow's meeting between Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, and business leaders is to discuss the economy and ways to create
better conditions for industry in the 1990s.
Mr Heseltine has invited the chairmen or top directors from 19 organisations
including Rover, J. Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer, the Post Office, TI and
Northern Foods.
The 'round table' is expected to gather once or twice a year. Less senior
people from the same companies are likely to meet Department of Trade and
Industry officials every few months for an exchange of views.
The department has declined to publicise the agenda for the meeting, even
though details of the lunch menu - parfait of chicken liver, salmon escalope
and poached pears - have leaked out.
The round table has been welcomed by Sir John Banham, a former
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, who says it could
help bring together the generally disparate cultures of Whitehall and
industry. He reckons that more contacts could 'change the situation of the
past few decades in which civil servants have tended to see the average
person from industry as a bit like Uriah Heep'.
Sir Peter Carey, a former permanent secretary at the DTI, who is adviser at
merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, said it was 'helpful' for industry to talk to
government about the effects of Whitehall policies. This marked a change
from the 1980s, when government 'distanced itself' from business leaders.
Less impressed, however, is Professor Patrick Minford, an economist at
Liverpool University who was informal adviser to Lady Thatcher's government
in the early 1980s. He says gatherings of this kind can turn into a 'talking
shop' in which industry expects special favours from government.
Prof Minford, who is one of the Treasury's 'seven wise men' of outside
forecasters, said Mr Heseltine's round table was 'rather ludicrous'. He
added: 'I can see the potential for all sorts of mischief. People from
business are invariably a nuisance when it comes to talking about the
economy. When the head of the CBI speaks, I shudder.'
Sir Bernard Ingham, former press secretary to Lady Thatcher, said: 'There is
a danger of slipping back to a situation where people from industry think
government can do things for them. Formal meetings between government and
industry do little other than warm the self-importance of the people who
attend them.'
Sir Douglas Hague, a Downing Street adviser to Lady Thatcher between 1979
and 1983, said Mr Heseltine's initiative was 'fairly realistic' because it
appeared to be based on getting better information from industry leaders
about business conditions. It was important, however, to prevent civil
servants from taking a lead in policy ideas involving industry as they
'hadn't a clue' in this area.
Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman of the TI engineering company and a
member of Mr Heseltine's round table, said the initiative could lead on to a
'harnessing of brainpower' from business and Whitehall to set up
co-operative projects in areas such as semiconductors, aerospace and vehicle
technology. Such schemes may be essential, he believes, to put UK industry
on a more secure footing for the 1990s.
Sir David Alliance, chairman of textile company Coats Viyella, said the
generally pro-business attitude of the Thatcher administrations did not go
far enough. 'They were on our side but didn't understand us. These are two
different things.'
Sir David - who is not part of the round table but has had informal
discussions with the department recently - believes even small steps to
improve discussions between Whitehall and business can be useful. He says,
for instance, that for nearly two decades textile companies have produced
poor-quality bedspreads for the National Health Service because civil
servants have specified unsuitable products.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Anger likely over M-way toll plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will face fresh controversy over its transport policies this
week when Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announces proposals to
start charging drivers for using the motorways.
Opinion polls suggest that motorway tolls could prove even more unpopular
than railway privatisation. A poll carried out for the Royal Automobile Club
earlier this month found 86 per cent of motorists opposed to the idea.
Mr MacGregor is putting forward his proposals in a green paper expected to
be published on Wednesday. His aim is to find a new source of finance to
fund the government's Pounds 19bn roadbuilding programme.
He is expected to try to take some of the heat out of the controversy by
setting out a series of options and asking for opinions rather than
proposing a firm course of action.
But some of the options have already been ruled out. Mr MacGregor has said
Continental-style toll plazas cannot be installed on existing motorways
because they would worsen traffic congestion and use too much land. He has
also reluctantly acknowledged that electronic technology will not offer a
more sophisticated way of collecting tolls from motorists for at least five
years.
This means that the most likely way of charging motorists in the short term
could be to require them to buy a permit if they want to use the motorways.
This system operates in Switzerland, where motorists pay SFr30 (Pounds
13.50) a year for a windscreen sticker.
The government is also keen to encourage the private sector to start
building toll roads. But motorists would be reluctant to pay tolls on
private-sector motorways if they had paid a charge to use the public-sector
motorway running next to it.
The green paper is therefore likely to consider the introduction of
so-called shadow tolls, under which the government remunerates
private-sector roadbuilders by paying them a fee for every vehicle that uses
their roads.
The RAC says in a paper published today that road charging will be
acceptable only if there is an equivalent reduction in vehicle excise duty
and if the government guarantees to spend the proceeds solely on the road
system. It also wants to see the Department of Transport's responsibilities
for motorways hived off to a more business-like independent agency.
The Automobile Association yesterday published the results of a poll of
2,600 motorists suggesting that 88 per cent are against motorway charges. If
charges were introduced, 36 per cent would prefer to pay a toll of 10p a
mile, 21 per cent would prefer an annual Pounds 50 fee and 20 per cent would
prefer a 15p increase in the price of a gallon of petrol. The remaining 23
per cent had no preference.

one of the Treasury's 'seven wise men' of outside forecasters - warned that
the Bank of England's fear of inflation could destabilise recovery.
He said on BBC2's The Money Programme: 'The Bank of England are really being
ultra-cautious in the direction of fear of inflation. It is an ultra-caution
that could be extremely risky, ironically, in destabilising the recovery.
'I want to see the government trusting the market forces it has liberated
and also trusting the evidence of the domestic economy on the state of
demand and inflation. I want to see it permitting the recovery to proceed
much more rapidly than it now looks like proceeding. They should recognise
that and let interest rates now drop in order to permit the economy to
recover.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / CBI urges faster settlement of bills
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES to speed the payment of bills by large companies to thousands of
small suppliers were proposed yesterday by the Confederation of British
Industry.
The CBI said small businesses are estimated to be owed more than Pounds 100m
in overdue debts at any one time. It urged large companies to declare their
payment policies in annual reports rather than give a detailed calculation
of the average time taken to settle bills as urged by the Department of
Trade and Industry.
Mr Richard Brucciani, CBI smaller firms council chairman, said: 'The problem
of late payment requires a change of culture and attitude in business, and a
published statement of corporate payment policy would give suppliers a
useful insight into this.
'It would also expose directors to scrutiny and provide a basis on which
they and their auditors could be tackled for poor payment practices in
breach of their stated policies.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / Unions seek to block loss of Swan Hunter projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL OFFICIALS of shipbuilding unions will be asked this week to back a
call for shipyard workers throughout the UK to refuse to work on three Type
23 frigates if they are moved from Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter.
The motion was unanimously backed on Saturday at a Carlisle meeting of shop
stewards from all UK shipyards except Southampton-based Vosper Thornycroft.
Union leaders from Swan Hunter, which went into receivership 10 days ago
after a helicopter carrier order went to rival consortium VSEL/Kvaerner,
said the Vosper stewards had send a message supporting the motion.
Swan Hunter union officials expect the motion, proposed by Mr Jim McFall,
chairman of the shipyard negotiating committee of the Confederation of
Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, to be endorsed by the committee when it
meets on Wednesday.
Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne and Blyth CSEU chairman, said yesterday: 'If endorsed
it will be adopted as official policy of their unions.'
If the frigates are removed - a move Swans unions have pledged to prevent -
workers wherever they were sent would be balloted after union lawyers had
scrutinised the motion.
Some Swan Hunter workers, demoralised by uncertainty and poor alternative
job prospects, doubt they can count on solidarity from other yards.
Mr George Cook, a boilermaker, said as he left Swans on Friday: 'If it's
going to save their jobs, they'll work on them. It's a horrible situation,
it's look after number one. That's Tory Britain now.'
But Mr Brennan insisted: 'I'm sure the overwhelming majority won't touch
that job with a bargepole.'
Fitting out the frigates is vital to Swan's survival as a shipbuilder. It
would provide work until late 1994, giving the company the chance to bid for
other contracts and secure a buyer as a going concern.
The Ministry of Defence has given no undertaking that work can continue on
the frigates beyond this Friday.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Manufacturing probe urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES SUCH as Swan Hunter and Leyland Daf are being allowed to collapse
while the government does nothing, Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the
MSF technical union, said yesterday.
Opening a debate on manufacturing at the union's annual conference in
Blackpool, Mr Lyons called for a royal commission to do the work that the
government had failed to do. He said: 'We are dealing with a long-term
problem that requires long-term solutions and a change in attitudes. We need
a new consensus in support of manufacturing industry.
'In addition to the campaigns we are waging now on behalf of our members, I
am writing to the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, Mr John
Smith, to propose the establishment of a royal commission on manufacturing.
'I know that royal commissions have their critics. I am therefore proposing
that this one operate in a radically different way. It would meet in public.
'It would take evidence in public. Its membership would be drawn from across
the political and industrial spectrum, including the trade union movement,
and it would be asked to report by the end of 1995 - just in time for a new
Labour government to consider its recommendations.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / Effect of recession expected to linger
</HEADLINE>

   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY MANUFACTURERS of consumer products believe the lingering impact of the
recession will continue to affect their businesses for at least the next six
months, a survey says.
The survey, conducted last month by Datamonitor, covered 394 marketing
executives in 60 consumer-goods sectors. In most sectors three quarters of
respondents said it would be at least six months before the negative effects
of recession ended. About half expected it to take a year or longer.
The most bullish sectors were household and leisure goods, where a fifth and
a quarter respectively of those polled said the impact of the recession had
already worn off. In personal care and hygiene, by contrast, none of the
respondents reported any improvement.
Almost all the executives said recession had made consumers more
price-sensitive, and most said switching between competing brands had become
more common.

MR JACQUES ATTALI, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, breakfasts with the deputy prime minister of an eastern
European state, lunches with bankers in another and then dines with a head
of state several hundred miles away.
As he says himself, the only way to keep up such a pace is to use a private
jet. One charter company in particular, Air Entreprise, based at Le Bourget,
near Paris, has been the beneficiary of Mr Attali's flights from London
where the EBRD is based.
Last year the EBRD paid Fr6.88m (Pounds 739,000 in terms of the exchange
rates when the flights took place) for 26 flights with Air Entreprise - many
to destinations well-served by scheduled flights - according to a detailed
memorandum prepared by Mr Anders Ljungh, the bank's finance director, which
has been obtained by the Financial Times.
Only once in that year did the EBRD charter an aircraft from another
operator. That was for a trip to the Baltic states of the former Soviet
Union, which did not involve Mr Attali. The trip was organised by six EBRD
directors, each a civil servant representing the countries which own the
bank.
That trip to the Baltic states lasted six days and the jet provided by the
charter company, Euro-flite, carried 10 passengers from the bank. The cost
of the expedition, which included stops in Helsinki, Vilnius, Riga, Tallin
and St Petersburg, was Pounds 8,800.
The banks' directors have now asked why all but one of the trips with Air
Entreprise cost more than that. The expenditure on private jets is one of
the main targets of the investigation into the bank's financial management
being carried out by the bank's audit committee.
Mr Claes de Neergaard, a Swedish government official who is chairman of the
bank's audit committee, made a series of critical comments on the flights in
a report dated May 7:
'The committee believed the use of special flights (flights in charted
aircraft) should be scrutinised on the grounds of cost efficiency, cost
effectiveness and their impact on the bank's image.
'The committee was not satisfied that cost efficiency had been demonstrated,
especially where flights were to destinations well-served by commercial
airlines.
'The committee expressed doubts as to the cost-effectiveness as it appeared
that special flights were often necessitated by an impractical agenda.
'The committee expressed serious concern that during 1992 one company (Air
Entreprise) had been used for all but one of the 27 flights.'
One bank director said yesterday the audit committee would now carry out a
'forensic probe' of the flights taken by Mr Attali. The audit committee has
received Mr Ljungh's synopsis of private jet flights in 1992 but this list
does not give details of Mr Attali's schedule on those trips, nor why Air
Entreprise was chosen as carrier.
In its publicity material Air Entreprise, whose main trading arm is Air
Entreprise International, describes itself as 'the first aviation company
for business purposes in France and the second in Europe'.
It says that in 1991 its turnover was Fr150m from a fleet of 19 aircraft,
including 11 Falcons, regarded as among the most luxurious of private
aircraft.
A company search has disclosed that Air Entreprise International made
after-tax losses of Fr91m in 1991 and Fr13m losses in the year to June 1992.
The search also found that an unpaid bill was registered against the company
in January 1993.
Air Entreprise's holding company is Compagnie Europeene d'Aviation Generale.
Last August Mr Rene Micaud, the former chairman of a tour operator, Air
Outre-Mer, bought 67 per cent of the shares in CEAG.
Mr Bin Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, a member of the Saudi Royal Family, acquired
the remaining shares. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Mr Micaud is said to have good political connections, and under his
chairmanship Air Outre-Mer was granted authorisation for new routes by the
then Socialist government.
Air Entreprise was formerly owned by Mr Dominique Bouillon, a businessman
best known for his involvement in the Paris property market. He had tried to
rationalise the private jet sector - but without success - just before he
sold out of the business.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Industry's growth plans 'flawed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING companies are forecasting a bright future for the next three
years but their growth plans are 'fundamentally flawed', says a study by
Pera International, one of Europe's leading business consultancies.
A Pera survey of 345 companies released this week - mainly in mechanical
engineering, medical engineering, and the electronics and automotive
industries - finds that 82 per cent expect business growth this year and 96
per cent predict significant growth within three years.
But nearly a quarter of respondents admitted they could not develop a growth
strategy, while nearly a third could not implement development plans.
In addition a fifth were unable to pinpoint their company's own strengths,
identify new business opportunities or recognise the factors critical to
their success.
The survey found that nearly 90 per cent of manufacturers had survived the
recession by cutting costs. This made them 'leaner' and more efficient but
had not increased or even protected their market share.
Pera says: 'Come the economic upturn, these companies will not be able to
capitalise on their own leanness.
'Many of their planned growth strategies cannot bear fruit, due to a lack of
specific skills to implement them. A lack of adequate financial resources is
also likely to scupper many hungry companies' plans for growth.'
It believes growth plans are flawed because of a worrying fundamental
inconsistency.
Manufacturers, understandably cautious, are mainly looking to develop within
their current core business. But if most organisations are adopting the same
develop-ment strategies only the 'outstanding few' will gain the increased
market share they expect, says Pera.
Most manufacturers surveyed also gave their employees, especially the sales
team, little credit for the company's success.
'This attitude contradicts respondents' desires to grow the business,' says
Pera. 'The traditional notion that 'the product sells itself' still
prevails.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / US plans economic aid for S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is prepared to work with other leading industrialised nations to help
South Africa 're-enter the global economy' once its transition to a
non-racial democracy is firmly on track.
In the first speech by a secretary of state exclusively devoted to Africa
policy since the end of the cold war, Mr Warren Christopher said the US-led
effort, in which it expected co-operation from others in the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations, would begin once a transitional executive
council has been put in place and a firm date for elections set.
Before that, Mr Christopher went on: 'We have urged the World Bank and the
parties in South Africa to begin planning now the projects that will lead to
economic growth.' He hoped US businesses would be in the vanguard of
investment in South Africa.
He had special praise for both Mr Nelson Mandela and President F W de Klerk
for the 'monumental achievement' of making free and fair elections possible.
'That election will echo around the African continent and across the world
as a roaring triumph of human rights,' he said.
Mr Christopher placed his commitment to assist the South African economy
firmly in the context of the promotion of democracy throughout the
continent. 'That is why President Clinton chose to invite the first
president of a democratic Namibia, Sam Nujoma, as the first African head of
state to be recognised at his White House.'
Elsewhere in his speech, he bluntly referred to President Mobutu Sese Seko
of Zaire as an example of 'corrupt dictators' but he singled out no other
African autocrat, preferring instead to praise unnamed 'courageous
democrats' from Senegal to Benin and Madagascar to Mali, and to warn that
'the US will take human rights into account as we determine how to allocate
our scarce resources for foreign assistance'.
The Christopher speech, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the
Africa-America Institute, was to have been the stage for announcing US
recognition of the former Marxist government of Angola. That, however, was
pre-empted by Mr Clinton earlier last week.  ANC leader Nelson Mandela ended
a two-day visit to Natal province yesterday, urging an end to conflict
between supporters of the ANC and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party,
Reuter reports.
At least 8,000 people have been killed in clashes between the groups in
Natal since 1986.
Mr Mandela's plea came a day after at least 13 people were killed in clashes
between ANC supporters, Inkatha hostel dwellers and police in Thokoza
township, east of Johannesburg. The ANC and Inkatha both demanded a judicial
inquest into the killings.
Mr Mandela also said the date for the first all-race elections would be
announced before the end of this month. The 26 parties to multi-party talks
have already agreed the poll will take place no later than April next year
and have been debating a precise date.
ANC activists devised a plan to rescue Mr Mandela from Robben Island prison
in 1981 in a basket dangling from a helicopter, but the attempt was called
off by ANC leaders in exile because it was too risky, Reuter reports. Mr
Mandela was freed in February 1990 after 27 years' detention.

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S opposition parties have launched an offensive over how long
acting President Octavio Lepage should stay in office, just three days after
being sworn in.
Mr Lepage, backed by his Democratic Action Party, wants to stay in office
for 90 days or more. But the opposition says he should have no more than 30
days and a joint session of congress should elect a new president from its
members before then. As a former senator, Mr Lepage would presumably be
eligible.
Mr Lepage, a veteran politician, took over as caretaker president after the
senate decided there were grounds to impeach President Carlos Andres Perez,
who was suspended from his duties. Mr Perez was due to complete his
five-year elected term on February 2 1994, but now must face charges of
mishandling government funds.
Ex-president Rafael Caldera, a leading candidate in presidential elections
scheduled for next December, said the congress should vote within a week on
a new president, and warned that he would demand an opinion from the supreme
court if Mr Lepage tried to stay longer than 30 days.
While Venezuela's constitution clearly defines a presidential succession
procedure in case of the death or resignation of a sitting chief executive,
it is not precise on the question of a temporary presidential absence.
Mr Lepage has served as acting president for short periods under two
previous governments. Constitutionally, he is first in line to replace a
sitting president as chairman of the Senate, and as such chairman of the
National Congress.
Mr Lepage served as minister of the interior under President Perez during
the latter's first presidential term in the 1970s, and under President Jaime
Lusinchi, who was in office from 1983 to early 1989. In these posts, he was
made acting president when the president went abroad. He has served in
Congress for many years, first as a deputy then as a senator.

<TEXT>
MEXICO and Canada are at odds with the US over accords on environmental and
labour standards which would form part of the North American free trade
agreement (Nafta).
Following a three-day negotiating session in Ottawa, Mexico and Canada
expressed misgivings over Washington's demands for measures to enforce the
accords and for sanctions for non-compliance.
Nafta is due to come into force next January. However, the Clinton
administration wants to stiffen the environmental and labour provisions of
the agreement to counter fears that low Mexican wages and weak
anti-pollution standards will attract many US companies to Mexico.
Canada and Mexico are concerned that US companies may use environmental and
labour disputes as a pretext for broader trade complaints. The two
governments also contend that a separate enforcement mechanism could
undermine the provisions of Nafta.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO posted a trade deficit of Dollars 3.64bn (Pounds 2.36bn) in the first
quarter, up 7.9 per cent on 1992. The rise is smaller than previous years
and follows a sharp slowdown in import growth.
Imports reached Dollars 15.38bn in the first quarter, a rise of 10.3 per
cent, compared to growth rates of 20-30 per cent last year.
Exports rose to Dollars 11.75bn, 11.1 per cent more than the same period
last year, with manufacturing exports performing particularly well.
The trade numbers come on the back of an unexpectedly favourable increase of
2.4 per cent in gross domestic product in the first quarter. Some sectors,
such as textiles and apparel, and metals and machinery, suffered from high
interest rates and tight fiscal policy, while construction rose 7.6 per cent
and services were up by 2.6 per cent.
For March the government reported a trade deficit of Dollars 1.23bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG-ARM tactics by big countries to impose policies on others could
endanger the world trading system, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said in South Korea this morning,
apparently referring to the US, Reuter reports from Geneva.
Unless the Uruguay Round talks on trade liberalisation were wrapped up this
year, he told the Pacific Basin Economic Council in Seoul, they might never
be completed.
'We see for example attempts to impose domestic environmental or labour
standards on other countries through trade measures, and attempts to open
markets through bilateral pressure rather than in multilateral negotiation,'
Mr Dunkel said. 'This bilateralism is a threat to open regional arrangements
as much as it is to the open multilateral system.'
Mr Dunkel said he was disturbed by 'a new flirtation with protectionism in
some of the world's leading economies' and a questioning of the value of an
open trading system.
This was especially alarming, the former Swiss diplomat said, because hopes
for a modest recovery in the world economy 'hinge on the prospects for
growth in trade'.
His main criticism was clearly aimed at President Bill Clinton's new team
and sections of the Democrat-controlled Congress which argue for tough
tactics to achieve Washington's trade objectives.
Mr Dunkel said Mr Clinton's request to Congress for renewed negotiating
authority in the round until December 15 was encouraging, and urged leaders
of the industrial powers meeting in Tokyo in July to work for that deadline.
In a sign that he was far from convinced it could be met, he warned that
'all of the old protectionist interests are still out there . . . waiting
for their chance at a comeback and all too happy to borrow some respectable
clothes'.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Trade bans may save the whale, but not the elephant

BIO-DIVERSITY is the environmental lobby's latest buzz-word. Translated, it
means the more species, the merrier. But this diversity appears to be under
threat, at least according to statistics compiled by the World Conservation
Monitoring Centre, which purport to show that species extinctions have risen
rapidly over the past century. Humans cannot be blamed for the demise of all
species, the extinction of the dinosaur being one obvious example. Let us
accept, however, both that bio-diversity is worth preserving and that it is
human beings who are responsible for the rise in extinctions in recent
decades. What can be done to reverse the trend?
The standard response, enshrined in numerous international conventions, is
to ban economic exploitation of endangered species. Such a ban is the
mechanism that the International Whaling Commission has used for over 40
years in its efforts to reverse the collapse in the number of blue and
hump-back whales. A fortnight ago, at its 45th annual meeting, the IWC
decided not to lift its ban on commercial whaling.
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) hopes
that by banning ivory trade it can reverse the demise of the African
elephant, whose numbers halved between 1979 and 1989, implying a loss of
over 700,000 elephants. The ban was imposed in 1989 and reconfirmed a year
ago, despite opposition from southern African governments.
Do such trade bans work? Not always, argues Mr Timothy Swanson in the latest
issue of Economic Policy. A ban on commercial fishing may be an effective
way of protecting threatened oceanic species from excess farming, he argues,
but halting trade in elephant products is not.
Whales are threatened with extinction for three reasons: they breed slowly;
they are cheap to catch relative to the market price for whale products; and
access is available to anyone with a boat and the necessary expertise. If
access to whale farming were controlled by quotas, their numbers could
theoretically be stabilised. In practice, a ban on commercial whaling is a
more effective way of reducing the economic return for fishermen and thus
discouraging their capture. But the success of this policy for preserving
the whales depends on the assumption that, left to their own devices, whales
would breed freely and flourish.
The same argument does not apply to elephants, which do not have the luxury
of living in huge oceans. The survival of land species, especially such
large and potentially destructive animals as elephants, depends on the
willingness of humans to preserve their habitat. This depends on their
economic return, compared to other land uses.
It is because investing in elephants has not been sufficiently profitable,
at least in the poorest African states, that elephants are threatened. While
the proximate cause for the decline in the number of African elephants in
recent years seems to be the availability of high-power weapons and the
relatively lucrative ivory trade, elephants were killed in large numbers
because government did not find it profitable to stop the poachers. In the
1980s, four countries alone - Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire and Sudan - lost
750,000 elephants. All spent less than Dollars 20 a year per square
kilometre on park management. Zimbabwe, by contrast, spent Dollars 194 and
saw its elephant stock rise by over 20,000.
Little wonder that the higher spending governments of southern Africa are
arguing for the ban on the ivory trade to be lifted. Banning trade reduces
the incentive for African countries to keep poachers out of the parks or to
preserve elephant-friendly habitats. If African elephants are to be saved,
the economic return on elephant farming must be increased, rather than
lowered, perhaps by granting export quotas to countries willing to invest in
keeping the poachers out. Free trade in ivory may not be environmentally
friendly, but neither is a trade ban.

India's federal government yesterday removed the governor of Uttar Pradesh,
a key northern state where Hindu extremists demolished a mosque last
December, Reuter reports from Lucknow. Mr B. Satyanarain Reddy was replaced
by Mr Moti Lal Vohra, President Shankar Dayal Sharma's office announced.
Nearly 2,000 people were killed in riots after the mosque demolition.
Congress leaders of Uttar Pradesh have been demanding Mr Reddy's removal
since the razing of the mosque. They suspect him of loyalty to the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government which was ruling in the
state at that time.

<TEXT>
New Zealand and Australia sought at the weekend to underline their
commitment to co-operation, particularly in trade, after a three-day visit
to New Zealand by Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, writes Terry
Hall in Wellington.
Mr Keating spelled out a vision of 'companionability' for the trading future
between the two countries, adding that the 'main game is our integration in
the Asian-Pacific region'.
On defence, Mr Keating apparently failed to secure agreement for New Zealand
to spend more, and was also unsuccessful in his calls for the country to
patch up its differences on nuclear ship visits with the US under the Anzus
pact.
There was agreement on pensions integration, and the two leaders said they
would facilitate moves on air travel between the two countries to allow
people to use domestic terminals by the end of the year.

THE Israeli cabinet yesterday allocated 30m shekels (Pounds 7m) to create
20,000 jobs in the occupied territories for Palestinians barred from
entering Israel since the closure order was issued almost two months ago,
writes our Jerusalem Correspondent.
The cabinet rejected left-wing ministers' calls for the introduction of
unemployment pay for tens of thousands of Palestinians who are being kept
away from their jobs in Israel since the closure began.
The growing hardship in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip is
attracting increasing international criticism. The US, which sees chances
for progress in the Middle East peace process ebbing away, called on Israel
over the weekend to ease conditions.

FT  24 MAY 93 / From dictators to democracy: Political debate returns after
decades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the 40 years since independence from France, Cambodia has known little of
democracy until this week.
When Prince Norodom Sihanouk was in power in the 1950s he stifled and
persecuted parties which opposed him; Lon Nol, who overthrew the prince in
1970, was a dictator. The Khmer Rouge leaders who came to power in 1975 were
ruthlessly authoritarian and killed 1m Cambodians, and the regime installed
by Vietnam in 1979 was a one-party state modelled on the Soviet system.
The United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) has
nevertheless tried to introduce western-style democracy following the
signing in 1991 of the Paris peace accords by the four main Cambodian
factions.
UN volunteers have fanned out across the country to preach the message.
For the first time in decades Cambodians have been exposed to a spirited
debate between politicians at hundreds of election rallies around the
country. Nearly 4.8m people have registered to vote.
In some respects the policies of the 20 parties in the election are
indistinguishable. Many are run by exiles who live in France, Thailand or
the US. Most call for peace and reconciliation and are broadly hostile to
Vietnamese immigrants. Most recommend a free market economy but are
otherwise vague on economic and financial policy.
The chief distinction between the leading contenders is over whether to
isolate and destroy the Khmer Rouge or to attempt to accommodate them - as
the UN did with so little success - in a new government. The main parties in
Cambodia are:
Cambodian People's party. The Communist party behind the present
administration in Phnom Penh. Installed after the Vietnamese invasion which
overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979, it has failed to receive international
recognition, something it hopes to gain by winning this week's election.
The party claims to be the only organisation strong enough to combat the
Khmer Rouge menace. There are fears it will be reluctant to hand over to
opposition parties if it loses at the polls. Mr Chea Sim is the party
leader.
Funcinpec. The royalist party regarded as the main rival to the CPP. Created
by Prince Sihanouk in 1981 to oppose the Vietnamese occupation, the party is
now led by his son Prince Ranariddh, a university professor at
Aix-en-Provence. It is the best-financed and organised of the opposition
parties with offices throughout the country.
Funcinpec's policy is to hand over substantial powers to Prince Sihanouk and
seek accommodation with the Khmer Rouge, with which it had an alliance
against the Vietnamese occupiers until the 1991 peace accords.
Buddhist Liberal Democratic party. Led by Mr Son Sann, an 81-year-old former
Cambodian prime minister, the BLDP could be an important third force in the
new assembly. The party emerged from the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front, the US-backed faction which signed the Paris accords. Like Funcinpec,
it was allied to the Khmer Rouge during the Vietnamese occupation but is now
almost defunct as a military force. The party has committed itself to
resisting the Vietnamisation of Cambodia, to opposing any return of the
Khmer Rouge and to fighting corruption.
Khmer Rouge. Known to its supporters as the Party of Democratic Kampuchea,
the Khmer Rouge has rejected the election. The organisation signed the Paris
peace deal but has reneged on the agreement by refusing to disarm its
guerrillas and vowing to disrupt the voting.
Pol Pot, the infamous Brother Number One, is still regarded as the Khmer
Rouge leader, although Mr Khieu Samphan is technically party chief.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Third plan for HK airport funding
</HEADLINE>

THE HONG KONG government has passed to China a third set of options for
financing the colony's HKDollars 165bn (Pounds 13.8bn) airport and related
infrastructure developments. Officials would give no details of the new
financial plan - the third in little more than a year - but said it was
given to Chinese government officials a few weeks ago.
The timing of the proposal appears to have coincided with senior Chinese
officials' remarks that they wanted to see the airport built according to
schedule.
Since the first financial plan was given to the Chinese in March last year,
the airport has been hostage to an agreed Sino-British solution to Hong
Kong's future political development.
News of the new plan comes amid signs of markedly better Anglo-Chinese
co-operation on economic aspects of Hong Kong's development which have
followed the resumption of bilateral talks about the colony's future
political arrangements.
Late last week China approved three business franchises which span June
1997, when it resumes sovereignty of Hong Kong. There are also indications
Beijing may re-enter discussions on development of the colony's container
port.
Tony Walker adds from Beijing: China and Britain agreed to resume talks on
the wider issue of Hong Kong's future later this week after their third
round of discussions in Beijing ended yesterday without apparent
breakthrough.
A joint statement said merely that a fourth round would be held on May 28-29
in Beijing. But Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador to Beijing and head
of his country's negotiating team, described the atmosphere of the latest
round as good. 'The work we're doing is quite complicated,' he said. His
remarks indicated the two sides may have moved on to more substantial
discussions.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Cambodia poll puts Untac's chief to the test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMANTHA MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are anxious days for Mr Yasushi Akashi, the 62-year-old Japanese
diplomat who heads the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia
(Untac). His reputation depends on the success or failure of this week's
UN-organised general election.
As Cambodians go to the polls after 19 months of UN efforts to implement the
peace plan signed in Paris in 1991, many of Mr Akashi's critics inside and
outside Untac are blaming his apparent indecisiveness and policy of patient
diplomacy for the UN's failure to disarm the warring factions or bring peace
to the country.
But Untac's mandate was to monitor a ceasefire rather than enforce one, and
Mr Akashi was blocked at almost every turn by the intransigence of the Khmer
Rouge, which reneged on the peace accord and threatens to disrupt the
elections, and by the unwillingness of the government in Phnom Penh to yield
control to UN administrators.
One of the turning points of Untac's mandate was in June last year, when Mr
Akashi and Gen John Sanderson, Untac's Australian military commander,
declined to insist on the UN's right to enter Khmer Rouge areas. Gen Michel
Loridon, Gen Sanderson's forceful French deputy, left Untac, complaining
that it should have called the Khmer Rouge's bluff and if necessary take on
the Khmer Rouge militarily even if it meant the loss of perhaps 200 men.
Mr Akashi disagrees. 'I have no authority. I am not at liberty to sacrifice
200 good soldiers, even 20 soldiers,' he said in an interview at Untac
headquarters. 'We have to remain within the mandate given to us by the Paris
agreement and by the UN Security Council.
'We are not a group of heroic soldiers. We're not a group of Joan of Arcs
here. We are here based on the willing consent of four Cambodian parties,
who in their free will agreed to accept a number of political obligations.
But some of the parties act as if they have forgotten the instrument which
they signed in good faith in Paris.'
Asked whether it might not have been better to have changed Untac's mandate
to give it more powers of enforcement, Mr Akashi said there was little
support for such a move from governments contributing to the peacekeeping
forces, especially those from Asia and Australia. 'Use of force in a
domestic conflict can be extremely messy and bloody.'
He added: 'With the end of the cold war we thought the golden age of peace
would arrive but it has not arrived and we are faced with Somalia,
Yugoslavia, Afghanistan. We are seeing how persistent the domestic route of
conflict is.'
Mr Akashi accepts the need for some kind of continuing UN presence after the
scheduled departure of Untac in August, but is worried about Cambodia
becoming too dependent on outside help.
'I do not like the spectre of Cambodia becoming a second Cyprus,' he said.
'I'm torn between the desire to help Cambodia and Cambodian people longer -
to see to it that some of the reforms and the policies we have started will
be completed - and my desire not to make this country and the Cambodian
people feel too dependent on external influence.
'If the new government of Cambodia wishes, I think the Security Council will
respond favourably to establishing some kind of small UN presence. . . In
the meantime the reconstruction projects will continue and be expanded even.
The World Bank, the IMF and the Asian Development Bank will come in, but
they are waiting to see whether peace and stability in Cambodia after the
elections will be secure enough ..'
Responding to his critics, Mr Akashi denied he was merely a practitioner of
'patient diplomacy'. 'No, I think I am not that patient,' he said. 'I
combine patience and impatience. If you are not patient you will not get
things done, but unless you are impatient nothing will move, so you have to
have appropriate combinations of both.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / China tightens credit reins: Lending clamp revives fears of
another boom to bust cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has begun enforcing tougher credit restrictions, squeezing funds
available for both investment and operating expenditures, according to
foreign bankers and businessmen.
Fears of a resurgence of inflation, with the urban rate running at an
annualised 17 per cent in April, have prompted the renewed drive by China's
central bank to curb a credit explosion and calm an overheating economy.
However, the lending clamp has revived worries of a return to the boom and
bust cycle of the 1980s, when tough administrative measures such as credit
curbs and import restrictions slowed economic growth dramatically. 'Many
local joint ventures are starved of currency,' said a western banker, citing
cases of businesses that now have to go to a 'grey market', dominated by
non-bank financial institutions, to borrow funds at interest rates of 20-40
per cent.
China's economy grew by nearly 13 per cent last year and growth in the first
four months of 1993 exceeded 14 per cent, compared with the same period last
year. Western economists have long been warning that such rates are
unsustainable.
Last week China increased interest rates on bank lending and deposits in an
attempt to staunch the flow of funds from the banking system.
The credit squeeze coincides with a continuing depreciation of the yuan,
with rates to the dollar exceeding Yn10 on the black market against an
official rate of Yn5.7.
The People's Bank is reported to be placing non-bank financial institutions,
such as local trust and investment companies, under more stringent
supervision to restrain credit growth. Lending by the institutions has
fuelled a real estate boom and the spread of economic development zones in
provincial areas.
China has also indicated that it plans to restrain money supply growth to a
figure of about half that of last year, but western economists in Beijing
are sceptical. M2, the broader measure of money supply, climbed by 30 per
cent last year, and continued in similar vein in this year's first quarter.

FT  24 MAY 93 / E German steel strike nears end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EASTERN GERMANY'S three-week steel strike is expected to end tomorrow
following an agreement reached at the weekend between the employers and IG
Metall, Germany's powerful metalworkers' union.
The 7,000 steel workers who have been on strike since mid-May, mostly in
Brandenburg, will be balloted tomorrow. If they accept the deal, it will
bring to an end a wave of strikes which threatened to paralyse eastern
Germany's industrial sector.
Under the terms of the agreement, forged after 13 hours of negotiations, the
equalisation of eastern and western German pay levels for the steel sector
has been postponed by two years, to April 1996. Until then, wages will reach
80 per cent of western German levels, beginning next month instead of last
April, and will rise to 90 per cent in October 1994.
At present, incomes in eastern Germany's loss-making steel sector are 60 per
cent of western German levels.
The agreement is modelled, with modifications, on the Saxony compromise,
agreed 10 days ago between employers and IG Metall's metal and electrical
sectors. However, the employers can exercise an opt-out, or hardship clause
for those enterprises which cannot afford the proposed pay rises. IG Metall
had rejected the Saxony compromise as a model for the steel sector on the
grounds that it failed to iron out the income differentials between eastern
Germany's steel, metal and electrical industries, even though parity among
these two sectors does not exist in western Germany.
The formula agreed yesterday maintains this income differential, but gives
the steel industry in eastern Germany a slight edge over the metal and
electrical sectors in terms of income parity with its west German
counterparts.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Stop-gap agreement on Bosnia: Deal mends rift between allies
but does little for permanent settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE main achievement of the agreement reached at the weekend by the US with
its European allies and Russia is that it momentarily heals the rift between
them over what to do next in Bosnia.
Yet it is clear that the joint plan of action is no more than a stop-gap
measure which, while it might damp down the fighting and protect Moslem
communities in a number of UN 'safe areas', does very little to provide the
basis for a permanent political settlement.
No more than lip-service is paid in the final communique to the Vance-Owen
plan for a division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces
based largely on ethnic criteria. The Bosnian Serbs' total rejection of the
plan, and the less than lukewarm support it has won from Washington, has
virtually relegated the plan to the already overflowing archives of
unsuccessful Balkan peace projects.
It can, as the communique from the Washington talks emphasises, still form a
building block for a negotiated 'durable' peace settlement, which remains
the objective of the countries attempting to find a solution to the Bosnian
conflict. But the prospect of anything more than a partial implementation of
the Vance-Owen proposals has become very slim indeed.
Communiques usually try to put the most optimistic gloss on the outcome of
the meetings which they describe. But the Washington communique merely
states that 'to the extent that the parties decide to implement promptly
mutually agreed provisions of the Vance-Owen plan, this is to be
encouraged.' It has recently been conclusively demonstrated that the main
provisions of the plan cannot be mutually agreed.
Though the ultimate objective of the Washington participants remains 'the
withdrawal of Bosnian Serb troops from territories occupied by force', there
is no mention in the communique of the precise area to be given up, as there
is in the Vance-Owen plan. The phraseology employed is reminiscent of UN
Security Council resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict, which have
remained largely a dead letter for more than two decades.
Nor are any radical new measures proposed to achieve such a withdrawal. US
President Bill Clinton has been unable to persuade his allies to accept
either the lifting of the UN arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia in
favour of the Bosnian Moslems or 'surgical' air strikes against Bosnian Serb
military targets. The emphasis will remain on a tightening of UN economic
sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro and the sealing of their borders
with Bosnia, which, it is hoped, will eventually force the Bosnian Serbs to
adopt a more reasonable position.
However, it is not even certain that the proposal to place international
monitors on the Serbian-Bosnian border - reiterated by the participants in
the Washington meeting - will be accepted by President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia. According to some reports from Belgrade, Mr Milosevic, while
promising to seal the border with Bosnia, has rejected the idea of
international monitors. Nor does he appear to be making good his promise to
block military and other strategic supplies across the Bosnian border.
One of the most positive aspects of the new plan is the formal endorsement
by the main powers of the concept of 'safe areas' in Bosnia-Hercegovina to
protect the Moslem population from further expulsions and atrocities. But
even this idea has been seriously weakened by the refusal of the US, which
remains sceptical about the whole concept because of the danger that havens
could become no more than huge 'refugee camps', to commit ground troops for
their protection.
Washington's promise to protect UN forces in safe areas - though,
significantly, not Moslem civilians - from attack only by the use of air
power falls far short of what its European allies would have liked.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, has openly expressed his
'disappointment' at the refusal of the US to commit any ground troops to the
UN's operations in Bosnia, while Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, has said the UK is not prepared to increase the number of troops
 -some 2,500 - it already has in Bosnia.
Though the Russians have promised to provide an unspecified number of ground
troops for the Bosnian operation, it may prove difficult to make up the
required number, given the small number of countries with forces qualified
for such a task.
More important, the refusal by the US to contribute ground troops to the UN
Protection Force in Bosnia, coupled with the European nations' rejection of
any kind of military intervention, will undoubtedly remain a bone of
contention between the western allies.
The net result of this can only be a weakening of the political message
which they are trying to send the Bosnian Serbs.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Sirti chief arrested in Italian investigations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE impact of Italy's political corruption scandal widened sharply at the
weekend with the arrest of Mr Luigi Montella, managing director of the
state-controlled Sirti telecommunications group.
The arrest followed allegations by Mr Davide Giacalone, a former civil
servant in the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, whose testimony
triggered a wave of arrests of senior private-sector telecommunications
executives last week.
The latest allegations focus on the small Republican party, which has
managed to remain relatively untainted by the corruption scandals so far.
The new testimony, widely leaked, alleges the Republicans used their limited
ministerial representation in the former Andreotti government as an
important source of funds
Mr Giacalone's testimony alleges L9bn (Pounds 3.8m) in kickbacks was paid
between 1987 and 1990 by various telecommunications companies to Mr Oscar
Mammi, a senior Republican politician and former post minister. Mr
Giacalone, arrested this month, was an adviser to Mr Mammi.
Mr Montella's arrest marks the first involvement of the huge public-sector
Stet telecommunications group in the corruption inquiries. Sirti is the
network engineering subsidiary of Stet, the holding company for all Italy's
state-owned telecoms activities.
Mr Montella is accused of corruption relating to a contract from ASST, the
former telecommunications agency controlled directly by the Post Ministry.
The new allegations have led to both Mr Mammi and Mr Giorgio La Malfa, the
former Republican leader, being told by magistrates they could face
prosecution for accepting illicit funds and for illegal party financing. Mr
La Malfa has already been told he is under investigation over separate, less
serious, allegations of receiving illegal political contributions.
According to Mr La Malfa,the sums received from Mr Giacalone were far
smaller, and always presented as voluntary contributions to the party, which
are not outlawed.
In separate inquiries, Mr Franco Castiglione, a Socialist senator, was told
by magistrates he could face prosecution over alleged kickbacks on contracts
for Olivetti computers for the Justice Ministry. Mr Castiglione was a junior
minister in charge of improving the use of information technology for
magistrates in 1990-1991.
Naples magistrates investigating links between local magistrates, lawyers
and organised crime have also extended their inquiries to include Mr Alfredo
Bargi, a Christian Democrat senator and well-known local lawyer. The Naples
inquiries have so far resulted in 11 magistrates being placed under
investigation.
Socialist party leaders are due to meet tomorrow to elect a successor to Mr
Giorgio Benvenuto, the party leader who resigned last week after complaining
of insufficient support from many MPs.
The committee may elect Mr Ottaviano Del Turco, the former deputy head of
the CGIL trade union federation, as a compromise leader.
The party, which has been severely implicated in the corruption scandal,
risks breaking apart because of divisions between those, such as Mr
Benvenuto, who want to distance it from Mr Bettino Craxi, its former
leaders, and less reformist MPs loyal to Mr Craxi.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE is at last tackling the structural problems that have undermined the
economy over the last decade, but perseverance will be needed to achieve
convergence with the rest of the European Community, according to the
International Monetary Fund.
'After years of hesitant starts, structural adjustment gained substantial
momentum in 1992, especially in privatisation, deregulation and financial
and public sector reform,' the IMF said in its annual report on the Greek
economy.
However, the confidential report also pointed out that inflation, now 16.2
per cent, is still much higher than elsewhere in the EC, while revenue
raising remains a pressing problem.
The IMF said the government should take immediate measures to ensure that
this year's target of a primary budget surplus, amounting to 5 per cent of
gross domestic product, can be achieved, following a serious shortfall in
revenues in the first quarter.
The government has ruled out introducing new taxes ahead of next spring's
election, but is preparing spending cuts that would reduce public investment
this year and trim subsidies to state-controlled enterprises.
The report added that further spending curbs would be needed next year,
focusing on 'cost-cutting in the government and the broader public sector,
with a vigorous attack on overmanning'.
Despite pledging to cut 50,000 public sector jobs by 1994, the government
has made little progress on reducing the civil service payroll, swollen by
patronage appointments.
The report also called for a more determined effort on privatisation,
despite political opposition, in order to bring down the public debt, now at
around 120 per cent of GDP.
The IMF warned against any relaxation of the stabilisation effort.

FT  24 MAY 93 / European industrial output 'to fall 3.9%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN industrial output will fall by 3.9 per cent this year as a mood of
pessimism sweeps the continent's big economies, according to a report
published today.
The production decline in Germany, France and Italy will be even sharper
than the average as UK output will rise, says a review from DRI-McGraw Hill,
a forecasting company. Even when growth returns it will average only 2.1 per
cent over the next five years, compared with 3.6 per cent in 1986-1990.
Some sectors will do well. Communications services will grow 4.7 per cent a
year, with financial services and pharmaceuticals on 3.9 and 3.7 per cent
respectively.
But caution and tough competition in world markets means that 'many
investment decisions have either been postponed or cancelled, seriously
affecting the level of demand for capital goods'.
A slowdown in construction will stifle growth in metals, cement, glass and
ceramics.
Meanwhile, overcapacity will see iron and steel output growing by just 0.8
per cent a year over the next five years.
DRI-McGraw Hill cut its forecast for growth in sectors where Europe excels,
such as electrical equipment for industry and mechanical engineering. Their
annual growth projection over the next five years is 2.1 per cent, against a
forecast a year ago of 3.8 per cent. Aerospace equipment is also expected to
decline.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Belgium keen to contribute to Euro-corps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM is poised to contribute military forces to the Euro-corps being set
up by France and Germany, which it sees as a vital building block in
constructing a common European foreign and defence identity.
The Belgian government, which takes over the EC presidency from the Danes in
six weeks, is expected to give renewed impetus to European integration after
a year dominated by the crisis over the ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
But Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, this weekend dismissed
recent speculation that the Belgian presidency would push for an early
reform of EC decision-making to make it more federal and supranational.
Mr Claes said France, Germany and Belgium had now agreed that the
Euro-corps, expected to number around 40,000 by 1995, should be under Nato
command and be part of the Western European Union, while its command would
rotate between its members.
Mr Claes said he hoped European military co-operation could be pulled
together by 1996, when the Community is due to hold its next review of
Europe's integration. According to Maastricht, ratification of which was
unblocked last week by approval in the Danish referendum and the UK House of
Commons, 1996 is also the date at which reform of EC decision-making will be
examined.
More streamlined decision-making, implying less room for national vetoes, is
seen as the inevitable consequence of the EC taking in new members.
Despite speculation that Belgium will insist on institutional reform talks
now, Mr Claes said it would be 'logical, democratic and fair play' to wait
until the new members were in. Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway are all
negotiating entry by 1995. But he added that the goal of the Community 'is
not an economic one but a political one. We need an open debate and a
sincere debate in Scandinavia and in Austria on this target.'
He said the Belgian presidency's 'pragmatic' priorities would be to develop
foreign and security policy and EC co-operation on emigration and asylum
foreseen by Maastricht; to accelerate the enlargement negotiations; 'a
serious effort' to combat recession and unemployment; and preparing the
second stage of economic and monetary union, due to start in January.
Mr Claes insisted that recent remarks by his colleague, finance minister Mr
Phillipe Maystadt, that Emu's tight fiscal convergence criteria might have
to be reviewed, had been exaggerated. 'What Maystadt said was that if the
recession drags on, the figures (which set limits on budget deficits and
public debt), not the criteria, may have to be reviewed.'

FT  24 MAY 93 / Bank governors back more ERM flexibility

THE European exchange rate mechanism needs to be more flexible and central
parities must be accompanied by credible national economic policies,
according to a report by the committee of EC central bank governors on last
autumn's exchange rate crisis.
The central bankers' report criticises member states for failing to make
timely currency realignments and calls for a regular 'candid and frank'
dialogue on the sustainability of existing ERM parties.
The committee also expresses sympathy for the much-criticised Bundesbank's
policy of maintaining high interest rates in the aftermath of German
unification: 'A tight monetary stance was the necessary response to counter
price increases, leaving little scope for interest rate reductions.'
A central theme in the report is that the European monetary system should
not be managed as a de facto monetary union. This would be premature as the
necessary degree of economic convergence has yet to be achieved between
member states.
The ERM remains the designated vehicle for European monetary union as set
out in the Maastricht treaty; but the central bankers make clear in their
analysis of the crisis that there is no substitute for credible national
policies in support of price stability.
'Realignments of central rates remain an important feature of the system and
provision must be made for timely realignments when parities have become
unsustainable in the light of a country's macroeconomic performance and its
current and future policies.'
The central bankers concede that the assessment of ERM parities is an
extremely difficult task. The report refers to 'broad agreement' in the
committee in favour of tighter surveillance of exchange rate relationships,
a kind of early warning system.
The idea is to help to prod member states toward a consensus on the
sustainability of central rates or the desirability of a timely realignment.
'The committee stands ready to play its role in this surveillance exercise
and to devise procedures for communicating its view to ministers.'
The bank governors come down decisively against automatic responses to
market tensions, such as symmetrical action on the part of authorities of
countries with weaker and stronger currencies.
Though they do not rule out intervening on an ad-hoc basis, the governors
draw a clear line. Support will be forthcoming provided it does not
jeopardise the control over domestic monetary conditions in the country
issuing the intervention currency and that it is consistent with the primary
objective of achieving price stability in the Community.
This appears to meet objections from the Bundesbank that its support
interventions in favour of weaker currencies - particularly in favour of the
British pound and the Italian lira last September - risked jeopardising
control of its domestic money supply.
The governors say the ERM crisis confirmed that interventions - even where
they were before the currency hit its margins - have only a limited effect
in containing instability and may even exacerbate it if prolonged.
'Timely increases in interest rates remain the most promising course to
counter market pressure,' the report says. But it concedes that prolonged
high interest rates may not be sustainable if member states are in
recession.
The report declares that making market operators aware of the risks and
possible losses from speculation is critical to managing the ERM. One option
could be to allow a currency to strengthen within its fluctuation band when
market pressures ease; another option is to use an element of surprise when
offsetting the liquidity impact of exchange rate intervention in the money
markets.
The committee expresses caution about any possible changes in the width of
the fluctuation bands for the weaker and stronger currencies of 2 1/2 per
cent and 6 per cent respectively.
The committee notes that decisions on the band should be preceded by 'close
consultation', taking account of the same factors as those considered when
the sustainability of the parity grid is examined.
Also, the central bankers note that recent large-scale interventions
financed through the short-term financing facility - that is, unlimited
intervention financed in Ecus when exchange rates are at their limits -
resulted in 'substantial' losses for participating countries. Accordingly,
the committee says it intends to study ways to change the present
arrangement, taking account of the need to preserve an Ecu-based system.
Lastly, the central bankers attack politicians (and occasionally the
monetary committee) for making empty promises on currency parities.
It voices 'strong doubts about the usefulness of collective public
statements in support of the existing central parities if not backed by
immediate action. Experience has shown that such statements may fail to have
a positive impact on market expectations and could also be damaging to the
credibility of the authorities.
'However, when combined with decisive and visible action, demonstrating the
authorities' determination to defend central rates, statements may play a
useful complementary role,' the report says.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Currency crisis study spreads blame: EC monetary committee
believes EMS is fundamentally sound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community member states must rediscover a consensus on the conduct
of economic policy if the European monetary system is to return to long-term
stability, according to a report by the EC monetary committee on last year's
exchange rate crisis.
The report, considered at an informal meeting of EC finance ministers in
Kolding, Denmark, at the weekend, spreads the blame for the crisis, which
saw the pound and the lira ejected from the European exchange rate
mechanism, and successive devaluations of the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese
escudo and the Irish punt.
In a 12-page analysis of the crisis, the report concludes that there is
nothing fundamentally wrong with the EMS - but the members must play by the
rules.
Germany is criticised for financing German unification through borrowing - a
choice which led inevitably to a tight monetary policy and an 'unbalanced'
policy mix, with repercussions for the rest of Europe.
The UK is criticised implicitly for failing to raise interest rates at an
early date and in a decisive manner.
Italy's devaluation is blamed on a failure to get a grip on the government
deficit, while Spain saw a significant and cumulative deterioration in its
competitive position which undermined the credibility of the peseta rate in
the ERM.
A key recommendation is that the EMS should adapt its internal rules so that
member states can take the initiative to encourage a currency realignment.
The report states that existing EMS procedures leave the initiative to the
member state whose currency is under attack - a situation which clearly
proved unsatisfactory during last autumn's exchange rate crisis.
The call for new procedures mirrors a central theme in the report: that the
onus is on the targeted member state to take appropriate action to defend
its currency using available instruments, such as interest rates.
The report also implicitly limits the obligation of central banks to support
individual currencies, even when a currency comes under speculative attack
in spite of sound economic fundamentals.
'The other member states will determine to what extent and how they can
support these efforts through appropriate voluntary actions,' the report
says.
This statement appears to dilute the obligations of central banks as set out
in the 1987 Basle-Nyborg agreement. Here there is at least a presumption in
favour of member states whose currencies are targeted without obvious
justification.
The report comes down firmly against automatic rescue operations by the
central banks, declaring that large and prolonged intervention 'may even
have a destabilising effect and they can thwart monetary policy in creditor
countries'.
A central recommendation in the report is the need for frank communication
between member states on exchange rate matters and the possible need for a
realignment - a recognition of the communications breakdown last autumn
which ended in Black Wednesday with the forced exit of the pound and lira
from the ERM.
The monetary committee would like to create a confidential set of indicators
to ensure that misalignments in exchange rates are detected as early as
possible.
'They would not be thought of as 'warning lights' and they would certainly
not dictate the outcome of the investigation. They should include,
primarily, measures of external competitiveness,' says the report.
The next step would be to change EMS procedures so that member states could
take the initiative. 'In future, they should provide for the situation in
which other member states consider that a central rate is out of line. In
these cases, there is a need for confidential procedures.'
In a separate passage, the committee also calls for 'plain speaking', a
'confrontation on policy issues' and a critical probing of forecasts and
policy intentions - a clear admission that the run-up to last year's
exchange rate crisis was marked by a breakdown in communication among the
member states and, by implication, within the monetary committee itself.
The monetary committee stresses that stability in the EMS depends on the
credibility of economic policies in all member states. Although
strengthening the process of 'convergence' on economic performance is
essential for the stability of the EMS, it 'may not be enough unless
accompanied by an improved co-ordination of economic policies and a
continued commitment to defend the system as a common good'.
The report serves notice that re-entry into the ERM can only occur after
'careful preparation' and 'by mutual agreement, with regard to the time and
the conditions'.
In particular, it says that central rates should be reached 'in a common
procedure'. This marks a break with the past when the UK chose to enter the
ERM in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 without previous consultation with its EC
partners.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Pressure increases on Major for early reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced pressure to bring forward his expected
ministerial reshuffle as further cracks appeared in cabinet unity over the
Treasury's fundamental review of welfare spending.
Ministers raised the possibility that the prime minister might be preparing
to replace Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor as early as next week.
The suggestion came as some of Mr Lamont's senior colleagues voiced concern
about the risk of a public backlash against the curbs on the welfare state
that are being studied in the Treasury.
Mr Major has made it clear he will not be 'bounced' into ministerial
changes, and late July remains the most probable date for a cabinet
shake-up. The prime minister's office refuses to comment on the speculation.
But as a further spate of leaks confirmed that the Treasury is exploring
cuts in core areas of the welfare state, close associates of Mr Major
acknowledged the growing pressure within the Tory party for speedy changes.
The associates indicated there was now a 'possibility' he would use next
week's Whitsun parliamentary recess to conduct a reshuffle that would see Mr
Lamont moved from the Treasury. One suggestion last night was that Mr Major
might combine a limited shake-up of cabinet posts with much wider changes in
the middle and junior ranks of the government.
But friends of Mr Lamont insisted there has been no indication that Mr Major
has made up his mind to move him. The chancellor, who returned to London
yesterday from a meeting of European Community finance ministers, has put in
place a series of meetings in coming months to prepare for the Budget in
November.
The political row over the spending review - which ministers warned
threatened a government defeat in the forthcoming Christchurch by-election -
has intensified the pressure on Mr Major to reassert his authority.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, sought to defuse the latest
speculation by declaring that the government would stick to its manifesto
commitments to preserve the child benefit payment and to uprate it in line
with inflation.
Accusing the Labour party of 'scare tactics', he insisted no decisions had
been taken in other areas such as widening the base for prescription
charges, introducing 'hotel' fees for hospital stays and cutting invalidity
and unemployment benefit.
But cabinet colleagues echoed warnings from backbench Tory MPs that Mr
Portillo's understandable reluctance not to close options before the
completion of the review had created serious concern among the electorate.
Ministers in charge of large Whitehall spending departments are said to be
concerned about the political risks.
Some ministers were arguing yesterday that since some of the proposals would
never win a majority in the House of Commons, Mr Major should indicate the
review will not erode central elements of the welfare state.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, indicated that the opposition
would aim to keep up the pressure on the government by demanding specific
assurances on a range of benefits and NHS services.

FT  24 MAY 93 / EBRD lending falls far short of budget targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development made commitments to
provide just Ecu70m (Pounds 55m) of loans and investments in the first
quarter of this year, according to internal bank documents.
The slow rate of lending and investment, also a feature of 1992, is
highlighted in an internal EBRD report by the bank's Swedish director, Mr
Claes de Neergaard, which criticises the bank's use of private jets and its
failure until recently to disclose that it has a Paris office.
The bank was set up two years ago to stimulate growth of the private sector
in eastern Europe. It has recently been criticised by some of the countries
which own it for investing too little while spending too much on its head
office, travel and entertaining.
A meeting of the board of directors, who represent the bank's owners, is
scheduled for today. It is expected to appoint accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand
to investigate allegations of overspending on the bank's Pounds 55.5m
project to furnish its London headquarters.
The Ecu70m committed in new EBRD investment projects falls far short of the
rate required if the bank is to meet its budget target of commitments of
between Ecu2bn and Ecu2.6bn in 1993. Funds disbursed in the first quarter
were Ecu44m, compared with a budget for the year of at least Ecu694m.
Disbursements and commitments in 1992 were also below budget.
Mr de Neergaard is chairman of the bank's audit committee, which will
oversee Cooper's probe. The audit committee will itself carry out an
investigation of the Pounds 748,000 spent by the bank in 1992 on private
jets.
It will focus in particular on why every private jet flight taken by the
EBRD president, Mr Jacques Attali, in that year was in an aircraft hired
from Air Entreprise, a company based at Le Bourget, near Paris.
A report by Mr de Neergaard, dated May 7, is an account of the views of the
seven directors who are members of the audit committee. It said the audit
committee was not satisfied that flights in private jets were justified on
grounds of 'cost efficiency'. The committee welcomed Mr Attali's decision to
stop using private jets for the 'foreseeable future'.
The committee also asked for a paper on the bank's office in Paris, ahead of
any possible renewal of the rental arrangement in June. The rent is
currently paid by the French government.
The committee members complained at the lack of information given to them
about the office. One board member 'regretted that the annual report (which
makes no mention of the Paris office) could not be considered correct with
respect to EBRD offices'.
The committee also noted that Mr Attali's wife, Elisabeth, flew with him on
one Concorde flight last year, and that his contract says his 'travel
expenses shall include the travel and hotel expenses of your (Mr Attali's)
wife in attending overseas annual meetings of the Board of Governors and in
accompanying you on official travel whenever you consider this to be in the
interests of the bank'.
The committee members have been given a separate report, dated May 14, on
the bank's financial performance during the first quarter by a group of
directors' technical assistants. It criticises underspending in some areas
of the bank's operations to offset overspending elsewhere.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Allies accused of agreeing to a 'carve-up' of Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia, yesterday lashed out
at the international community for abandoning his country to a carve-up,
after the US, Russia and their European allies announced a plan aimed at
preventing future territorial gains by Serbs.
He pledged to use all means to defend the sovereignty of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'We are not going to waste time any longer in futile negotiations,' Mr
Izetbegovic said in a statement broadcast on Sarajevo radio. 'The world has
not left us with many choices.'
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday welcomed the plan as
the recognition of Serb victory. He said it was clear that the allies 'have
shrunk from interfering in the civil war and that Bosnia should be
transformed into three states'.
The US, Russia, France, Britain and Spain agreed at the weekend on a joint
strategy aimed at containing the war. The US backed off from earlier pledges
to arm Bosnia's outgunned Moslems and roll back Serbian war gains. The
allied foreign ministers announced measures including the offer of US air
power to protect United Nations troops in 'safe areas' being created within
the republic.
The viability of 'safe areas' was, however, called sharply into question by
the leaking of an internal document of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
revealing a breakdown of law and order in Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave in
eastern Bosnia.
The document describes heightened tension among defeated Moslem fighters,
local inhabitants and refugees in the enclave, one of six Bosnian government
strongholds which have been designated 'safe areas' under international
protection.
Crime and unrest have become commonplace, and a Canadian commander
complained that he must 'use more manpower to control the local population
than to police the frontline'.
Last week a group of 15 armed men broke into a warehouse and stole part of
the UNHCR assistance, the document says. 'A crowd of some 200 people started
to march towards the warehouse to take the rest of the food.'
The black market price for a packet of cigarettes has soared to DM30 (Pounds
12). Teenage girls turn to prostitution for the price of one cigarette.
Traffic has increased in the town after 1,000 litres of diesel were stolen
from the Canadian battalion.
Moslem fighters have refused to surrender their guns, handing over only
about 10 per cent of their weapons to the peacekeepers, says the document.
Only 2,000 local inhabitants remain, but the population has trebled to
19,000 as Moslems have sought sanctuary from Serb troops elsewhere in
eastern Bosnia.
'Srebrenica at this moment is a big refugee camp without the resources,'
said Mr Laurens Jolles, a senior UNHCR official. Trapped in their enclave,
its people depend on the whims of Serb commanders who decide whether to
allow the passage of food relief.
When the concept of 'safe areas' was proposed, UN officials feared that
without military muscle, these would fall to their hostile neighbours. Now
they worry that Srebrenica remains cut off from the outside world with no
possibility of a normal life.
A US-led air drop earlier this spring was initially welcomed. But relief
workers say it has become 'nothing but ridiculous'. The most recent air drop
included chlorine for water purification. Srebrenica is afflicted with
chronic shortages of most supplies, but it has enough chlorine to last four
years.

FT  24 MAY 93 / Call for EMS warning system: EC finance ministers back
tighter surveillance to aid realignments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER

   KOLDING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday backed a call by central bank
governors for the creation of an 'early warning system' to avoid a
repetition of last September's crisis in the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The idea is to tighten surveillance of exchange rates and strengthen the
consensus among members in favour of timely realignments. It came at an
informal meeting in Kolding, Denmark, at the weekend which ended with a
ringing endorsement of the European Monetary System.
The UK found no support for its argument that the EMS's exchange rate
mechanism contains 'fault-lines' which were responsible for the forced exit
of sterling and the Italian lira last September.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, said in Kolding it would be 'two, three years,
and possibly even longer' before the UK re-entered the ERM, mainly because
of the distorting effects on interest rates of German unification. A senior
Italian official suggested that the lira would re-enter the ERM after
electoral reform was in place and a new government came to power.
At the meeting, Mr Lamont repeated a call for lower interest rates in Europe
and criticised Germany for its tight monetary policy. 'There are growing
fears about the direction of policy in Europe. We are heading for a
recession,' he said.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, agreed interest rates were
'unnecessarily high'. But he appeared satisfied after EC finance ministers
gave him a mandate for putting the growth and employment debate at the top
of the EC summit in Copenhagen next month.
Two reports on the EMS - one by the committee of central bank governors and
one by the EC's monetary committee, which comprises central bankers and
senior national treasury officials - both concluded that the system was
fundamentally sound.
They seek to reaffirm collective discipline, noting that in last year's
crisis individual member states failed to take the initiative to defend
their currencies or take part in a realignment. The reports blame the crisis
on significant economic divergence between members, a development
exacerbated by the shock of German unification which led to an 'unbalanced
mix' between German monetary and fiscal policy.
However, they make clear that member states failed to heed fundamental
economic indicators and take the initiative in realigning their currencies.
A central recommendation, therefore, is to create new, confidential
procedures to make a persuasive case that a central rate is out of line.
The central bank governors offered to play a role in this surveillance
exercise, but the EC monetary committee also put itself forward. It
suggested creating a set of confidential economic indicators which member

FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: New equity products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARANTEED equity products which offer stock market growth or your money
back - continue to pour onto the market.
Birmingham Midshires Building Society is offering an account which rises by
75 per cent of the increase in the FT-SE 100 index over five years (for a
basic rate taxpayer) or by a net 15 per cent, whichever is the higher.
As with many other guaranteed products, investors benefit only from the
capital growth of the Footsie, and not the dividend yield. At 4 per cent a
year for five years, the dividend yield can make a significant difference to
investment returns.
Furthermore, in line with the recent trend, the Footsie figure used for the
calculation is based on the average of the last six months. This protects
the investor from a last minute fall in the index, but means he gets 4.75
years growth and not five.
How good a deal is it? Although Birmingham Midshires, advertises a gross
return of 100 per cent of the FT-SE, other companies have offered 100 per
cent net.
Investors are thus giving up potential gain for a better minimum guarantee -
a net 15 per cent gain versus the normal money back offer.
There is scope for early access. After 2.5 years, you can get your money
back plus the greater of 56.25 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE or 3.75 per
cent.
Newcastle Building Society's Nova Equity Bond offers a net 120 per cent of
the rise in the Footsie over five years, or your money back. But this rise
is based on the average of the Footsie over the last year of the bond, so in
fact you are getting 4.5 years market growth.
Again, you get no credit for the dividend yield on the market. There is also
no scope for early encashment (except on death).
However, the 120 per cent rate is pretty good and means that the account
will come close to the total return on the market, even allowing for
dividend yield. For basic rate taxpayers, this may make it as good as an
indexed unit trust, with the guarantee thrown in. Higher rate taxpayers,
however, would face an extra tax charge and would probably be better off
with a low charging indexed unit trust, such as Gartmore's.
The minimum investment in Nova Equity Bond is Pounds 2,000.

The US oil giant said it has the right to explore and operate Block 209, a

office in Nigeria.
On Tuesday Nigeria signed an oil exploration and production-sharing contract
with the alliance between BP and Statoil of Norway.
It was the third agreement in a month with a foreign oil group to take all
the risks in developing new fields since shortage of cash forced the

FT  22 MAY 93 / Man in the News: Centurion off-guard - Michael Portillo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo was ambushed this week. It was an unfamiliar experience
for the bright young Centurion of the Tory right. For Mr John Major's
government it was a salutary warning of the political ditches that lie ahead
as it seeks to restore a semblance of order to public finances.
The proximate cause of the discomfort was a leak that the chief secretary's
review of public spending had begun to touch the nerves of the welfare
state.
Free National Health Service prescriptions - available to 80 per cent of the
population - were to be restricted to the poor. The NHS might withdraw from
dental care. Parents could find themselves paying the tuition fees for their
childrens' university education.
Never mind that these are only options - nothing has been ruled out but
nothing has been decided. Nor that other suggestions - new restrictions on
invalidity benefit, cuts in unemployment benefit or 'hotel' charges for
hospital stays - are on the list.
The Tory party at Westminster, never far these days from the edge of panic,
was aghast. Since the enforced tax increases in the March Budget, the
government backbenches have been ringing with calls for the Treasury to
regain a grip on public spending. But after their trouncing in Newbury and
in the council elections, Conservative MPs are in no mood to dish out more
unpleasant medicine to the voters.
Mr Portillo, among the few in the cabinet whose reputation has been
unscathed by recent crises, found himself encircled.
Mr Major was furious. This was to have been the week when the prime minister
celebrated the end of the year-long Commons battle over the Maastricht
treaty. Another fall in the unemployment total and a sharp drop in the
inflation rate were to have provided some all-too-rare icing on the cake.
Instead, as his chief secretary toured the television studios parrying
questions about the future of the welfare state, Mr Major was forced yet
again on to the defensive.
The winners were the Whitehall spending departments, determined that a
return to fiscal virtue should leave their empires untouched. Few doubted
that the leak had emanated from Mrs Virginia Bottomley's health department.
It was not the way Mr Portillo had planned it. He had been drafting a speech
designed to explain to his party, the nation, and, above all, to his cabinet
colleagues, the scale of the problems. It was to be a careful step in
preparing a receptive climate for tough decisions in the November Budget.
The 'scare stories' derailed it.
His speech nonetheless was an elegant exposition of the economic and
political case for a return to sound finance. Not yet quite 40 - he intends
to celebrate that birthday next week in a London nightclub - Mr Portillo has
the advantage of believing in the need to curb the role of the state.
The cabinet standard bearer of the Thatcherite right, he has long been
tipped as the man most likely to restore the ideological purity of the 1980s
when the party leadership falls eventually to his generation. But his demand
for a re-evaluation of the welfare state - and his challenge to the
principle of universal benefits - is grounded in harsh financial realities
as well as ideology.
The figures speak for themselves. Britain's public borrowing, running at
Pounds 1bn a week or 8 per cent of national income, is unsustainable. The
cost of servicing the debt will almost double to Pounds 30bn a year by 1997.
The core budget deficit - excluding debt interest - is worse than Italy's.
Much of it can be blamed on the fall in tax revenues and rise in welfare
benefits inevitable in a recession. But in the chief secretary's view, the
government - he would never say Mr Major - has got into the habit of
throwing money at problems.
Mr Portillo has two parallel strategies to restore the position.
The first is a new system for the annual spending negotiations. The cabinet
has committed itself for the first time to targets for non-cyclical spending
(budgets largely unaffected by the ups and downs of the economic cycle)
which will mean small cuts in each of the next two years once account has
been taken of inflation. The Pounds 253.6bn and Pounds 263.6bn cash ceilings
for 1994-95 and 1995-96 have been declared sacrosanct.
Alongside the annual negotiations Mr Portillo has instituted his long-term
review - focusing initially on the Pounds 80bn social security, the Pounds
34bn health, the Pounds 32bn education and the Pounds 14bn law and order
budgets.
It is this second strand which is throwing up the radical options. The
original idea was that the conclusions of the review would inform
decision-making next year and beyond. But, with many of his colleagues
already ignoring Treasury strictures against bidding for extra cash, Mr
Portillo must realise that if the sums are to add up this summer, the
cabinet must take some tough decisions now.
The man who as local government minister introduced the poll tax for Mrs
Margaret Thatcher and abolished it for Mr John Major has underlined his
politically shrewdness in the way he structured the reviews. He has cast
himself as the agent in a collective decision-making process. If harsh
decisions are taken, the opprobrium will be distributed equitably. He hopes
also that this week's scare stories will dull the reaction to the next,
inevitable, batch of leaks.
But Mr Portillo's problem runs deeper. The government and the Conservative
party have been drained of will. The targeting of benefits and the extension
of charges in health and education would hit two groups of core supporters:
the middle-aged middle classes and the elderly. An issue like prescription
charges might cost the government the forthcoming by-election in once-solid
Christchurch. The constituency is packed with pensioners.
Mr Portillo was characteristically sanguine about the political fall-out.
But he must not forget the fate of the last rising star of the Tory right
determined to take an axe to the welfare state. Who else remembers Mr John
Moore?

FT  22 MAY 93 / Ukrainian N-plant fire kills workman
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRE at a nuclear power station in Ukraine yesterday killed one workman and
seriously injured another. The blaze was started when sparks from a welder's
torch ignited hydrogen leaking from a pipe in one of the six reactors at the
Zaporizhia plant, Ukraine's largest atomic station.
Officials said no radiation was released by the accident, which was in a
machine room, not the reactor core, Nevertheless, it is likely to raise
further questions over nuclear safety in the countries of the former Soviet
Union.
The plant is about 50km from the city of Zaporizhia, where nearly 1m people
live, and about 550km from Ukraine's capital, Kiev.
The power station has a VVR water-cooled reactor, considered by experts to
be safer than graphite-cooled RBMK reactors. Design flaws in RBMK-style
reactors have been blamed for the accident at the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine
in 1986, which claimed up to 8,000 lives, according to Ukrainian estimates.
Safety has been a serious concern at Ukraine's five nuclear power plants
since the Chernobyl accident. Public opinion in Ukraine is bitterly hostile
to nuclear power and morale in the industry is low.
The Chernobyl plant is to be closed by the end of the year by order of
parliament. But government ministers have asked parliament to consider
lifting a freeze on construction of at least three nearly completed
reactors. Some officials have suggested Chernobyl should remain open to meet
power needs.
Mr Oleksandr Kaliukaev, a duty officer at the Zaporizhia plant, said one
workman died immediately in the blaze and a second suffered serious
injuries. The fire, which lasted 3 1/2 hours, was preceded by an explosion
in the fifth block of the power station.
He said the reactor was under repair at the time of the accident and was not
connected to the electricity grid. News of the accident was broadcast on
local radio and television in the city.
The official said the plant director had given an assurance there was no
danger to people living in the immediate vicinity or in the city of
Zaporizhia.

aim to derive 10 per cent of its profits from the US.
The deal through Citizens Financial Group, its US subsidiary, involved the
purchase of NESB assets worth almost Pounds 500m from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and the assumption of about Pounds 456m of the bank's
deposits, the Royal Bank said.
All 21 NESB branches will re-open today under the name of Citizens Bank.
In a separate deal, Citizens has signed a back-to-back agreement with Lehman

FT  22 MAY 93 / Minister to head trade visit in Far East this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Needham, the trade minister, is to lead a delegation of 25
business executives on a five-day export promotion mission to the far east
at the end of the month.
This was announced by Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister,
in the Commons yesterday when pledging full government backing for the
efforts of British companies to maximise their share of the world's
fastest-growing market.
He said South Korea was among the 17 countries to which ministers would be
leading trade missions in the next 12 months.
Mr Leigh said British exports to China had doubled in the first two months
of this year, and Mr Needham, who had been there three times in the last
year, was planning an early return visit.
Mr Leigh said Britain's share of world trade had stabilised in volume terms
after three decades of decline.
In the first quarter of this year visible exports to non-EC markets were up
12 per cent on the corresponding period in last year.
Giving further details of the reorganisation of the department's export
services, Mr Leigh said 30 of the 100 'export promoters' to be seconded by
private industry were already in place.
This 'infusion of new blood' from the private sector would be of great value
to the department in implementing the recent decision to establish two
export promotion divisions.
Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour spokesman in the debate, suggested that the
improved export performance of the last few months was largely attributable
to the devaluation of sterling after its exit from the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Condemning the government's mismanagement of the economy, which had resulted
in a Pounds 17bn trade deficit, he warned of the danger of higher interest
rates, an overvalued currency and further periods of 'economic gloom and
doom'.

<TEXT>
MARATHON Angolan peace talks have collapsed after the government and Unita
rebels failed to agree on a draft peace package, raising fears that the
civil war may intensify, Reuter reports from Abidjan.
A final session of the six-week-old talks in Ivory Coast broke up without
success last night and participants said negotiations were suspended
indefinitely.
'I'm afraid the war is going to go on and probably to intensify,' Ms
Margaret Anstee, the United Nations special envoy to Angola, said in the
Ivorian capital Abidjan. 'That means we have to intensify our efforts to try
to get the two sides together again.' There was no indication if talks
between Unita and the MPLA government would restart.
Ms Anstee said the main stumbling-block was a military clause in the draft
peace agreement saying Unita fighters would withdraw from areas they have
occupied since late last year. The MPLA said it was ready to sign the peace
package, drawn up by observers from Portugal, Russia and the US. Unita
refused.
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday announced US recognition of the
formerly-Marxist MPLA, effectively ending 18 years of support for Unita.
In Angola, fighting continued. The government said yesterday 40 civilians
were killed and 51 wounded during a Unita raid on the besieged eastern city
of Luena.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Clinton has reservations on UN safe havens in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton expressed deep reservations yesterday about the
latest Russian proposals to establish 'safe havens' in Bosnia protected by a
multinational peacekeeping force including US troops.
Speaking after a White House meeting with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister, the president said the US was 'sceptical that we'll be
able to resolve this satisfactorily within the framework that has been
proposed.
'I don't want to see the US get in a position where we're re-creating
Northern Ireland, Lebanon or Cyprus or anything else,' he said. He conceded
'some potential down the road' for a peacekeeping operation, but added: 'We
don't want our people in there basically in a shooting gallery.'
Mr Clinton's remarks appear to cast doubt on next week's planned UN Security
Council deliberations on Bosnia, likely to discuss three new motions: the
establishment of safe havens, the setting up of a war crimes tribunal and
the stationing of monitors on the Bosnia-Serbia border.
The rump Yugoslavia yesterday refused to accept the deployment of about 500
inspectors to enforce a blockade on its borders with Bosnia. The rejection
was sure to complicate even further efforts to forge a common strategy. Mr
Clinton's negative comments stood in sharp contrast to those of Mr Kozyrev,
who insisted after the White House session and two rounds of talks on
Thursday with Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, that the US and
Russia were 'very, very close' to an agreement that could be presented to
western European countries.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, arrived in Washington for talks
with Mr Christopher yesterday. He was expected to take exception to Mr
Clinton's comparisons of Bosnia with Northern Ireland. Mr Alain Juppe, the
French foreign minister, is due here for consultations this weekend.
Mr Clinton was not entirely dismissive of the prospects of an international
agreement. Stressing that the US goals were to contain the fighting and stop
the killing, he said that 'ultimately there will have to be some reasonable
borders and some political solutions which have a reasonable territorial
component'. In such circumstances, he implied, US ground forces could be
deployed in a peacekeeping capacity.
The White House had said on Thursday that its main problem with 'safe
havens' was that they appeared to reward the territorial gains achieved by
the Serbian policies of 'ethnic cleansing,' also practised by Croatia
against Moslems in Bosnia.
However, the New York Times yesterday quoted senior officials as saying that
Mr Christopher had come round to the view that it was impossible to roll
back all Serb gains and was prepared to accept the safe haven notion if it
was 'a temporary measure and not the endorsement of any concept of
partition'.

<TEXT>
BACK IN January Kenneth Ladd, a non-executive director of St Ives, the
printing company, sold 198,000 shares at 318p, since when the share price
has underperformed the market.
This week Robert Gavron, the chairman, sold 2,013,262 shares and another
1,500,000 non-beneficially, all at 317p, reducing his beneficial holding to
7,218,960 shares.
On May 6, the Bank of Scotland announced slightly lower than expected
profits for 1992 and an increase in bad debt provisions. Last week Angus
Pelham Burn, a non-executive director, sold 42,000 shares at 130p to reduce
his holding to 166,226. This sale follows purchases made by two of the banks
directors last year at prices between 110 and 119p. In recent months, the
company has seen its premium rating eroded.
Four directors of Photo-Me International, the manufacturer of coin operated
photo booths, exercised options over a total of 145,000 shares.
Two of the directors then sold all their new shares; the other two kept
about a third to a half of theirs.

FT  22 MAY 93 / View from peaks of progress: What a photograph of Everest
tells us about our values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REVOLTING and revealing photograph was published in the May edition of
High Mountain Sports, the official magazine of the British Mountaineering
Council.
It was taken by the French photographer, Pierre Royer, and shows the scene
at 26,000 feet on the South Col of Everest. It is a scene of filth,
devastation and pollution. The refuse of countless expeditions is scattered
almost as far as the lens can see. We are told that the litter on the
plateau just below the summit weighs about 20 tons, and that yet another
expedition will have to be organised to remove the mess.
Among the detritus are between five and nine corpses - no one seems to know
how many. Some have been left open to the elements, others hidden under
stones.
The picture was published some weeks before the near national hysteria in
Britain over the climb to the summit of Everest by Rebecca Stephens, the
first Englishwoman to succeed in the attempt. It is of course, a great
achievement: the corpses on the South Col are grim testament to the hazards.
But I wonder what Stephens thought when she surveyed the mess, which looks
like nothing so much as Piccadilly Circus during the dustbin men's strike of
1979.
She probably did not have much time to think. There are so many people
climbing Everest that any one who hesitates loses his, or her, place in the
queue to the summit.
I suppose it will be claimed as a wonderful thing that what was once a
virtual impossibility is now almost routine. At about the same time as Sir
Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay made the first full ascent of Everest, Sir
Roger Bannister became the first person to break the four minute mile. That
has become even more of a commonplace than climbing the world's highest
mountain. Athletic records fall almost daily, and each fresh edition of The
Guinness Book of Records charts the unfailing progress of man towards some
ultimate and as yet unquantifiable ideal of fitness and fastness.
Does this mean that we are evolving into some race of supermen and women? I
suppose that physically and medically, that might happen. And indeed much of
the health journalism which has spread from the US seems predicated on the
notion that we all not only could, but should, become physically perfect.
The only drawback to this ideal, the inevitability of death and decay, is
never mentioned.
This form of secular body worship, the notion that we can become physically
perfect, is probably harmless enough, and less morally hazardous than most
emanations of the displaced religious impulse. The danger lies in the
illusion that if we are continuously advancing physically, we must also be
evolving mentally and creatively. This belief lies behind much that is
meretricious in art and literature.
Artists who come up with something new are lionised, awarded the Turner
Prize and appear on late night television. The fact that the new idea might
be a pile of bricks, or a crucifix in a tub of urine, just to take two
recent examples of acclaimed new art, seems to cause no concern among
believers in the progressive ideal.
Somehow the thought that what is new might be regressive, a defeat for
mankind, does not occur. The intellectual sphere of human attainment becomes
as value-free as a one-mile race, or a climb up a mountain. Perhaps if the
athletic records were to dry up, if the life expectancy of the western male
were to cease its unremitting rise, there might be a greater willingness to
acknowledge that artistic and literary standards could be declining, and
that we have more to learn from the scarcely digested old than the
indigestible new.
The photograph of the human refuse and remains on Everest is as good an
illustration as any of the descent of man, even as he/she climbs the peaks:
it is hard to imagine the mountaineers of 40 years ago leaving bodies
unmarked and unburied, for someone else to clear up, if not honour. Lord
Hunt, the leader of the 1953 ascent of Everest has described the conduct of
his successors as 'unthinkable . . . inexcusable'. But I doubt that Lord
Hunt's words and Royer's photograph will influence the public as much as the
smiles and exhilaration of Stephens. Mankind can stand only so much reality.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Private View: Mutations of an artist in the lab - William
Latham on the aesthetics of his computer-generated 'virtual sculptures'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUT IS IT Art? William Latham says it is, though he does it at the console
of a computer in an underground laboratory at an IBM research station in
southern England.
He sits in the half-darkness breeding 'virtual sculptures' out of mutant
forms borrowed from nature - horns, shells, slugs and eggs - and sets them
afloat in computer space like visitations from a nightmare. Not only are
they art, says Latham, they are a statement of the artist's function in a
technical world.
'My work links into the Renaissance and Durer's concern with geometric
primitives. It has connections with Leonardo and his sketchbooks.' His other
influences are Surrealism, 'systems art' and the Russian Constructivists,
Pop Art and SF films such as Aliens.
'I am exploiting technology and commenting on it at the same time,' he
explained. 'Normally an artist stands on the edge of society as a spectator
making comments. The artist on canvas is on the outside, whereas I have
become a cog in the science machine.
'Maybe it's the 20th century's view of artists that is wrong. They are
peripheralised, expected to behave like savages, when really they are often
highly perceptive and can make a much wider contribution. It's wrong that
they should be limited to commercial galleries and museums. Visual
communication is very powerful and it is a skill that many people don't
have. There's not enough art at school. I think that's criminal.'
William Latham is genuinely an artist; he started painting at 13, won a
scholarship to Stowe School, a First in fine art at Christ Church, Oxford,
and a Henry Moore scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London. From
simple geometrical shapes he began to construct, on paper, a vast family
tree of forms. He applied to IBM for help and was taken on six years ago as
a research fellow - a sort of artist in residence.
IBM was practising community outreach. But its investment in Latham has
proved commercially valuable. For his evolutionary project led to the
creation of 'Mutator', a sophisticated computer program which, because it it
permits the use of intuitive judgment, could revolutionise not only graphic
design but financial and economic modelling, automobile design, motorway
planning, medical image processing and criminal identification.
'Mutator' could not have been created, however, without Latham's colleague,
Stephen Todd, a pure mathematician (also with a First from Christ Church)
and full-time IBM employee.
The invention of Mutator raised unusual questions of copyright: and since
Latham sells his art works (large photographs of his cyber-creatures)
through his own company, he was obliged to take legal advice.
'To work with big corporations you have to be very hard-nosed sometimes and
diplomatic at other times, especially if you're using millions of pounds of
their computer time to do what you like,' he said.
Don't you find the environment alien?
'I have accustomed myself to it. Because I'm not an employee I'm treated a
bit like a guest. I quite like the environment actually. I've always found
it difficult working in a studio by myself. I find it better when stuff is
happening around me: you feel you are part of the nervous system of
technology.'
But that subterranean air-conditioned office . . . I wonder your artistic
sensibility doesn't revolt.
'In some ways it has its own aesthetic, the lab world. I find it very
necessary to get away from all this and shut it out of my mind. That's why I
live in London.' Latham's wife Belinda Channer is an artist too and they
have a six-month-old baby, Daisy.
Did you have conventional prejudices about scientists?
'No, largely because my father was an industrial chemist. It's odd why I
didn't become a scientist. I do think very subjectively, but analytically as
well. I switch very quickly from one to the other - working with computers
forces one to.'
Latham made a distinction between the creative scientists like his colleague
Stephen Todd and the programers who live a narrower, systems-dependent
existence.
I asked him about the mind-numbing jargon of the computer industry.
'It's a bit like Latin in the Middle Ages. If you spoke it you communicated
with people across the world, but if not you were hostile. It hasn't helped
by making people quite fearful of technology. But jargon is necessary as a
short-hand.'
William Latham describes the computer screen as a window into his own
imagination and his 'sculptures' as snapshots through the window. The
mutations are generated randomly but according to parameters set by the
artist, and he intervenes to select them on aesthetic grounds. His animated
films demonstrate the evolutionary process.
Are these creatures as real to you as the real world?
'About the same. I sometimes feel sorry about killing a mutation. You become
attached to them in a funny sort of way, a bit like a pet. They float around
and the babies cluster round the parent like bees around a honeypot. Should
I really kill these little things clustering around their parent? Is it
morally incorrect to kill these forms if they are behaving autonomously?'
Having instruction keys on the computer which read 'marry', 'breed',
'gene-splice', 'kill' makes it worse, he said. 'The morality of computer
space . . . ' he laughed.
But is it Art?
Latham sells about six of his big Cibachrome prints a year (they go for
Pounds 2,000 upwards) through a London gallery; and has exhibited in Europe,
the US, Japan and Australia. 'Why shouldn't art be sold in the same way as a
symphony on a CD? What I don't like is the elitism, the mafia, snobbishness,
art being only for the rich.'
Aren't they just computer graphics?
'There is this argument. If I'm like a gardener making flowers for a show or
a dog-breeder breeding for Cruft's, it doesn't necessarily make me an
artist. If you find a beautiful shell on a beach shouldn't that be called
art as well?
'The difference is I am both the gardener and the creator. It's my system,
crafted with Stephen to match exactly my ideas. I can go behind the scenes
and change the evolutionary rules then come out again as the gardener and
breed more forms. I agree that if I was just the gardener someone else could
do it instead.
'Another interesting question is whether the role of the artist is to create
the system that other people use to make their own art - so art becomes a
collective experience.
'Yes, I would describe what I do as art. But maybe the purpose of my work is
to question. I think all good art questions the definition of what art is.
Does the meaning of art change with evolution and computers? Or is there
another term? I don't really try and answer those questions.'
But where is the personal stamp?
'The personal stamp is that I define the evolutionary system and the rules
of growth, then Stephen hard-codes that.'
The objects are very impersonal.
'Like nature. Like that plant.' He pointed to a pot plant. 'It is austere. I
want things to be austere so someone looking at them wouldn't realise there
was any human involvement at all. I want it to be very cold and very
uncompromising, to get this quality of natural forms . . . Nature is
hostile. I like photos of giant bed-bugs, blown up.'
You mean you have a taste for the weird?
'Yeah', he laughed. 'I think so.'
Is this a psychological problem? I asked, half-seriously.
'I think I'm quite a normal sort of guy.' He laughed again. 'But I do like
things that are just at the edge of one's frame of reference.'
So working on a machine doesn't limit your imagination?
'Not really, so long as I keep producing weird forms.' The machine enables
him to be more productive, he said. 'It's quite cathartic, in some ways like
Picasso's late work when he was just churning this stuff out . . . getting
ideas out of one's imagination. All artists have these drives.'
And does your work carry any message?
'You could say it's a comment on the whole area of genetic engineering and
man's tampering with the natural world, a subtle parody of science and
technology. In a thousand years everything may have been genetically
manipulated. So there's a sort of paranoia there about things ceasing to be
natural.'
Geneticists and the military have shown an interest in 'Mutator'. One day,
Latham said, it might be used for purposes with which he did not agree.
Such as a eugenics programme for humans?
'My structures are not representations of natural objects. It would have to
be a lot more complicated, but we've got the basis of research here that
could take it into that area. We ourselves don't'
So you could find yourself in 20 years the unwitting father of some
monstrous project?
'I hope not. But those are the dangers. It comes back to this human
fascination for exploring without knowing where it will lead. It might mean
mutating molecules for some medical cure.
'But the point is that the artist is no longer on the periphery.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / As they say in Europe: The ordinary and the evil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEROISM and evil provide an essential journalistic staple. The past week
offered the case of four women and one man who reflected the naturally
excitable, even hysterical, approach of the British and the phlegm of the
French.
Let us start with one of those peculiar records. The Daily Express wrote:
'Rebecca Stephens battled on to become the first British woman to conquer
Everest. No one is better able to sum up her achievement than Lord Hunt,
leader of the first expedition to conquer Everest exactly 40 years ago. 'It
is a tremendous achievement, particularly as she has had relatively so
little experience.'' This combination of braggadocio and bathos is typically
British and its disappearance would constitute a serious folkloric loss, but
it inevitably devalues real achievement.
The other woman who loomed large in the British press was a hospital nurse,
Beverley Allitt, who was found guilty of the murder of a number of children
in her care. It was a horrifying case and the tabloid press played on the
lynch mob mood. 'Let us kill Allitt,' was the headline in the Sun, quoting
the bereaved parents and dropping the inverted commas.
A few days earlier the French had watched with bated breath as a gunman, one
Eric Schmitt, demanded FFr100m (Pounds 12m) in exchange for six children he
held in a nursery school outside Paris. He was killed by the police but the
children were saved, physically and psychologically, largely thanks to the
fortitude and skill of their teacher, Laurence Dreyfus, assisted by a
25-year-old paediatrician, Evelyne Lambert.
The two women received the accolades of an admiring press, but in the
extensive comment there was no reference to 'the courage of French
womanhood,' no bluster, no triumphalism. A rich stream of cliches flowed,
but followed a course unknown in Britain. Presse-Ocean wrote of Schmitt:
'Unemployed and divorced. Even if he incarnated the two great evils of our
society, Eric Schmitt, the so-called human bomb, deserved no pity.'
It was the drama of the human condition that drew the most attention. As
France-Soir put it: '. . . the mystery is that of the quiet man who becomes
paranoid, of a destiny which crashes and wavers between tragedy and strip
cartoon.' For Sud-Ouest the heroines of the affair raised up the rest of
society: 'The courage of these ordinary people is an extraordinary example
which shows that bravery and guts do not belong only to the great and the
strong: it reminds us that we are not all bastards or rotten, or egotists
and cynics, and that it is not necessary even in this grey period of
pessimism, to despair of man.'
This theme was surprisingly widespread. From central France I read: 'The
rescue of the hostages from their nursery school revealed the marvellous
devotion of the anonymous servants of the state and the comforting
solidarity of citizens for once torn from their selfishness.'
The difference between the popular press in Britain and in France is clear.
The former believes that ordinary people are wonderful, and indeed
constantly tells its readers how particularly wonderful they are. For these
papers, everybody who was ever once involved in any hostilities on the
British side is a 'hero' and those who act to prevent their goods being
stolen are always 'plucky.' When anyone behaves really badly, therefore,
tabloid indignation knows no bounds. Evil is abnormal and punishment has to
take the most extreme forms.
In France there is some surprise when people behave well. Eric Schmitt was
portrayed as 'normal,' as a not unexpected phenomenon in a society which
bears many scars in a world burdened with original sin. So rare, in fact, is
the demonstration of virtue that it has to be rewarded immediately. Thus the
two women who protected the children from Schmitt were made members of the
Legion d'honneur on the very day their charges were saved.
Honest John Bull would have ensured civil servants spent 18 months looking
into the matter, seeing if either candidate had ever parked on a double
yellow line and then given each a 'British Empire Medal' because that would
not exceed the honour bestowed on the chairman of the school governors who
was already a 'Member of the British Empire.' The chairman of the company
which supplied the portion-controlled frozen food during the siege, having
made the appropriate donations, would have exchanged the appellation of
Julian Featheringnest for that of Lord Linepocket.
This is a system with which the prime minister, John Major, has promised to
tinker. What cannot be fixed is an incurable Anglo-Saxon optimism about
human nature that makes even the banal evils generated by sick minds the
subject of endless shocked exposition and indignation.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: On the trash heap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WAS not a happy chimpanzee this week. I was Mr Sad of Sad City sad beyond
endurance that Norway and Japan are up to their tricks again with their
barbarous keenness to restart commercial whaling. I thought we had finished
with whaling. I thought we had agreed that the time was long gone when we
should be firing explosives into the backs and flanks of our greatest
mammals so that Norway and Japan could continue to eat whalemeat and light
their street lamps with blubber-oil to perpetuate an aboriginal lifestyle.
The madness of humans is not something that shocks me. The thing that shocks
me is our naked stupidity. If you count them up, there are about 40m ways in
which we are trashing our planet and the lifeforms we share it with. Yet the
moment we seem to be making progress we slam into reverse and grab our
harpoons.
I laugh at people who believe that humans are special or superior - citing,
usually, nothing more impressive than the Sistine Chapel or our
moon-landings or religions as evidence of this superiority. They are wrong.
In the history of human evolution, the Sistine Chapel will be seen as a
daub, the moon-landings as child's-play and our religions . . . don't tempt
me.
In the meantime, we keep trashing the planet. Apart from the whales, the
reason I was Mr Sad of Sad City this week was because I was reminded how
swiftly and thoroughly we set about this trashing when we really try. The
reminder came in an article in Earthwatch magazine by Fred Hill, a writer
based in Idaho, in which he describes how a high-desert valley in
south-eastern Arizona, where he grew up, was trashed by modern farming
methods.
The valley was opened to white settlement in the 1930s by the Army and
rancher-pioneers, who drove the native Americans back into the hills and
eventually onto reservations. The valley wasn't particularly desirable land.
But his family and their neighbours were good at what they did.
'My stepfather could read the crops; he knew the precise amount of
fertiliser and water they needed and when they would be ripe for harvest. He
could read the weather and know to the hour when the rains would hit. He
knew exactly when to cut the hay so that it could be raked and baled and put
up without being rained on . . . He knew when to pick the cotton so that it
was fully developed but not so mature that it would fall from its boll and
be lost on the ground. He loved the land and crops and cattle, and treated
them all with the deference that was their due.'
It wasn't enough. As time went on, farmers had to learn new ways. They had
to become mechanics. To be good businessmen and keep full records. To
understand markets. Understand investment terms. Manipulate tax positions.
Develop strategic plans. Experiment with new crops. Almost overnight they
had to become experts in lubricants, fuels, pesticides, herbicides and soil
analysis.
Few could learn the new ways fast enough. And of course the water ran out.
The water in the aquifers was 10,000 years old, so even had there been rain
it could not have been replenished.
'We were ignorant of the harm we were doing and ignorant of different
choices that we could have made,' writes Hill. 'We were also greedy, some of
us . . . Radio and especially television made us yearn for that radiant easy
life, but did not show us the value of what we scorned and were leaving
behind.
'We put too many cattle on the native grass, even during dry years. We
overgrazed . . . and destroyed the water that we needed. We stripped the
land of every scrap of sellable product . . . We poured on the fertilisers
and herbicides and fungicides and pesticides in ever-increasing volume and
variety, and beat the living soil into lifeless clay. We ploughed and disked
and baled and levelled, pounding the soil into a hardpan impervious to
water. The alkali salts leached to the top and poisoned the crops.'
Sometimes intentionally, sometimes not, they killed coyotes, badgers,
snakes, turtles, rabbits, ants - every living creature that they deemed
superfluous to their own narrow interests.
They were driven off the land. In time, says Hill, all that will be left of
the fierce battles of three generations will be memories lying restlessly in
the minds of their children.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Offspring of Thatcherism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE day after Mrs Thatcher announced her resignation from office as Prime
Minister, I was teaching history to a group of 18-year-olds; and I asked
them to discuss what the Thatcher years had meant to them. They all carried
on about the iniquities of the poll tax, were otherwise more or less 50/50
for and against her achievements, and all remarked that they had no memories
(and little knowledge) of politics before Thatcherism.
In this new work, Trevor Griffiths charts the lives of seven children who
are several years older - aged 15 when Thatcher became Prime Minister - from
1979 to 1993 (plus a prologue in 1973 and an epilogue in 1999). Thatcher's
Children is often entertaining, and for anyone in the audience aged 30 or
more it provides the incidental fun of connecting the events onstage with
those of our own lives. (I too received a Kissogram in 1983.)
But this project - one offspring of the Arts Council's 'Be Bold' scheme,
which has been lending a new spurt to several regional theatres  - is
fraught with problems. Are these really Thatcher's children? On the brink of
leaving school in 1979, their minds have surely been formed chiefly by years
of Labour governments. And how to handle seven separate lives over thirty
years? Griffiths's text is full of short episodes that should connect more
seamlessly than they do in Andrew Hay's clunky, messy staging, which makes a
long evening longer with jerky scene-breaks, semi-audible audiotape,
uninteresting lighting.
Each of Griffiths's characters is complex, 3-D, surprising (and well acted).
These 'Yorkshire' children are an engagingly motley group: Afro-Caribbean,
Pakistani, Welsh, Jewish, et al. Hester grows up to be a black lesbian
power-dressing Thatcher-supporter; Daisy becomes a left-wing journalist;
Sandra is beaten by her father and, later, her husband; Mona takes to
prostitution; 'Girly' becomes a pusher; Wayne becomes a cop (but goes to
jail for killing his baby); Tom keeps trying to shake off his conformist
middle-class roots. Hard, however, to believe that they could all have been
pals even at school; and impossible that they should all keep in touch 10 or
more years later.
Unreal though the set-up is, it proceeds with the air of a documentary - a
series of short clips taken from separate lives, adding up to a complex
picture. Yet not complex enough for its subject; though Griffiths makes
Hester (the black lesbian) interesting to us, her Thatcherism is the least
interesting, and the least 'felt', thing about her. The intense conviction
to which Mrs Thatcher inspired her supporters is absent. The evils of
Thatcher's Britain, however, are very present: race riots, drugs, Clause 28,
child abuse, police brutality, the me-me-me mentality. Yes, quite a litany -
and it omits the poll tax] - but highly partial.
At its most obvious, Thatcher's Children is just a crude socialist
documentary - is virtually Agitprop. But its many strands include some
poetry, much comedy, and memorable imagery. You remember afterwards the
plaits of hair that the Pakistani boy cuts off in an effort to conform; the
black prostitute who, while masturbating a customer, remarks 'Where I come
from, it's all hands to t'pump'; the girl who remembers her Jewish
grandmother's advice that 'Truth swims, but lies float'; and more.
Nonetheless, it only flickers fitfully into life. Though you admire its
ambition, you cannot miss the fact that it has bitten off more than it can
chew.
At the Bristol, Old Vic, until June 12

FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: A Noble Lear - The latest production at Stratford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADRIAN Noble has emerged at the best Shakespeare director of our time. His
King Lear at Stratford is every bit as good as the Hamlet that he introduced
at the Barbican last year. It is an even greater achievement because Lear is
a more difficult play. We should also remember his recent productions of
Henry IV and The Winter's Tale.
Noble works by seeing a Shakespeare play as a whole. He stands back and
looks at the entire environment. No character is too small not to be
developed, though without gimmicks; few lines are as irrelevant or obscure
enough to be cut. His Hamlet was as much a play about the court and society
as about Hamlet the man. Even in Lear we notice that there are long periods
when the king is off-stage. The action does not slow, nor the interest wane,
as a result.
The difficulty with King Lear is the absence of sympathy with the main
protagonists. It is not naturally a warm play. Noble has overcome that by
giving the title role to Robert Stephens, an actor whom he had already
brought back into the mainstream as Falstaff in Henry IV.
The gamble, if such it was, has paid off in gold. Stephens starts well and
gets steadily better as he goes on, like a man who knows how to conserve his
energy to the end, though not without electric flashes in between. At the
beginning he is in a long, smart, scarlet cloak, the colour worn by his
retainers. He is just as impressive in pyjamas and dressing gown in a
hospital bed in Act V. For this is a Lear who fears he is going mad, knows
he is going mad, does go mad and comes out serene. The transitions are most
marvellously paced.
Stephens has a distinctive voice with the ever-so-slight suspicion of a
lisp. He also has a beautiful smile, which he uses sometimes for the
audience, sometimes for the cast as though suggesting he can see through it
all. His presence is huge. At times, when peering at the audience, he makes
the Stratford stage seem small. The voice is used sparingly: often he seems
to be barely whispering, yet there is no chance of failing to hear him.
Lear's lines can seldom have been better spoken. Above all, he turns the
king into a sympathetic figure whom people can love, as Cordelia does.
Here is another Noble masterstroke. It is plain from the first scene when
Cordelia declines to go along with her father's division of the kingdom that
she is already regarded as a powerful personality at the court, way above
her sisters. The bond between Lear and Abigail McKern's Cordelia is thus
established at once. That is what holds the drama together.
Meanwhile there is the Fool, played with exquisite sensitivity by Ian
Hughes. Lear's affection for him is deep and vice-versa, though in the
latter case it is tinged with fear and foreboding. Again the symmetry of the
play emerges. The Fool is there when Cordelia is not.
Yet another mark of Noble's direction is the way he handles Simon Russell
Beale as Edgar. Normally Beale is a mannered actor whom some praise highly
while others demur. Here he is disciplined and without affectation, part of
the play, not the act itself. In short, he is absolutely right. Noble had
the same salutary effect on Kenneth Branagh in Hamlet.
One could scatter praise all round. Goneril and Regan, Janet Dale and Jenny
Quayle, would not expect much of it since Noble makes no excuses for their
behaviour. Nevertheless, they play the bitches that they are with great
competence. It is not their fault that this production is on the side of the
angels.
Look at David Calder's decent, loyal Kent, and the plain, blunt David
Bradely as Gloucester. They are both gems. Indeed the only character Noble
has trouble with is Albany, but the reason, I suspect, is that he is the
least satisfactory figure in the play: never properly developed.
The set, designed by Anthony Ward, is cosmic, as it should be: a largely
abstract backdrop with changing colours and images, and a huge suspended
globe, sometimes the moon, sometimes the earth looking as if Lear were
bearing it on his shoulders. To keep a sense of perspective, across the
floor is a map of Britain, subsequently torn up. Of course, the globe
cracks. No symbolism is missed, and none is overdone. This Lear and Robert
Stephens's Lear are magnificent.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE are theatres that you long to return to, regardless of the plays you
see performed in them. On this, my second visit to the Watermill Theatre
near Newbury, I was moved to find all as I had remembered: the mill-stream
running fast round two sides of the little theatre, dozens of fish plopping
out of the water, birdsong loud and varied. Inside the old group of redbrick
buildings, the pleasant bar and restaurant (pity about the canned music),
and - just before you enter the auditorium - a view of water hurtling past
the millwheel.
Such settings confirm a notion of traditional England. How the Watermill's
directors must be tempted to continue that notion with a nostalgic, cosy,
repertory. The thrill of this play, however, is quite the opposite. Athol
Fugard's My Children] My Africa] - new in 1989, seen at the National Theatre
in 1990 - plunges an audience straight into South Africa. Two different
black generations are in conflict over the pursuit of racial equality. The
teacher, Mr M, believes in the peaceable route of education; Thami, his
brightest student, is involved in more violent protest.
The main thrust of the play is in their dialectic, with frequently strong
results. One snag, however: either man is mainly just a type, there to flesh
out the debate within black South Africa. A play lives in its detail; Fugard
gives us too little detail about these two. And too much rhetoric, with big
Hollywood lines like 'What is wrong with this world that it wants to waste
you all like that? My children] My Africa]' When Mr M. tells Thami briefly
of his loneliness when Thami had deserted him for the new protest movement,
we get a psychological insight that is welcome but rare.
Between these two, however, there is the bright white girl Isabel. She beats
Thami in public debate, she enters into an English-literature contest as his
partner, she quickly learns to love Mr M. Although she too is there to
embody another aspect of the debate, and to represent thousands like her,
Fugard makes her an individual. We know of her reluctance to lose, her
thrill in success, her ambitions to be a journalist, her rapacious eagerness
for life and understanding.
The imbalance between the roles may have been affected by certain small cuts
taken (for the sake of political accuracy) by the director Alby James and
his South African associate Molefe Pheto. This production is, in other
respects, gripping. Burt Caesar and Len Trusty have been perfectly chosen
for Mr M and Thami for vocal and physical reasons. Mairead Carty lights up
Isabel from within straightaway. She knows how Isabel breathes: a little
two-note giggle that punctuates her talk, a little outward puff through the
nostrils that is part of her excitement. Too bad that Fugard ends the play
by giving her one of the play's more corny Bette Davis lines ('The future is
still ours, Mr M'). I prefer to recall her angry tears as she talks of her
mother's repression and ignorance, because they do more to make South Africa
come to life on a Berkshire stage.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: A Romantic through and through - Poetry in Performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENATOR WB Yeats once referred to himself as a '70-year-old smiling public
man' with the easy self-importance of one accustomed to being feted as
Ireland's greatest poet. A man with an equal claim to public eminence is Sir
Stephen Spender CBE, grand old survivor of the 1930s, that 'low dishonest
decade' in Auden's famous phrase, poet, critic and cultural ambassador
extraordinary, who gave a rare reading in London this week as part of the
Poetry Library's 40th birthday celebrations.
The difference between the demeanours of the two men was striking. Yeats was
said to be forever striking poses; Spender, for all his great height (6ft
5in before he began to stoop a little), resembles, in another poet's words,
some 'infinitely gentle, infinitely suffering thing' - shy, vulnerable,
entirely at our mercy.
The tragedy of Spender's life is that, although he has always regarded
himself as a poet in essence, it is not what he has been best at. The
Journals and his autobiography, World within World, are his finest
achievements. It was not therefore at all surprising that, setting aside his
life's work as a published poet, Spender should spend his time reading new
poems, as if to say: My reputation is still to come . . . it was a decision
of gentle defiance.
Poetry is in the service of language, and language is in such a fragmented
state nowadays that poets often seem unsure in what language they ought to
be writing. Stephen Spender's poetry has no such doubts. He has been
consistently faithful to a vocabulary and a rhetorical manner that link him
directly with the Romantic tradition. It is a poetry that cherishes the
uniqueness of the I, and passionately celebrates the realm of the personal
as the first and last bulwark against Chaos.
A number of the poems were versified notes from his diary, including a
striking portrait of his friend, WH Auden. In 1970 Auden had just spent a
semester or two teaching students at Milwaukee, and he shared his
impressions of those students, and of himself teaching the students, with
his old friend. 'He shares his distance from them like a joke', writes
Spender. For him, that would be quite unimaginable.
Paul Durcan, who was reading at the South Bank this week from his new
collection, A Snail in My Prime, usually wears red shirts - suggestive of
seditious opinions - when he performs in public, and rolls up his sleeves to
remind us that the reading of poetry is a real job. And, like any other
task, it is not to be taken too seriously. Durcan is one of Ireland's most
popular poets, a man given to playing the role of the Holy Fool in public, a
light-fingered scourge of the medieval mysteries of Irish catholicism and
much else; a poet whose performances give his work its unique flavour.
The success of a Durcan reading depends upon stillness, silence and a
brooding darkness over the auditorium - suggestive of mock-sanctity. What
the audience registers are the head and the speaking voice. Nothing else
matters. It is the mobile face, a tragi-comedy mask of a face, that contains
all the humour - and all the anguish. The voice, a rich, velvety Co Mayo,
creeps up unawares like a stranger approaching from behind and, from time to
time, inflicts a shockingly savage wound. Every word of every poem matters.
There are three important facial characteristics: the raising of a single
eyebrow, which indicates a sudden fit of childish indignation; a furious
working of the lips; and a flick of the eyes heavenward, which means: God
alone has the key to this mess of potage that we miscall civilised human
life upon earth] But almost best of all is a hopeless lolling of the head to
left or right, which says: 'This is as much as can be said. I am washed
clean of all hope, now and forever more.'

FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Opera house as Art-Object - Max Loppert howls with
frustration over missed opportunities at Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST weekend the doors of the new Lyons opera house opened at last. Bright
splashes of ceremony marked the end of the six long years France's second
city has had to endure without one. There were speeches by the mayor and the
new Culture Minister. There were two new opera productions, both conducted
by the company chief, Kent Nagano: the long-awaited premiere of a Debussy
reconstruction and a High-Concept new version of The Tales of Hoffmann. On
both evenings in the magnificent Hotel de Ville across the square there were
post-performance canapes and champagne for notables, local dignitaries and
the specially-invited French and international press.
And in between there were opportunities to examine from many angles the
realisation of Jean Nouvel's bold design for a state-of-the-art
opera-theatre built up out of the old Lyons opera house. Tres controversee,
the mayor called it. That is, I think, putting it mildly. On the evidence of
these first encounters I shall risk describing the new theatre as at once a
brilliantly-imagined art-object in itself and, in practical terms, a pretty
considerable disaster.
The architect, prevented by on-site limitations of space from enlarging the
old theatre, pursued instead the idea of expanding upwards within its frame.
The original facade and grand foyer have been preserved; the rest was boldly
germinated to provide sharp distinctions of new-versus-old visual contrast.
A great half-tunnel roof crowns the edifice; within it a new theatre (1,300
seats, 500 more than in the old) is supported by an elaborate suspension
system (the technology of the building is a source of great fascination),
and above the auditorium itself there is provision for much-needed
administrative and rehearsal space.
The marriage of past and present, of glass panes, metal girders and
warm-toned classical columns, is distinctive. Viewed from the surrounding
square late at night the whole complex leaves an impression of glamour and
confidence of style and purpose. But a theatre is for rather more than
street-level gazing. It is for audiences and performers, and for effecting
with maximum efficiency and ease the artistic link between them. Nouvel
seems not to have understood these most basic of requirements.
The entrance foyer and main passageways are painted in Stygian shiny black,
as is the theatre auditorium itself. The antechambers are in screaming red,
with lighting to match. A single pair of escalators is all there is to lift
1,300 people from entrance to theatre level (the pre-performance crush on
both opening evenings was simply frightful); and the connecting stairways
are made of bouncing thin perforated metal rather like a lemon zester - just
the thing for filtering footwear dirt and dust onto the heads of people
below.
The sense of rat-in-a-psychologist's-cage unease induced by the blanketing
colours of death and emergency is completed by arrival in one's narrow seat,
with its insufficient leg room and cold metal arm-rests. The reasoning
behind the black-and-red ordinance was that this would force total
concentration on the stage; what it induces instead - in my case at least -
are feelings of claustrophobia and irrational loathing of all architects.
Before the Saturday Hoffmann there were cries from the upper tiers of 'Go
ahead, we can't see anything anyway]', which raised again the already vexed
topic of upper-level sightlines; and a Deep Throat from the chorus told me
of physically nightmarish conditions backstage.
The new theatre has cost under FFrs 480m - peanuts compared with the sums
lavished on the Bastille. It scores over the Paris theatre in one crucial
respect - its well-balanced acoustics. For the rest, and with the Paris
mistakes in mind, one wanted to howl with frustration at the waste all over
again of time, effort and precious resources. When the building's various
ills finally prove intolerable, as they soon must, one can only hope that
action both swift and clear-minded will be taken to heal them.
Given all this, and the various necessary feats of co-ordination required to
put on two operas and a new Coppelia in a brand-new opera house, it was to
Nagano's great credit that musically the two opera productions were of a
standard to make the Lyons visit worthwhile malgre tout. Rodrigue et Chimene
is the Grand Opera, on a flatulently verbose libretto by the playwright
Catulle Mendes distantly related to Corneille's Le Cid, that Debussy began
(in 1888) but never completed. It has been pieced together from various
piano-score sources by the Debussy scholar Richard Langham Smith, with
textual help from Georges Beck; Lyons commissioned the Russian composer
Edison Denisov to score the three substantial acts thus created.
The result is not a complete opera (Langham Smith looks forward to the day
when a putative fourth act materialises) nor even a 'real' opera (pace,
timing and narrative sequence are clumsy). But musically it is two hours of
continuous richness, a pre-Pelleas web woven out of the influences of
Parsifal, Mussorgsky and Massenet, as well as the language of Debussy's own
early songs and Blessed Damozel cantata. It affords a profound new insight
into the composer at a crucial turning-point in his artistic development.
Hearing it as played by the excellent Opera de Lyon orchestra under Nagano's
lucid baton, and sung by a strong cast (Laurence Dale and Donna Brown in the
title roles, Jean-Philippe Courtis and Jules Bastin as their warring
fathers) and the no less strong Lyons chorus, was a pleasure. Seeing it in a
grey-toned, stiff-gaited production by Georges Lavaudant was rather less so
 -this was hardly the spirit-lifting piece of work needed to relieve the
gloom of the theatre.
But totally, horribly faithful to the worst aspects of the architectural
enterprise was the unbroken two-hour version of Hoffmann the following
evening. Comparable with the theatre, this was Opera as Art-Object: cut-down
Offenbach devised by the Lyons dramaturge Michel Vittoz, produced by the
company boss, Louis Erlo, and re-titled . . . Des Contes d'Hoffmann (note
the dots and the 'des').
A more frustrating exercise in 'structuralist' intellectual posturing of the
French persuasion would be hard to imagine. The setting was that weariest of
modern-opera cliches, the mad-house. Olympia was a crippled inmate released
from her wheelchair and callipers during the Doll Song, a gruesome scene.
Drawing high-fashion operatic frisson from presentations of madness and
physical handicap is a base pursuit. A lesser cause of dismay was the waste
of Nagano, the orchestra and a classy cast: the sympathetic young tenor
Daniel Galvez-Vallejo (Hoffmann), Barbara Hendricks (Antonia), Nathalie
Dessay (Olympia), Brigitte Balleys (Nicklaus) and the great Jose van Dam as
nemesis-figure.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Macbeth in a mess - A revival of the ENO production of
Verdi's opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE outgoing administration of English National Opera must be cursing the
fact that money could not be found for their celebratory end-of-term
performance of Verdi's Requiem. Instead, they will be departing to a
'special farewell' performance of the same composer's Macbeth, no doubt with
a cackle of delight at having left so ghastly a production for their
successors. To the usual cast of the opera they add Hecate as an extra
character and she has cast her most grisly spell over this revival. In a
year or two regular patrons at the London Coliseum will no doubt be sharing
memories of the many inspiring nights that Mark Elder (conductor) and David
Pountney (producer) gave them during the years of that team's partnership.
But on Thursday those happy occasions seemed a long way off.
There are various reasons why Verdi chose to turn Macbeth into an opera. One
theme, as in so many of his operas, is the use (or misuse) of power and it
is possible to imagine a production which would bring this element
up-to-date, since Verdi's own feelings on the subject were a response to the
events of his day. Pountney has toyed with that approach, but not
convincingly followed it through.
The whole production is a cauldron full of clever ideas that do not work.
The witches are a haggle of middle-class ladies, together with a few men in
drag, who seem to be living in suburban Glasgow sometime in the 1950s.
Banquo is murdered by a trio of cross-dressing hit-men wielding handbags.
Birnam Wood has become a sort of Scottish Garden of Eden inhabited by rows
of naturist locals who have all left their sporrans at home. What a mess]
Eye of newt would be a delicacy after all the tripe that Pountney has tipped
into this unholy brew.
It might have mattered less if the performance had been as exciting as the
opera usually is. Unfortunately, there was a limited sense of the drama
powering towards its crisis points, which was strange, as Elder himself was
conducting a taut and well-paced account of the score.
The most likely answer is that, if the production is unrelievedly
overworked, the performance will respond by seeming all on a level. For all
their hyperactive emoting, Malcolm Donnelly and Kristine Ciesinski as the
Macbeths never really led the drama. Donnelly has the experience for the
role, but made heavy weather of any passage that called for the singing of a
sustained line. Ciesinski has power and commitment, but not the precision
for the music, and a troublesome wobble is starting to beset the voice. John
Hudson gave notice of a promising new tenor as Macduff; Gwynne Howell was
the reliable Banquo.
When one producer has given his time so abundantly in furnishing his company
with new productions, it is inevitable that his style will become familiar
to the point where it only irritates. After this Macbeth it is time for
somebody else's cliches.
Further performances until June 26

FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Dancing Dracula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHOUT, uncharitably, naming names, I must note that the idea of a horror
ballet suggests to me the work of one or other of those European
choreographers who specialise in anguish and intellectual posturing. How
good to report that the Royal Ballet of Flanders has brought an echt Bram
Stoker-ish chiller to our shores, this week in Northampton. Dracula is the
real thing. It was choreographed by the late Stuart Sebastian in 1990 for
his Dayton Ballet, and entered the Flanders repertory a year later.
It would be easy enough - and difficult enough - to send Dracula
stratospherically up. Sebastian cleverly saw it as a narrative which, while
it might encourage performances of extreme and scenery-chewing bravado, had
dramatic energy and unabashed blood-chilling tensions. So his staging
fillets Bram Stoker's tale, but keeps its curious erotic drive, and brings
off some tingling theatrical coups to set our hackles rising.
I would not make vast claims for Sebastian's choreography - his dances are
unadventurous in classic language - or for his sensitivity as a
story-teller, but this Dracula moves at a cracking pace, and has the
properly uneasy atmosphere. There is effective design, by Chris Phillips, of
skeletal arches and drapery that evoke locations well, with excellent
lighting also by Mr Phillips, and good traditional costuming by Lowell
Mathwich.
For his score Sebastian made a collage of classical gems: we begin with the
Dies irae from the Verdi Requiem, and pass by Verdi's Macbeth, the Rossini
Stabat mater, Rakhmaninov's most famous piano prelude and a mad moment from
a Vierne organ sonata with wolf-howl obbligato. There is also an
intermittent accompaniment of bat squeaks, thunderstorms, a few
ear-splitting screams from recipients of the Count's attentions, quantities
of drifting mist and hellish red light. It is all huge fun in its desire to
give us something horrid. Sebastian makes sound dance ensembles - there is a
charming party scene to Lanner waltzes - and a couple of pas de deux in
which the Count's irresistible charms are well displayed as he plays at
transfusions with Lucy Westenra and Mina.
The piece is danced with tremendous verve by the Flanders company. The
ensemble is strong, classically stylish, and the leading roles, as I saw
them on Thursday evening, are excellently taken. Dracula is played by Chris
Roelandt with entire seriousness and a considerable and demonic allure: we
believe in him. Lucy is beautifully drawn by Lorena Feijoo and Mina is no
less well shown by Ninon Neyt. As the mad, fly-eating Renfield, Eric
Frederic gives a fine display of neurosis and pirouettes, and I was
impressed by Rinat Imaev (a Bulgarian danseur) who played and danced
Jonathan Harker with real finesse. The entire cast give the piece a nice
edge of hysteria to keep us all on the qui vive. It may not be the most
serious ballet on view this year, but it must be among the most engaging.
And for connoisseurs of theatrical tots, there is a female kiddie who
scampers, with gorge-rising innocence, into the clutches of the vampires.
But instead of being served up as an aperitif to the Count, the infant (in a
white nightie and a mass of tousled curls) is led to safety. Curses]
At the Derngate, Northampton, until May 23. Support from Ann Bonham and
Sons. Grand Theatre, Blackpool from May 25-29

FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Cannibalism in Kilburn - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1968 Sunday play on Radio 3 was, as I warned, Edward Bond's Early
Morning, which the Royal Court reckoned a factor in the end of theatre
censorship. The scheduled opening, confined to club members, was halted by
the police, but some of us were at the dress rehearsal; and in the evening
there was a 'teach-in' about restrictions in the arts, where I sat between
Mick Jagger and Tom Driberg. John Calder was sound on the censorship of
literature; but later interventions, by William Gaskill, Bond, David Mercer
and John Arden were increasingly unpractical.
As for the play, now adapted for radio by the author and directed by David
Benedictus, it seemed less amusing than it did in 1968, so many of its
outrages barely being outrages at all today. In Queen Victoria's reign,
Disraeli and Prince Albert are planning a revolution. The Queen (Margaret
Courtenay) is in love with Florence Nightingale, whom she calls Freddie. The
heir to the throne is Prince George, a Siamese twin with his brother Prince
Arthur. At first it is fun to hear anachronistic and common talk in the
mouths of such folk, but one gets tired of it, and the story, which includes
actual and metaphorical cannibalism, in Kilburn High Road and in Heaven, is
too unlikely to arouse any real indignation. Later in that year the Lord
Chamberlain lost his power of censorship, but not, I suspect, on account of
Early Morning.
Last night I made what I mean to be my final dip into 1968, Caryl
Churchill's half-hour Identical Twins. I could not miss this, being one
myself. I thought it fair romantic comedy but without much dramatic use of
of the identicalness of the twins. As I see it, her point is that, however
alike your looks and upbringing, your characters may not be so. Speaking
from inside, I think this is on the whole unusual. Both twins were played by
Kenneth Haigh, sometimes in unison. John Tydeman directed.
Radio 4's Monday Play, for 1993, was Peter Tinniswood's The Governor's
Consort, about Lady Edith (an earl's daughter?) sailing out to a fictional
south Atlantic island colony where her husband is to be Governor. En route,
her husband dies and the ship's captain commits suicide, but the unmoved
Lady Edith is offered intimacy by the Chief Engineer, a doctor and a waiter.
Ultimately her cabin is entered by a figure from her youth; but, as I had
guessed halfway through, it was all imagination. Tinniswood is always
amusing, and Mary Wimbush, for whom the play was written, was splendid; but
this was a bit too easy.
The Prospect of Hanging is a curious theme for Radio 4 on a Sunday evening
when the week's news was mainly of murder. But it covered no more than
Martyn Wiley's interview with a retired hangman. Syd Dearnley seemed a
decent fellow and old prejudices could have been suspended by the end of the
programme. He had been a welder in Mansfield, as much interested in crime as
any other reader of crime stories, and at age 27 applied for the job of
assistant executioner at Lincoln prison. The procedure he described - leg
straps, arm straps, hood, lever - was done in a very short time, in one
recorded case, 7 1/2 seconds and sounds singularly unbrutal. 'I had no
qualms,' Dearnley said. 'It suited me and got me an extra pint or two of
beer.' It goes on no longer, but lovers of statistics might learn that the
rope was 10ft 6in long, and the trap measured 7ft 6in by 4ft 6in. More
detail can be found in Charles Duff's Handbook on Hanging, even more from
James Berry's My Experiences as an Executioner, unlikely to be still in
print. Neither is liable to follow this programme on Radio 4 on a Sunday
evening.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Emotional wars hot up at Cannes - The build-up to
Palme d'Or day at the film festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION is amazing in Cannes. A cafe au lait costs two pounds. Elizabeth
Taylor costs Dollars 1m for a single night (the hoped-for revenue from her
Dollars 2500-a-table Cannes charity dinner for Aids). And as Palme d'Or
lobbying begins, the praise for individual films by loyalists and PR persons
grows balloon-like by the hour. One fears the day when, as happened to
Inflatable Arnie Schwarzenegger this week, a much-puffed movie suddenly
loses air and threatens to fizz round Cannes like a demented rubber sprite.
Jane Campion's The Piano is still the palmist's favourite; but Chen Kaige's
Farewell To My Concubine, a mid-festival cheer-raiser, may provide a photo
finish on prize night. This spectacular three-hour assault on the icy face
of recent Chinese history has two Peking Opera performers (played by Leslie
Cheung and Zhang Fengyi) acting as our sherpa guides. Their story begins in
1926, when they are thrown as boys into the brute disciplines of a
pre-Maoist opera school. Then it climbs onward and upward through Japanese
invasion, nationalist resistance, the Communists' coming to power and the
Cultural Revolution. Can the two men's precious art survive the blizzards of
history? Can they?
Chen Kaige belongs to the generation that has transformed Chinese cinema.
But his new film makes even Yellow Earth and Life On A String seem
apprentice work. The scene-painting is sensational. Here a Chinese opera
brought to life in all its regal eclat. Here a mist-strewn city street
suddenly thundered through by Japanese troops, scattering its crowds and
composure. Here the grim pageant of a light-raked Maoist show trial.
Within the great design the main characters wage their own emotional wars.
The actor who plays the Queen loves the actor who plays the King who loves a
glamorous courtesan (Gong Li). And when not wrestling with their private
lives, they are frogmarched off to face history's regular tribunals on
whether their art is edifying or reactionary.
The film stumbles only in later scenes when the historical signposts
multiply too fast. Nationalists routed to Taiwan; Red Army entering Peking;
Mao announcing Cultural Revolution . . . We want to cry 'Whoah' as the Great
Events begin to drag the human players in their traces, and the director
himself wields the didactic whip too strongly in using his characters to
castigate the grim kismet of his country.
But three hours of Chen Kaige is a trifle in the viewing compared to the 2
3/4 hours of the festival's rival marathon. Wim Wenders's Faraway So Close
is Wings Of Desire part two. The German director takes the earlier yarn's
themes and characters - Berlin angel Otto Sander, fallen-to-earth angel
Bruno Ganz, much metaphysical warbling about time, memory and emotion - and
shakes them around like dice before scattering them over the crazy-paved
plot.
The film starts with intimations of mortality - it is Sander's turn to fall
to earth and become human - and ends with imitations of Alastair McLean. The
climax is jaw-droppingly dotty. A raid on an arms vaults by an army of
trapeze artists; a hi-jacked barge; a mid-air shoot-out; and dear Horst (The
Magnificent Seven) Buchholz brought out of seclusion to play chief baddie.
There are depths, but you need McLean-style scuba equipment to find them.
Even early on, they are sunk beneath the gnomic voice-overs, the flotillas
of guest stars (Peter Falk, Nastassja Kinski, Mikhail Gorbachev) and the
stylistic surface as capricious and confused - now colour, now monochrome,
now slapstick, now serious - as an oil spill. Despite moments of magic,
Wenders has still not recovered from the try-anything prolixity that brought
us the Until The End Of The World. Faraway So Close is too much of too
little, or possibly too little of too much.
This we cannot say, despite title, of Much Ado About Nothing by William
Shakespeare in collaboration with Kenneth Branagh. Of the Anglo-American
movie contingent going for gold on the Cote d'Azur, this sun-bronzed Bardic
lark is the cheerleader. Branagh plays Benedick and - contain your surprise
 -Emma Thompson plays Beatrice. Add a half-dozen British theatre stalwarts
and a trio of box-office Americans (Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, Keanu
Reeves) and you have this feelgood verse epic set and shot in sunny
Palladian Italy.
Many have sniffed in disdain. I ended up sniffing in delight: my
handkerchief used for laughter in the early duels of wit was later used to
dab emotions at the film's authentically moving ending.
Two other Cannes films, Peter Greenaway's The Baby Of Macon and Stephen
Frears's The Snapper, represent the high-faluting and low-faluting ends of
British cinema. Neither are in competition, which is as well for Greenaway's
extravaganza which found popularity nowhere. In this cod 17th century
religious pageant, presented as a play within a film within a
theatre-cum-cathedral, the title tot wreaks havoc on the 'virgin' mother and
venal prelates who exploit his supposed miraculous powers.
A for idea, but C minus for clotted pace, monotonous rhythms and relentless
decoration. By curtain-time we have had rape, cannibalism, plainsong,
multiple nudity and the rest of the Greenaway baggage; and we are pining for
a simple British film like . . .
Well, in theory like Frears's The Snapper, scripted from his own novel by
Roddy Doyle of The Commitments. But though this is cheerful, it is also
fearfully slight. Ninety Irish minutes of 'Who's got Sandra pregnant?',
'Who's buying the next Guinness?' and 'How do we get the next chortle from
the audience?' It was made for TV and should perhaps go straight there:
though Colm Meaney's rumbustious performance as Dad deserves a bigger,
better setting.
The rest of Cannes has been show business as usual. The competition has
never been dull even when it has disappointed. Steven Soderbergh's King Of
The Hill is a sentimental but sweetly acted Depression tale from the
director who conquered Cannes three years ago with the tougher sex, lies and
videotape. Alain Cavalier's harsh, no-frills political fable Libera Me falls
short of his radiantly minimalist religious fable Therese (Cannes Jury Prize
winner 1986), but wins points for boldness in its eschewal of dialogue for a
mute cinema of gesture. And Stephan Elliott's comedy-thriller Frauds from
Australia has a silly plot about insurance scams but Phil Collins showing
surprising comic acting muscle as the dandyish villain.
For the rest, we liked caustic Chicago gangster Bill Murray laying waste the
acting competition, including Robert De Niro, in the American police romp
Mad Dog And Glory; Australian film-maker Bob Ellis limning a tender comedy
of adolescence and Armageddon in The Nostradamus Kid; and the real Arnold
Schwarzenegger guesting through Cannes and refusing to be upstaged by his
forty-foot blow-up doppelganger. As for the final hot-air event at Cannes -
the prizes - that happens on Monday night.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Lottery, a hollow gamble - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lottery Bill arrives in the Lords next week. It should pass through
unscathed: indeed it might acquire some extra weight if their Lordships
approve an amendment which makes the Lottery a charitable foundation and
frees it from political influence.
But although there is no doubting its long term importance to the arts and
heritage (to say nothing of sport, charities and the Millennium Fund), in
the short term the Lottery is having a malevolent influence. It is setting
arts organisations against each other as they jockey for position, under
pressure to make their case for Lottery cash.
Has the Royal Opera House gone off too soon with its plea for Pounds 45m for
its rebuilding programme? Can the Tate really walk off with Pounds 50m for
its new museum of modern art? What about the proposed Cardiff opera house;
the demands of Olympics-chasing Manchester; to say nothing of the V&amp;A, with
its buckets to catch the rain, and so on. This week alone there were two
more substantial starters - English Heritage anxious for Pounds 15m for the
'new' Stonehenge; and the Theatres Trust seeking a Pounds 30m endowment to
patch up our disintegrating theatres.
The whole thing is getting out of hand, especially as the organisations
(like the Arts Council, the Sports Council, the National Heritage Fund)
selected to hand on the money have been advised to plan on an initial honey
pot of Pounds 50m a year each, well below earlier estimates.
To date the Lottery has excited suspicion, wild scare stories and worry, and
raised expectations that cannot be fulfilled. It has also had a deleterious
short term impact on funding. The money going eventually to the heritage
obviously influenced the government's decision to cut the annual grant of
the National Heritage Fund next year from Pounds 12m to Pounds 8.2m, and may
well be responsible for the planned Pounds 5m cut in the Arts Council grant
for 1994-95.
The Council's dramatic policy shift last week, when it seemed prepared to
allow established arts companies like the leading theatres and orchestras to
rely more on their own talent for revenue raising while subsidy was used to
foster the avant-garde and individual artists, could also be a reflection of
post-Lottery thinking. The Government's protestations that the Lottery would
provide additional revenue for the arts look increasingly hollow.
*****
This week even the National Theatre, by any yardstick one of the most
successful arts companies in the UK, felt moved to make its pitch. It is not
greedy: it is seeking a million or so to do boring but essential maintenance
work, and to extend the Theatre out towards the Thames, creating a new
entrance and more retailing space. It would also like to clean its concrete.
In the wider context, the National is worried that government cash, through
the Arts Council, might be drying up. This lies behind its decision to
present fewer new productions in 1993-94. Between now and next March only
one new play will appear in the Olivier, The Absence of War, the third part
of David Hare's trilogy about modern Britain. (On five Saturdays in the
autumn you can see them all on one day for Pounds 45). The Lyttelton
newcomers are reduced to a revival next month of John Osborne's Inadmissible
Evidence, and, in the autumn, the re-discovery of the American writer Sophie
Treadwell's Machinal, described as a feminist thriller and a great hit in
the 1920s.
The Cottesloe is busier with Lord of the Flies, Angels in America Part II,
and Alice in Wonderland among others. But throughout the arts world at the
moment there is unprecedented gloom about the future as companies face the
quadruple whammy - falling box office revenue, scarcer sponsorship, less
local authority funding, and now the likelihood of Arts Council cuts.
*****
After years hidden from view, presumably in Christie's south London
warehouse, there are rumours that Canova's famed marble of 'The Three
Graces' is about to make a sensational reappearance.
The Phillips family of Luton Hoo, where the Canova held pride of place in
the sculpture gallery, acting through a Cayman Islands investment company,
sold the sculpture to the Getty Museum in Malibu for Pounds 7.9m early in
1990. But the heritage lobby mounted a spirited fight and Mr Nicholas Ridley
put an indefinite block on the export of this prime slice of neo-classical
statuary.
His idea was that the reclusive Barclay twins should buy it on the
understanding that the Graces went on show at the V&amp;A for 25 years. But the
vendors refused to sell it to the Barclays, and presumably planned to offer
it again on the market in a more favourable climate.
The Getty withdrew its interest long ago, as did the Barclays, but the
Canova has probably held its price pretty well, and if the Cayman Trust has
conjured up a new buyer now is the time to apply again for an export
licence. The National Heritage Fund is almost down to its last million and
faces a cut of Pounds 4m in its grant next year. It is in no position to
lead the campaign to save the Canova for the UK. The last line of defence is
the Heritage Secretary, Mr Peter Brooke. He has few victories to his credit
as a Minister so could gain some easy kudos by holding firm and keeping the
export stop in place.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Books: Gospel according to Fra Angelico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRA ANGELICO AT SAN MARCO
by Wiliam Hood
Yale Pounds 45, 338 pages
THIS exceptionally beautiful book describes the corporate mentality in early
15th-century Florence. It reminds us that Fra Angelico was not simply a
Florentine painter who applied a fresh and highly expressive pictorial
language to traditional religious scenes. Fra Angelico was a member of the
Observant Dominicans, which meant that from his mid-twenties he was a wholly
committed, corporate man.
The take-over of San Marco in Florence represented a signal triumph for the
30-year-old Observant or reformed Dominicans. The Observant programme was to
recapture the original fervour of St Dominic's mendicant preachers,
established in 1216 to save fellow-Christians from heresy. However, begging
in the streets was hard to square with a life of study and contemplation.
Finally, the Observants followed the unreformed Conventuals in opting for a
more genteel form of begging: fund-raising.
It was Cosimo de' Medici, patron of San Marco, who paid for Fra Angelico's
paintings. One theme explored in this rich book is the tension between
Medici patronage and the vow of poverty. Cosimo's clout was irresistible. At
San Marco he had his own room and even, it would appear, his own chapel.
Saints Cosmos and Damian, his patron saints, had to occupy a dramatic
position in the great altarpiece.
But that was the limit of Medici propaganda. Away from the church were
paintings intended mainly, and in the dormitory exclusively, for the friars'
eyes. Here the Observant message rang out uncompromised. But who decided
what Fra Angelico painted, and who approved the sometimes radical departure
from traditional subject-matter?
Hood argues that Fra Angelico was not merely illustrating texts by the
famous Prior Antonine (later canonized) and other Dominicans. His suggestion
is that here at San Marco, the artist-friar was able to make his own choices
and decisions.
Fra Angelico at San Marco is a superbly evocative picture of the lives of
its inmates and the role played by images seen a thousand times. Our
understanding of these paintings is lastingly deepened by descriptions which
relate the image to the liturgy and to meditational literature.
The friar in his icy cell on a February morning, preparing a sermon for the
feast of the Purification of the Virgin, would have known the gospel passage
by heart. Learned commentaries were on hand in the library (given by
Cosimo). Just along the corridor was the 'angelic' painter's own
interpretation of the traditional image for the feastday, the 'Presentation
in the Temple'.
St Peter Martyr is there, kneeling in meditation, showing that this is not a
narrative scene but a reminder of the Dominican mission. Looking at the
priest Simeon, with the swaddled Christ child in his arms, the friar's lips
would have murmured Simeon's grateful words, the Nunc Dimittis, 'Lord, now
lettest then thy servant depart in peace'. These were the words which friars
recited every night of their lives at compline.
We will probably never know whether it was indeed Fra Angelico who chose
what to paint for San Marco. It seems likely that it was Prior Antonine who
ruled that, away from Cosimo's eyes, the artist should avoid expensive
pigments. If Fra Angelico was an artist before he was a friar, then perhaps
he resented being deprived free use of lapis lazuli and other expensive
pigments. But if, as this book suggests, he was first and foremost a
corporate man, then he would have willingly acquiesced. His talent, itself a
gift from God, could more than compensate.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Books: Lighten up the face of science - Scientific works
should have more popular appeal with better use of illustration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCIENCE Book Prizes, whose sixth annual awards ceremony will be held at
the Science Museum in London next Wednesday, have done much to raise the
visibility of popular science publishing in the UK - and at the same time
have drawn attention to its serious shortcomings.
The fundamental problem is that most science books, even those aimed at the
general reader, are written in a dense style that emphasises instruction far
more than entertainment. Yet publishers remain reluctant to give them the
amount of illustration - photographs and, above all, good explanatory
diagrams - that they need.
Heather Couper, the astronomer and broadcaster who chaired this year's
judging panel, was struck above all by the 'sheer unrelieved density' of
most of the 69 books submitted for the Pounds 10,000 adult prize, sponsored
by Rhone-Poulenc, the French-owned chemicals company. (Sixty science books
for children were entered for the Pounds 10,000 junior prize.)
Science suffers from the existence of a gulf between lavishly illustrated
works - often referred to disparagingly as coffee table books - and the
majority of publications in which words are all-important and any pictures a
casual afterthought. This gulf reflects a deeply ingrained belief that text
is intellectually superior to pictures. Good illustrations are seen as
essential only for certain book categories, such as those for children and
students, art books and how-to-do-it manuals.
Yet scientific concepts cry out for illumination by illustration. Publishers
should be planning more books in which lively text and graphics are
conceived in tandem to complement and reinforce each other, and fewer with a
smattering of fuzzy photos or textbook-style diagrams.
One book shines out from the prize shortlist for the quality of its
illustrations: Insects in Flight by John Brackenbury, a Cambridge University
zoologist who painstakingly developed his own technique for photographing
the astonishing contortions of flying insects' wings, legs and bodies. The
publisher, Blandford, should be congratulated both for printing
Brackenbury's stunning photos in high quality and for integrating them well
with his lucid text and Rachel Chesterton's explanatory drawings.
The public longing for illustrated explanation accounts for the
international success of Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Science series,
which are produced primarily for young readers but also sell well to adults.
Other publishers may claim they cannot afford to produce science books with
more and better illustrations. But they should remember that most will not
need the full Dorling Kindersley treatment; just a few well placed graphics
could make all the difference. And if costs do increase, the answer is
surely to produce fewer, better books with more international sales
potential. There is no overall shortage of science books - the total number
of new titles published in the UK rose from 2,225 in 1991 to 2,847 last
year, according to Book Marketing Ltd.
Of course, improved visual presentation is not the whole solution. Science
books also need a more inspiring text, says Anthony Wilson, publications
manager of the Science Museum, who has been involved with the Science Book
Prizes from the start and is on this year's judging panel. 'Although the
entries have improved in quality over the five years, and the standard of
writing and explanation in the shortlisted books is high, they are not
always as lively or engrossing as we would like,' he says. 'A more poetic
approach - and more wonder and amazement - might make these books more
popular with general readers.' In Wilson's opinion, the only 'really
unputdownable' read on this year's shortlist is The Malaria Capers by Robert
Desowitz, a professor at the University of Hawaii.
Publishers generally prefer their science books to be written by active
scientists rather than professional writers - even a master such as the
American journalist James Glieck, shortlisted for Genius: Richard Feynman
and Modern Physics. Among scientist-authors, the most consistently inspiring
include Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard, Richard Dawkins and Colin Blakemore of
Oxford and Jared Diamond of UCLA. They are among the 12 eminent scientists
who have been enlisted by John Brockman, a New York agent, to write for
Science Masters, the most ambitious science books venture so far. An
international consortium of 16 publishers, led by Orion in the UK and
HarperCollins in the US, will launch the books in autumn 1994.
The world's publishers see popular science books as a growth market and they
are willing to invest in it, as the multi-million pound Science Masters deal
shows. Bookshops are keen to give them more prominence too. The biggest
single boost for science books in the UK may come from the recent decision
by W H Smith, the largest national chain of book shops, to set up separate
'popular science' sections in its 500 branches. Publishers and authors must
now produce science books with real popular appeal that will persuade buyers
to return consistently to those shelves.

OLIVER FRANKS
by Alex Danchev
Clarendon Press, Oxford Pounds 25, 256 pages
ASKED ONCE who was the ablest man he had ever met outside politics, Attlee
answered, 'Franks'. Many others - British, American or European - who were
active in public affairs in the early post-war years would have agreed. A
younger generation who may be puzzled by this judgment will understand it
better when they have finished this appreciative but by no means
hagiographic account of his life.
Having been, like so many academics, drafted into Whitehall at the outset of
the second world war, Franks showed an immediate talent for administration -
a talent never seriously engaged either before or afterwards. By 1945 he had
become, at the age of 40, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Supply when
it employed over 400,000 people. Then, in 1947, he played a crucial part in
the development and implementation of the Marshall Plan. First, in 15 hectic
weeks of immense effort he produced, as Chairman of the newly formed
Committee for European Economic Co-operation, a unanimous report with much
supporting analysis on Europe's projected needs for dollars, both in
aggregate and by individual country over the next four years. Then he went
to Washington and, almost single-handed, persuaded the Americans to
legislate a not too scaled-down version of these proposals.
As a direct result of this resounding achievement he was appointed
Ambassador to Washington in 1948. For the next four years his unusual
combination of analytical ability, moral authority and neutrality of mind
made him an outstandingly successful Ambassador. He was pivotal in the
creation of NATO and in persuading the UK to join the US in the defence of
South Korea. Dean Acheson came to regard him almost as a personal adviser
and in Anglo/US negotiations at the highest level he was virtually accorded
the status of Chairman.
Apart from the tremendous 12 years 1940-1952 his career was relatively
unremarkable. He was an academic philosopher for 12 years before the war;
Chairman of Lloyds Bank from 1954 to 1962 and Provost of Worcester College,
Oxford, from 1962 to 1976. He wrote extraordinarily little: one academic
philosophical paper and an unmemorable set of Reith Lectures in 1954.
Virtually nothing else.
On the other hand, look at his 'shadow cv' - the posts he was offered and
turned down: Secretary-General of NATO; Chairman of the National Coal Board,
British Railways, British Petroleum, the Atomic Energy Authority;
Director-General of the BBC; Headmaster of Harrow; Editor of The Times;
Governor of the Bank of England. The Establishment clearly valued him and
tried hard to get him to work for them. But he appears to have had a
deep-seated reluctance to commit himself institutionally. It shows even in
his religion, which was of the utmost importance to him. He was a life-long
attender of Quaker meetings and married in a Quaker ceremony, but unlike his
mother and his wife he never joined the Society of Friends.
Outside his relatively short period of formal public service his powers
found their greatest expression in inquisition. There were eight Franks
Reports on subjects as diverse as Indian development plans and British
business schools and including a massive inquiry Into Oxford University in
1960. They normally ended with clear recommendations arising logically from
the mass of evidence lucidly marshalled. If sometimes those commissioning
the reports were dIsinclined to accept their conclusions, that was not
Franks' concern.
His conduct of inquiries was legendary. His questions tended to be long,
miraculously coherent summings-up of the Issues at stake or of the witness's
previous answers, at the end of which many witnesses could do little but
agree. (On one occasion the formidable Dame Evelyn Sharp was subjected to a
particularly intricate question, delivered without notes and extending to
three pages in the transcript. She asked if the question could be repeated.
It was and proved identical in the transcript except for occasional
phrases.)
Alex Danchev has written an excellent, informative and thoughtful biography
of this outstanding, puzzling man. The heart of it is naturally the early
post-war years where the author is clearly at home with the background and
provides an account of this seminal time that is both readable and well
referenced. But the whole book is fascinating for the attempts - doomed by
the nature of the subject to be ultimately unsuccessful - to understand and
explain precisely what made Franks tick.
Only in his account of the Falklands Inquiry may some readers feel let down.
Danchev behaves as gingerly in assessing Franks and his colleagues as they
themselves did in assessing the behaviour of all those from the Prime
Minister downwards whose combined errors led to an avoidable disaster. Those
looking for a more robust account can find it in Ian Gilmour's Dancing with
Dogma.

DEATH PLUS TEN YEARS
by Roger Cooper
HarperCollins Pounds 17.50, 330 pages
ROGER Cooper has written a cool, elegant and in the end rather moving
account of his five and a half years in that nightmare situation of today's
expatriate, the Middle East hostage. When he was imprisoned by the Iranians
in 1985 he was in great danger because, on the face of it, he was indeed
qualified to be a 'British spy': he was an authority on Persia, had lived
there for many years, was variously a journalist, consultant, teacher and
businessman.
Quite soon in his interrogation he was prepared to write a 'confession' in
which he confected a colourful autobiography that relied on characters drawn
from Evelyn Waugh's novels. He was eventually sentenced to death (for
'alleged fornication' 25 years before) and another ten years for spying. One
of the few sympathetic Iranians in this book assured him that he would serve
the two sentences in reverse order.
There is a corpus of Hostage Literature. Cooper never attempts to match the
remarkable poetic candour of Brian Keenan, and he does not have the
best-selling story to compete with the boy-girl romance of John McCarthy.
What he achieves is a fascinating demonstration of the stiff upper lip.
His imperturbability - which is a high form of courage - is almost
unbelievable. This is a narrative devoid of anguish, terror, even anger. 'I
felt very sorry for myself'; 'Anyone who has been to an English public
school and served in the ranks of the British army is perfectly at home in a
Third World prison'; 'I felt quite wobbly'; 'the beatings were unpleasant
enough, of course, but not seriously damaging': that is as far as he is
prepared to go. It is a book full of jokes as well as blindfolds and
deprivation and mock executions and, just once, a rejection of suicide.
How can a man be so cool about five wasted years? The answer lies in the
character. Roger Cooper (who had various connections, and friendships, on
this newspaper) always had an insouciant quality which, I suspect, helped
carry him through. He loves Iran and believed he knew best how to cope with
its fundamentalist rulers.
He is too modest to mention it but he is a Persian scholar of distinction;
he might perhaps have been an academic but was sent down from Oxford,
ridiculously, for going to join the Hungarian uprising in 1956. (It would
have been good to have a fuller autobiography - the Cooper family is
interesting, his uncle was Robert Graves, etc.) He describes how he used his
later imprisonment to set out on a course of intense study.
As for the spying, surely MI6 is not so crazy as to hire such an oddball
eccentric - yet there is a curious sequence in the chronology when he makes
notes for a 'confession' which he hides under his mattress and they are of
course found. One guesses that the full story will never be told; FT readers
who know the Middle East will appreciate that these things are never simple.
Only at the end, after he is free, do we glimpse the horror which Cooper is
so loath to admit: 'even in a curtained bedroom I slept with my airline
eyeshade on as a kind of security blanket just as I had worn my blindfold in
gaol to keep out the non-stop lights of my cell'. A brave man, and he is
still not willing to admit just how much that means.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Books: Active service - Crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WRITER of crime novels has a limited choice of protagonist: it can be
the investigator (uniformed or amateur) or the murderer or, more rarely, the
victim.
If the investigator is chosen, he cannot be allowed to have too much
personal life, otherwise wife, kids, the unrepaired dish-washer and the
Sunday dinner interfere irritatingly with the crime's solution. For her
first suspense novel, Kindness Can Kill (Constable, 190pp. Pounds 13.99),
Jane Bolitho steers an ingenious but steady course concentrating on the
victim but also allowing her DCI Ian Roper a considerable, engaging but
apposite life of his own. The crime - an attractive, independent woman is
brutally and inexplicably murdered - takes place in a rich context and
touches many lives, described with perceptive economy and wry humour. The
small-town setting is traditional (there is even a vicarage), but the author
gives it fresh vitality.
David Armstrong's first novel, Night's Black Agents (Collins, 184pp, Pounds
13.99) presents another new and arresting talent. Here the actual murderer,
a misanthropic canal boatman, and his homicidally crazed employer, a
cuckolded landlord, are the focus of attention, along with the unusual
setting: the canals of the Midlands and the North-West during the 1930s. The
debutant novelist reveals a genuine gift for atmosphere and for keen
characterisation; (the errant wife and lonely child are tellingly drawn);
the denouement, however, is a let-down, dependant on a man's somewhat
unconvincing weakness rather than on the logic of events and the
investigation. Still, this book is impressive and eminently readable.
A Detective Constable on active service, Keith Wright has found time to
produce three novels. The latest is Addressed to Kill (Constable 192 pp,
Pounds 13.99), starring DI David Stark (with the usual vaguely dissatisfied
wife and children neglected in the line of duty). In the course of the book,
a rapist killer runs loose, but is finally apprehended in a good chase.
Wright's forte is police-station atmosphere, chaff, routine, personality
clashes, sententiousness. Nothing startlingly original here, but a highly
competent performance.

CATCHING THE LIGHT
by Arthur Zajonc
Bantam Press, Pounds 16.99, 388 pages
WHAT IS light? Arthur Zajonc and a colleague, both physicists, recently
constructed a science exhibit to show why this question is so compelling.
They made a box into which strong light is beamed. Viewers peer into the box
through a window. What they see is - nothing. Outside the box is a handle
connected to a wand projecting into the box. When the handle is pulled, the
wand moves up into the beam, flashing brilliantly on the surface facing the
light source. Only with something to illuminate does light become visible.
Many historians treat science as a tale of progress from superstition to
enlightenment. Zajonc takes a different tack. His interest lies in the
variety of human efforts to make sense of the world. In this book he
concentrates on one of the most extraordinary and beautiful of things, and
one of the most difficult to understand: light, and its allied phenomena of
sight and colour.
Zajonc takes us from the Egyptian god Ra, whose eye was the sun and whose
tears gave rise to mankind, to the latest speculation on the ambiguous
nature of the photon in quantum physics. It is a fascinating journey. Zajonc
succeeds in showing that scientific enquiry is seamlessly part of the human
search for more than mere facts. Recently science has come under renewed
attack for clipping angels' wings, as Keats put it, and unweaving the
rainbow; but Zajonc shows how mistaken this perception of science is.
Light is central to our imagination of the world. Creation was conceived as
the moment when god ordered light into chaos, and great religions like
Zorastrianism and Manichaeism carried the theme forward by describing
existence as the struggle between light and darkness. The metaphor of the
'light of the world' is central to Christianity also, and it is unsurprising
that from antiquity onwards intelligence has been analogised as the light of
the mind. The word 'theory' derives from the Greek word 'to behold', and
blind seers, like Homer and Tiresias, gaze further than sighted men because
their inner light shines brighter.
Early philosophers described seeing as a projection of light from the eye.
Light itself was, quite literally, the eye-beam of god, as witness the
identification of Ra and the sun. Plato thought of sight as the mingling of
daylight with beams emanating from the eye, kindled there by a fire within;
inner and outer light coalesce, making a bridge for motions caused by
external objects to pass into the mind.
Until the beginnings of modern science in the Renaissance, the mysteries of
light remained a rich source of metaphor for speculation about gods and
minds. But with the work of Italian artists on perspective, furthered by the
optical researches of Galileo and Descartes, light began to reveal itself as
a repository of mysteries much stranger and deeper than the pre-scientific
imagination had ever dreamed.
Newton split white light into its spectrum of colours by beaming it through
a prism. He conceived of light as particles of different sizes, each
responsible for producing a different colour in visual experience. In the
following century Leonhard Euler rejected Newton's view, replacing it with a
wave theory of light, on analogy with sound. Augustin Fresnel developed the
theory, and experimental work supported it. The stage was set for 19th
century science's great distraction, the quest for the luminiferous ether.
Just as sound needs a medium through which to propagate - it does so by
compression and rarefaction of air - so a medium was thought necessary for
light. The ether filled this bill. Much effort was devoted to the search for
it. But the brilliant work of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell on
electromagnetism sowed the seeds for abandonment of ethereal speculations,
and prepared the ground for the giant steps soon taken by Einstein and the
quantum theorists.
In quantum mechanics light is described as both wave and particle, a deep
ambiguity which has led to a revision of the fundamentals of physics.
Photons have no mass, and display the weird property of nonlocality, meaning
that ordinary concepts of causality do not apply. To accommodate light in
the physics of the universe, entirely new ways of thinking are required.
By exploring the unfolding of views about light from mythology, religion and
current science, Zajonc helps us to a position where, in the concluding
discussions, quantum theory strikes us as no more odd, though no less
mysterious, than any of its predecessors. Although Zajonc goes close to the
edge of speculation sometimes (can Rudolf Steiner really be as serious a
contributor to the debate as Albert Einstein?) one learns a lot from this
rich book, which is highly entertaining and - yes - illuminating.

Antinori is determined to make one of the world's best wines. He may have
succeeded / Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE STANDARD explanation for the extraordinary increase in wine quality over
the past decade or so is improved technology. But that is just part of the
story - the arid bit. The real reason often is good, old-fashioned
competition between producers.
This is keener than ever before, not just because it is a buyer's market but
because success is easier to measure. All the world's producers have access
to the numerical scoreboards of the American wine press (which publishes
points out of 100 for individual wines) as well as to the well-publicised
results of comparative tastings and the like.
What a thrill to produce a 95-pointer when the product of one's competitor
gets only 85. And, just think - if that competitor were one's older brother
. . .
Sibling rivalry, one of life's more powerful forces, might just be the one
which propelled international playboy Marchese Lodovico Antinori to carve
his own wine estate, Ornellaia, from the scrub of the once mosquito-ridden
Maremma of coastal Tuscany.
Antinori is a famous name in the wine lexicon. The family, based at the
Palazzo Antinori in the Piazza Antinori, has been making wine in and around
Florence since 1385. Today, Lodovico's older brother, Piero, runs Marchesi
L&amp; P. Antinori and is probably Italy's most respected wine personage.
He made the prototype 'Supertuscan', Tignanello, and a well-received attempt
to coax first-growth claret out of Tuscan soil, Solaia. This was itself a
riposte to Sassicaia, a similar Cabernet-based wine produced today by
Lodovico and Piero's cousin next door to Ornellaia, where Lodovico's
wine-producing relatives are referred to as 'the cousin' and the 'brother'.
When Lodovico was 23, he was despatched to work for Antinori's US agent in
New York while Piero remained at the Palazzo Antinori. But Lodovico's early
exposure to a wine market harsh enough to call his family's Chianti 'dago
red' did little to kindle his enthusiasm for the business. He spent the next
two decades producing films in Los Angeles, being a photo-journalist in
Vietnam, skiing in Gstaad, hunting in Austria, and generally fleshing out a
CV that would send a shiver down the spine of a careers' master.
Although Lodovico still spends more time in Switzerland and Austria than at
Ornellaia, there are distinct signs that wine has got to him at last. It was
Andre Tchelistcheff, the nonogenarian oenologist in California, who
convinced Lodovico in 1980 that he would be better off establishing a wine
estate in Italy than California.
Lodovico called on a roll-call of top wine names to advise him and regularly
flies the jolly lord of Pomerol, Michel Rolland, to Tuscany to supervise the
production of his special, all-Merlot wine, Masseto, which has achieved cult
status in Germany and southern California.
Indeed, it is only because 1989 was a particularly generous vintage,
yielding 650 cases of Masseto, that the wine is available in Britain for the
first time.
The Ornellaia winery may be unusual. A total investment of more than Pounds
5m has resulted in a roof garden surreally sunk into the deserted Tuscan
landscape 'this is where we had the famous opening party', as featured in
Tatler, empty marble halls 'this is used once a year for a local festa', and
an impressively architectural triangle full of Lafite and Lynch-Bages 'the
Marchese's private cellar'.
But there is no doubting Lodovico's commitment to quality as a wine
producer, nor that his approach is as sensitive as it is deep-pocketed. 'I
learnt more during Tchelistcheff's annual visits from 1980 to 1988 than I
ever will again. It was total immersion in the philosophical concept, like
having a tutor in many humanistic subjects, not just technology.'
At Tchelistcheff's suggestion, he bought eight brand new oak vats in 1989
(thereby ensuring French coopers Radoux's profitability for the year) simply
for short term storage before the wine is racked into the best barrels money
could buy, just because Tchelistcheff said that he had good results with
them at another millionaire's winery in California. Since his young
Hungarian winemaker Tibor G'al visited Chateau Margaux, they are being used
for fermentation too.
'Right now I'm having a love affair with Mr Anselmi of Soave', he announces
gleefully, having fixed on this talented iconoclast as current white
wine-making guru for his Sauvignon, Poggio alle Gazze. Tibor, whose young
family has tried and failed to settle at Ornellaia, sighs deeply and often
during his employer's outbursts, but he too cares passionately about the
wines that are shown at Ornellaia - in special Austrian-made glasses.
Presumably in an attempt to staunch the outflow of lire, they have launched
a pair of lesser wines, Le Volte red and Pian dei Susini white, made
substantially from indigenous grapes grown outside the carefully guarded 56
hectare estate. The next vintage of Le Volte, 1992, looks an exciting step
up from the 1991, but will not be exported until the autumn.
Lodovico Antinori, touring Britain's wine trade this coming week, if he can
be persuaded to stick to his schedule, is determined to make one, preferably
two, of the world's best wines. To all intents and purposes he has
succeeded. Masseto is a sumptuous Merlot in the style of Le Pin, and the
1989, having been picked early, completely refutes the reputation of this
vintage in Tuscany.
Ornellaia, a Cabernet-based blend, beguiled a roomful of Masters of Wine
when served blind alongside Chateau Latour last year. The 1989 is
impressive, the 1988 tantalisingly unobtainable, and the 1990 a knockout.
And in issue 82 of the influential US Wine Advocate newsletter, 'the
brother' and 'the cousin' scored 90 to Ornellaia's 93.
Ornellaia 1990 is Pounds 23.83, 1989 is Pounds 21.49 and Masseto 1989 is
Pounds 29.25 from Winecellars, London SW18 tel 081-871-3979, fax
081-874-8380. Le Volte 1992 should be less than Pounds 10.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Why obsession is on the menu - Rich foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY is it that rich men and women become obsessed with making wine, serving
meals and running hotels. It must be love because having made money the
sensible way they are ignoring commercial discipline and lavishing cash on
their labours. So have California Cabernets been born, French chateaux
renovated and grand Spanish hotels reopened.
One of the latest businessmen to do it is Jean Michel Signoles who, in 1967
at the age of 19, founded a children's wear company called Chipie. Today,
his textile empire has outposts on high streets from Tokyo to London and
boasts an annual turnover of more than Pounds 100m.
Chipie is still based in Signoles's home town of Carcassonne, in south west
France, now home to his smaller culinary empire. Signoles was born in a
house in a poor quarter of the town and grew up in the shadow of the cite of
Carcassonne, the 12th century walled city that was reconstructed by
Viollet-Le-Duc in the 19th century and, more recently, acted as Nottingham
Castle for Kevin Costner in his film reconstruction of Robin Hood.
Situated between the cathedral and the castle was a bishop's palace which,
over the centuries, was host to saints, popes and various kings of France.
In 1909 the palace became an hotel and guests included Maurice Chevalier,
Grace Kelly, Walt Disney and the British middle classes touring in their
Singers and Wolseys. During the second world war it acted as the
headquarters of Air France after it fled Paris.
The hotel closed in 1986 and eventually Signoles bought it. Chipie was
attracting so many business clients that finding suitable accommodation was
becoming impossible. But this does not explain adequately the Pounds 5m
investment in this hotel, its sister hotel next door, the Dame Carcas, and
the lively bistro, Les Coulisses du Theatre, in the 13th century Rue Saint
Louis. Civic pride and the chance to paint his design talents on to a larger
canvas have also played a part.
It has also allowed Signoles' strong anglophile tendencies to prevail. The
bedrooms are decorated courtesy of Colefax &amp; Fowler, all the bathroom
fittings are British and the garage houses his meticulously-maintained, pale
blue Jaguar Mark 2 3.8. The library houses a complete set of Guide Michelin
back to its first appearance in 1900, while the bar and dining room look and
feel like a cross between an Oxbridge college and a Spanish parador.
In fields where Signoles is not expert he has taken expert advice. The wine
list, although it contains many reasonably priced bottles from the
surrounding vineyards, reads like the catalogue from a Christie's wine
auction: 12 vintages of Chateau Margaux back to 1929, 14 vintages of Petrus
back to 1954, 13 vintages of Lafite to 1902 and the same number of different
vintages of Chateau d'Yquem.
In the kitchen, Signoles has hired an extraordinarily talented chef, Michel
del Burgo, aged 30, and given him a kitchen that most chefs only dream
about. The main section is dominated by an enormous Molteni stove  -
considered to be the Rolls-Royce of its field - while at one end of the
kitchen, and visible from the dining room, is an open spit oven that gives
the air of a medieval banqueting hall. I ate the farmyard chicken, stuffed
with herbs, spit-roasted and served with cep mushrooms. It was delicious.
So too were our first courses. A thick, cold but luxurious potato soup
topped with generous shavings of truffles; one of Del Burgo's signature
dishes, a risotto made from epeautre, the eye of a local strain of wheat
instead of rice, with wild asparagus, and a carpaccio of duck served with a
slice of foie gras on country bread. Del Burgo has managed to combine the
region's penchant for trencherman-like servings at every course with
refinement and even tweaked the local speciality, cassoulet, by making his
with duck, hare and tender young pork. He has also had the modesty to put at
the bottom of his menu the names of his sous chef and patissier. The
latter's art is obvious from the delicious breads to the petits fours that
followed a memorable hot chocolate souffle with a white chocolate sauce.
The consequences of all this investment, hard work and talent is the
restaurant's first star in the 1993 Michelin guide. After only two years,
this is a considerable feat in the conservative world of French gastronomy.
My biggest criticism of the restaurant is certainly one that would not
bother any French reviewer. Although the service is attentive and friendly
it lacks, I feel, a personality to orchestrate the imposing dining room and
bar. But possibly Signoles intends to solve that by importing a British
maitre d'. Now that would show style.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Brian's bait tempts some fishy clients -
Common Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONUNDRUM faces every interested British cook. Why is it so difficult to
obtain the fresh fish our island waters so bountifully supply?
Over the past 50 years, 7,000 traditional wet fishmongers have disappeared
from the country's high streets and the supermarkets have failed to rise to
the challenge.
But this has allowed the rise of the travelling fish market. Today there are
1,200-1,500 small refrigerated vans on Britain's road uniting suppliers -
fishermen and fish merchants based in Newlyn, Brixham or along the east
coast - with their customers either at home or in staff canteens.
There are 200 vans carrying fish out of Grimsby alone to Birmingham, Leeds,
Bristol, Liverpool and London. One is driven by Gary Simons, 32, whose
father, Brian, started the business in the late 1970s when the building
trade went into one of its periodic declines. He now sells 40,000 stone of
fish a year around the country.
Fish which he buys in Grimsby on a Monday - his salmon comes from Scotland,
smoked trout from Gloucestershire - is packed under ice for his 3.15am start
on Tuesday. After a short sleep he is with his first customer in
Bedfordshire at 7am and then it is on to Mill Hill, North Wembley and
Harrow.
He stays in digs overnight and has a rendezvous arranged with a Grimsby fish
merchant to top up his stock. When I met him there had been a run on salmon
courtesy of a Delia Smith recipe on the television the night before.
On Wednesday it is St John's Wood, Regent's Park and Harley Street. On
Thursdays he leaves central London via customers in Brondesbury Park,
Finchley and Barnet and returns to Grimsby at about 6pm utterly exhausted.
Friday is spent, more mundanely, doing the books and scrubbing down the van.
I sat in the van and watched Simons in action. Dressed in a white coat,
nipping in and out ringing a number of doorbells simultaneously to see
whether his customers were in and, if they were, what they wanted, he looked
just like a fleet-footed milkman - except that he was delivering brill,
dover and lemon soles, halibut, herring fillets, smoked salmon and kippers.
Brian's Fresh Grimsby Fish, 28 Stallingborough Road, Healing, Grimsby, South
Humberside DN37 7QL. Tel: 0472-887557, mobile 0860-844508.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Cookery: A perfect risotto from Italy's best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Food Exhibition is a biennial event at which producers and
manufacturers hawk their wares to potential buyers in the retail and
catering trades under the watchful eyes of the media at Earls Court, London.
Some of the products are best-selling household names; others are still at
the development stage, testing the market. As in a junk shop hunt or a bran
tub lucky dip, there are plenty of no-nos to be found and a few gems.
Happy discoveries for me this year included razor clams and other spankingly
fresh seafoods from Padraic Mulloy of Co. Mayo, Ireland (tel: 098-41328);
wild capers on the stalk, pickled in wine and as pretty as cherries, from
VEA Lerida of Catalonia, Spain (3473-126 000); and splendid anchovies (whole
salted and fillets in oil) plus Blancafort Madurat goat cheese imported from
Spain by Brindisa of London (071-403 0282).
The Italian contingent was bigger and stronger than ever before. I
particularly liked the exquisitely creamy buffalo mozzarella from ABC
co-operative farms centred on Caserta (0823-621 560); truffle products from
Brezzi of Grosseto (0564-456 800); and a notable debut of offerings from
Sardinia. Among these were a fine range of honeys (Agri-Sar: tel. 070-662
302); the best pecorino sardo I have ever tasted - a version intended for
the table rather than cooking (Argiolas: 070-740 293); and a feather-light
panettone made by the sourdough method and topped with sugar granules and
almonds, like the Milanese Easter cake called Colomba (Murgia Salvatore:
070-924 5000).
At the end of the day, the Italian Trade Centre hosted a reception for all
the exhibitors in its pavilion plus a sprinkling of outsiders; several
hundred people in all. The menu included truly excellent bruschetta;
focaccia with sun-dried tomatoes; polenta wrapped round fontina cheese and
prosciutto, egged and crumbed and fried; Parma ham with hand-made grissini;
assorted salami and regional cheeses; lots of rocket and little artichokes
fried in the Roman manner; pasta 'nasciata (moulded and baked Sicilian
style); and risotto primavera.
The highlight for me was the risotto - really delicious and a culinary
near-miracle given the number of guests. Thirty kilos of rice was used,
cooked in massive muscle-flexing panloads of 10-12 lb at a time.
I went behind the scenes to watch work in progress and found the jolliest
kitchen team imaginable, including: chef Mauro Bregoli of the Old Manor
House in Romsey, Hampshire, tel: 0794-517353, (in whose kitchens I once
spent a happy day lending a hand with salami-making after a pig-killing);
Franco Taruschio of The Walnut Tree Inn near Abergavenny, in Gwent
(0873-852797), whose fans will rejoice in the news that Pavilion Books is
shortly to publish his Leaves From the Walnut Tree; and Pietro Pesce, of
Danmar International, importer of much of the best Italian produce into the
UK - and mastermind behind the risotto recipe below - and food writer Anna
Del Conte.
Franco Taruschio had brought his entire brigade with him, a bright,
enthusiastic and hardworking bunch of young people, all British save one, an
American girl. It was a long and arduous day for them. They had set out from
Wales at crack of dawn bringing everything with them bar the kitchen stove.
After the reception Taruschio was taking them out on the town far baldoria
(to have fun), before driving back to Abergavenny. That's what I like about
the Italians: their sense of enjoyment of everything to do with good food.
RISOTTO PRIMAVERA
This is the delectable risotto as cooked by Bregoli and Pesce, scaled down
to modest quantities suitable for the domestic kitchen - enough to serve
four people as a first course or three as a main dish.
Ingredients: 5-6 oz asparagus; 3-4 baby artichokes; 4 oz very small
courgettes; 4 oz peas (shelled weight); 1 garlic clove, chopped finely; 2
tablespoons finely-chopped onion; 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil; 2 oz
butter; 2 tablespoons wine; 9 oz carnaroli rice; 2 pt chicken or vegetable
stock; a bunch of flat-leafed parsley, chopped; 1 1/2 oz freshly grated
Parmesan cheese.
Method: Shell the peas and trim the asparagus, artichokes and courgettes as
appropriate. Blanch all four vegetables separately and drain well. Cut the
asparagus into short lengths and dice the courgettes. Chop the artichokes
into small pieces and scoop the flavoursome marrow from the stalks.
Heat the stock until just simmering and keep it at simmering point. Heat the
oil and half the butter in a heavy-based pan and saute the onion and garlic
until tender.
Stir the rice into the onion pan and cook for two minutes. Splash on the
wine and boil rapidly until reduced. Add a ladle of stock and let the rice
absorb it, stirring constantly.
Continue to add the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring frequently until the
rice is cooked. Halfway through cooking, start adding the blanched and
chopped vegetables. Begin with the asparagus stalks, as they are hardest and
will take longest to become tender. Next add the artichokes and peas, then
the courgettes and, finally, the asparagus tips and artichoke marrow.
When the rice is done, draw the pan away from the heat, season with salt and
pepper and add half the chopped parsley. Stir in the remaining 1 oz butter
(cut into small pieces) and the Parmesan. Cover the pan tightly with its lid
and let it stand for a couple of minutes. Then stir the risotto vigorously
again, transfer it to a heated dish, decorate with the remaining parsley and
serve straight away.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Gardening (A Taste of Chelsea): A fine French sense of
Chelsea deja vu - Robin Lane Fox travels to France to pick up some early
tips for the UK's top show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK, I watched while horticultural punters scrambled for the latest
line in copper labels; floral prizes had already been bestowed by the jury;
as the rain intensified, we rushed for the tents and afterwards, a familiar
column of middle-aged customers headed towards the car park, lugging irises
in polythene to the boots of their Renaults and Peugeots. Yet Chelsea Flower
Show begins on Tuesday and public tickets have already sold out. Have I
beaten the crowds by telepathy? Have I dreamed in anticipation, erasing
those outdoor gardens of cedarwood designed by the Daily Express?
Next week, I will be visiting Chelsea with a cosmopolitan sense of deja vu:
I have prepared myself with a work-out at the flourishing new show in
France. Ten years ago it started at Courson, about 30 miles west of Paris
where the grounds of the Chateau had been ably gardened by three generations
of the Fustier family.
A share in the property had passed to Helene and her banking husband,
Patrice, but neither knew anything about gardening, except that it seemed to
be dreadfully expensive, especially when the main rhododendrons died of
drought in that frightful year of 1976. They approached the Association des
Parcs Botaniques de France in 1983 and proposed a flower show for members in
the Chateau's grounds. Innocently, they agreed to one nurseryman's
last-minute request that exhibitors should be allowed to sell plants.
The association was not altogether prepared for over-the-counter trading
behind the green cloth, but 200 members turned up and enjoyed the
experience. With modifications, the experiment was repeated, making
particular strides in 1986-7 and attracting valued support from Britain's
Royal Horticultural Society. It now takes place twice yearly, in May and
October, and although the Association still attends with pleasure, its
members now comprise only a fraction of the visiting public.
Last week I watched while more than 20,000 paying customers turned up during
three days to an agrarian style of car park which would reassure any
visitors to an English village fete. Tenting is limited; the staging is
vraiment rustique; exhibits are not massed or shown off a la Chelsea and
there are no restrictions on buying plants from them on the first day. The
proceeds from Chelsea go towards subsidising the RHS's other shows. Last
week Courson's proceeds went to the Societe's Bills for maintenance, a
private initiative in a country where the Societe National d'Horticulture
let the chance of a Gallic Chelsea slip during its past 150 years of sleepy
existence.
Courson is no Chelsea and my French informants assured me that they hope it
will never lose its French style. Nonetheless, some of Chelsea's own
exhibitors now cross the Channel in vans for this prelude, from Clifton
Nurseries through Blooms and Scotts to Glebe Cottage Plants. What happens
when French and English meet?
In the sunshine the French can enjoy the English and their open-air
eccentricities: mature women in macintosh jackets discourse on Alpine
plants, while the younger generation were breast feeding in track suit
trousers beside family exhibits of rare trees.
The show has a wonderful feel of informality and weekend market which has
still not been lost in its huge success. It also has the openness and
personal enthusiasm of the Fustiers and their staff who deserve to make a
proper return on a yearly investment of time, love and not less than FFr1m
(Pounds 120,000).
For me, the rencontre refutes lazy expatriates who always complain that they
cannot buy decent plants in France and that anything desirable has to be
brought from England with the accompanying problems of forms and Customs.
From June 1, plants from approved nurseries can circulate across the Channel
without further bureaucracy: my first thoughts among the rustic tables were
that England has the status of a horticultural Taiwan.
On French stands Fuchsia versicolor was selling for Pounds 18, Lavatera
Barnsley for Pounds 17 and a clematis for Pounds 20, at the exchange rate
for the debacle of Golden Wednesday. Standard box trees were on offer at up
to Pounds 400.
I am not sure which is cause and which is effect, but until the Single
Market, serious gardening from French tree and shrub nurseries has been a
minority's possibility, pre-supposing enormous riches. Even at the
herbaceous level, a common plant such as Geranium macrorrhizum from a
first-class French nursery sells for more than a plant of the new, rare and
lovely blue Corydalis flexuosa, driven over from Devon in the back of Carol
Klein's nursery van.
Beyond question, French gardening is being pulled together. For the
Fustiers, one delight of Courson is the emergence of remote nurserymen whom
the show has drawn into the open. Aimez-vous old-fashioned roses? Try
Boureau from the Ile de France which sells 500 varieties, including musk
roses as elegant standards. Best of all, try Grillot near Lyons,
'Rosieristes depuis 1829', describing itself as 'archaeologists of the rose'
across five generations which make Vita Sackville West look like a brief
comet in the sky.
Preferez-vous Meconopsis? Try the Lemonniers in Normandy, whose owners
describe to me their list of more than 25 varieties, many of which I would
never expect to find in a seaside climate. What about betilla striata or the
incredible Hebe Hulkeana? Try Dino Pellizaro down in Provence, whose list
results from 20 years' keen plant-finding and is ignored by Brits who go
south to escape the lawn.
We have all made jokes about those frightful red Salvias in the parterres of
French chateaux: the tables are now turned, if you know where to look. To my
eye, and ironic pleasure, the best sight of the show was the exhibit of
Salvias by Yves Herve and his partner at La Foux Nursery. Together, they
have collected and exhibited wild Salvias from Brazil to the Middle East,
most of which I had never seen, although the family is red-hot news in
English container-gardening. Last year, the nursery took a small display to
the Hampton Court show, but I now realise that this display was only an
appetiser. These wild Salvias, like expatriates, thrive in the hotter areas,
especially in the south.
Is there a wide and growing base for these plant lists among French
gardeners themselves? Since 1992, there have been two equivalents to our
Plant Finder, of which the better one is co-authored by Anita Pereire and
published by Hachette. Like the new open frontier with British nurseries,
these lists will raise the public's awareness of the possible. Scotts of
Somerset is already supplying wholesale to big Parisian garden stores,
including Cedre Rouge.
In the last three years, we have passed the point when the French were best
left to accessories and their most stylish jardins were imaginaire. On the
Wells and Winter accessories stand the presiding presence of Sir John Wells
told me that on two days, takings already compared favourably with his
entire haul from Chelsea.
Fifteen thousand garden labels had been bought, and French good taste
preferred green labels to white ones. As yet, clients have not graduated to
sophisticated needs like his caps for plant-stakes to blunt them and avoid
eye injuries. French customers, he found, were much more decisive, unlike
those little old ladies at Chelsea who fiddle around among his flower prints
and end up buying nothing.
Ten years ago, the Fustiers never dreamed they would have a show whose jury
included the top names in European gardening and which pulled in 20,000
visitors. In 1992, the RHS awarded a Veitch Memorial Medal to Patrice
Fustier which he would be the first to share with his wife and fellow
pioneer from a position of ignorance in 1983.
For gardeners in France the show catalogue is an essential index and a visit
in May or October will transform attentive minds' ideas of their scope and
supply. In the shadow of Chelsea, English gardeners would probably prefer to
stay put, although curiosity is rewarded and a visit can be combined with a
leap into early summer in the enchanted grounds of Paris's great haven, the
gardens at Bagatelle. All of us must wish the Fustiers continuing luck with
the weather.
During 10 dry years, their Courson show first revealed what French sources
were growing in modest isolation: the English invaders will merely serve to
enlarge it. Was it true, I asked Patrice Fustier, that two nursery persons
had met at Courson, fallen in love and married? Perhaps, he replied, and if
so, we will be exhibiting the hybrids soon at Courson too. As you follow the
flow signs in Chelsea's matchless Main Tent, you may find it hard to imagine
that in the scrimmage of this Flower Show, anyone has ever had time for
romance.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Gardening (A Taste of Chelsea): The otter surfaces - Country
Note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIN fastened to the pub wall under a notice 'Water Otter' led into the
murky depths of a tank enclosed and landscaped, after a fashion, to resemble
a river bank.
I bought my drink and waited expectantly but nothing appeared. Finally,
seriously concerned for the animal's welfare, I hauled on the chain only to
recover - a kettle] Sadly in England, kettles are far more numerous than
otters, whose virtual disappearance in the 1960s and early 1970s largely as
a result of poisoning from organochlorine pesticides and sheep dips, has
been well documented.
These chocolate brown members of the weasel family are almost as big as
badgers but they are shy, secretive and difficult to find. This makes them a
problem to count. It would be hard to discover if they were numerous or
scarce were it not for their characteristic droppings, or spraints, which
enable biologists to get some idea of the size of their population. These
spraints are generally full of bones from fish and other prey which are
glued together in a black and tarry mass. The most telling feature about
them is their smell, a sweet musky odour which is both acceptable and
unmistakeable, the staff of life to the otter surveyor.
While mink droppings, or scats, look much the same, their smell is far from
pleasant. Otters hold territories along rivers and streams as well as on the
coast and leave their spraints at strategic points as signposts which will
be readily found by other otters.
Luckily for the surveyor, these are frequently on the ledges on either side
of the water under bridges. Checking for them rarely means more than donning
a pair of waders at the roadside and crawling under the bridge with a sharp
eye and a keen nose. English Nature, then the Nature Conservancy Council,
completed a first survey of otters in the late 1970s and has published the
results of a repeat which was carried out ten years later.
These indicate that, since the guilty pesticides have fallen from use and
hunting has been stopped, otters are on the increase, but only in those
areas where they were strong before, in the far west and the far north of
England.
Otters are spreading from these strongholds as their population grows to
occupy new rivers. But where they have been severely reduced or are absent,
things continue to look grim. At best they are doing no more than hold their
own on the Somerset Levels and in East Anglia.
There is a great swathe running through the whole of central England to the
south coast from which otters are entirely absent. The problem is that,
since they became scarce, habitat changes have taken place both in terms of
'improvements' to waterways and recreational pressures.
Even if otters increased in numbers sufficiently to recolonise this chunk of
England, many of the rivers where they once lived are now entirely
unsuitable for them.
Fortunately, in both Scotland and Wales, they are considerably more numerous
and the islands and lochs on the west coast of Scotland are reputed to have
signs of otters at every 100 metres on average. It is here, at Kylerhea on
the Isle of Skye, that the Forestry Commission has established a centre and
hide.
For anyone prepared to spend an hour or so there, the chances of seeing an
otter are high. In contrast you could keep a look out for a lifetime on an
English river without seeing a single one.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Gardening (A Taste of Chelsea): Chance for a prize
composition - As English gardeners gear up for one of the highlights of
their year, the Chelsea flower show, the Weekend FT, in conjunction with
Oxford College of Garden Design, offers all-comers a garden challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FREE PLACE at the Oxford College of Garden Design's summer course is being
offered to the winner of our Composer's Courtyard Garden competition.
Valued at Pounds 1692 (Pounds 1440 plus VAT), the garden design course takes
place from July 19 to August 12 at Wolfson College in Oxford. Numbers are
limited to 16 to ensure that all students receive plenty of individual
attention from principal Duncan Heather, one of Britain's foremost garden
designers, and his team of lecturers.
This and a one-year part-time course which starts in September are being
offered for the first time by the Oxford College of Garden Design.
The theme of the competition is a Composer's Courtyard Garden. The garden
should reflect a well-known composer's personality or a particular piece of
music. For example, a water garden might be a celebration of Handel's Water
Music, while a theatrical garden could be inspired by Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Entrants are asked to design a south facing courtyard garden measuring 15m x
5m with a fertile clay soil. The garden is surrounded by a 6 ft brick wall
and is entirely laid to lawn.
The plan should be submitted on a sheet of paper no larger than A3 and drawn
to a scale of 1:50 (2cm = 1m). It should show the two dimensional layout of
the garden to include features such as paving, ponds, pergolas, tree
positions, planting beds, seats etc. The plan should be accompanied by a
200-word description of the garden. A detailed planting plan is not
required. Applications should be received by June 18 this year.
Details about the Oxford College of Garden Design are available from 34
Kings Road, Henley-on-Thames, Oxon RG9 2DG. Tel: 0491-411161.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Gardening (A Taste of Chelsea): Rhubarb, a wonder drug -
Rhubarb has found at its niche at Chelsea this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHUBARB, laxative of kings and terror of school-children, has a stand to
itself at this year's Chelsea Flower Show.
'The Story of Rhubarb' is a display mounted by Harlow Carr Botanical Gardens
of Harrogate in Yorkshire, headquarters of the Northern Horticultural
Society. You will spot the rhubarbs in the virtuous but dowdy educational
section of the Grand Marquee.
I like the humble, edible rhubarb, its stature and the way its leaves burst
rudely from the earth in spring. I like to eat it, baked in the oven with
orange or ginger. But the fascination of the rheum family was only revealed
to me by an enthralling book published last year; Rhubarb, The Wondrous Drug
by Clifford M. Foust (Princeton University Press; 371 pages,Pounds 27.50).
Foust chronicles the west's perplexed efforts to get to the bottom of
rhubarb - or perhaps one should say, to let rhubarb get to its bottom. In
the 1st century AD Dioscorides, father of pharmacology, prescribed dried
rhubarb for all manner of conditions, from flatulence to poisonous animal
bites. However, to the Romans and to the middle ages, rhubarb (Rha ponticum
or Rhabarbarum) was known only as a costly drug brought from the east.
For centuries, European explorers in the Far East and Central Asia sought
the True Rhubarb as if it were the holy grail. Only rhubarb was so gently
purgative, cleansing the body's evil humours without the violent griping
inflicted by senna or hellebore. Elizabethan physicians were so fascinated
by rhubarb's properties that they even recommended eating the leaf, which
can be highly poisonous.
Even once rhubarbs were growing in Britain, problems were rife. None of the
several species produced results comparable to the wonder drug from the
east, a cause of consternation and much experimenting by apothecaries and
botanists. Meanwhile, the imported species hybridised away, producing
varieties which a few people discovered was quite palatable - so long as one
could afford the sugar.
The last chapter of Foust's splendid book describes how a few, highly
persistent British market gardeners in the early 19th century managed to
stimulate a culinary craze for rhubarb which swept the country and even
spread to the US and Australia. In 1815, after workmen digging a ditch at
Chelsea Physic Garden accidentally buried some rhubarb, the technique was
discovered of forcing it for consumption in early spring.
The West Riding of Yorkshire, with its cold winters, high rainfall, the
abundant night soil from its cities, and wool shoddy from the mills, became
the world's major rhubarb-growing region. It remains so to this day,
although nowhere else is particularly interested in disputing the title.
The last two decades have seen commercial rhubarb growing decline
everywhere. According to Christopher Margrave, curator of Harlow Carr, only
a handful of Yorkshire growers still uses the traditional forcing-sheds.
Part of the display will be a mock-up of a forcing shed with a grower
harvesting thin pink stalks by candlelight. The aim is to evoke the heyday
of West Riding's rhubarb, when the 'Rhubarb Special' ran through the dawn to
bring Londoners the ingredients for crumbles, tarts and wine.
Even a generation ago, a British or American garden without a rhubarb patch
would have been unthinkable. But rhubarb is also under something of a cloud
with amateur gardeners. The plant is perhaps almost too easy to grow. In the
1990s, the ambitious amateur gardener is more likely to want to produce a
few tasteless Kiwi fruit off the garage wall than to consume mountains of
rhubarb.
And yet, well cooked rhubarb is delicious. Margrave does not share my taste
for open-ground rhubarb. However, the slender pink petioles of forced
rhubarb sends him into transports of delight. It cleans the palate, he
observes, and makes the perfect between-course sorbet for the gourmet's
table.
Margrave points out that garden-centres have played their part in rhubarb's
declining popularity with a new generation of gardeners. An average garden
centre is likely not to stock rhubarb at all, and if it does so it will be
an unlabelled variety. The one he recommends is Cawood Delight, which will
be on the Chelsea stand. Its sticks retain their brilliant red even after
they are cooked.
Other varieties Margrave says deserve to be widely available are The Sutton,
Timperley Early, Prince Albert, and its slightly later partner Victoria.
There are also varieties which taste of cherries, greengages, blackcurrants,
and apples - or so it is claimed.
Sadly, the rhubarb's elephantine leaves mean there will probably be room for
only two culinary varieties on the Chelsea stand, and in all only six
members of the Rheum family. And yet Harlow Carr holds the national rhubarb
collection of over 150 varieties] Still more frustrating, Harlow Carr's
Plant Centre does not sell rhubarb - surely this is should be put right?
Margrave recommends John Tweedie of Maryfield Road Nursery, Maryfield,
Terregles, Dumfriesshire who stocks 15 varieties; send a SAE for a list.
The fortunes of rhubarb may yet revive. As the admirable Foust points out,
rhubarb is rich in vitamin C and non-fattening (he forgets about the sugar).
Rhubarb keeps you more regular than a barrel of breakfast bran. The
Mediterranean world, which has never fallen for rhubarb, needs to be
introduced to a delicacy as thoroughly British as pork pies and smoked
salmon. Just possibly, the rhubarb renaissance may have already started in
the US. Since 1983, an annual Festival of Rhubarb has been held at a hamlet
in Philadelphia called Intercourse.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Gardening (A Taste of Chelsea): The agony aunts of gardening
lore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS EVERY regular visitor to the Chelsea Flower Show knows, it is the people
who matter quite as much as the plants they exhibit.
There stand the men and women who know the answers - whether daffodil-leaves
should be tied in a knot, why your auriculas never germinated, why last
summer's tomatoes had black blotches. At other flower-shows, exhibitors are
too busy selling stuff to answer questions. At Chelsea, you fix the poor
devils with a gimlet eye and they have no place to hide.
Exhibitors have ways of evading interrogation. They spend a lot of time
fussing around the stand, squirting the roses and replenishing catalogues.
Language, too, can be a problem. Last year, my most urgent question was
about tulip fire. Does it persist in the soil? But the tulip-exhibitors were
dour Dutchmen and as soon as I waylaid them, each became resolutely
monoglot.
This year, I would find an answer. A section of the Great Marquee is
virtually a clinic for gardeners' problems. The Educational and Science
section is not glamorous; many exhibits are merely display panels and a few
plants. Nonetheless, knowing gardeners queue up for advice, often with bags
and matchboxes of unsavoury items.
For sick lawns, there is the Institute of Groundsmanship (0903-312511);
environmentally friendly ways with greenfly, the Henry Doubleday Research
Association (0203-303517); tree-problems, the Arboricultural Association;
(0794-68717). A sign of the times, the Metropolitan Police will be advising
on chaining down your statues and yuccas.
Among the agony aunts will be Dr Roland Fox of the School of Plant Sciences
at Reading University, known worldwide for its horticultural expertise. This
year's melancholy display, 'Diseases in the Garden', is also advertising
Reading's new BSc degree in crop protection as well as short courses on the
diagnosis of plant disease (0734-318708).
The exhibit itself is not about curing diseases but the symptoms which
reveal that 'the invisible worm' is in the bed. Ghastly photographs
illustrate scabs, lesions, cankers, blights, and moulds, all symptoms of
what the experts call necrosis and we call a dead plant. A close up of
carrot with black bodies, Sclerotimia sclerotorum, is as nasty as it sounds.
The vocabulary of the plant pathologist is strangely poetic. Fungi and
bacteria reveal themselves by streaks, stripes, fire, scald, scorch,
die-back, blotches, mummification, exuding, and bleeding. You want to know
what happens when your pears get scab? 'Conidia of the fungus form under the
cuticles then burst through to sporulate.' If the leaves of a plant grow
downwards, it has epinasty due to ethylene caused by wilts or canker.
Scabby potatoes and crooked cactuses will make this Chelsea's first exhibit
of (knowingly) diseased plants. However, some of these plants are valued for
their viruses. If it were not for arabis mosaic virus which dwarfs its
hosts, all kitchen-garden rhubarb would loom 6 ft tall.
The netted gold leaves on the honeysuckle, Lonicera japonica var
aureoreticulata, are due to a virus. It is not readily transmissible, which
is why the variegated form is tricky to propagate.
Virus has caused the variegations on clover, geraniums, abutilon, and a fine
golden-veined canna peculiar to Reading's collection. A silver variegated
pot of that awful pest, Mind Your Own Business, may have virus but could be
genetic.
If this sounds a trifle academic, the Reading team will be there to answer
questions. Why does my almond have Peach Leaf Curl despite being sprayed?
Answer, because England is cold, and Bordeaux Mixture is not half as
effective as lime sulphur which is listed in my old gardening books, but can
be the devil to find.
Dr Fox is used to gardeners weeping as they describe sudden death of trees
and shrubs. Often, honey fungus is often the cause. Disease, it is well
known, is a matter of social class and as Fox puts it, 'honey fungus is the
major disease of RHS members.' Look for white rot, like very old
matchsticks, and for black 'bootlaces'.
However, the good news is that the Reading team have found a 'very
effective' preventative for honey fungus which it is developing for the
market with Zeneca. Fox will not be drawn on the date of release, but it
should be with us in the next few years.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Property: When history palls, there are always pork pies -
Gerald Cadogan finds plenty to interest potential purchasers in the east
Midlands of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINCOLN Cathedral is at the heart of the east Midlands. Its vast bulk
dominates the town and its rich variety of stonework recalls that it used to
control a great swathe of England, when its diocese stretched from the
Humber to the Thames at Oxford. This majestic building from the late 12th
and early 13th centuries, conceived on a scale that seems more at home in
France, is rare in having had few changes since St Hugh started to rebuild
it in 1186. Lincolnshire prospered in the Middle Ages, as its many grand
village churches show.
The county's decline reached a trough in the 1930s when some landlords
actually paid tenant farmers to continue to work the land. But the second
world war changed that. While bombers took off from Lincolnshire's many
airfields - the cathedral has a sobering monument to the great number of
fliers who never returned - its fertile land showed at last what it could
produce. And farming still prospers.
Church crawling is one delight of living in the east Midlands, partly to
identify the stones the builders used. Ketton and Clipsham stone were
favourites, and Collyweston produces the best roughly-slivered stone tiles.
Savills is selling the 17th century, Grade II Manor House in Clipsham for
around Pounds 325,000.
But Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire are
not just for antiquarian aesthetes. Go to Leicestershire to hunt or taste
pork pies in Melton Mowbray. Nottingham has its Chinese restaurants and the
southern branch of Scotland's Loch Fyne oyster bar. And in Northampton, home
of the British shoe industry, outlets near the factories sell 'seconds' of
the footwear destined for the shops of Jermyn Street in London's West End.
The defects are hard to spot and the saving is large.
The price rises for season tickets by train to London have hit commuters who
came into south Lincolnshire in the 1980s, attracted by cheap houses. But
getting north and south is quick on the M1 and A1 roads, and very quick by
train from Peterborough or Grantham.
House prices are around 40 per cent down on the boom years. Nicholas
Leeming, of Humberts, suggests the county is turning back on itself. Now
that 400-500 people a day - the peak a few years ago - are no longer
commuting from Grantham, there are seats on the London trains.
The steady shrinking of the fishing industry has hurt north-east
Lincolnshire. Across the Humber, Hull hardly knew there was a 1980s boom in
house prices. But, as they scarcely went up, so they have scarcely fallen.
There is a shortage of houses of rectory/farmhouse size (unlike the south of
England and the West Country), probably because big landlords still own much
of the land. The area of Nottinghamshire known as the Dukeries (parts of
Sherwood Forest, of Robin Hood fame, that became ducal property with the
enclosures) speaks for itself. Lincolnshire boasts Belvoir Castle and
Burghley House - Britain's riposte to Chambord in France - while northern
Northamptonshire has Rockingham Castle, Deene Park and Boughton House, the
Duke of Buccleuch's French chateau in the Midlands.
In the medium range, a few more houses are appearing because the diocese of
Lincoln is still selling rectories out of church domain - which will qualify
for a unique exemption from stamp duty if sold under the Parsonages Measure
1938. Jas Brown has on its books the Rectory at Scotter, between Scunthorpe
and Gainsborough, with 1.75 acres for around Pounds 175,000 (note, however,
that the new rectory will be going up next door); and the Rectory at
Woolsthorpe, west of Grantham, with a splendid view over the Vale of Belvoir
to Belvoir Castle, for around Pounds 225,000. The same firm (and Strutt &amp;
Parker) is selling Barkston Grange, five miles from Grantham. This is a
farmhouse with outbuildings, swimming pool, tennis court and 4.3 acres for
Pounds 280,000 - much cheaper than such a property would cost in
Gloucestershire. Yet, it is just a few minutes over an hour to London by
rail.
For Pounds 5,000 less, William H. Brown offers the early-17th century brick
Cosby House (but without the barn and stables, although they could be
included) in Cosby, a few miles south-west of Leicester and well-placed for
the M1 and M69; and, for Pounds 105,000 less, Tudor Mews in Cosby, three
cottages made into a house of substance.
In Billesdon, between Leicester and Uppingham, Brown offers The Old
Greyhound, a converted pub said to stand on the site of a Roman building,
for Pounds 145,000. The agent, faithful to the new Property Misdescriptions
Act, writes that this has not been verified. To do so would mean a dig. A
larger country house new on the market shows what good value waits in
Lincolnshire. Thorpe Hall at Louth, on the edge of Tennyson's country of the
Lincolnshire Wolds, was begun in 1584 for John Bolle, knighted in 1596 for
his exploits fighting at Cadiz. In Spain, he fell for a Spanish woman whose
ghost, the Green Lady, is said to haunt the house.
In 1906, Gertrude Jekyll planned the gardens and park, so the spirit of
romanticism is alive. Savills is selling the house for around Pounds
650,000. Apart from its grounds and cottages, you get a study with a stained
glass window showing the ballad of 'The Spanish Lady's Love for an
Englishman,' and perpetual rights to sole use of the Thorpe Hall pew in the
local church.
Hilton House, near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, also has fine gardens and a
wealth of topiary, and is on sale for only the second time since it was
built in the 18th century - as a Georgian house on the older plan of an E
with the middle bar cut out. An underground passage, letting servants go
from one end of the house to the other, will be an adventure playground for
children. Bidwells offers it for around Pounds 500,000.
Usselby Hall, near Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, is a brick Georgian house
that belonged to Tennyson's grandfather (from Savills, around Pounds
385,000). The firm's Cambridge branch is selling the imposing Edwardian
Tudoresque Houghton Manor near Huntingdon, complete with a baronial dining
hall. This comfortable pastiche costs around Pounds 325,000.
In Oakham, Rutland, the Grade II Yule House is probably the best in town;
the judge used to stay there for Assizes. Built in 1700, it has a squash
court and listed dovecote; Carter Jonas offers it at Pounds 395,000. Two
essence-of-rural-England thatched cottages from the same agent are Walnut
House in Ufford, near Stamford (Pounds 195,000), and Ivy Cottage in Sawtry,
near Huntingdon (Pounds 125,000). Carter Jonas also has Yew Tree House in
Molesworth, near Thrapston, a thatched farmhouse for Pounds 230,000. East of
Northampton, Jackson-Stops is selling 8 Bell End in Wollaston for just
Pounds 85,000.
New on the market is Uffington Manor, near Stamford, from Humberts for
Pounds 250,000-Pounds 275,000. With views across the valley to Burghley, the
manor is next to the ruined site of the big 1670s house which burnt down at
the beginning of this century. Its yew walk is now in the manor garden, as
is a dog cemetery where Jockie is buried with the epitaph: 'The rich man's
guardian, and the poor man's friend; the only creature faithful to the end.'
Doggerel for toffs.
Also newly for sale is a Grade I manor rich in history near Oundle. Lyveden
Old Bield belonged to the family of Sir Thomas Tresham, an eccentric Tudor
symbolist who turned Roman Catholic in 1580 and so went straight to the
Fleet prison.
When not in jail, he started building the nearby New Bield, with a cruciform
design honouring the Cross and Passion. Now a picturesque ruin owned by the
National Trust, it is well worth a visit.
So, also, is his Triangular Lodge at Rushton, the family's main seat, which
honours the Trinity. Sir Thomas never finished the New Bield as he died in
1605 (as did his son, Francis, in the Tower of London, where he had gone for
taking part in the Gunpowder Plot).
The Old Bield, with a guide price of Pounds 475,000, comes from Savills in
Stamford. But you get only the back stairs for your money; the main
staircase went to the United States in the 1920s.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Travel Focus (Touring Europe): Just one vaporetto . . . -
The grace and charm of the Veneto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME GILDED cages are hard to escape, even in the sultry, seething months of
high summer. Could there be a more blissful way to start the day than to be
slowly awakened by the rhythmic slop of water against moored gondolas, the
cries of gondolieri - even the grinding gears of a vaporetto? To muffle up
in a thick bathrobe and linger over breakfast on a fifth-floor balcony
surveying the Grand Canal as it stirs into life in the milky, early morning
light?
The idle are amply rewarded by the industry of others. Chugging motorboats,
the life-blood of Venice, criss-cross the Grand Canal. A maritime
greengrocer pulls in at the jetty below. After perfunctory negotiation, out
come boxes of neatly packed pale verdura, ranks of gleaming peppers,
aubergines, lemons, plums. Look up from this lush bird's-eye view and there
are the gigantic snail volutes of the church of Santa Maria della Salute
staring you in the eye.
Tempting though it might be to linger, the time has come to do what
privileged Venetians have done for half a millennium: exchange their
Venetian palazzo for a Veneto villa.
The Veneto is the other face of the Most Serene Republic. Mercifully, the
hordes who pound Venice ever further into her patient watery grave rarely
make time to explore the blue distant landscapes and fortified hill-towns
that are depicted in their favourite altarpieces by Lotto and Giovanni
Bellini.
Stand in the first-floor salon of the Villa Barbaro at Maser, now an hour or
so's drive from Venice, and you understand the point at once. The villa was
built as a summer retreat for two Venetian brothers around 1557-58 by Andrea
Palladio. He gave them living quarters in separate wings which meet in a
suite of airy reception rooms frescoed by Veronese. With the balcony doors
open and the blinds up, light floods in and enlivens every square inch. In
contrast, even on the brightest day Venetian palaces seem cavernous and
gloomy.
From the balcony, the eye follows the sweep of the formal garden and soars
towards the open fields beyond. Veronese extends that landscape indoors,
confecting romantic vistas beyond trompe l'oeil marble balustrades and
rustic scenes reflecting the four seasons.
Allegorical figures celebrate the pleasures of music. Vines garland the
ceiling. The mood is light-hearted, the visual puns legion. Dogs peek around
make-believe columns. Shoes and a brush seem to lie discarded on a marble
ledge. A huntsman and his hounds burst through an imaginary door. A fair
gentlewoman in pale silks, her maid and lapdog, look down from the faux
balcony above.
At Maser, the aristocratic and learned Barbaro brothers played (seriously)
the gentleman farmer. The rooms behind the long, ochre arcades at the
ground-floor level of each wing housed farm equipment, labourers and
animals. The farm provided the brothers with welcome additional income but
the villa is, first and foremost, a man-made Arcadia, an evocation of an
unreal world, informed by an essentially urban, sentimental view of the
countryside.
Our palazzo in Venice, the stately ocean-linerish Hotel Bauer Grunwald, had
been relinquished for a 16th century villa at Asolo that was once home to
Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. As the Hotel Villa Cipriani it is
both haven and perfect base for exploring the villas of the Veneto - and
Palladian Vicenza - and the small towns that fringe the luxuriant foothills
of the Monte Grappa.
Asolo may have become self-conscious about its charm and its famous
residents (from the Brownings and Eleanora Duse to Freya Stark), but some
500 years after the Venetian republic ceded it to Caterina Cornaro, Queen of
Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia - in return for Cyprus  - the town retains
something of the spirit of her cultivated humanist court.
Miraculously, Lorenzo Lotto's Madonna in Glory is still to be found in
Asolo's small cathedral. Similarly, Conegliano boasts a fine altarpiece by
Cima, Vittorio Veneto an even more impressive Previtali. Castelfranco has
even succeeded in hanging on to its Giorgione altarpiece, albeit shown
behind bars.
The museum at Bassano del Grappa is crammed with works by generations of the
da Ponte family, notably Jacopo, who more or less established the genre of
the pastoral landscape. It is an extraordinarily handsome town, graced with
a breathtaking site, sharp mountain air, a famous covered bridge designed by
Palladio - and equally celebrated grappa.
An almost surreal contrast to the gentle, accommodating landscape around
Asolo is provided at Possagno where the great neo-classical sculptor Antonio
Canova built a gipsoteca, or studio, behind his family home and a massive,
Doric-columned marble temple that acts both as mausoleum and parish church.
The gipsoteca contains the models and plaster casts of nearly all his
inventions, some camp, some astoundingly erotic, but most faintly ridiculous
to modern sensibilities. In their austerely classical, all-white interior,
the life-size icing-sugar heroes, seated matrons and simpering nudes sit
like props awaiting curtain-up on a long-unfashionable play.
The region's rolling olive- and cypress-clad hillsides have often been
likened to Tuscany. Perhaps that partly explains the English love affair
with the Veneto. One crucial distinction is that the food - and the wines -
here are far, far better. For foodies with long pockets there is Da Lino at
Solighetto. For fungophiles, a short season in September offers seventh
heaven, with the local delicacies of finferli and chiodini, or 'little
nails.'
To acclimatise to the idea of returning to the big city, take an hour or two
to inspect Treviso. Sample its bitter red chicory, the variegated, wild
radicchio rosso, and the chapter house of the monastery of San Niccolo
where, in his frescoes of 1351, Tommaso da Modena gave us our earliest
surviving representation of someone wearing spectacles.
Susan Moore travelled to Venice and returned from Treviso with Italian
Escapades, which offers holidays to Italian cities and resorts tailor-made
at most price levels. Short breaks in Venice start at Pounds 210 per person.
Italian Escapades: 227 Shepherds Bush Road, London W6 7AS, tel:
081-748-2661. The Hotel Bauer Grunwald can be booked through Italian
Escapades, or tel: 041-5207022.
Reservations for the Hotel Villa Cipriani at Asolo (tel: 0432-55444) can be
made through the Ciga office in London, tel: 071-930-4147, freephone
0800-289234. A double room costs L300,000 per night, with a special weekend

FT  22 MAY 93 / Travel Focus (Touring Europe): Berlin, a city of the fourth
dimension - Nigel Andrews advises a walk along the Ku'damm to let the wind
ruffle your hair and your sense of history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Do you know the works of modern German philosophy?'
'Er, only in English.'
'Well, there it is all explained, ja? You understand?'
WELL, SORT of. The taxi-driver was talking to me about metaphysics on the
way from Tegel Airport. He seemed to be driving all over Berlin - I had to
keep saying 'left]', 'right]' or 'mind that child]' - and he was propounding
this strange theory. It was that Berlin is not a place but an agglomeration
of times. For four decades, he explained, Berlin was a western European city
in an eastern European country.
Since this is manifestly impossible (he argued), the place cannot exist as a
three-dimensional geographical reality. Therefore, Berlin must live in the
fourth dimension where time alone is relevant.
I suspect he is right. Many people to whom I mention this argument are
unconvinced. But they have not seen what I have seen: a wall known to be
impregnable having holes punched in it by history, through which East German
guards poked friendly faces back in February 1990; a city full of clocks
that failed to keep time because eastern-western electricity systems could
not mesh (February 1993). And a town centre - we speak of what used to be
West Berlin - that mixes time-zones with ingenious perversity.
Let us sketch this city centre, since it is one of the most chaotically
splendid in Europe. In recent years West Berlin has been upstaged as a
curiosity-zone by the previously cloaked mysteries of East Berlin. But -
awful truth - once the cloak is off, East Berlin stands revealed as a fairly
charisma-free place: a social and visual wasteland only beginning to recover
from decades of institutionalised deprivation.
West Berlin has a wild charm and a concertina'd sense of history. The centre
is its masterpiece and deserves a 360-degree pan. Over there is the famous
Berlin Zoo, with its Japanese archway and frieze-adorned aquarium wall
fronting the street. Inside, animals from the dawn of time disport. My
favourite view - as a longtime Berlin visitor for the annual film festival -
is from the Festival Centre windows, which abut the zoo: crows caw and wheel
while rude-bottomed Barbary apes gambol over frosty black rocks.
Opposite the atavistic is the (almost) modern. The EuropaCenter is a once
state-of-the-art shopping mall topped by a slow-twirling Mercedes sign and
boasting, among other things, a terraced jungly cafe, a rooftop observation
platform, a medley of glossy eateries and a towering water clock. In this
still chic labyrinth the primitive and modern jostle in a pleasant
consumerist frenzy.
Then, plonk in the centre of the city's centre, as if pulled both ways by
the epochal tug of war around it, is the Gedachtniskirche (Memorial Church).
One blasted, blackened Gothic spire stands next to a tall, boxy tower like
an overgrown stereo speaker. This architectural ensemble symbolises the old
Berlin that survived Hitler jostling with the new Berlin that raises one
mellifluously defiant finger to his horrid ghost.
At least I think that is what it symbolises. But here is West Berlin's
appeal. You are given the riot of raw data, the conflicting slices of time,
and you decide what it all means. Take the famous Kurfurstendamm, which
spokes out mile on mile from the centre. Here you may sink mental dating
equipment into time's strata by merely looking at the buildings and people.
In the hotels and apartment buildings a Teutonic modernism wrestles with
rare glimpses of the unbombed old. Architecturally, Berlin is the face that
launched a thousand lifts: tiny bits of the old cafes, theatres and
movie-houses grin through the cosmetic surgery. And note the success with
which styles collide. The giant Wertheim department store, for instance, a
galleon of ribbed glass, jostles serenely with the oldy-worldy quaintness of
the Cafe Mohring.
In the people, the war of competing zeitgeists is more beguiling still. The
old lady with the fur coat and powdered cheekbones obviously lived through
the days of Dietrich. She is heading straight for Kranzler's and a cup of
chocolate with a sachertorte. The old man with the monocle, cane and
military tread may have fought for Hitler but now prefers to be associated
with the earlier Prussian heyday. Back then everyone looked like Fritz Lang
and could have had their portraits painted by Georg Grosz.
Then there are the middle-aged Berliners, careworn and self-effacing. These
men and women avoid your glances. They are the People Without A History, the
baby boomers born into the spiritual bust that was post-war Germany.
Finally, there are the young. Here is the most curious collision of all
between time-zones. The young in West Berlin used to be a paradigm of the
world's student population. Drawn to the city as a haven from the military
draft, they were prosperous youngsters dressing down to be radical. Long
shabby hair, long shabby coats, long shabby faces. Radical chic was the
tribute paid by capitalism, which had the freedom to play charades, to
Marxism, which didn't. Then, after the Wall fell in November 1989, in rushed
all the young East Berliners who were genuinely poor and wore authentically
shabby coats, hair, faces, etc. The young Westerners took one look, realised
the game was up and began dressing according to their incomes.
Since there is mostly one-way traffic today - day-tripping Berliners come
from East to West rather than vice versa - East Berlin has little of this
sense of multiple reality. You should visit the statutory landmarks, which
at least prove that the East has been through some of the same mainline
stations of progress and crisis as the West.
The Brandenburg Gate, with its chariot of destiny riding a slice of
neo-classical wedding cake; Unter Den Linden, slowly returning to
consumerist frenzy; the Fernsehturm (TV Tower), with its revolving
observation platform and its look of a giant needle that has swallowed a
sputnik.
But much of East Berlin - it takes years to recover from socialism - is
still a place of monochrome rhythms and urban anomie. Compare its centre,
Alexanderplatz, with that of West Berlin: dull, concrete vastness;
robot-spirited shoppers, and nearby a park, Marx-Engels Forum, whose
mathematical symmetries chill the soul. Karl and Friedrich themselves are
present, cast in bronze. Sensing that they are due for historical melt-down,
they stand dead still as if to avoid detection.
Returning to West Berlin is like blinking into the sun after hours in a
mineshaft. You do not need to visit museums or galleries here to know the
difference in cultural richness and traditions of freedom. All you need do
is walk along a busy street.
Make randomness your style. Go out of your hotel - I recommend, according to
your purse, the Am Zoo, the Savoy or (spoil yourself) the Kempinski - and
turn left or right. Pass the street busker with his marionette violinist
playing great cadenzas from Paganini. Throw an interested look at the man in
drag miming to Aida as it issues from his ghetto-blaster. Pause by the stall
selling communist-surplus Soviet Army caps with hammer-and-sickle badges.
Buy a cholesterol-intensive bockwurst mit brotchen - sausage with roll - at
the street-corner Imbiss snack van. (In the evening you will eat at
Florians, home of the New German cuisine, or more informally at the charming
all-wooden Zum Dortmunder, which resembles a Bavarian hunting lodge with
gamey food to match).
Then slip your moorings. Walk on down the Ku'damm as time's crosswinds
ruffle your hair and your sense of history.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Travel Focus (Touring Europe): Slow up, and drink at the
journey's end - How to take the wrinkles out of a touring holiday in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL, Motoring Correspondent

<TEXT>
FOR MOST people, touring in Europe starts with driving in France because
that is where all the best ferry routes go to. In fact, one doesn't really
need to go further than France because it is a super country to tour
provided you remember a few simple rules.
The first is to use the autoroute only for getting to the area where you are
going to enjoy your driving as well as the scenery, food and drink. Compared
with British motorways, French autoroutes - except for the main north-south
A1-A6 - are usually so uncrowded you wonder where all the other cars have
gone.
It may have something to do with the tolls. They are not cheap, and the
network of N and D roads (roughly equivalent to Britain's A and D roads) are
an agreeable slower alternative.
Paying tolls to use a motorway comes as a shock to many British drivers
accustomed only to the moderate charge made for using the Severn bridge or
Dartford tunnel. But most of Europe, except for the Low Countries and
Germany, has toll motorways. Switzerland imposes a one-off autoroute charge
at the frontier; Germany plans to do so next year. Make the most of them
while they are free.
The French autoroute restaurants are good. Try one of the l'Arche chain, but
not if several tourist coaches have just decanted their hungry hordes. A
thick, steaming slice of baked ham with Madeira sauce and a choice of
vegetables in a l'Arche will keep the wolf from the door for hours.
With a bottle of Badoit and coffee, it costs about Pounds 8. And an
agreeable four-course luncheon with a little wine and waiter service at a
French autoroute restaurant near Bourg-en-Bresse a few weeks ago cost under
Pounds 12.
A word about drink. The French take a relaxed view about having a glass or
two (not more) of wine and then continuing your autoroute journey, although
you cannot have an alcoholic drink at all unless you have a hot meal.
But do not even think about going over the top. The penalties for drink
driving all over Europe are, quite properly, at least as severe as they are
in Britain. Anyway, the best time for serious eating and drinking is at the
end of the day, not in the middle of it.
Germany's autobahnen are still free of a speed limit though a 130 kph (81
mph) maximum is recommended. That is the legal limit on French autoroutes.
It is lower in other European countries - as low as 90 kph in Norway. Do not
be tempted by a lightly-trafficked motorway (unless it be an autobahn) to
put your foot down and see what the car will do. Getting nicked for speeding
in Europe is more expensive than in Britain and can be time consuming.
In France the drill, according to people who have been caught, goes like
this. You are radar-ed, stopped, automatically breathalysed and then taken
to one of those police vans that look like corrugated iron chicken houses.
You are questioned at length ('and where was your maternal grandmother born,
monsieur?') by a policeman who bangs it all down slowly with two fingers on
an antique typewriter. This takes at least half-an-hour, more if you are one
of several offenders. Then you are relieved of anything up to Pounds 100 in
cash.
Credit cards will not do nicely for French speeding penalties, though they
will for autoroute tolls and virtually everything else in France. If you are
going to speed, keep a wad of money under the carpet. You will need it.
Should you be speeding on a continental motorway or normal road and drivers
coming toward you flash their lights, lift your foot off the pedal at once.
There are police about. Off the motorways, most speed traps are where you
enter or leave towns and villages or on narrow, straight country roads.
But why speed at all? You are on a touring holiday. Slow down. The idea is
for you and your passengers to have a nice, relaxing time.
Germany built its first autobahns before the first world war, and some are
still in use, like the awful two-lane stretch going east from Aachen toward
Cologne. It became so crowded that a 100 kph limit was imposed.
Some of Italy's oldest autostrade are not much better. Now, more than 30
years on, almost the only popular touring area in France without an
autoroute pointing at its heart is the Dordogne. And, unless you are heading
for Paris, you no longer have to face its dreaded boulevard peripherique.
This mini-M25 is inhabited by demented drivers and even madder
motor-cyclists.
Avoid it by going east from Calais - the best point of entry from the UK by
P&amp;O or Stena Sealink super-ferry from Dover - on the A26 autoroute.
Starting at Calais docks, the A26 opens the door to eastern and southern
France and beyond. At Reims, an easy two-and-a-half hours from Calais, you
can continue to Metz and southern Germany or head south for Troyes and
Dijon.
From Macon (about an hour further on from Dijon) there are autoroute
branches to Geneva and Italy. Continue south from Macon and you by-pass Lyon
en route for the Mediterranean coast.
For a great touring holiday, there is no need to go further than France It
is a big and thinly populated country in which you can find every kind of
scenery as well as the best in wines and food. Leave the main N-roads and
follow the D-roads - the most important ones are marked in yellow, the
lesser ones in white - in Michelin's invaluable large-scale motoring atlas
of France. You will have the freedom of a countryside little touched by
time, where the villages are not filling up with retired townies making
trouble with the locals about their cocks crowing, cows lowing and pigs
smelling.
Where to stay? I would not think of leaving home for France without my
Michelin Red Guide, which is worth its Pounds 12.50 for the town plans, let
alone the restaurants and hotels. Michelin is for referring to, while French
Leave Encore by Richard Binns (Pounds 9.99) is good bedside reading - an
idiosyncratic treatise on the habits, food, drink and sights of rural France
as well as a useful source of places in which to stay and eat.
A final thought. A car that packs up on the other side of the Channel can
make one feel totally helpless. If yours is coming up for a service, get it
done before you go. Remember that an insurance Green Card is still needed
for full accident cover. Think, too, about subscribing to a breakdown
recovery scheme like those run by the AA and RAC, Mondial, Europ-Assistance
and similar organisations with English-speaking helplines. It is much easier
than trying to explain to a garageman in fractured French or non-existent
German that you heard this funny noise and suddenly the car would not go any
more.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Travel Focus (Touring Europe): Ferry companies sharpen their
act - The battle for a share of the cross-Channel travel market is hotting
up / Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST WHEN you thought it was safe to go under the water through the Channel
tunnel to France, that is - Jodie Foster has bitten back. The American film
actress is said to be starring in a forthcoming tunnel disaster movie which
will depict teeth-clenching scenes of terror and torment beneath the murky
water. Eurotunnel is understandably miffed.
But ferry companies, even before this Hollywood godsend, were already busy
fending off the tunnel's potential challenge with faster and spruced-up
services. Prices, too, have been sharpened. Such scrapping for market share
has generally spelt good news for the Channel-hopping motorist.
'If you go back 10 years,' says Ian Todd, head of information at P &amp; O
European Ferries, 'crossing the Channel was something to be endured rather
than enjoyed.' But in the past few years, P &amp; O has invested Pounds 400m -
in its Dover operations alone - on new ships, staff training and computer
ticketing. Its competitors have done likewise.
The jumbo ferries born of such investment are a far cry from the dowdy ships
of yesteryear. They boast silver-service restaurants (as well as
cafeterias), video lounges, children's play areas and duty-free shopping
'malls' large enough to swallow your entire holiday allowance before your
tyres hit the Paris peripherique.
Some have club lounges which, for an extra Pounds 5 or so, offer steward
service, fax machines, complimentary refreshments and newspapers.
Ferries are also straining to compete with the tunnel for speed. On the
Dover-Calais route, companies claim a motorway-to-motorway time of 100
minutes, compared with Eurotunnel's projected 60 minutes. Check-in times
have been cut - from an hour to 20 minutes - largely through computerised
ticketing. Improved operations at Dover harbour and relaxation of customs
checks have also helped.
P &amp; O hopes to save further time with the introduction of cameras and
computer-readable labels attached to car windscreens. These will enable
vehicles to drive straight on to ferries without queuing.
From Dover, P &amp; O runs ferries every 45 minutes, and Stena Sealink hourly -
a shuttle service designed to compete with Eurotunnel's planned four
departures an hour.
From June 21, when SeaCat (55-minute crossings) rejoins Hoverspeed's two
Hovercraft (35 minutes) on the Dover-Calais route, there will be a further
18 departures to choose from.
With cross-Channel traffic booming (P &amp; O alone carried 13.2m passengers and
2.2m cars last year), ferry companies are not savaging prices. But, as one
company spokesman said of the run-up to the tunnel-ferry face-off: 'Although
it's not a war yet, the battle lines are being drawn up.'
Even at peak season, a standard Dover-Calais return for a car and five
passengers can be as little as Pounds 135, admittedly at highly unsocial
hours. There are often discounted special offers available through
newspapers or motoring organisations. Sally Line, which operates from
Ramsgate to Dunkerque, is particularly cheap with fares ranging from Pounds
59-Pounds 234.
Motorists not attempting to beat the tunnel for speed might try the
Folkstone-Boulogne Ferry Company which is reviving the Boulogne route
recently abandoned by larger rivals. The aim, according to joint managing
director Ken Faulkner, is to hark back to the leisurely style and service of
a bygone era in an age of what he calls 'floating shopping arcades.'
The company is spending Pounds 250,000 on refurbishing a chartered Isle of
Man ferry which will have an 'old worldy feel' replete with enclosed teak
promenade and lounge chairs. Faulkner promises steward service, free
refreshments and live entertainment. Prices are likely to be 15 per cent
below those on the Dover-Calais route.
Reservations: Brittany Ferries (tel: 0705-827-701); Folkstone-Boulogne Ferry
Company (0303-246-880); Hoverspeed (0304-240-241); P &amp; O European Ferries
(0304-203-388); Sally Line (0843-595-522); Stena Sealink Line
(0233-647-047).

FT  22 MAY 93 / Fashion: Under cover, the Mac factor - Raincoats add
character to a wardrobe. So where do you shop if you want to put something
away for a rainy day?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the clothes in a man's wardrobe it is perhaps the old raincoat that
has the most character, loved like a friend, there when needed to protect
from the vicissitudes of the English weather.
Even when it is too old to be worn in polite society it can be relegated to
the hallstand - raincoats are rarely thrown away - ready to offer itself to
anyone needing to venture out when grey clouds threaten and dogs need to be
walked or roses pruned. The pockets usually hide some old treasure - a sweet
paper, a foreign coin, last year's withered conker.
Raincoats are the ultimate 'investment clothing', but wearing one in town
was once considered ungentlemanly - a gentleman had no need of a raincoat as
there was always an obliging manservant to hold an umbrella as he walked
from club or home to cab or carriage.
When the time comes to send your raincoat to the jumble sale, where do you
go to find a new one and what do you look for? Obviously it should be at
least showerproof, perhaps even fully waterproof, and lightweight  -
remember that temperatures often rise during rain. Choose one that covers
the knees for, although knee-length raincoats have a certain style, damp
knees do not.
Most raincoats are cut with a Raglan sleeve making them easy to put on over
a suit. A Raglan sleeve is one that goes over the shoulder in one piece
joining the coat at the collar seam.
There is no lack of choice and if you want to be overwhelmed by variety (and
choice) then visit Harrods, where you will find both the classics and the
fashionable, including some in unusual colours by Hugo Boss: viridian, red,
bright blue and a dullish lime green.
If you want to choose from a narrower range head straight for the classics
and visit either Burberry or Aquascutum. They both produce quality coats,
retaining the best of the old but introducing new styles, colours and
fabrics. Aquascutum's Nelson raincoat, available in beige, navy and light
brown, is near perfection. The only flaw is the collar, which I would prefer
slightly smaller. Another classic is the Felton Broc at Pounds 575. If your
budget does not run to that then visit Marks &amp; Spencer for a reasonably
priced alternative, which lacks none of the style or detailing of more
expensive clothes.
There is no reason why fashionable raincoats should be any less showerproof
than their classic counterpart and if you are given any lame excuses such
as: 'It's a fashion item' then my advice is to put your credit card back in
its wallet and leave the store]
Emporio Armani's grey proof raincoat seems more than capable of withstanding
any sudden downpour and Issey Miyake's at Pounds 365 (available at Issey
Miyake and Liberty) makes a perfect coat to travel with as it is so
lightweight.
Dries Van Noten, a Belgian designer, is one of the chosen at Joseph, his
linen-coated off-white raincoat, though perhaps not entirely practical for
commuting, will certainly make you the most stylish man in a spring shower.
No gentleman should be without an umbrella, although I am always suspicious
of the owners of collapsible ones, who self-righteously produce them from a
brief case during an unexpected shower while you get drenched.
You can buy an umbrella almost anywhere but why bother when you could buy
from James Smith, one of the most glorious shops in London. It was founded
in the 1830s and is still family-owned. It has preserved the past yet it
serves the present.
There seem to be scores of umbrellas to choose from and the charming staff
are only too willing to help you find the umbrella to suit your needs.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Fashion: Fashion workshop dates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ALL THE many readers who wrote and sent cheques to come along to our
Browns/FT Fashion Workshop might like to know that the response was huge -
so big in fact that we will be holding another, exactly one week later, on
the evening of Tuesday June 15.
The first 50 readers whose letters hit my desk on Monday morning will be
sent tickets for the evening of June 8. The next 50 will be invited to the
workshop on the following Tuesday. Those who cannot make that date will have
their cheques returned - except in the case of those many generous readers
who attached sweet notes saying that whether they were successful or not the
Leukaemia Research Fund could have the money.
We are sorry that we will have to disappoint some of you but those who
missed out this time might like to know that we will keep a note of their
names and addresses and they will be the first to be invited to an autumn
workshop.
If you want to join the FT Safari 'Among the Elephants' going to Kenya and
Tanzania with Iain and Oria Douglas-Hamilton you still have another week to
apply. Already letters and cheques are arriving daily but I promised last
week that I would allow a full fortnight before I did the draw in order that
readers abroad should not be disadvantaged.
To recap: The safari runs from September 3 to September 20, it takes in
trips to the major elephant areas such as Lake Manyara, Tsavo East National
Park and the borders of the Tarangire River. There ought to be a chance to
witness the wildebeest migration which normally takes place at this time of
year and three days will be spent in the Mahale Mountains on the eastern
shores of Lake Tanganyika where Roland Purcell, one of the world's leading
experts on primate behaviour, will accompany you to see the largest known
group of chimpanzees in the world.
The safari ends with three days in the Douglas-Hamilton's own home on the
shores of Lake Naivasha. The price is Pounds 5,499 per person and to secure
a firm place a deposit of Pounds 1,000 (made out to African Explorations,
which has orchestrated the safari, but sent to me here at the Weekend FT,
3rd Floor South, No 1 Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9 HL) is required.

FT  22 MAY 93 / How To Spend It: In the swim with a Tinsel Town look - Dip a
toe in the tide of fashion history when you buy this summer's beachwear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE swim suits for serious swimming (Speedo, for example, plain,
simple, classic and practical) and then there are swimsuits for posing round
pools sipping something long and cool that tinkles nicely - in which case
you need all the flattery that the designer can muster.
Ideally the craft of the old-fashioned corsetiere should be married to the
art of the designer and the technical know-how of the chemist. But, above
all, the hallmark of this year's swimsuits is glamour, glamour and yet more
glamour. Think Rita Hayworth, Esther Williams, Betty Grable and you will get
the idea. Hollywood is the image to go for, forget quiet good taste.
Most of the big designer names have caught the theme. Ruching, sweet-heart
necklines, criss-crossed straps, lots of uplift, clever ways with darts,
and, of course, such are the wonders of modern fibre technology, fabrics
that seem soft and feminine but offer lots of confidence-boosting support.
Sweet ginghams, chirpy polka dots, jaunty nautical stripes are the prints.
Sugary almond pinks, turquoise, lipstick red and, of course, the perennial
glamour colour, black, are the colours to go for.
For those who like established names Amanda Verdan, director of fashion
buying at Harvey Nichols of Knightsbridge, London SW1, has collected a
clutch of the smartest labels in the business.
Top of the scale for chic (and price - these all start at about Pounds 100 a
time) are La Perla (but these arrive in November for the start of the cruise
season and sell fast), Liza Bruce, Capucine Puerari (lots of under-wiring,
back-interest and big on 40s-style glamour). As for Moschino, he is still
the cheekiest designer around - this summer's hit is his white one-piece
with 'Swim Where?' printed in big black letters on the front.
Harvey Nichols is to open a brand new beachwear department in about a
fortnight in which all the big designer names will be gathered together but,
more usefully, so will everything else the beachbound shopper might require,
from a pair of espadrilles and a bathing hat to a capacious beach-bag or a
cover-up.
The hottest new designer, is Samantha de Teran, all of 26 and a graduate of
Trinity College, Cambridge, and St Martin's School of Art. Almost every chic
shop in and out of London has snapped up her range. Her swimsuits are
evocative of the old-fashioned bathers of the 1930s. They sport long-line
bodies with tiny shorts or flared skirts - much, much more flattering, in my
view, than those high-cut swimsuits which were alleged to make the legs look
longer but in reality did nothing so much as make them look vulgar.
There are no gimmicks, no florals, no frills or bows, just strikingly
simple, almost sculptural, swimsuits in the classy classic colours of cream,
navy, olive or black. They are beautifully made using, she wishes you to
know, an all-British fabric, a combination of nylon and Lycra, her trade
mark is the ladder-back cut-outs at the side, or back or round the neck.
What she aims to do, above all, is flatter.
Fenwick of Bond Street, London W1, has the full collection but they are
going fast. Most of the designs range between Pounds 70 and Pounds 100.
Other stockists include Way In, Harrods, London SW1; Lisa Stirling of
Manchester; La Jolie Madame of Edinburgh and Brown Thomas of Dublin.
More retro-styling comes from Slix which has homed in on the 1950s. Here we
have Grace (named after guess who?), scoop-necked, off-the-shoulder, with a
matching skirt. Essential accessories to complete the look are, of course,
the sunglasses and the chiffon scarf.
More nostalgia in the world of swimwear comes with the news that Jansen,
that old staple of school swimming teams, is these days ultra-chic. This
will not be news to readers of Hello] magazine. In January they were treated
to endless photographs of the Princess of Wales diving into the Caribbean in
one Jansen outfit after another.
Being just 5 ft 2 ins myself I have trouble empathising with the problems of
the willowy set. However it seems being tall is amazingly difficult - quite
apart from lining-up with men-friends (eye contact, I gather, is tricky
though as one who is very used to talking to armpits this seems a small
price to pay for long limbs) finding shoes and swimwear to fit seems to
present real difficulties.
Long Tall Sally, which, as its name implies, has long addressed the
particular needs of the tall set, has a selection of six swimsuits all of
which are cut to fit those with long bodies - which is not always just the
very tall, some shorter women have disproportion- ately long bodies.
The range is well-priced ranging from Pounds 16.95 to Pounds 29.95. They fit
sizes 12-20 and both the body and straps have been lengthened to suit the
taller frame. The best of the collection, in my view, are the black ruched
one-piece (Pounds 29.95) - very 1950s, with its sweetheart neckline and
ruching down the body - and the black or turquoise bubble one-piece (Pounds
19.95).
All the Long Tall Sally Shops sell them but they are also available by mail
order - telephone 0604-494349 for a free mail order brochure.

FT  22 MAY 93 / How To Spend It: Glittering art of patronage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARRARD, the Crown Jewellers, has decided to celebrate 150 years of being
jewellers to the royals in some style.
The theme it has chosen for its anniversary exhibition is one dear to my
heart - the vital importance of new patrons if designers are to flourish -
and to illustrate it it looks back historically to the connection between
design and patronage throughout the 20th century.
Part of the exhibition looks back on what has happened in the past, showing
the work of eminent designers such as Reginald Gleadowe, (one of the first
designers to explore ideas for pass-producing fine silver); Harold Stabler
(who revived the use of enamel as decoration); George Kruger Gray (who
designed the coinage of more than a dozen countries); Leslie Durbin (who
worked on the sword which Churchill presented to Stalin in 1943) and Alex
Styles (who designed and made a stunning tea and coffee set which was
presented to The Prince of Wales by the people of Caernarvon on the occasion
of his investiture as Prince of Wales).
There are pieces, too, by Charles Sykes, the creator of 'The Spirit of
Ecstasy' which is found perched on the top of the radiator of every
Rolls-Royce.
Some of the work looks as fresh as if it had been designed yesterday. A E
Harvey's sculpturally simple vase has that timeless look that is the mark of
all fine design while Gleadowe's more flowing, curving lines and distinctive
fluting show that when it comes to pleasing the eye there are no rules.
Though the past work is fascinating to look at Garrard's wanted to make sure
that the exhibition was not just an exercise in nostalgia and self-
congratulation, but an inspiration to patrons. For this reason there is a
big selection of silverware from distinguished contemporary designers all of
which is for sale.
The pieces range from a pair of stunning fluted silver beakers by Ian
Calvert (Pounds 500 each) and the condiment set (photographed below) (Pounds
750) to pieces costing thousands. But besides the diversity of objects -
small pocks or photograph frames, wine coolers, goblets and jugs to a pair
of five foot high silver gilt ginger jars - what is most fascinating for the
potential patron is the wide range of talent on show.
The work ranges from the rich enamelling of Fred Rich to the more
streamlined elegance of Robert May.
As Garrard points out, new designers need new patrons - if they do not have
patrons they will not survive. Much the most important aim of the exhibition
is to encourage individuals to think of themselves as patrons. Many people
who easily spend Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,000 on designer suits or
mass-produced objects could rewardingly spend the same sort of money on a
hand- crafted object of great beauty.
Many of the pieces are priced between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 2,000. Many of
us have occasions when we want to give presents that are beautiful, one-off
and personal - here is a chance to find the designer that could bring your
vision to life.
The exhibition is on until June 5 at Garrard, 112 Regent Street, London W1A
2JJ.

THERE are those for whom Gucci is still the cobbler par excellence. For them
Gucci in London has just received stocks of what it calls 'the ultimate soft
shoe for summer shuffling' - the shoe for chaps to wear on the beach, in the
jeep, for loafing around and above all for driving. It looks much like a
classic Gucci moccasin, with the distinctive snaffle bar, but the soft
stitched leather sole is reinforced with rubber on the ball of the foot and
the heel so that it does not slip on the brake or accelerator. The shoes are
tan with black soles or black with tan soles and cost Pounds 100 a pair.
Gucci shops are at 32-33 Old Bond Street, London W1X and 17-18 Sloane
Street, London SW1.

Malcolm Levene of 13-15 Chiltern Street, London W1 runs one of those small
personalised shops that customers, once they find it, tend to go back to
again and again. He is adept at helping chaps put a look together, whether
for work or play, and he clothes some of the snappiest dressers around. In
the course of trying to keep his customers well-dressed he has discovered
that there is a gap between the traditional bespoke service and straight
ready-to-wear.
'Many of the men who come in are not standard sizes but they don't have the
patience or want to pay the prices for a complete bespoke service,' he said.
He has therefore developed a customised service. It works like this - if you
fall in love with a suit or jacket but find there isn't one that fits you
perfectly, you can order the same style in any of the fabrics on offer
(there is masses of choice) and in your own size. Three weeks later the
garment is ready, though occasionally a few extra adjustments, such as
shortening trousers or sleeves may be necessary. The price for this extra
service is just 10 per cent to 15 per cent more than the standard retail
price which means suits on average work out at just under Pounds 500,
jackets or blazers at about Pounds 325.

The City &amp; Guilds of London Art School in Kennington, south London will hold
its Graduate Diploma Show on July 2-5. It offers a chance not just to buy a
wide selection of decorative objects, all the work of graduating students,
but also to spot budding talent. Almost all the students are eager to take
on commissions so if you have something to celebrate this could be a
splendid way of finding something original. Objects include tables, screens,
wall hangings, doors and mirrors to bowls, lacquer and metal work, cabinets,
paintings and sculpture.
