FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (2): Soft landing is planned for this year -
The economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ON A recent visit to Santiago, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the
Bundesbank, thought his Chilean hosts had misplaced the decimal point in
their economic statistics.
GDP growth of 10.4 per cent in 1992? Private-sector investment up by 30 per
cent? A 12 per cent increase in export revenues? Surely this was not
possible in a global recession.
As Mr Tietmeyer was soon to discover, 1992 was Chile's best economic year in
three decades. Growth was spurred by unprecedented investment outlays in
Chile's export industries, a construction boom in Santiago, and government
infrastructure projects. The country's gross domestic product is approaching
Dollars 40bn, while per capita income reached Dollars 3,000 last year.
Fiscal discipline allowed the government to match record levels of economic
growth with falling inflation. In three years, finance minister Alejandro
Foxley's firm grip on the purse-strings of the treasury has doubled the
government savings rate to 5.6 per cent of GDP.
Over the same period, the annual rate of inflation dropped from almost 30
per cent to 12.7 per cent at the end of 1992. Like Mr Tietmeyer, Mr Roberto
Zahler, president of Chile's autonomous central bank, distrusts double
digits. 'The economy last year was not overheated, but such exceptional
rates of growth are not sustainable over time,' he explains.
Mr Zahler aims to engineer a soft landing for the Chilean economy this year.
Interest-rate increases in the second half of 1992 and a slowdown in Chile's
export sector should moderate economic growth to an optimal 5 to 6 per cent
in 1993, according to central bank forecasts. Meanwhile, the strong
investment momentum generated by the private and public sectors should lay
the foundations for future growth.
The most important change Chile will see this year is in its external
accounts. Imports are growing at twice the rate of exports. This will
probably wipe out the trade surplus this year and widen the current account
deficit to around Dollars 1.5bn, or 4 per cent of GDP.
Economists, however, are not alarmed by the 25 per cent rise in imports.
'Most imports are going into real bricks-and-mortar investments,' says Mr
Armen Kouyoumdjian, a business consultant. 'And with Dollars 10bn in foreign
exchange reserves, there is no danger of a balance of payments crisis.' In
addition, foreign direct investment, concentrated mainly in the mining
sector, continues to flow into Chile, to the tune of Dollars 1bn a year.
However, there are signs that the Chilean economy, as it approaches full
capacity and near full employment, will have to adjust to lower rates of
growth.
'Chile will feel the pain of the international recession this year,'
predicts Mr Joaquin Vial, chief economist at the finance ministry. The
country's traditional exports - copper, fishmeal and cellulose - have been
hit by a slump in world commodity prices, while the appreciation of the
Chilean peso is hurting the Dollars 1bn-a-year fruit industry and the
dynamic non-traditional exports - jeans and shoes, biotechnology, wine from
the Central Valley, and fresh salmon from the southern Lake District.
Most economists predict that export revenues will rise by 7 per cent at most
in 1993, to about Dollars 10.6bn, compared with growth rates of 12 per cent
and above over the past five years.
The other question-mark hanging over economic policy is whether Chile's
monetary authorities have any leeway to further reduce inflation. Last year,
it was curbed by five points to 12.7 per cent, thanks to a hefty revaluation
of the peso, interest-rate hikes and fiscal austerity. This year, the
central bank's target is to trim the figure to 11 per cent.
But even this modest reduction seems ambitious, given the widespread
indexation of the economy, growing wage pressures, and the central bank's
reluctance to hurt exports with a further revaluation. In addition, this is
an election year, and, despite vigorous denials, the government may be
sorely tempted to relax the reins on government spending.
Against this backdrop, Mr Foxley's greatest battle this year will be to
persuade Congress to maintain the present levels of taxation. When President
Aylwin took office in 1990, Congress approved tax increases for a four-year
period to finance greater social spending. The tax reforms expire at the end
of 1993, and Chile's vociferous business community is lobbying for a return
to the pre-1990 corporate tax rate of 10 per cent, against 15 per cent at
present.
Mr Foxley argues that to lower taxes now would unleash dangerous
inflationary pressures on the economy. It would also deprive the government
of an estimated Dollars 800m in annual revenues. If the right-wing
opposition blocks an extension of the current tax rates, Mr Foxley has
warned congressmen that the unpopular task of axeing social programmes from
the budget will rest on their shoulders.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (4): A diversified trade pattern - Nafta
membership remains a goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Clinton's US presidential election victory last November produced
political tremors in Santiago. Chile had put a lot into its relationship
with President George Bush, who promised in May 1992 to negotiate a free
trade agreement with Santiago upon successful conclusion of the Nafta talks
between the US, Mexico and Canada.
There were widespread fears that an incoming Clinton administration, pledged
to focus on domestic issues, would turn its back on Latin America or even
pursue a more protectionist line with its neighbours. Gains for Chile from
Mr Bush's 1990 Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, covering debt, trade
and investment, could be at risk.
In the event President Clinton reaffirmed his predecessor's stance on Chile,
while Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, said in April he hoped that the
Nafta would be the 'first building block' of a hemisphere-wide free trade
deal.
However, amid the sighs of relief, the government has been at pains to cool
hopes of rapid progress towards an FTA. 'Chile has a very diversified
composition of trade, about one third to Europe, one third to the US and one
third to Asia,' says Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister. 'So in the
short and medium term, an FTA is not really essential to our trade strategy.
We will pursue an FTA with the US without any sense of urgency, but with
determination,' he adds.
Even if a deal is reached, it is unlikely to lead to a dramatic increase in
trade with the US, already the country's biggest trading partner. Chile has
relatively low barriers to imports, with a uniform tariff rate of 11 per
cent for most produce, and a welcoming attitude to foreign investment.
However, an agreement would reassure investors and act as an insurance
policy against a drift towards a more protectionist stance by Washington.
The government likes to emphasise that the costs to the US of a deal with
the small Chilean economy would be minimal. But it would not necessarily be
painless for Chile.
One of the biggest obstacles for Washington to a trade agreement is Chile's
protected agriculture sector. Wheat, vegetable oils and sugar imports are
levied with duties aimed at maintaining a minimum domestic price for local
producers.
'Bread and sugar are twice the price they should be,' said a US diplomat in
Santiago. 'This is a subsidy borne on the backs of the poor. The US could
sell Dollars 100m of wheat to Chile if it liberalised in this area.'
However, local producers are pressing to have the price banding extended to
a larger number of staples.
The system also reduces the force of Chile's complaints about European
Community trade barriers - fruit growers face an average 18 per cent duty on
exports to the EC and a bumper European apple crop has produced curbs on
Chilean apple sales.
Nonetheless, Chile's government has lambasted the EC, especially France and
Germany, for foot-dragging on farm trade in the General Agreement on Tariff
and Trade talks.
The timetable for talks with the US is undefined, but agreement is unlikely
this year, with the Nafta talks continuing. In the meantime, Chile has been
vigorously pursuing bilateral agreements with its more like-minded
neighbours. This April Chile signed a free trade pact with Venezuela aimed
at eliminating import tariffs on 90 per cent of goods by January 1997.
A similar deal signed with Mexico in September 1991 produced an 80 per cent
increase in Chilean exports to Mexico last year, to about Dollars 80m.
Negotiations with Colombia are 'well advanced,' says Mr Joaquin Vial, chief
economist at the finance ministry.
'Most of Chile's export growth in the past two years has come from Latin
America,' Mr Vial says. However, the government has fought shy of joining
any of the region's emerging trade blocks, such as Mercosur, which groups
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
'The experience with broader integration has not been so good,' says Mr
Vial. 'There is still too much instability in the economies of the Mercosur
countries, particularly Brazil.'

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (1): It's a global
business - Many observers believe the European express market will be
dominated by the major groups, which can benefit most from economies of
scale. Meanwhile, the amount of investment needed to keep abreast of
developments puts profit margins under pressure
</HEADLINE>

THE COURIER and express industry is attracting political attention both in
the UK and the broader European market.
In the UK, the government plans to privatise both the Royal Mail parcels
division Parcelforce, either separately or as part of a more general
privatisation of postal services, and its British Rail counterpart Red Star.
A decision on the nature and timetable of the Royal Mail/Parcelforce
privatisation had been expected around now. But Government sources indicated
last month that privatisation moves are now unlikely before 1994.
Last July, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced
that it was intended to sell Parcelforce as a separate unit. Since then,
there has been something of a rethink, and Royal Mail and Parcelforce could
be sold off as one unit.
Red Star, though, looks certain to be sold separately from the rest of
British Rail, and is likely to be the first significant part of BR to take
that route. Among the potential bidders are two groups of current or recent
senior Red Star managers.
On the European front, the European Council of Ministers was this month due
to discuss a European Commission Green Paper on the future of postal
services. The discussions could have considerable implications for future EC
courier/express service development.
Meanwhile, the European Commission is investigating courier industry
allegations that seven national post offices are abusing EC competition laws
and hampering some aspects of their business.
The International Express Couriers Conference (IECC) has complained that the
post offices of the UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Finland, Switzerland and
Sweden are deliberately slowing down private sector re-mail operations. That
business involves courier mail from one country being reposted in the postal
system of another to take advantage of cost savings.
Regardless of the truth or otherwise of those allegations, post offices
generally are becoming much more commercial in their thinking on the
development of mail, courier and express services. Highlighting that trend
is the 18-month old joint venture between postal organisation GD Net, the
express company established by the post offices of Germany, France, the
Netherlands, Sweden and Canada, and TNT Express Worldwide, a private sector
operator.
The GD Net/TNT venture helps to illustrate the importance of size and
traffic volumes as a factor in the express industry's development. With
delivery systems generating substantial fixed costs, any increase in traffic
volumes rapidly produces significant economies of scale.
Mr Tony Keating, European logistics director for US-based parcels giant
United Parcel Service (UPS), maintains that in Europe, for instance, rates
should come down as volumes increase and the industry develops along similar
lines to that in the US.
'The traditional structure of parcel groupage and forwarding operations in
Europe will, I believe, change just as they have in the US. With this
change, I foresee service levels increasing year by year. At the same time,
we should see rates coming down from current levels to far nearer the costs
of similar movements in the US,' he says.
In the light of that likely development, many express industry observers
believe the European market will increasingly be dominated by the major
groups who can benefit most from economies of scale.
In the last five years, there have been numerous cases of domestic parcels
delivery companies coming unstuck while trying to develop their own
operations in Europe. But a number of leading domestic express companies
still believe they can compete in the European market through partnerships.
One of the most pronounced international trends is the move by major service
operators to expand their activities to include more comprehensive logistics
activities. The big four global express companies - TNT, UPS, DHL Worldwide
Express and Federal Express - now have special divisions or management teams
dedicated to developing full logistics services for multinational customers.
This trend is fuelled by the attempt of multinational manufacturers to
restructure their logistics activities to reflect the increasingly global
nature of their sourcing and distribution activities. Fast, reliable
delivery services are often a key component of those operations.
At the same time, express companies are also broadening the scope of their
standard delivery services. The express industry is introducing more
added-value services, such as inventory management, order fulfilment and
expedited shipping programmes for high-value or time-sensitive goods.
But the most significant general area of 'added value' service development
involves information technology, particularly the establishment of new EDI
(electronic data interchange) links between customers, carriers, Customs and
other organisations.
Tight operational control and fast reporting of management information is
now very much the name of the game, and express operators are investing
millions of dollars in new computerised control, tracking and reporting
systems.
TNT, for example, earlier this year placed a multi-million dollar order for
new computers with Hewlett-Packard. The order involves more than 200 HP 9000
Series 800 computer systems, which will be installed in 35 countries.
Another big spender in the information technology field is UPS. The company
has invested about Dollars 1.5bn in new IT development over the last few
years. This year, it introduced a cellular technology, nationwide mobile
data service in the US, which will enable UPS to transmit package delivery
information from its 50,000 delivery vehicles for immediate customer access.
The system, said to be the largest of its kind in the world, has cost about
Dollars 150m to implement.
Domestic express companies, too, are investing heavily in IT.
Birmingham-based UK national carrier Elan recently spent Pounds 2m to
improve its own internal systems and provide additional benefits to
customers.
In Europe, the pace of information technology and general express industry
development is being further accelerated by the advent of the EC Single
Market. As manufacturers and suppliers make greater use of centralised
warehousing/distribution, they increasingly require fast, frequent, reliable
delivery.
Other developments are inspired by the coming of the EC Single Market. They
include a renewed focus on the use of road transport. Removal of border
controls within the Community now makes most markets accessible by truck
within two days. Encouraged by this development, express companies are
stepping up their use of roadservices, thereby freeing costly air systems
for urgent traffic. TNT, UPS, Emery Worldwide and Air Express International
are among the big air express operators who already have such road-based
operations and DHL is thinking of joining them.
However, the sheer scale of the investment needed to keep abreast of the
latest developments in a fast-changing industry, coupled with the high costs
of fixed operational systems, means that operators' profit margins remain
under heavy pressure. Even some of the largest operators are incurring big
losses in some of their activities.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (1): A watershed in economic development -
Chile's success is equated with high growth and hefty capital gains -
policymakers now seek to scale down expectations without losing investor
confidence. Although the country has not yet achieved full democracy, the
December elections may prove a landmark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NINE years of consecutive growth, topped by the best overall performance in
Latin America last year, have brought Chile to a watershed in its economic
development.
The country which pioneered so many of the reforms now galvanising Latin
America - the export-led strategy for growth, privatisation, debt-equity
swaps and private pension funds - is now confronting the limitations of its
chosen model of development and the social and environmental costs of
success.
Politically, too, 1993 will be a landmark. Presidential and congressional
elections in December will restore the democratic succession broken by the
1973 coup which toppled the late Dr Salvador Allende.
President Patricio Aylwin, elected in 1989 after 16 years of military rule,
will have thus fulfilled his main ambition: to revive Chile's democratic
institutions and bequeath power to an elected successor.
Economic continuity undoubtedly played a role in Chile's smooth transition
from dictatorship to democracy. But without Mr Aylwin's negotiating skills
and the cohesion of his government, Chile would not be basking in the
prosperity and political stability it enjoys today.
So stable is it that seven months ahead of general elections it is already a
foregone conclusion that the ruling coalition, the Concertacion, will form
the next government and that Senator Eduardo Frei, a Christian democrat like
Mr Aylwin, son of a popular statesman of the 1960s, will be Chile's next
president.
The country's economic fortunes are less easy to predict.
The days of exponential export growth and huge capital gains are probably
over. Finance ministry officials are predicting that Chile will feel the
pain of the international recession this year.
Export revenues are expected to grow by a 'modest' (in Chilean terms) 7 per
cent in 1993 to about Dollars 10.6bn, compared with almost 12 per cent in
1992. Traditional exports - copper, fish meal and cellulose - are being hit
by a slump in international commodity prices.
The global downturn has affected Chile's cellulose producers in particular;
they had recently invested more than Dollars 1.5bn in new state-of-the-art
pulp mills. Most of the mills are currently operating at a loss. Further
expansion plans have been shelved.
The Dollars 1bn-a-year fresh fruit business, where exports have doubled
since 1987, is facing trade barriers in Europe and stiff competition from
other southern hemisphere producers such as Argentina, New Zealand and South
Africa.
Fedefruta, the fruit growers association, says it is exporting apples and
kiwi fruit to the European Community this year at a 'suicidal loss'. It has
called for a halt in shipments.
The most dynamic area of export growth - an eclectic mix of manufactured
goods and new products such as jeans, shoes, wine, fresh salmon and exotic
flowers - is finding competition harder as a result of a 13 per cent
revaluation of the peso since 1990.
There are signs that exporters are already adapting to the tougher
international environment by introducing new technologies and paring down
costs.
Mr Joaquin Vial, chief economist at the finance ministry, says that much of
the 30 per cent increase in private sector investment last year went into
modernising plants and improving productivity.
Despite the diversification of Chile's exports, the global recession has
exposed the vulnerability of the export-led model of growth. Exports now
account for almost 30 per cent of GDP, but more than 70 per cent of foreign
earnings are still commodity-based, and sensitive to the vagaries of
international prices.
Economists, however, see no alternative course for small countries such as
Chile. 'We either pursue export-led growth or no growth at all,' says Mr
Vial. This explains the importance Chile attaches to trade liberalisation,
whether through multilateral forums such as the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, or bilateral agreements. Chile has signed free trade accords
(FTAs) with Mexico and Venezuela, and hopes free trade negotiations might
soon begin with the US, its biggest trading partner.
'An FTA with the US would be our insurance policy against trade wars if the
international environment deteriorates,' argues Mr Vial.
Following last year's 10.4 per cent growth in GDP, which now borders Dollars
40bn, Chile's autonomous central bank is planning a soft landing for the
economy. 'Such exceptional rates of growth are not sustainable over time,'
says Mr Roberto Zahler, the bank's president.
But shifting economic gear will require an important change in Chilean
business culture. Bankers and entrepreneurs have grown accustomed to annual
30 per cent returns and more on assets. Stock prices in 1991 more than
doubled in value.
Santiago's wealthy suburbs are sprouting luxury condominiums and crawling
with expensive imported cars. Yuppies are alive and well in Chile.
In the minds of Chile's business elite, success is equated with high growth
rates and hefty capital gains.
This creates a problem for Chile's policy makers, who must now try to scale
down expectations without provoking a loss of investor confidence. The
central bank's president has scolded Chileans for being manic-depressives: a
good economic year caused euphoria and self-adulation, but a single poor
indicator was enough to plunge the entire establishment into terminal
depression. He called for a more realistic assessment of Chile's strengths
and shortcomings.
The strengths arise from a consensus, now deeply ingrained in Chilean
society, on economic fundamentals: the need to preserve macro-economic
balances, to curb inflation, to keep government spending in check.
The most heated discussions revolve around regulation, environmental
protection and how to alleviate the poverty that still engulfs 4m Chileans -
one third of the population. Chile should have a new capital markets law
before the end of the year. Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister, calls
it the 'deepest and most complete reform to the domestic capital markets'
since the early 1980s.
The law, which will widen the investment horizons of Chile's private pension
funds and insurance companies, also includes tighter rules to prevent
insider trading and other conflicts of interest. These provisions are hotly
opposed by the financial community. Bankers are protesting against what they
perceive as excessive regulation and the government's reluctance to sanction
new lines of business - such as foreign branches, pension management and
life insurance.
Environmental issues are also climbing up the political agenda as the Aylwin
administration makes incipient attempts to protect natural resources from
excessive exploitation. The challenge here is not implementing legislation,
but enforcing it.
Conaf, the forestry commission, says it would need an army to police Chile's
7m hectares of virgin forests against the predatory action of wood-chippers
(exports up 38 per cent last year to 3m tonnes). Fishing fleets resent the
frequent bans imposed to safeguard stocks. Mining smelters are only now
being forced to implement clean-up plans, and Santiago's reviled buses
prefer to go on strike rather than convert to cleaner fuels.
Poverty alleviation has been a main concern of President Aylwin's
government. Tax reforms in 1990 raised an extra Dollars 800m in fiscal
revenues to finance social projects: low-cost housing, health clinics,
primary schools. Real wages have risen by 12 per cent since 1990 - and the
minimum wage by 36 per cent in real terms. Pensions and family benefits have
been improved.
The government's social programmes, however, are in jeopardy. Mr Foxley has
warned congressmen that if the present tax regime is not upheld, the
unpopular task of cutting Dollars 800m of social expenditure from the 1994
budget will be their responsibility.
There will be other political battles this year. Government attempts to
reform the judiciary are far behind schedule. The judiciary is arguably the
weakest link in Chile's new democracy - a Byzantine institution tainted by
corruption and negligence in the defence of human rights. The government
wants to dilute the power of Pinochet appointees to the supreme court by
expanding the number of chief justices. It has also promised more resources
and better pay to overworked magistrates, some of whom handle upwards of
5,000 cases at a time.
Still pending are the length of the next presidential term - eight years if
the constitution is not changed - and the electoral system, which heavily
over-represents the right-wing opposition. The government has linked the two
reforms in congressional debates.
The government failed earlier this year to get an important package of
constitutional reforms through congress. One important change would have
abolished the nine non-elected senate seats (these senators were chosen by
General Pinochet before he stepped down, to deprive the Concertacion of a
majority in the upper house); another reform would have devolved the
president's power to sack commanders-in-chief of the armed forces.
The reforms failed because they struck at the heart of General Pinochet's
political legacy. And while the Concertacion is committed to getting rid of
the authoritarian fetters written into the military's 1980 constitution, the
right defends the charter as Pinochet's proudest achievement.
General Pinochet's power is also felt in the long arm of military courts
(these can prosecute civilians for 'offences against the armed forces', a
crime as broad as it is vague), and in the impunity army officers enjoy
against the human rights violations of the dictatorship. 'We are far from
having a full democracy,' President Aylwin admits, reviewing his three years
in office.
But however far from perfect, Mr Aylwin's tactful handling of the armed
forces has eliminated the threat of another military coup. It will be the
task of the next political generation to heal the wounds of the past.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Size and coupon of next gilt auction well
received
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England's announcement that the next gilt auction would be of
Pounds 3bn 7 3/4 per cent stock due 2006 lifted the UK government bond
market at the end of the day.
The good reception was attributed to the size of the auction - at the bottom
end of expectations - and to the comparatively low coupon.
A coupon below 8 per cent was taken as a sign of the bank's confidence in a
lower inflation outlook. It also meant the gilt would be priced below par,
building in a capital gain.
The futures contract benefited most, gaining about  3/8 points. In the cash
market the auction area and beyond showed small gains.
DISAPPOINTMENT that the Bundesbank left the repo rate unchanged at 7.60 per
cent caused a sell-off in the German government bond market.
The immobility cast a further pall over hopes that it would cut the Lombard
or discount rates at its council meeting today, although a few were still
looking for a  1/4 reduction.
Once the June futures contract fell through 94.45, further sales were
triggered. The day's low was 94.26, from which there was some recovery.
Expectations of a Yes vote in Denmark also acted as a drag on bunds, which
are seen as losing more of their safe haven status. A Yes vote would give
another push to the convergence story, activating further switches to higher
yielders.
The yield spread of 10-year Danish government bonds over bunds would be
expected to narrow significantly from yesterday's 71 basis points.
French government bonds have continued to benefit from this theme, with the
bund-OAT yield spread coming in to as little as 29 basis points.
THE ITALIAN government bond market, already attracting demand as a high
yielder, rose further on the news that withholding tax would be refunded
much more quickly to overseas investors.
The 12 1/2 per cent tax, which has taken six months to reclaim, has proved a
deterrent to overseas investors. A new target of only two to three weeks was
announced by the government, which needs overseas investors to finance the
public sector deficit. It also announced spending cuts designed to
counteract a looming overshoot on that deficit.
The BTP future gained 80 basis points to close near its all time high of
99.56.
THE JAPANESE government bond market took fright at a newspaper report that
short-term interest rates might rise, exacerbating its concerns about
economic recovery.
The September futures contract fell through a key support level, opening at
106.44 and closing at 106.11. In the cash market the yield on the benchmark
No 145 rose from 4.575 per cent to 4.67 per cent. Once again there was a
lack of domestic demand.
Other niggling factors were a rise in the overnight money rate to 3 7/32 per
cent, the weakening of the yen against the dollar and declines in overseas
government bond markets.
The US Treasury yield curve continued to flatten yesterday as longer-dated
securities posted fresh declines while the short end held its ground.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down at 101 9/32 ,
yielding 7.018 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was unchanged at 99, to yield 4.026 per cent.
The day's only economic news - a 6.7 per cent rise in monthly housing starts
 -was largely ignored but prices at the long end eased because attention was
focused on the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee meeting
in Washington DC.
Recent news on inflation has heightened speculation that the FOMC might
decide to shift the bias of monetary policy towards a possibly tightening.
Although such a move would not necessarily involve a hike in interest rates,
it would make it more likely that interest rates would go up, rather than
stay steady or be lowered, over the coming months.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Equity Issues: Finnish forestry sector boosted
by devaluation

THE DEVALUATION of the Finnish markka has sparked international investor
interest in Finnish stocks, prompting several issues in the forestry sector.
Metsa-Serla, one of Finland's leading forestry groups, plans to raise around
Dollars 100m through a direct offering of B shares to international
investors. The proceeds will be used to reduce the group's debt and to
expand operations.
The group says that it wants to exploit increased international demand for
its shares at a time when its financial performance is improving and its
shares have risen strongly.
The group's B shares have risen by 72 per cent this year to FM172.
Meanwhile, Repola, another Finnish timber company which is 20 per cent owned
by Metsa-Serla, has priced its international share offering at FM66.25 per
share, approximately FM1 below Monday's closing price.
The offering was increased from 6m shares to 7m shares. SG Warburg, the lead
underwriter, has the option to increase the size by a further 1m shares.
The size and price of the Metsa-Serla offering will be set according to
market conditions after the June 9 publication of the group's financial
figures for the first four months.
These are expected to show that the group has returned to profit, confirming
the forecast it gave when it announced a 1992 loss of FM290m.
The issue is mainly being targeted at the US, UK, Swedish and central Europe
markets, where demand for the group's shares has increased since Finland
relaxed restrictions on foreign share ownership at the start of the year.
Metsa-Serla, along with other Finnish forestry groups, has seen its
international competitiveness restored by the heavy depreciation of the
markka since November 1991 and has also benefited from significant
restructuring.
Mr Timo Poranen, chief executive, said: 'Our main target with this issue is
to reduce our gearing, but we also want to continue our focus on high value
added production.'
A specific plan is to convert the group's Kirkniemi mill to 100 per cent
production of coated magazine paper.
Kleinwort Benson is the global co-ordinator of the offering, while
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki has been appointed as co-lead manager.
This is the second international share issue to be announced by a leading
Finnish group in the last few days.
Last weektelecommunications group Nokia announced that it was making a
Dollars 100m offer. It confirms a growing sense of confidence among the
country's leading exporters.
Banco Santander, the Spanish commercial bank, said yesterday that it was
launching a Dollars 195m share offer in the US, AP-DJ reports.
The offer, which is Santander's fourth US share tender since its first in
September 1991, will bring to Dollars 750m the amount of capital it has
raised on the New York Stock Exchange, the bank said.
'The funds obtained will reinforce Santander's broad capital base, raising
its capital adequacy ratio to 13.57 per cent, the highest of the big Spanish
banks,' Santander said.
The preferential shares carry subscription but not voting rights and a
maximum dividend of 8 per cent, the bank said.
Chia-Hsin Cement, the third largest cement company in Taiwan, has priced its
offering of global depositary receipts at Dollars 16.90, a premium of 3 per
cent over a five-day average. Each global depositary receipt is based on 10
ordinary shares. The offering was arranged by Jardine Fleming.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Growth phase over for German
CP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHASE of 'stormy growth' in the German commercial paper market is over,
the Bundesbank says in its May monthly report.
The German CP market was established in February 1991, much later than in
other countries. It grew rapidly and within 18 months had become the fourth
largest such market in Europe.
But the report says that with the decline in the German economy, demand for
short-term funds has fallen sharply. Also, long-term interest rates have
fallen, making it more attractive to borrow at the long end of the yield
curve.
The volume of the German CP market was DM37bn at the end of last year, more
than double the level at the end of 1991. But in April this year the
utilisation of such programmes stood at 45 per cent, down from a peak of 60
per cent

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Time running out for country's
brokers - Japanese securities houses and companies turn in fresh batch of
poor results / Cost-cutting needs to go deeper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the past year, Yamatane Securities has squabbled with Sakura Bank over a
restructuring that would wrest control from the broker's traditional family
managers. It was appropriate that on the day the broker reported a Y10.4bn
(Dollars 93.69m) pre-tax loss, 15 of its executives announced their
resignation.
The Yamatane case, and a batch of generally bad results yesterday from other
medium-sized brokers, suggests there is a limit to how much longer these
companies will be allowed to go on reporting losses by their supporting
financial institutions, be they larger brokers or banks.
Although these brokers have already trimmed staff, reduced office space, and
delayed spending on new computer systems, the size of the pre-tax losses
suggests the cuts will have to be much deeper.
The cause of the problems at the mid-sized brokers, and of the pain at the
Big Four - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko, and Yamaichi - is the rapid expansion of
the domestic operations during the late 1980s, followed by a collapse of
prices, turnover and new listings in the three years after the market peak
of December 1989.
Most of the brokers are confident the Nikkei index, which hit 14,309.41 in
August, down from 38,915.87 in late 1989, has recovered enough to keep it in
the 20,000 range this year. That expectation has prompted all of the 14
largest brokers to forecast profits, including an ambitious Y60bn at Daiwa,
which reported a Y7.3bn loss for the year ended in March.
The larger brokers point out that they don't have the bad-loan exposure of
banks, although some houses do have a hidden exposure through the lending of
their so-called non-bank financial company affiliates.
However, Nomura and the other leading brokers do have the advantage of a
broader range of revenue sources than the smaller brokers, which are reliant
on commissions for as much as 90 per cent of their income. The most notable
second-tier exception is Kokusai Securities, which has close links to
Nomura, and last year reported Y13.2bn profit on its bond dealings, though
it still had a pre-tax loss of Y17.4bn.
Nomura's own bond trading volume rose 5 per cent, and profits on bond
dealings rose 36 per cent to Y30.5bn, while a rush of straight issues late
last year and early this year led to a 48 per cent increase in the amount of
bonds underwritten and distributed.
'Thanks to the cuts in the official discount rate and the appreciation of
the yen, bond prices rose and transaction volume increased, reversing the
downward trend of the previous four years,' Nomura said.
The surge in stock prices also meant the leading brokers reported lower
valuation losses on their securities holdings than foreseen when the market
was languishing. Nomura's loss was Y12.1bn, Daiwa's Y12.7bn, and Nikko's
Y10.9bn.
Yamaichi, which has now reported two successive years of huge losses, saw a
27 per cent fall in commission income. It did make a profit of Y12.3bn on
its securities dealings, against an embarrassing loss of Y32.1bn in the
previous year, although dealings on stocks showed a Y1.9bn loss.
While Yamaichi may be the most vulnerable of the Big Four houses, there are
far deeper concerns about the health of medium-sized brokers, which are
struggling to keep market share and are yet to see a return of the
individual investors, on whom they rely heavily for earnings.
Ms Alicia Ogawa, of Salomon Brothers, said the smaller brokers' profits were
'more highly-geared to a recovery in volume on the exchange than the Big
Four', but that their share of that turnover was 'tenuous'.
The continuing flow of red ink at brokers such as Kankaku Securities (a
pre-tax loss of Y51bn), and Wako Securities (a loss of Y22.5bn), raises the
question of whether their backing banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Industrial
Bank of Japan respectively, will move to strengthen their control.
Only two of the 10 second-tier brokers, Tokyo Securities and Kokusai,
announced dividends for the year, and all 10 houses reported sharply lower
commissions and financial revenue, affected by the lowering of interest
rates.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chemicals producer falls heavily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Kasei, the leading Japanese chemicals maker, reported a 29.9 per
cent fall in pre-tax profit, to Y9.3bn (Dollars 83.78m), for the year ended
in March. It blamed the loss on falling demand for industrial chemicals and
the slowing of the economy.
Sales for the year fell 2.3 per cent to Y709.83bn, although the company
continued to expand outside its traditional lines and increased production
of pharmaceuticals, biochemicals and electronic items.
The company is expecting to benefit from the stronger yen, which will lead
to relatively lower prices for imported resources, but it is still concerned
about the sluggish pace of the domestic economy and weak demand from core
industrial customers.
Profits have now fallen for three years in succession. Mitsubishi Kasei is
forecasting another fall this year, with pre-tax profits expected at Y6bn,
on slightly higher sales.

HEAVY restructuring costs have led to a sharp fall in profits at Telecom
Corporation of New Zealand.
The company, controlled by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, has announced a
profit of NZDollars 108m (USDollars 58.6m) for the financial year to March
31, in line with analysts' predictions, after absorbing a restructuring
charge of NZDollars 350m after tax. The restructuring includes laying off
5,500 staff by 1995.
Mr Peter Shirtcliffe, the chairman, said earnings excluding abnormal
restructuring costs would have been NZDollars 458m, compared with NZDollars
444m in 1991-92.
The chairman said the company was expecting another pleasing year, and
intended continuing to increase its dividends to shareholders. The company
increased its final dividend by one cent to 8.5 cents a share.

JANSSEN Pharmaceutical of Belgium plans to double its manufacturing capacity
in China over the next two to three years to meet rapidly increasing demand
for western medicine.
Mr Jerry Norskog, head of Janssen's Dollars 28m Xian joint venture, said the
company would increase production to 2m packs annually as part of long-term
plans to improve the range and volume of its drugs.
The move coincides with a drive by foreign pharmaceutical companies to gain
entry to the China market in the light of new regulations that will benefit
local producers.
'We have successfully fulfilled our first phase of strategy,' said Mr
Norskog. 'We will be able to produce 2m packs of preparations a year when
expansion is finished in two to three years. Our target is to supply the
greater China market - not just the mainland, but also Taiwan and Hong
Kong.'
Janssen is likely to pick Xian, south-west of Beijing, for a planned second
plant. 'There we could get more personal attention and government support,
though it might lag behind the coastal areas in infrastructure.' said Mr
Norskog.
Dr Paul Janssen, founder of Janssen Pharmaceutical, who has been visiting
China, was due this week to sign a memorandum of understanding with the
Nanjing Medical College to support further research into an Aids cure. They
are examining combining traditional Chinese medicinal herbs with western
medicine.
Xian Janssen Pharmaceutical is regarded as one of China's most successful
joint ventures. Among its bigger-selling products are Sibelium, a palliative
for migraine and dizziness, and Hismanal, an anti-histamine.
China has about 1,100 pharmaceutical plants with a turnover, in 1991, of
28.4bn yuan (Dollars 5bn). Most produce bulk pharmaceuticals. China spends
Dollars 700m a year on imported drugs.

CASIO Computer, the leading Japanese digital watchmaker, announced a 39.6
per cent fall, to Y11.5bn (Dollars 103.60m), in pre-tax profit for the year

Sales rose a mere 0.3 per cent to Y326bn during the year. Sales of
electronic musical instruments declined by about 10 per cent, to 37.6bn,
from the previous year, while sales of electronic calculators rose about 1

passes dividend

JVC, the Japanese manufacturer of audio-visual products which brought the
world the VHS video tape, yesterday reported a sharp deterioration in its
business results and passed its dividend for the first time since it became
a public company.
JVC reported a consolidated net loss of Y43.1bn (Dollars 388m) as sales in
its most important product areas fell sharply amid the world-wide slump in
the consumer electronics industry and as the yen's appreciation adversely
affected overseas revenues.
The result was a significant setback from the previous year, when JVC
reported a consolidated net profit of Y1.99bn.
The loss came on consolidated sales, down 8 per cent to Y768.89bn, as
consumers refrained from buying in key markets, which have become saturated.
For the parent company alone, JVC reported a 15 per cent decline in sales,
to Y513.16bn, and a pre-tax loss of Y26.13bn compared with a loss of Y2.13bn
previously.
The company's businesses suffered a setback in both the domestic and
overseas markets. In the domestic market, sales were down 1 per cent to
Y260.2bn.
Sales overseas, nearly half of turnover, declined sharply by 26 per cent, to
Y252.96bn, as the company moved to reduce stocks and as a result of the
strong appreciation of the yen.
JVC has cut costs throughreductions in staff levels and restructuring of
businesses, including factories. The company aims to reduce staff levels by
3,000 through natural wastage, curtailment of new recruitment and transfers
of personnel to subsidiaries.
It forecasts a slight improvement in sales to Y540m in the year to March
1994 and a return to profitability during the year.
Olympus, the camera and precision instruments maker, reported a 72 per cent
rise in consolidated pre-tax profits in the year to March 1993 but a 25 per
cent decline in net profits to Y3.8bn due to extraordinary costs related to
a patent infringement settlement.
The increase came as consolidated sales rose 3 per cent to Y267.7bn. Olympus
was hit by a payment to settle a patent infringement dispute brought by
Honeywell, the US company.
For the parent company, Olympus reported a 10 per cent decline in pre-tax
profits, to Y9.36bn, on sales down 1 per cent to Y187.75bn.
Although the company does not expect a substantial improvement in the
business environment this year, it is forecasting a 23 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Y11.5bn, and a 209 per cent increase in net profits to
Y6bn on a non-consolidated basis as a result of restructuring. Clarion, the
car audio manufacturer, reported a pre-tax loss of Y6.7bn on sales down 7
per cent to Y142.65bn. It passed its dividend.
The specialist audio maker was particularly hit by the downturn in the
vehicle market.

PARKER &amp; Parsley, the US energy group which last week agreed to pay Dollars
448m for Prudential Securities' troubled energy investment partnerships, is
suing Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas, a rival US energy company which has
submitted a higher bid for the partnerships, for attempting to interfere in
the transaction.
Graham Royalty, a firm which was a general partner in the loss-making
partnerships along with Prudential, is also named as a defendant in the
lawsuit filed in Texas.
Parker claims that Dreyfus 'maliciously interfered' with the merger
agreement between Parker and Prudential and that Graham Royalty breached the
merger agreement and committed conspiracy and fraud by negotiating with
Dreyfus.
The lawsuit follows a series of confusing events. On Monday Prudential
agreed to sell its partnerships to Parker for Dollars 448m but a few days
later, under pressure from investors in the partnerships, it was forced to
reveal that a counter-offer worth Dollars 510m had already been made by
Dreyfus.
At the time, Prudential said that it did not accept the higher offer because
there was not enough information in the bid for it to be evaluated properly.
Prudential has since said it will consider the bid once Dreyfus has provided
a full financing commitment for its offer, which Dreyfus said it will
provide in the next week.
The affair is being watched closely by investors in the Prudential energy
partnerships. After the partnerships racked up big losses in the late 1980s
because of a slump in the domestic energy and property businesses, the
investors sued Prudential for misleading them over the risks involved in
buying into the partnerships.

HEWLETT-Packard, the US computer and electronics manufacturer, reported a 7
per cent rise in second-quarter net earnings yesterday, with orders and
revenue both increasing sharply.
The results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates, and by early afternoon
the shares were up Dollars 5 at Dollars 84 5/8 . Net earnings for the
quarter totalled Dollars 347m, or Dollars 1.38 a share, compared with
Dollars 323m, or Dollars 1.27, in the same period last year.
Net revenue rose 22 per cent to Dollars 5.1bn. US revenue gained 24 per cent
to Dollars 2.2bn; revenue from outside the US rose 20 per cent to Dollars
2.9bn. Orders advanced 28 per cent to Dollars 5.37bn.
Mr Lewis Platt, president and chief executive, said: 'We're pleased with the
company's order strength, and our product programmes have never been more
competitive. But we face a very mixed and uncertain economic environment, as
well as intense competition and rapid change in our markets. We also believe
that upward pressure on cost of sales is likely to continue.'
The first-half results were encouraging, he said, adding that the company
remained focused on managing operating expenses and getting products to
markets quickly.
Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was 58.8 per cent in the
quarter, compared with 53.6 per cent. The company said the increase was in
line with expectations
Operating expenses rose 6 per cent, with operating expenses as a percentage
of net revenue falling to 30.3 per cent against 34.9 per cent.
For the six-month period, net earnings dropped 3 per cent to Dollars 608m,
or Dollars 2.41 a share. Last year's comparative figures were struck before
a one-off after-tax charge of Dollars 332m in relation to adoption of an
accounting standard on retiree medical benefits.
First-half net revenue grew 20 per cent to Dollars 9.7bn. Orders rose 26 per
cent to Dollars 10.6bn.

<TEXT>
A GROUP of Hong Kong investors is to create a substantial Canadian oil and
gas producer through the proposed merger of Numac Oil &amp; Gas of Edmonton and
Calgary-based Westcoast Petroleum.
The merged company, which will rank among Canada's top 20 energy companies,
will be controlled by Mr Cheng Yu-Tung, chairman of New World Development of
Hong Kong, and the family of Mr YP Doo, whose Hong Kong interests include
Fung Seng Diamond Company.
Mr Cheng currently owns 24 per cent of Westcoast and 25 per cent of Numac,
while the Doo family holds 15 per cent of Numac and 24 per cent of
Westcoast. Several other Hong Kong investors are shareholders in Westcoast,
which was spun off earlier this year by Westcoast Energy of Vancouver.
Under a letter of intent between the two companies, Numac shareholders will
receive one Westcoast common share for each Numac share. Westcoast,
currently a private company, will have 50.6m shares outstanding prior to the
transaction. Numac has 33.1m shares outstanding. The combined company will
operate under the Numac name and be publicly traded.
Mr Stewart McGregor, Numac's chief executive, declined yesterday to disclose
the financial strength of the new company beyond saying the combined cash
flow in the first three months of this year was CDollars 25.2m (USDollars
19.7m).
Numac's cash flow is expected to grow rapidly over the next year as a result
of its 3 per cent stake in the large Caroline gas deposit in Alberta.
Mr McGregor said that a 'much larger' capital and cash flow will facilitate
expansion. He predicted that the company's international exposure 'will grow
over time'.
Mr Cheng and his partners appear to be taking a more gradual approach to
their investment in the Canadian oil and gas industry than their compatriot
Mr Li Ka-shing, whose acquisition of Husky Oil of Calgary has turned out to
be a heavy financial burden.
Hutchison Whampoa, the conglomerate controlled by Mr Li, last year took a
HKDollars 1.42bn write-down on the Husky investment. Husky last month raised
over CDollars 100m from the sale of various oil and gas properties in
western Canada.
By midday yesterday Numac's share price had risen by 37 cents to Dollars 7
1/2 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Honda sees further fall after
32% drop in profit

<TEXT>
HONDA, the Japanese car manufacturer, yesterday announced a 32 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits and warned that results for the current year were
also likely to show a significant fall due to the difficult trading
environment.
The sharp decline in Honda's profits reflects the persistent weakness in the
Japanese car market, the slow recovery in the North American market and the
impact of a strong rise in the value of the yen which depressed overseas
revenues.
Honda said that a sharp fall in car sales was largely responsible for a 5.9
per cent drop in consolidated revenues from Y4,391.9bn (Dollars 39.7bn) to
Y4,132.4bn in the year to March 1993.
Pre-tax profits fell to Y88.6bn from Y130.8bn while net profits declined 41
per cent to Y38.3bn from Y64.9bn.
In North America, a market which Honda depends on for over 40 per cent of
sales, the company has faced intensified competition from both US and other
manufacturers over the year. Last year, Honda faced the disappointment of
seeing its Accord model lose its title of best-selling car to Ford's Taurus.
Meanwhile, the yen's 6 per cent appreciation over the period had shaved off
about Y70bn from revenues, Honda said.
In contrast to its car business, where revenues declined 9 per cent to
Y3,280bn, Honda's motorcycle sales rose nearly 10 per cent to Y569.5bn.
The upturn in the motorcycle business, where operating profit of Y45.3bn
almost matched operating income of Y49.2bn from the car business, was
supported by strong demand for motorcycles in China and south-east Asia,
Honda said.
Demand in the Japanese market was still unpredictable with a rise in car
sales in March offset by a downturn in April, Honda said. The recovery in
the US market, meanwhile, was still very slow, it said.
Honda expects the launch of new models later this year to spur demand for
its cars.
However, the company expects continuing weakness in world markets. It
predicts that the impact of the yen's appreciation and other 'unpredictable
factors' will result in a further 3 per cent fall in revenues and a 40 per
cent decline in net profits for the year to March 1994.

UPJOHN, the US pharmaceuticals group, yesterday announced a series of
organisational changes which provoked speculation about who would take
charge of the company following the recent death of its chairman and chief
executive, Mr Theodore Cooper.
While the company made a number of appointments at the vice-president level,
it did not name a chief executive or chairman.
Mr Ley Smith, president and chief operating officer, presided over Upjohn's
annual shareholders meeting.
Mr Smith was named acting chief executive in April. He will continue in that
office until the board appoints a successor to Mr Cooper.
Mr Arvind Desai, a senior analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said there
was some intermediate uncertainty 'about who the chief executive will be and
whether there will be a separation of the functions of chairman and chief
executive'.
Mr Smith said Upjohn would strive to have 1994 earnings at the same level as
profits in 1993.

<TEXT>
FLUOR Daniel, the US engineering and construction company, has agreed to buy
49 per cent of ICA Industrial, a subsidiary of Mexico's largest construction
company Empresas ICA Sociedad Controladora.
The subsidiary, with revenues of Dollars 204m last year, and to be renamed
ICA Fluor Daniel, will become 'a single source for clients seeking
high-quality, full-service engineering and construction capabilities in
Mexico and other Latin American countries', the US company said.
The joint venture, which was proposed in November, is one of many recently
signed between US and Mexican companies, where the US partner offers capital
and technology, and the Mexican knowledge of the local market.
In this case, ICA Fluor Daniel will concentrate on industrial construction,
offering services for consumer products, petrochemicals, power generation,
and the car sector, among others.
The venture is expected to help ICA Industrial compete against Bufete
Industrial, its main Mexican rival that has long had an association with
Kellogg of the US. ICA and Fluor Daniel have already shown interest in
constructing several Mexican electric power plants that are now up for
tender.
Empresas ICA reported revenues of Dollars 1.8bn last year, most of which
were gained from heavy construction for the public sector. ICA has won the
lion's share of contracts in the government's ambitious toll-road programme.

MID-YEAR profits of VIAG, the German energy-based conglomerate, are likely
to fall below comparable figures a year earlier, Mr Alfred Pfeiffer,
chairman, told the annual meeting.
However, he added that its annual dividend would remain unchanged at DM9 a
share.
Net profits for 1992 fell by 9 per cent to DM366m (Dollars 227m) on sales 3
per cent up at DM24.3bn. He attributed the rise in turnover largely to the
first time inclusion of sales from VIAG's one-third stake in the Kuhne &amp;
Nagel shipping and freight concern.
Mr Pfeiffer said that Viag had an interest in buying a majority stake in
Kuhne &amp; Nagel but this depended on Mr Klaus-Michael Kuhne, who owns the rest
of the company.
Profits for VIAG's aluminium division suffered the most severe setback,
falling to DM78m, down from DM120m the previous year. Mr Rainer Grohe, a
VIAG director, said it had cut production of aluminium products in Germany
by 25 per cent.

BOMBARDIER, the Canadian international aerospace and transit equipment
maker, plans to raise funds later this year by issuing a new class of
convertible preferred stock.
Details will be made public after the creation of the new stock comes up for
shareholder approval at the annual meeting in Montreal on June 22.
Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, confirmed in Toronto that the dividend rate
on the stock will be geared to Bombardier's common share dividend policy. An
increase in common dividends will mean a higher preferred share payout, but
he refused to give further details.
Mr Beaudoin said the company plans the preferred issue partly to avoid
further dilution of its common stock. Also, Bombardier shares have been
depressed in the market by the company's CDollars 450m (USDollars 353m)
claim against Trans-Manche Link to cover additional work on its CDollars
750m Channel Tunnel wagon contract.
He said Bombardier has already accounted for 'an important portion' of the
estimated losses on the contract.

<TEXT>
METRO-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood studio taken over by Credit Lyonnais, its
French bank creditor, has reported reduced first-quarter losses.
Net losses were Dollars 51.21m, against Dollars 87.4m a year earlier, on
lower revenues of Dollars 196m compared with Dollars 298.9m.
The net losses include extraordinary losses of Dollars 9.83m on repurchases
of debt during the quarter. As a result the company anticipates lower
interest costs in future. Last year's first-quarter results included a
one-off charge of Dollars 33m related to changes in accounting for income
tax.
MGM said the latest results reflected a fall in feature film revenues due to
quarter-to-quarter differences in the timing of theatrical releases and
availability of products for home video and pay television markets. Revenues
in the feature films and television programming operations dropped to
Dollars 149.2m from Dollars 243.5m.
Theatre revenues fell to Dollars 46.87m from Dollars 55.37m, mainly due to
currency fluctuations. MGM said theatre operations remained profitable and
investment in multiplex theatres in Europe would continue.
Mr Alan Ladd and Mr Dennis Stanfill, co-chairmen, said the company had
'accelerated MGM's development and production activities with the support of
Credit Lyonnais'. They indicated, however, that these increased activities
would not be immediately reflected in the company's results, due to the long
lead times for development and production of feature films.
Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest operator of cable TV systems in the
US, has announced a Dollars 53,000 after-tax profit for the three months to
end-March. The figure compares with an Dollars 18,000 loss in the same
period of 1992, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Revenues rose from Dollars 856m to Dollars 1.02bn, and per-share earnings
stood at 11 cents, up from a loss of five cents in the first quarter of
1992.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Xerox warns over core earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY BENNALLACK-HART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL ALLAIRE, chairman of Xerox, has warned that second-quarter earnings
in the company's core document processing operations could drop below the
Dollars 1.12-a-share level posted a year ago.
However, he said he still expected full-year earnings for those operations
to show an increase on 1992.
Mr Allaire said the fall reflected fundamental changes in the management of
the company's document processing business, the realignment of the US
salesforce and continued weak economic conditions.
These factors had already affected first-quarter results, released last
month, which showed overall net income of Dollars 189m, or Dollars 1.77 a
share, against a loss of Dollars 529m, or Dollars 5.68, in the same period
last year when the company took accounting charges. Income from the document
processing business was Dollars 125m, or Dollars 1.12, against Dollars 103m,
or 91 cents. Revenues were unchanged at Dollars 3.3bn.
Mr Allaire said that after the second quarter, 'we expect sales momentum to
increase as we realise the benefits of the sales reorganisation'.
His comments, in a conference with security analysts, were made in view of
the planned offering of 6m shares, announced in March, which the company
said would go ahead this summer.

<TEXT>
ASTRA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday said pre-tax profit rose
63 per cent to SKr1.74bn (Dollars 236.7m) in the first three months, but it
warned that profit growth over the rest of the year would be slower.
The latest figure was at the top end of stock market expectations and
compared with a profit of SKr1.06bn in the same 1992 period.
'Given the large revaluations during the fourth quarter of 1992, the profit
development for the whole of 1993 will not reach the same rate as during the
first quarter,' the company stated.
Sales for the quarter rose 36 per cent to SKr5.02bn from SKr3.70bn, although
excluding currency factors, the increase was 16 per cent.
The company said it had strong volume growth in many markets, particularly
the UK and France. But sales in its most important market, Germany, fell 16
per cent because of what it called 'political interference' in the country's
pharmaceutical industry.
Sales of Losec, the company's anti-peptic ulcer drug, rose to SKr1.5bn from
SKr991m, although if sales through licensees are included, the figure rose
to SKr2.64bn from SKr1.55bn.

European demand and high one-off costs in North America for a 20 per cent
fall in first-quarter profits.
Income after financial items fell to SKr202m (Dollars 27.5m) from SKr253m,
which was towards the lower end of stock-market expectations. Sales,
benefiting from the weaker krona, advanced 23 per cent to SKr24bn from
SKr19.5bn.
The group said the downturn in demand was particularly sharp in Sweden and
Spain, while there was no upturn in the UK and Germany.
While demand in North America continued to rise, one-off costs for product
launches, production transfers and the recall of a dishwasher series meant
operating income fell.
Operating income after depreciation rose 4 per cent to SKr643m from SKr618m.
The group said its competitive position was stronger, following
restructuring and changes in currency rates, and operating income had risen
in most countries apart from North America and Spain.
In both household appliances and commercial appliances, operating income was
down, while there was an upturn in the group's other main divisions, outdoor
products and industrial products.
The household appliance result was dragged down by a SKr300m drop in income
from North America and Spain. Electrolux blamed the situation in Spain on a
weak market and an inflexible labour market.
Nevertheless, volumes rose in both Europe and the US in the household
appliances sector, with sales rising to SKr13.15bn from SKr10.98bn.
Sales in the outdoor products division rose to SKr3.96bn from SKr2.74bn and
in industrial products to SKr4.37bn from SKr3.49bn. Both units improved
their operating result thanks to restructuring and an improving performance
in North America.
Commercial appliances lifted sales to SKr2.29bn from SKr2.02bn but operating
income fell because of weak market conditions.

FOSTER'S, the Australian brewer, is to expand into China, the world's
fastest-growing beer market.
The group's Carlton and United Breweries subsidiary yesterday announced a
ADollars 120m (USDollars 84.3m) joint venture with Huaguang Brewery in
Shanghai. Mr Ted Kunkel, chief executive, said Foster's expected to brew as
much beer in China within five years as it does in Australia.
The joint venture is the start of a ADollars 200m investment strategy in
China over the next seven years. Mr Kunkel said the aim was not to
'Fosterise' China, but to develop a range of local and regional brands. It
would brew Foster's as its 'international premium brand' in due course.
'This historic step into China is a critical strategic move for long-term
growth,' Mr Kunkel said. 'I expect it to become our fourth brewing arm,
joining CUB in Australasia, Courage in England and Molson Breweries in North
America.'
The project, in which Foster's is providing 60 per cent of the investment,
involves upgrading the existing brewery and developing a large new operation
in Shanghai's Pudong development zone.
Mr Kunkel said Foster's was also looking at joint ventures in other parts of
China.
Huaguang is one of Shanghai's leading brewers, servicing China's biggest
city of 13m people and a huge population in the Yangtze delta. Its
better-known brands include Guangming and Shanghai. CUB executives believe
the latter has international potential.
Huaguang said the state-owned company hoped to dominate the Shanghai market
through its CUB joint venture. Huaguang's market share is 20 per cent.
Mr Kunkel expects China to replace the US as the world's largest beer market
within 10 years, and to overtake Germany as the second-biggest market within
four years.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Degussa hit by health reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals and drugs group, yesterday unveiled a
sharp profits reversal in the early months of the year.
Blaming the state of the domestic and world economy and recently-introduced
health reforms in Germany, Degussa said that group pre-tax profits in the
six months to the end of March dropped 27 per cent to DM77m (Dollars 47.8m).
It predicted it would not be able to make this much profit in the second
half.
The poor result follows a 14 per cent increase in profits in the first three
months of the group's financial year, when the figure rose to DM49m. This
means that from the first to the second quarter of the year profits dropped
by 57 per cent.
Group turnover in the first quarter rose 11 per cent to DM6.9bn, although
Degussa said this was due to changes in group structure and an increase in
metals trading turnover. Without these special factors, turnover would have
fallen by 1 per cent.
Degussa blamed the change in fortunes on the weakness of domestic and world
economies, which hit all business areas but especially the group's metal
activities. The pharmaceutical division was hard hit by German health
service reforms introduced in January.
These were designed to oblige patients to pay more for treatment and have
led to what Degussa called 'substantial losses in turnover and profits' in
its pharmaceutical activities, which account for 20 per cent of turnover.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Continental sees return to
profit

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL will make a profit again this year in spite of a 'miserable'
first two months, and may be able to pay its first dividend since 1990, the
chief executive of the German tyre company said yesterday.
Mr Hubertus von Grunberg said group sales in the first quarter dropped by
10.3 per cent to DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.36bn). Profits fell by a similar amount,
reflecting weak demand from carmakers and poor conditions in the market for
replacement tyres. Sales of tyres for passenger vehicles fell by 6 per cent
in Europe and the US.
Mr von Grunberg's comments come shortly after Continental announced that it
made net profits of DM133m for last year, after a loss of DM128.2m in 1991.
This implied a sharp deterioration in the second half of last year, as the
group made DM118m profit in the first half of 1992 alone.
In spite of the profits recovery, Continental said that it would be
premature to pay a dividend for 1992.
The chief executive said that this year's figures would be boosted by the
fact that General Tire, the group's US subsidiary, would return to the black
after several years of heavy losses. This would offset poor market
conditions in Europe. Business conditions had been 'miserable' in January
and February but had improved in March and April, Mr von Grunberg said,
noting that the quarter had not proved as bad as had been feared.

JAPAN'S leading brokers yesterday reported weak earnings, including the
first pre-tax loss at Daiwa Securities since 1964, but confidently declared
that the three-year collapse of Tokyo stock prices was over.
The stock market recovery boosted commissions in the last weeks of the year
ended March.
Nomura Securities, the largest house, reported a pre-tax profit of Y2.4bn
(Dollars 21.5m), down 94.6 per cent, but managed to avoid the loss that had
earlier seemed inevitable.
Daiwa, the second largest house, had a pre-tax loss of Y7.3bn, compared to a
profit of Y9.3bn. while Yamaichi Securities announced another embarrassing
loss, Y37.4bn, following a loss of Y36.5bn in 1991-92. The houses reported a
fall in stock commissions and underwriting income, and all had valuation
losses on their securities holdings.
Japan's 10 second-tier brokers all reported losses for the year, and a sign
of the mounting pressure on their balance sheets was the resignation
yesterday of 15 executives at Yamatane Securities, under reconstruction by
Sakura Bank, a leading commercial bank.
However, even Yamatane, which reported a loss of Y10.4bn, expects to return
to profits this year on the back of a big recovery in share trading volume.
The hope is that the daily turnover of shares on the Tokyo exchange can
average at least 400m, compared to 282m last year.
The broker with the best news was Nikko Securities, which reported a profit
of Y2.5bn, down 19.4 per cent, but topping Nomura. However, only Nomura
reported a net profit, turning in Y3.3bn after tax. The net loss of Y6.5bn
at Nikko compared with Y25.9bn a year earlier.
Nikko's relative success followed a sharp increase in profits on bond
dealing, which were Y28.2bn, up from Y1.2bn, and managed to reduce operating
expenses by almost 18 per cent. Over the last six months, listed brokers
have reduced their offices from 3,150 to 3,000, and cut staff by about 5 per
cent.
Daily turnover of shares in Tokyo was 662m last month, and brokers are
confident that retail investors will return to the stock market in coming
months, if only because a fall in interest rates has reduced their
investment options.
However, there are signs that investor interest in the stock market might
have begun to wane, as trading volumes have slipped in the past two weeks.

FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Weak markets help drive Volvo to
SKr331m deficit
</HEADLINE>

WEAK markets and higher interest payments led to an increased loss after
financial items of SKr331m (Dollars 45m) for Volvo, the Swedish vehicle
group, in the first quarter.
The result, which compares with a SKr248m loss in the same 1992 quarter,
came after a drop in sales of cars and trucks, mainly because of lower
demand in western Europe.
Group debt was SKr7bn higher at the end of the first quarter than a year
ago, and interest expenses rose sharply to SKr388m from SKr123m.
In the first three months, sales rose 14 per cent to SKr22.95bn, although
excluding currency factors and acquisitions they were 2 per cent lower.
The operating loss was much lower at SKr189m, against SKr347m. Although this
reflected a positive SKr250m impact from an accounting change, operating
losses in both car and truck groups were down, in spite of lower sales
volumes.
Car sales rose 15 per cent in value terms to SKr12.63bn, due to the weaker
krona. However, sales dropped to 73,500 vehicles from 80,500.
Volvo increased its share of the weak Swedish market, but lost share in the
UK. However, it increased sales and market share in the US, and strengthened
its position in Japan, south-east Asia and Russia.
Truck sales were 12 per cent higher at SKr8.34bn, although deliveries were
down 8 per cent at 10,800 vehicles.
In Europe, sales fell 39 per cent to 3,600, while US sales climbed 25 per
cent to 4,900 units, although market share was lower.
The group's share of profits from Swedish food and pharmaceutical group
Procordia increased to SKr596m from SKr124m.
Income from Renault, with which Volvo has extensive cross-shareholding
links, fell to SKr236m from SKr387m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT, France's state-owned car and truck group, yesterday announced that
first-quarter profits had tumbled to just FFr240m (Dollars 44.3m) from
FFr2.35bn in the same period of last year, and said that it saw no prospect
of early recovery.
The company said turnover in the quarter fell by less than the general
decline in the European market, with Renault's combined car and truck sales
8 per cent down on the first quarter of 1992, at FFr43.9bn.
However, Renault's first quarter results were dragged down by a FFr238m loss
stemming from the group's 20 per cent stake in Volvo of Sweden, compared
with the FFr180m loss it took in the first quarter of 1992.
The only bright spots in an otherwise sombre picture were a 3 per cent rise
in exports to countries outside Europe, compared with the same period of
last year, and an increase of FFr45m in earnings from its financial service
companies.
'With the economic climate for the second quarter apparently no more
favourable, the prospects for an improvement in the European market are
receding,' the company said.
First-quarter cars sales fell by 8.6 per cent to FFr36.9bn, but sales in the
overall European market fell by 17.2 per cent so that Renault held its
market share.
The same trend occurred in trucks, with Renault sales falling 13.4 per cent
but with the European truck market plunging by 26.6 per cent.
The pessimism of the French car industry has been vocally expressed by Mr
Jacques Calvet, the head of Peugeot, who this week predicted that the
overall decline in European car sales this year would be more than 10 per
cent.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: MCC litigation may realise Dollars 300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATORS to Maxwell Communication Corporation estimate that up Dollars
300m may be realised from litigation connected to the business empire,
according to documents circulated to creditors this week.
No potential defendants are named in the disclosure report, which was sent
to 10,000 creditors around the world. But legal action could include writs
against professional advisers to MCC such as Coopers &amp; Lybrand, its
auditors.
The report to creditors slightly upgrades previous estimates on total
realisations for non-preferential and priority creditors into the range
Dollars 781m - Dollars 1,364m. That excludes any recoveries from litigation.
The latest figures were produced before Reed signed a letter of intent for
the purchase of Official Airline Guide for Dollars 425m.
But Mr Alan Jamieson, one of the joint administrators and a partner at
accountants Price Waterhouse, said yesterday that this price 'falls firmly
within our range'.
The document shows that MCC has preferential and priority claims of Dollars
4m-Dollars 8m and claims from other creditors of Dollars 3.2bn-Dollars
3.6bn.
That would give creditors an estimated dividend in the range 22 per cent to
43 per cent before any recoveries from litigation and the resolution of a
dispute over the ownership of Berlitz shares.
Payment depends on approval by creditors by proxy or at a meeting on July 1
in London of the proposed MCC joint scheme of arrangement under UK
insolvency law and plan of reorganisation under US bankruptcy law.
The US court will then consider the plan on July 14, the English court on
July 21 and the scheme begin at the end of that month if it is approved. Any
claims would need to be received by the end of September, which could clear
the way for an initial payment to creditors in November.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for a market in bonds issued by small and medium-sized unquoted
companies have been launched by the Capital Exchange, a small company which
is attempting to increase the supply of capital to small firms.
Companies which have been trading for at least three years would be able to
issue what would be known as SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) bonds
for amounts of between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 5m.
Capital Exchange hopes to launch the Private Syndicated Funding Scheme later
this year, but will have to obtain approval from the Securities and
Investments Board.
The scheme is intended to make capital available to smaller companies which
face the prospect of the possible closure of the USM and the ending of the
Business Expansion Scheme at the end of this year.
In January the Capital Exchange launched the Capital Exchange Gazette, a
bi-monthly magazine intended to form a meeting place for small businesses
seeking finance and private investors and larger companies looking for
investment opportunities.
The magazine has 400 subscribers, but Capital Exchange hopes to increase
this to 50,000.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Concentric profits expand to Pounds 4.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCENTRIC, the Birmingham-based engineering and components group, raised
pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.52m to Pounds 4.35m in the six months ended
March 31 1993.
Mr Tony Firth, chairman, said hopes that difficulties in continental
European markets would be mitigated by the September devaluation of sterling
had not been fulfilled 'as smoothly as had been hoped'.
The reasons were customers' resistance to price increases, rises in the
costs of raw materials and the severity of the 'collapse' in European
markets.
Turnover on continuing operations rose to Pounds 60.7m (Pounds 58.7m) of
which 28 per cent was exported. Margins improved by a fifth to more than 7
per cent.
More than half of turnover serves the automotive industry. The group had
been somewhat protected from the car industry's downturn because it makes
parts for a range of automotive products from tractors to racing cars.
Concentric Pumps, which supplies oil and water pumps to diesel engines, was
the biggest single contributor to sales after 'problems a couple of years
ago' had been resolved.
Sales of satellite dishes were poor, partly for cyclical reasons. A stock
adjustment was in progress because of changed technical standards.
The group was 'cash positive' following last year's Pounds 12.5m rights
issue. Capital expenditure so far this year, mainly on buildings, was
already more than the Pounds 4.5m spent last year.
An unchanged interim dividend of 1.77p is declared out of earnings of 5.63p
(5.38p).

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BOC shows 11% rise to Pounds 180m - Signs
of UK recovery weak while upturn in US moving erratically
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the industrial gases and drugs group, yesterday reported profits on
ordinary activities before tax up 11 per cent from Pounds 162.1m to Pounds
180.1m for the six months to March 31.
The results were flattered by favourable currency movements. The rate was
Dollars 1.53 to the pound during the six months, compared with Dollars 1.78
over the same period last year. At constant exchange rates the rise was
limited to 3 per cent. The figures were achieved on turnover up 10.4 per
cent from Pounds 1.37bn to Pounds 1.51bn.
A second interim dividend of 11.6p (11p) is to be paid making a total for
the year of 23.2p (22p). Earnings per share for the period came out at
23.55p (21.55p).
The group, which believes its industrial gases businesses represent good
economic indicators, warned that the UK recovery was weak, with the
favourable trend in retail sales filtering only slowly into industrial
activity.
Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, said the upturn in the US was moving erratically
and there were no signs yet that the recovery had staying power.
The impact on demand remained restrained, he warned. Meanwhile, the German
economy was heading for a crisis similar to that faced by the UK in the
early 1980s, he said.
The Japanese economy had hit the trough, he felt, but the north Pacific
markets continued to boom.
Gases and related products reported operating profits up from Pounds 144m to
Pounds 154.1m on turnover of Pounds 1.13bn (Pounds 1bn). Mr Rich said demand
for liquid gases was up, but demand for cylinders was static. Prices and
margins for the businesses remained stable.
Operating profits at the healthcare division increased from Pounds 48.2m to
Pounds 54.9m on sales of Pounds 303.5m (Pounds 255.6m).
The figures masked a deterioration in sales during the second quarter,
following the expiry of the US patents of Forane, the group's best-selling
anaesthetic at the end of January.
Mr Rich said a tough and professional battle was emerging between BOC and
Abbot, the US group which had launched a generic version of Forane.
Headline prices had fallen between 10 per cent and 15 per cent, and data
from IMS, the market research company, suggested BOC had lost 12 per cent
market share by value. Before the expiry it held 70 per cent of the market,
according to analysts. Sales of Suprane, BOC's replacement product, had been
held up by a fire which had disrupted supplies, said Mr Rich.
US trading profits, excluding exchange rates, rose from Pounds 64.4m to
Pounds 77.1m on turnover up at Pounds 560.6m (Pounds 469.8m). European

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional items to add Pounds 82m to C&amp;W
profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, yesterday released a
statement of exceptional items in advance of the publication of its annual
results next month, showing a net contribution of about Pounds 82m to
pre-tax profits.
The City regarded the items as a clearing up exercise, but was more
concerned by the lodging of a peso 10bn (Pounds 245m) damages suit against
C&amp;W by Digitel Telecommunications of the Philippines for alleged failure to
fulfil commitments under a joint project.
There are three exceptional items, to be included in C&amp;W's 1992-93 results
presented under FRS3 accounting standards, comprising a write-down of around
Pounds 96m relating to its undersea cable systems, a profit of Pounds 60m
from the exercise of warrants acquired in the merger leading to the creation
of Telecom Hong Kong in 1988, and a gain of Pounds 118m from the sale last
November of 20 per cent of Mercury, its UK domestic subsidiary.
Mr James Ross, chief executive, said the unusual announcement was to give
the markets 'a clear picture of our underlying trading performance'. It
appeared to be partly a reaction to the unfavourable publicity attracted
last week by British Telecom, which announced a larger than expected deficit
on its pension fund on the day of its results.
Analysts expect C&amp;W to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 800m before
exceptional items, up from Pounds 644m last year.
The damages suit relates to a project to provide telephones in the
Philippines. Digitel claimed yesterday that C&amp;W refused to pay its share of
a deposit on a peso 40bn (Pounds 980m) project on Luzon Island.
C&amp;W, which has a 27 per cent stake in Digitel, declined to comment.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sedgwick slips in opening quarter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-quarter pre-tax profits from the Sedgwick Group of insurance brokers
came to Pounds 40.7m, compared with Pounds 41.5m last time.
Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, said the difficult market conditions
continued, but there were indications that rates were hardening in some
areas of business in the US.
In London there were substantial rates increases in areas such as aviation,
oil and gas, and marine hull business, but there was a marked contraction in
the size and capacity of the market.
For the three months to March 31 brokerage and fees rose 3 per cent at
constant exchange rates.
There was strong growth in continental Europe and Asia Pacific broking
operations, in Sedgwick Payne in the US and in consulting worldwide.
Lower interest rates in the US and UK led to a 27 per cent drop in
investment income, but the profit benefited by Pounds 5.1m as a result of
currency management activities and weaker level of sterling.
Earnings per share for the period worked through at 5.7p (6.4p).

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Capital Exchange launches fund-raising
initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for a market in bonds issued by small and medium-sized unquoted
companies have been launched by the Capital Exchange, a small company which
is attempting to increase the supply of capital to small firms.
Companies which have been trading for at least three years would be able to
issue what would be known as SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) bonds
for amounts of between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 5m.
Capital Exchange hopes to launch the Private Syndicated Funding Scheme later
this year, but will have to obtain approval from the Securities and
Investments Board.
The scheme is intended to make capital available to smaller companies which
face the prospect of the possible closure of the USM and the ending of the
Business Expansion Scheme at the end of this year.
In January the Capital Exchange launched the Capital Exchange Gazette, a
bi-monthly magazine intended to form a meeting place for small businesses
seeking finance and private investors and larger companies looking for
investment opportunities.
The magazine has 400 subscribers, but Capital Exchange hopes to increase
this to 50,000 within three years. The gazette is aimed at companies seeking
between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 250,000. The bond scheme is for companies
wanting larger amounts.
The bonds of companies which pass the audit and management criteria for the
private syndicated funding scheme will be offered to subscribers to the
magazine and to the public by means of a synopsis in the national press.
Bonds would be issued in Pounds 500 denominations. Interest, at an agreed
rate above London Interbank Offered Rate, would be paid on half of the
bonds' nominal value while dividends would be paid on the other half. Under
normal circumstances, Capital Exchange said, companies would be expected to
make dividend payments to bondholders.
Information on bond-issuing companies would be included in the magazine and
Capital Exchange would encourage operation of an after-market.

Narborough Plantations' pre-tax tax profits fell from Pounds 176,000 to

They said that the company was continuing to trade profitably and it
expected to report a profit in 1994.
In 1992 pre-tax profits fell sharply from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 613,000,

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Northern Ireland Electricity makes Pounds
56.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland Electricity, the Belfast-based utility which is to be
privatised next month, made an operating profit of Pounds 56.6m on turnover
of Pounds 452.4m in the year to March 31, according to the pathfinder
prospectus issued yesterday.
This compared with Pounds 15m on Pounds 433.5m in 1992 and Pounds 44.1m on
Pounds 403.6m in 1991. But the prospectus warns that comparisons are
misleading because of the restructuring of the Northern Ireland electricity
industry that occurred in 1992.
Restructuring costs also accounted for the low result in 1992.
The bulk of the 1993 result came from the transmission and distribution
business which contributed Pounds 49.3m.
But the company made a Pounds 5.1m loss on its appliance retailing business.
In its latest financial year, NIE paid a total dividend of Pounds 16.5m. The
directors say that they intend to adopt a 'progressive' dividend policy
which, all being well, should produce an increase in real terms.
The pathfinder reveals that the government will be taking Pounds 70m of the
Pounds 85m of cash currently in NIE's balance sheet as repayment for earlier
injections into the company. The government, which will retain a special
non-voting share, will also have the right to half of any capital gains on
asset sales made by the company over a ten-year period.
The NIE issue, which is expected to value the company at between Pounds 300m
and Pounds 400m, will be priced on June 3. Applications for shares must be
in by 10am on June 16.
The basis of allocation will be announced on June 21 and dealings are
expected to commence at the same time.
The government is hoping that up to two thirds of the shares will be bought
by retail investors. People who register by June 1 will be entitled to one
free share for every ten they hold for three years. NIE customers will have
the alternative option of electricity vouchers. Over 600,000 people have
registered so far.
Payment for the shares will be in two instalments, the first on application
and the second on June 28 1994.
NIE is the last of the state-owned non-nuclear electricity companies to be
privatised. Unlike regional companies in England and Wales, it is also in
the transmission business, and it has a different regulator.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fenner passes interim as exceptionals bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FENNER, the Hull-based industrial group which last month revealed
'indications of interest' in the company, is passing its interim dividend
and undergoing a further programme of disposals and rationalisations among
its smaller businesses.
The diversified producer of power transmission equipment, industrial
conveyer belting and fluid power products announced that pre-tax profits in
the six months ended February 28 fell from Pounds 2.28m to Pounds 105,000,
on turnover down slightly from Pounds 97.7m to Pounds 97.2m.
The decline in profits partly reflects a net exceptional charge of Pounds
1.4m. Redundancy and rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.8m, and Pounds 1.2m
of professional fees associated with an aborted merger, were offset by a
Pounds 1.6m profit on the sale of the Fenner Industrial Controls business in
the US.
After minority interests, and a higher overseas tax charge of Pounds 1.7m -
previous tax losses in the US have now been absorbed - there was a loss
attributable to shareholders of Pounds 2.29m or 5.24p a share, compared with
profit of Pounds 174,000 or 0.41p a share a year ago. The interim dividend
in 1991/92 was 1.7p per share.
Mr Peter Barker, chairman, would not give any further information about the
recent bid approaches, but did say that Fenner had previously come 'very
close' to a merger that would have benefited shareholders.
The aborted merger talks, and the uncertainty over the future of the UK coal
industry had been major factors in Fenner's first-half performance, where a
further decline in demand had been the background to trading.
Demand from British Coal for Fenner's conveyer belting had fallen by
one-third year-on year in the first half. But Mr Julian Bigden, group
managing director, said Fenner had managed to offset some of the decline
with increased overseas business, and had letters of intent to sell belting
to the Ukraine.
In the power transmission business, UK demand had been affected severely by
trading conditions, although Mr Bigden said there were signs that it was
picking up. But continental European markets for power transmission products
were worsening.
Fenner has cut 240 jobs in the financial year to date, reducing the total
workforce to 3,800. Mr Bigden said the planned rationalisation programme was
'a cleaning-up exercise' of underperforming operations which would simplify
the company and increase UK profits through a further reduction in costs.
Mr Barker, who has been Fenner's chairman since 1982 and saw off the bid
from Hawker-Siddeley in 1984, is retiring. Sir James Cleminson will be
acting chairman until Mr Barker's successor is announced.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Elswick near Pounds 2m in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON FARRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELSWICK overcame a tough year, particularly in the last four months, to
produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.91m for the 12 months ended January 31.
Reminding shareholders that trading was weighted towards the first half, Mr
Bill Cross, chairman, said the second period was constrained by unusually
subdued demand in specialised print and packaging, and by particularly
adverse weather which led to Pounds 1m of lost sales in equipment and
services.
Those constraints were not carried over to the current year which had
'started briskly', said Mr Cross.
The accounts comply with FRS 3, and 1991-92 now showed a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.54m after a Pounds 1.68m loss on disposal of Falcon Cycles.
Print and packaging sales rose 8 per cent to Pounds 28.1m, but operating
profit fell to Pounds 2.74m (Pounds 2.81m) after Pounds 150,000
non-recurring expenditure on a new offset litho press.
Earnings per share came to 0.78p (losses 0.82p). The final dividend is 0.15p
for a total of 0.3p (0.22p).
Mr Cross is retiring as chairman on July 22 and will be succeeded by Lord
Lane.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Newcomer Linx issues profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINX Printing Technologies, the manufacturer of continuous ink-jet printing
equipment, yesterday shocked the market with a profits warning just six
months after its listing.
The shares fell 36p to 139p, some 9p above the price at which they were
placed last October. The warning comes six weeks after a similar statement
from Domino Printing Sciences, its larger UK rival.
The unexpected difficulties both companies have come up against suggest
their products have met greater than expected competition from Videojet, of
the US, and Imaje, of France.
Linx said pre-tax profit this year would be 'around the same level' as the
Pounds 1.64m achieved in the year ended June 30 1992, and lower than it
expected at the time of the interim results on March 3. It still intended to
recommend a final dividend of 1.73p, giving 2.08p for 1992-93.
The market had been expecting profits of about Pounds 2.2m.
Shortly after the interim statement, Mr Derek Harris, chairman, sold 300,000
shares at 183p. That was for personal reasons and he retains 500,000 shares.
In the interim statement Linx said sales in Europe, including the UK, had
risen. There was strong growth in France and Italy and slower progress in
Germany and the UK.
Yesterday it conceded that sales had suffered 'particularly in the UK and
Germany due to tighter market conditions caused by recession.
It was reviewing the sales and marketing strategy in Europe.
Mr Harris said the company had been expecting to sell significantly more in
the second half. As the product carried high gross margins, any reduction in
sales had a large impact on the bottom line.
'At the time of the interims we had no idea (about the lower sales)', said
Mr Harris.
Shares in Domino Printing fell 11p to 508p after its profit warning.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil makes hostile bid for Securiguard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENTOKIL Group, the environmental and property services company, yesterday
launched a hostile Pounds 59.2m all cash bid for Securiguard, the provider
of security and cleaning services in the UK and US.
The offer was rejected by Securiguard's board, who said it 'significantly'
undervalued the company and advised shareholders not to sell.
The 270p a share offer represented a 46 per cent premium to Securiguard's
closing price on Monday of 185p. Following Securiguard's rejection, its
shares closed 19p above the offer price at 289p, suggesting the market
expected Rentokil to raise its offer.
'People can see how this deal will help Rentokil's earnings and so expect
them to go a bit higher to get the bid recommended,' an analyst said.
Mr Clive Thompson, Rentokil's chief executive, said the company saw security
and guarding services as a good fit with its other business services, like
property management. Securiguard's cleaning activities, expanded in 1990
through the purchase of Madison, could fit with Rentokil's office cleaning
activities, Mr Thompson said.
Rentokil appeared less interested in Securiguard's other divisions,
communications and personnel.
Securiguard, which gained a full listing in 1987, has seen its shares
underperform since 1990 because of fears about the quality of its management
and business. Although it holds some high profile contracts, such as
providing security for New York's Kennedy airport, its cleaning division is
thought to be skewed towards low margin, local authority business.
In the year to November, the company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
5.74m on sales of Pounds 165.1m. One stock market analyst expects profits
this year of Pounds 6.2m, putting the shares on 13.8 times earnings at
yesterday's closing price.
Securiguard had net assets of Pounds 2.68m at its year end. Rentokil said it
would need to write off about Pounds 57m in goodwill if the bid succeeded.
According to analysts, the acquisition would enhance short term earnings at
Rentokil, which had net cash of Pounds 60.2m at December 31. However, the
company's shares fell 4p to 193p on concerns about longer term earnings
growth and questions about the quality of Securiguard's profits.
Mr Thompson said Rentokil believed customers increasingly wanted quality
security services and this would allow improved margins.
Securiguard employs about 15,000 people, including part time workers.
Rentokil is making the offer through its financial adviser County NatWest.
Securiguard is advised by BZW.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Warburg in US expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG WARBURG is to purchase KC-CO, a Chicago-based derivatives trading
partnership, as part of a drive to expand its derivatives business.
KC-CO has seats on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Founded in 1985, the 60-strong firm had net assets of Dollars
22.4m as at December 31.
Other the past few years, many of Chicago's specialist derivatives firms
have been bought by larger institutions.
The terms of the KC-CO acquisition, while not fully disclosed, include SG
Warburg Group ordinary shares to a value of Dollars 15m and warrants to
subscribe for a further 9.75m shares.
However, the deal is subject to restrictions, principally continued service
by former partners of KC-CO for a period of up to five years.
The right to exercise most of the warrants, which carry a strike price of
800p and are exercisable between four and 10 years after completion, is
subject to SG Warburg ordinary shares having reached certain threshold
levels up to Pounds 10.50 within the next four years.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Prudence pays dividends for M&amp;S
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT doesn't worry me if I'm not described as entrepreneurial and all those
other business-school adjectives,' says Sir Richard Greenbury, Marks and
Spencer's chairman and chief executive. 'I'm quite prepared to be a tortoise
provided we get there.'
Sir Richard's cautious prudence has paid off. M&amp;S yesterday snatched back
the crown of the UK's most profitable retailer.
The Stock Market's downbeat reaction surprised some analysts, who suggested
the City was concerned about a wage settlement that will add 6 per cent to
M&amp;S's wage bills, and was disappointed that sales growth was not greater.
But, as one analyst put it, 'Marks and Spencer has never been a top-line
story'. The company makes money by being a superbly-run operation, and that
was perhaps more true this year than ever, with pre-tax profits up 10 per
cent even stripping out last year's exceptional items, on turnover up only
3.4 per cent overall.
Improvements in information technology helped M&amp;S keep firmer control of its
stock, avoiding the need to discount to get rid of surpluses as many other
retailers do.
That technology has also improved distribution, enabling M&amp;S to respond
quickly to changes in fashions, and keep operating costs down. The result
was a 6.8 per cent rise in UK operating profits, on turnover up only 1.8 per
cent.
The improvements in efficiency also enabled M&amp;S to freeze prices for 75 per
cent of its clothing, and reduce prices for 25 per cent by cutting its
buying margins.
Profits were also boosted by improved performances abroad. Sales in
continental Europe increased 22 per cent, while operating profits were up 15
per cent to Pounds 27m. In North America, there was evidence that the
company's homegrown expertise was bearing fruit. The Canadian operations
climbed out of the red for the first time, with an operating profit of
Pounds 0.1m, after the closure of 30 stores and a 55 per cent reduction in
staffing in the past two years.
Brooks Brothers in the US increased operating profits by 20 per cent - the
third successive rise - while Kings Super Markets also saw operating profits
grow 20 per cent. In the Far East, improved merchandise values, cataloguing
and distribution lifted sales 64 per cent, and operating profits 68 per cent
to Pounds 10.6m.
As UK consumers start spending again, and the company steps up its overseas
expansion, M&amp;S looks likely to remain a tortoise to watch.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Hanson improves to Pounds 507m - More than
Pounds 8bn cash available for a big takeover bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday reported pre-tax profits
slightly higher at Pounds 507m, compared with Pounds 500m, in the half year
to March 31, after Pounds 47m of profits on disposals from discontinued
operations and fixed assets.
Trading profits rose from Pounds 449m to Pounds 465m on increased sales of
Pounds 4.8bn (Pounds 4.17bn). The stronger dollar accounted for up to Pounds
30m of profits.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 8.5p to 7.7p. The divided is held
at 2.85p.
The group's net debt more than doubled to Pounds 1.59bn, although more than
Pounds 700m of the increase was due to the rise in the value of the dollar
debt.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said: 'With more than Pounds 8bn of cash
we have the resources to write a mammoth cheque; if underperforming
companies think Hanson is not in a position to do big takeovers they could
be in for a nasty shock.'
Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, the group's US arm,
said while large acquisitions would continue to be part of the group's
strategy the greatest potential for growth would come from 'continued
capital investment in our businesses'.
Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 110m to Pounds 144m. The tax charge
increased from Pounds 87m to Pounds 134m.
The US consumer businesses increased operating profits from Pounds 46m to
Pounds 63m offseting a disappointing result from Peabody Coal, suffering
from industrial action, which saw profits fall from Pounds 69m to Pounds
54m.
Despite Cavenham Forest Industries' increased profits of Pounds 50m (Pounds
34m), the overall Pounds 3m increase in building products to Pounds 92m was
less than expected because aggregates saw its profits fall from Pounds 14m
to Pounds 2m.
Group pre-tax profits included Pounds 20m profit on the sale of Weber
Aircraft; Pounds 7m from selling half its stake in Wassall, the
mini-conglomerate, and a further Pounds 20m from the granting of additional
rights to Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management group, at landfill sites.
COMMENT
Notwithstanding Hanson's ability to write a big cheque, talk of the group's
greatest potential coming from existing businesses and bolt-on acquisitions
appears to underline the growing influence of the new mangement. If so, then
Hanson must be judged by the profitability of its mainstream business. The
best that can be said is that on balance the group performed credibly. While
consumer businesses out-performed market expectations, building products
fared worse. There remain nagging financial problems, such as the higher tax
charge, the unwinding of its interest rate arbitrage position and net
provisions of Pounds 144m. Recent changes in advance corporation tax and the
fact that interest income fell by just Pounds 8m to Pounds 36m may indicate
that some of those fears could be exaggerated. With forecast full year
earnings of Pounds 1.15bn the shares - down 5 1/4 p to 237 3/4 p - are
fairly priced on a prospective multiple of 13.6.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Banque Indosuez considers listing for
Gartmore shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE INDOSUEZ, the French investment bank, announced yesterday that it was
considering listing the shares of Gartmore, the UK fund manager, on the
London Stock Exchange.
Banque Indosuez will retain a controlling interest and is expected to sell
anywhere from 25 per cent to 49 per cent of its stake. Gartmore was
purchased from British and Commonwealth for Pounds 132m and it is now
capitalised at between an estimated Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m.
Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, said that so far there were no
immediate flotation plans and investment advisers had not yet been retained.
'We made an announcement at an early stage because in the nature of our
business we regularly have to answer questions from clients about our
ownership,' Mr Myners said. The company felt a public announcement was
preferable to allowing a leak of a planned flotation to raise questions
about Gartmore's future.
Over the past five years Gartmore has become one of Britain's most
successful fund management companies. Assets under management have soared
from Pounds 6.3bn in April 1990, when it was acquired by Banque Indosuez to
Pounds 14.5bn in April 1993. It now ranks as one of the so-called 'Big Four'
of UK fund managers handling pension fund accounts which have attracted a
disproportionate amount of the business due to consistently above-average
investment returns.
Its performance in its long-term balanced pools have been well above the
median for the past 4 1/2 years and last year the median return on its
segregated pension fund pool was 26 per cent. This compares with an industry
median of 21.8 per cent according to Combined Actuarial Performance
Services, a performance measurement group.
Roughly 80 per cent of the company's assets under management are those of UK
pension schemes, and Mr Myners said Gartmore is seeking to diversify the
source of its business.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fisons' chairman rejects call for merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS' chairman, Sir Patrick Egan, yesterday rejected calls at the group's
annual general meeting for the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment
company to merge with another group.
A shareholder said the new management had 'totally lost credibility'
following the decision to cease developing tipredane, a potentially
important asthma treatment, and what Sir Patrick admitted had been a
disappointing year.
The shareholder said: 'Maybe now is the time to consider a merger so
shareholders can look forward to some future growth.'
Sir Patrick said the company was continuing to put its house in order. 'We
are confident we now have the right strategies and capital investment in R&amp;D
to create further growth for shareholders,' he explained. He added that the
group would continue to look for collaborative alliances.
He warned, however, that Fisons' growth during the first half of 1993 would
be held back by the recession on the Continent and pressure on margins
scientific instruments This business had had a very difficult time last
year, said Sir Patrick.
Meanwhile, the group announced it had agreed to sell its North American
horticulture business to Macluan Capital Corporation, the Vancouver-based
group, for Dollars 60m (Pounds 39m) cash.
The Fisons business had turnover of about Dollars 85m last year and
operating profits of about Dollars 14m. Proceeds would be used to reduce
borrowings.
The UK business and two small Continental operations were still for sale.
Sir Patrick claimed they were trading profitably, and warned he would prefer
to keep them rather than sell them at knock-down prices.
Tilade, Fisons' latest asthma treatment, would be launched this month, said
Sir Patrick. He said he expected a licence for the product in Japan later
this year.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Diploma shows improvement to Pounds 8.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIPLOMA, the electronics, building products and special steels group, lifted
pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 8.1m in the six months to March
31.
However, the advance was flattered by the restating of last time's figures
to conform with FRS 3 accounting standards.
As reported, the previous profits emerged at Pounds 6.2m; restated, the
losses of Pounds 1.1m on a disposal and Pounds 2.6m on goodwill have now
become exceptional charges.
Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, said that the six months under review had
been one of 'two contrasting quarters, with considerably greater buoyancy in
the more recent period'.
He said that 'the worst of the long, deep recession appears to be over, if
our own experience over the last few months is indicative'.
As previously, there were two star performers.
Macro, the active components distributor, made profits of Pounds 3.2m on
turnover of Pounds 29m out of the electronic division's Pounds 5.7m and
Pounds 49m totals. It lifted its own profits and sales 75 per cent and 35
per cent respectively.
Mr Thomas added that the smaller Nortronic also performed well, with profits
up 50 per cent.
The other star was IG Lintels, which made Pounds 2.5m of the building
products division's Pounds 2.7m, though the first quarter had been
'unexciting'.
However loss-making Norwood Partitions had to be reorganised and its
workforce halved to 30, resulting in an exceptional debit of Pounds 1.1m.
Again oil sector uncertainty affected steels, though the reorganised H
Whitham increased profitability.
Group turnover was Pounds 74m (Pounds 61.9m) and operating profits Pounds
8.5m (Pounds 5.1m). The interim dividend is hoisted to 3.5p (2.75p), payable
from earnings per share of 10.7p (7.3p).

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Approval for Wellcome's Zovirax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK drugs group, yesterday announced the UK health authorities
had approved its Zovirax herpes treatment for sale over the counter (OTC)
with a prescription at pharmacies.
The approval is for the cream rather than intravenous or oral formulations.
The cream formulation represents about 30 per cent of sales of Zovirax,
Wellcome's best-selling medicine which generated sales of Pounds 586m last
year.
The product should be launched in mid-July, although a Parliamentary order
is required to complete the change in status from prescription-only to OTC.
The group has substantial ambitions for selling Zovirax OTC. In New Zealand,
sales rose 31 per cent during the 12 months after its became available OTC.
For the previous 18 months sales had been static.
Wellcome continues to search for a partner to strengthen its OTC operations
which Mr John Robb, chief executive, believes do not have critical mass. He
argues the business is too dependent upon cough and cold remedies, and does
not have enough presence in continental Europe, north America and
Australasia. The danger, he warns, is that Wellcome could miss out on the
big OTC opportunity presented by Zovirax.
Mr Robb has ruled out OTC acquisitions which are too expensive, but says he
is considering the possibility of a separate joint-venture company, in which
Wellcome could be the junior rather than senior partner. The group has
recently signed a co-promotion agreement with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer in France.
Mr Robb says a collaborative venture for co-development in Japan remained a
high priority.
Wellcome launched Zovirax OTC in Germany last September and this month began
a large television advertising campaign.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RPC to join the market with Pounds 75m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in RPC Group, the plastic packaging company, are to be sold to the
public through an intermediaries offer next week at a price of 125p, valuing
the company at Pounds 75m.
The company is raising Pounds 33.7m net in the sale and the placing
underwritten yesterday by Baring Brothers. The three key directors are not
selling any shares and will not do so for at least a year.
The company will use Pounds 18.8m of the proceeds and will take on some debt
to redeem Pounds 23.1m of preference shares and shares held by employees.
Of 28m shares being placed, 9.8m are subject to recall to satisfy valid
applications from preferential applicants under the intermediaries offer.
At 125p, the company has a historic p/e multiple of 15.1 times. The notional
yield is 3 per cent and the notional net dividend for the year to end-March
1993 is 3p.
RPC was a management buy-out in 1991 from SCA, the Swedish paper and forest
products group. SCA had bought the group from Reedpack, in turn an MBO from
Reed International.
The offer closes at noon on May 25 and trading begins on May 28. It is
underwritten by Baring Brothers and the broker is Cazenove.
COMMENT
RPC has the look of a thoroughly solid company. Cash generation is strong;
it appears, unlike many MBOs, to have invested in its future. And the
applications for polymer based rigid packaging are growing soundly, so it
can expect to take market share from glass, for example. The company is
already producing fine double digit margins, so there can be only limited
improvement here. But as the economy recovers, so growth should emerge
strongly from its largest market sector - paint pots, even if elsewhere
sales are less geared to recovery. The pricing, while by no means ambitious,
is also not overly generous. At 125p, RPC is almost bang in line with rival,
Plysu's prospective multiple of about 14 times. On balance though this a
reasonable rate at which to be getting on board a long-term growth stock
where strong management is already up and running.

FT  19 MAY 93 / BA launches Pounds 442m rights issue as profits drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday launched a Pounds 442m rights issue after
announcing a drop in profits and a doubling in debt.
Pre-tax profits calculated in accordance with the new FRS3 accounting
standard fell 57 per cent to Pounds 185m for the year to March 31.
Borrowings rose by Pounds 1.281bn to Pounds 2.453bn.
The one-for-four rights issue is priced at 245p a share, a 17.5 per cent
discount to Monday's closing price. It will lower the company's
debt-to-equity ratio from 160 per cent to around 100 per cent.
In the last year BA has spent more than Pounds 600m on investments to
strengthen its global presence, including stakes in USAir, Qantas and the
French regional carrier TAT, plus the assets of Dan Air, the former UK
regional airline. It has also announced it is to take over the activities of
Plymouth-based Brymon Aviation.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said the financial performance last year
was 'impressive' considering the tough trading conditions facing the
industry. The future looked 'very promising'.
BA's profits comparison was worsened by the restating of the previous year's
profits in line with FRS3, to include the Pounds 149m gain that year from
the sale of BA's engine overhaul business to General Electric of the US.
Without that gain, pre-tax profits for the year to March 1992 were Pounds
285m. On that basis, last year's profits showed a 35 per cent drop from the
previous year.
Group operating profits fell 9.9 per cent to Pounds 310m on turnover of
Pounds 5.566bn, which was 6.5 per cent higher than the year before.
The airline had an operating loss of Pounds 25m for the fourth quarter
against a Pounds 25m profit a year ago, partly due to one-off items
including higher staff severance costs and an operating loss by the former
Dan Air operations.
Group expenditures rose by 7.7 per cent to Pounds 5.256bn last year. Mr
Robert Ayling, BA's new managing director, said the company's cost reduction
programme had made a significant contribution, producing more than Pounds
150m in savings last year.
BA carried 28.1m passengers last year, an increase of 10.5 per cent. The
passenger load factor rose by 0.6 per cent to 70.8 per cent. The airline
said it was increasing its capacity this summer by 14 per cent and a further
3 per cent next year.
Sir Colin said there was beginning to be some improvement in first and
business class high yielding traffic. 'Given the measures we are taking to
increase revenues and reduce costs, British Airways remains well positioned
to take advantage of improved prospects for 1993 and 1994.'
The total dividend for the year was 10.60p, a rise of 4.1 per cent. The
company paid a second interim dividend of 7.54p a share last month in place
of a final dividend. Earnings per share were 22.3p. BA shares closed in
London 9.5p higher at 306.5p.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Saarstahl files for bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAARSTAHL, the French-owned steelmaker employing 7,200 workers in Saarland,
Germany's traditional steel and coal region, last night filed for bankruptcy
after deciding it could no longer sustain losses running at DM30m (Pounds
12m) a month.
The company, once the bastion of the steel industry in the region, belongs
to the DHS-Dillinger Hutte Saarstahl group, which is 70 per cent owned by
Usinor-Sacilor of France.
'A company with such heavy losses cannot get back on its feet in the
foreseeable future,' a Usinor-Sacilor official said.
Mr Oskar Lafontaine, Saarland's prime minister, tried to reassure local
steelworkers last night by saying that all possible measures would be taken
by the state government to ensure that the company continued part of its
activities for some time.
The Saarland state owns 27.5 per cent of DHS group. A symbolic 2.5 per cent
is held by the Arbed steel group of Luxembourg, which owned the group until
1988.
Usinor-Sacilor said the decision to file for bankruptcy had been taken after
consultation with the state government. It added that bankruptcy proceedings
would not affect the rest of the DHS group, which includes the Dillinger
steel works employing 5,700 workers.
Saarstahl manufactured 2.2m tonnes of steel rods, bars and wire last year.
It announced in March that it would cut nearly half its workforce over the
next 18 months, bringing employment down to 4,500. Ten years ago, Saarstahl
employed 20,000.

FT  19 MAY 93 / LWT buys 14% stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Weekend Television's parent company, LWT (Holdings), yesterday paid
more than Pounds 14m in cash to acquire WH Smith's 14 per cent stake in
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings, another ITV network broadcaster.
The deal highlights the growing number of equity stakes independent
television broadcasters hold in each other. Among these LWT also owns a 20
per cent stake in GMTV, the breakfast television franchise holder, as does
Carlton Communications and Scottish Television. Carlton also has a 19.2 per
cent stake in Central and Central has a 20 per cent stake in Meridian.
At the same time LWT announced that it has been appointed by Yorkshire as
its exclusive agent for the sale of advertising airtime next year.
LWT paid 200p a share for WH Smith's entire holding of slightly more than
7.03m ordinary shares in Yorkshire and also agreed to acquire the 1.97m
warrants held by the high street retailer for 40p each.
The total purchase price for the shares and warrants was Pounds 14.9m and
the deal completes the disposal of WH Smith's television and media
interests.
Under the terms of the initial five-year advertising sales contract, LWT
will receive a fixed annual fee plus commission when Yorkshire's share of
ITV advertising revenue increases above an agreed base point.
Commenting upon the deal, Sir Christopher Bland, LWT's chairman, said LWT
had 'great confidence' in the ability of its sales team to increase
Yorkshire's advertising revenue share, 'which will benefit LWT through the
airtime sales contract and enhance the value of our investment in the
company'.
Both moves came as Yorkshire announced a decline in interim pre-tax profits
which fell from a restated Pounds 9.63m to Pounds 3.79m in the six months to
March 31.
The decline reflects several special factors, including a further Pounds
1.37m charge to cover redundancy costs and the new ITV licence arrangements
which started on January 1.
The latest results, prepared using the new FRS3 accounting standard, also
include Tyne Tees Television for the first time, which helped push
advertising revenues up to Pounds 94.4m from Pounds 75.8m and increase
turnover to Pounds 131.3m from Pounds 101.7m.
Although advertising revenues increased, the company said the underlying
performance was 'not as good as was expected'.
Earnings per share fell to 4.7p from 16.8p, but the interim dividend is
being maintained at 3.3p.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Increased spirits sales help Allied-Lyons to 15% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food, and retailing group, reported a Pounds 10m
increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 620m, in line with market
expectations.
Spirits operations grew but brewing profits were affected by higher bad debt
provisions and the sale of 550 pubs was reflected in lower retailing
profits.
On an FRS3 basis, excluding property, profits before tax for the year to
March 6 rose 15 per cent from Pounds 439m to Pounds 505m.
Mr Tony Hales, chief executive, said the current year had started
encouragingly. Lower interest rates and sterling's devaluation had increased
competitiveness. said.
'Our exports grew last year by over 12 per cent to Pounds 402m and we expect
further benefits this year.'
Trading profits of the spirits and wine operations were 2.4 per cent ahead
at Pounds 421m. Shipments of Ballantine's scotch whisky, the group's most
important brand, rose 7 per cent, while the partnership with Domecq achieved
a 20 per cent increase in sales in Spain. Courvoisier cognac increased share
in the US, UK and in Japan, where shipments were 32 per cent higher in a
market that declined 7 per cent.
Allied also announced yesterday that it is buying Perrier-Jouet/Barton &amp;
Guestier (PJBG), a French distribution operation, from Seagram.
PJBG has handled Ballantine's, the leading premium whisky in France, for 32
years and will provide a base for distribution of other Allied brands. The
deal, for an undisclosed price, will raise the group's control of its
worldwide distribution from 88 per cent to 93 per cent.
Brewing profits fell from Pounds 75m to Pounds 67m, after a charge of Pounds
17m against bad debts. A provision of Pounds 28m has been carried forward
into the current year. Beer volumes - led by Tetley and Castlemaine - rose
in a UK market which declined overall by 2 per cent.
The merger of the brewing operations with those of Carlsberg is expected to
bring benefits from rationalisation in 1994. Five depots have been closed
and another two are due to go.
Retailing profits were Pounds 7m lower at Pounds 217m. Dunkin' Donuts, which
opened a further 240 outlets in the US last year, achieved 11 per cent sales
growth; and Baskin-Robbins sales were ahead of last year's. Victoria Wine
off-licences in the UK recorded sales growth of 6 per cent.
Food manufacturing suffered from the UK recession and profits declined from
Pounds 102m to Pounds 88m.
A revaluation of the group's pubs resulted in a Pounds 312m reduction in
values, of which Pounds 41m was taken to the profit and loss account.
Borrowings were marginally lower at Pounds 1.8m.
Earnings per share improved 3.5 per cent to 35.2p; and a final dividend of
14.05p lifts the total payment 5 per cent to 21p.

FT  19 MAY 93 / M&amp;S up 25% on turnover ahead 3%: Group regains title of most
profitable retailer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKS and Spencer regained the title of the UK's most profitable retailer
yesterday as it lifted its pre-tax profit 25 per cent to Pounds 736.5m.
The clothing and food retailer knocked J Sainsbury, the grocery chain which
last week announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 732.8m, into second place. M&amp;S
said the improvement was due to a pick-up in consumer spending, increased
efficiency, and the success of its 'outstanding value' campaign, which
involved lowering the prices of 25 per cent of its clothing.
The shares, however, fell 9 1/2 p to 345 1/2 p, apparently on worries about
a wage settlement that will add 6 per cent to the wage bill.
Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive, was characteristically
blunt in his reaction to M&amp;S regaining the title it first lost to Sainsbury
last year, quoting the former Liverpool FC manager Mr Bill Shankly: 'We
never worry or concern ourselves with how the other teams are playing, we
are only interested in how we are performing.'
'We are very much on the front foot as we see the consumers coming out of
the trenches,' he added.
Turnover for the year to March 31 increased 3.4 per cent to Pounds 5.9bn.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 736.5m on an FRS3 basis, up 25 per cent on last
year's restated Pounds 588.9m.
Earnings per share increased to 18p from a restated 13.5p, while the total
dividend was raised from 7.1p to 8.1p. Operating margins were boosted from
11.9 per cent to 12.5 per cent.
In the UK and Eire, Sir Richard said clothing sales had improved strongly
thanks partly to its aggressive pricing policy, and the company had
increased volumes and market share. He rejected claims that M&amp;S had been
'screwing' its manufacturers, insisting price reductions had been achieved
by lowering its own buying margins.
Food sales increased by about 5 per cent in the second half, with M&amp;S
retaining its overall market share.
The overseas performance was encouraging, with total sales up 8.5 per cent
to Pounds 736.9m, and the devaluation of sterling helped operating profits
increase 34.6 per cent to Pounds 56m.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Crossrail link wins pledge from PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night bowed to mounting pressure to underline its
commitment to the Pounds 2bn London Crossrail Project by confirming the
legislation needed for it to go ahead will be presented to parliament next
month.
Mr John Major, prime minister, used a speech to the annual dinner of the
Confederation of British Industry to make the announcement, saying the
government was determined to ensure the project was carried out as cost
effectively as possible.
'We want to see the private sector fully involved in London's Crossrail,' Mr
Major said.
He spoke in his address of a process of harnessing government and business
together to build a new prosperity across Britain.
The announcement - which followed Mr Major's chairing of a cabinet committee
called to discuss the scheme's future - will allay fears that the biggest
public transport project planned for central London was heading for
deadlock.
Before yesterday the impression had been building that the government might
not be prepared to take the bill forward without private-sector
participation, while the private sector was not prepared to join in until
the bill had been passed.
It also appears to represent a victory for the department of transport over
the Treasury. The two departments had been in dispute over the spread of
risk between the private and public sectors, with the Treasury insisting
that commercial sponsors should not be allowed to make a return without
risk.
The agreed formula was expected to set the trend for other joint projects -
including the extension of the Jubilee underground line - following a change
of rules announced in the Autumn Statement.
The Crossrail scheme involves building a pair of rail tunnels under central
London connecting Paddington and Liverpool Street, which would allow trains
from east or west to run through the City and West End.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Christopher highlights rift with leading allies on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GULF between the US and its leading allies on Bosnia was underlined
yesterday by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, who said
Washington considered it impossible to implement the Vance-Owen peace plan
for Bosnia 'at the present time'.
His remarks coincided with statements by the European Community and by Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, declaring their continuing
commitment to the international peace plan. Moscow wants to implement the
plan by stages, even though it has not been accepted by the Bosnian Serbs.
Mr Christopher told Congress yesterday it would be futile to attend the
foreign-ministerial meeting at the UN on Friday, proposed by Russia to
discuss implementing a plan 'so strongly rejected by one party'. At the UN
in New York, it was announced that the session had been cancelled.
Announcing the decision after a brief private meeting of members, Mr Yuli
Vorontsov, the Russian delegate, who is the present Council president,
insisted that a ministerial session would still be held, but later. Mr
Christopher nevertheless said he would meet Mr Kozyrev in Washington on
Thursday and Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, early next week in
pursuit of a common allied strategy.
But the US secretary of state said: 'We have not given up on what we think
is the soundest approach - lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia with
whatever compensatory air action may be necessary.' He conceded: 'Our allies
and friends are not prepared to follow this course.'
Mr Christopher added, however, that it was 'not surprising' that it was
taking time to arrive at agreed positions to try and solve 'an historically
difficult and tragic problem' in which atrocities were being committed by
all sides.
The US administration is determined to put Bosnia, albeit temporarily, on
the back burner of policymaking. No questions about Bosnia were put to
President Bill Clinton on Monday night in an hour-long San Diego 'town
meeting' dominated by concerns about the domestic economy.
Meanwhile, Bosnian Moslems and Croats agreed last night to implement parts
of the Vance-Owen plan in areas of fighting between them and adhere to a
ceasefire, Lord Owen said.
Speaking in the town of Medjugorje after talks between the Bosnian Croat
leader, Mr Mate Boban, and Bosnia's Moslem president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic,
Lord Owen called the agreement 'the first important step' towards
implementing the plan.
Joint committees are to be set up in three provinces - Travnik, Mostar and
Zenica - to try and defuse tensions between warring Moslem and Croat
factions.

<TEXT>
The Bank of England points in its inflation report to the disparity between
the government's inflation target and inflationary expectations implicit in
gilts prices. Whether these expectations are measured by extrapolating the
course of short term rates from the yield curve or through the yield
difference between index-linked and conventional gilts, they do not suggest
the public has enduring faith in the authorities' anti-inflation stance. The
bank's rather feeble re-sponse is that this could change over time if
inflation stays within target.
A gradual decline in inflationary expectations would certainly help the
government's massive funding programme. This year, inflation should be well
within range. Next year looks a closer call, partly because the imposition
of VAT on fuel will add 0.4 per cent to retail prices. It would help if
companies relied on volume increases to improve their profits in the
recovery, rather than pushing up their margins at the first sign of
increasing demand. There is some chance of this, both because capacity use
remains low and because manufacturers' margins held up relatively well
during the recession.
Even so the message is one of need for vigilance. The shape of the yield
curve suggests a marginal fall in inflationary expectations since the Bank's
last report. But while monetary policy has to bear the brunt of the battle
against inflation, there is precious little room for lower interest rates.
That could turn out awkwardly if the market does require a steeper yield
curve to absorb all the gilts on offer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new management installed at Allied-Lyons after its foreign exchange
losses in 1991 has had plenty of time to become established, so the company
should by now be starting to see the benefit in its results. But despite
heavy expenditure on restructuring, trading profit remains down in every
division except spirits and wine; even that has grown by a mere 2.4 per cent
despite sterling's devaluation. The charitable explanation is that the
recession is to blame. The nagging worry is that the revitalisation of the
company is not yet complete.
Retailing will not this year have to contend with the disposal of 550 pubs,
while the brewing side has yet to feel the benefits of the Carlsberg-Tetley
alliance. But food margins are down, and if the lack of news on Chateau
Latour is anything to go by, disposals are not yielding as much as they
might. Success on that front would create room for manoeuvre. Gearing at 66
per cent is not uncomfortable, but it is a constraint. Allied's assertion
that it would only launch a rights issue if it had a significant acquisition
in mind is also an admission that it could not easily expand without one.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 3 per cent fall in your share price on the day you turn in an unexpectedly
good 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits must seem scant reward for hard
work. That, sadly, is the cross Marks and Spencer has to bear. Its gross
margins are 36 per cent while its net margins are an astonishing 13 per
cent. Those looking to make a quick buck from economic recovery ogle the
likes of Burton with 50 per cent gross margins but only 3 per cent net
figures and dream of what might be.
Certainly those retailers which suffered in the recession have plenty of
room for improvement. Yet that is to miss the point. Marks has a quality of
earnings which is almost peerless. Even its great rival, J. Sainsbury,
carries greater risks with its massive capital expenditure programme and
very expensive sites. Marks' investment in systems and staff will also
continue to provide long-run productivity gains. Yesterday's angst about the
company's pay award emphasises the conflict. Short-termists worry that Marks
needs to keep volumes growing this year to pay for the 6 per cent rise in
staff costs. That is true as far as it goes, but the company is opening 3
per cent more selling space this year, and its 'outstanding value' promotion
is timed to increase market share at precisely the right moment in the
cycle.
Longer term growth will come from continental Europe. The company has has
finally got its formula right and is expanding into a weak property market.
Rolling out across Europe provides plenty of elbow room for sales growth.
Given that Marks' shares are only 3 per cent higher than they were this time
last year, it may be wondered what management has to do to please.

FT  19 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: BA's flight surcharge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors buying into the privatised British Airways may have anticipated Mr
Peter Lynch's adage: 'I like to buy a company any fool can manage because
eventually one will.' With 40 per cent of the landing slots at the world's
busiest international airport, it was only a matter of time before a more
commercial BA produced the financial goods. The Virgin fiasco aside, BA's
management has proved far from foolish. Profits may have fallen heavily to
Pounds 185m last year but its performance still contrasts favourably with
most international airlines.
Yet yesterday's Pounds 442m rights issue highlights how BA is now raising
its risk profile. Expensive equity finance is being used to help fund BA's
unproven globalisation strategy. This consists of spending Pounds 574m on an
array of minority investments in foreign carriers, such as USAir and Qantas,
over which BA exercises limited control. BA hopes industry liberalisation
will permit greater control, leading to substantial scale economies. This,
though, may represent a flight of fancy, given the highly politicised
regulatory environment. Without such reform, it seems improbable that BA's
investments will produce anything like an adequate return. Although
depressed by start-up costs, a Pounds 17m loss from associated investments
in TAT and Deutsche BA hardly represents the most auspicious start.
Comfort may be drawn from the projected decline in the industry's capacity
growth coupled with a pick-up in UK and US passenger demand. This should
work wonders for BA's profits over the next two years. Its operational
gearing is high; a one percentage point rise in capacity yield adds about
Pounds 50m to profits. It would be unfortunate, though, if the timing of the
rights issue allowed these short term blandishments to obscure the longer
term concerns.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Inquiry into carrier contract bids: Audit probe to decide
how VSEL undercut Swan Hunter by Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE, IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMMEDIATE inquiry is to be launched by the National Audit Office into the
bidding war for a helicopter carrier order that left Swan Hunter, the
struggling shipbuilder, facing closure.
The NAO, the government's spending watchdog, decided on the move yesterday
after a meeting between Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general, and
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence select committee.
It hopes to report back to parliament before MPs rise for the summer recess
in July or August.
The inquiry will have to decide, among other things, how the victorious
consortium of Cumbria-based VSEL and the Kvaerner Govan merchant shipyard in
Glasgow was able to undercut Swan by as much as Pounds 50m on an order
believed to be worth about Pounds 170m. Swan Hunter is the last working
shipbuilder in north-east England.
The NAO said yesterday that it aimed to check whether bid procedures were
carried out fairly. The circumstances surrounding the order were the 'kind
of thing' it might have looked into even without Sir Nicholas's approach.
Sir Nicholas said it was 'a matter of concern' that Swan was at risk. 'It is
very worrying. Certain allegations have been made about the way the contract
was tendered.'
The move came as Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East and frontbench
spokesman, claimed additions to the original specifications ordered by the
Ministry of Defence had forced Swan to add Pounds 30m to its original
tender. This led to a final price of about Pounds 200m.
He said Swan had been unable to absorb the cost of the additional work. VSEL
had done so through the 'enormous profits' made on the 'cost-plus' Trident
submarine contract. He wanted the inquiry to reach a conclusion about the
level of subsidy in the VSEL bid.
'The plain truth is that those in the Ministry of Defence and higher up in
the government never had any intention of allowing Swan Hunter to win the
contract.'
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said Mr Brown had not served any good
purpose by suggesting that there had been 'some kind of conspiracy'.
In a separate move, Price Waterhouse - the receiver appointed to Swan's UK
companies last week - confirmed it had reached an agreement with the MoD.
This would permit it to meet this month's wage payment to Swan's 1,750
manual workforce, due this Friday. Under the agreement, work on three Type
23 frigates would continue until at least May 28.
News of the inquiry triggered a mixed response. Mr Stephen Byers, the Labour
MP in whose Wallsend constituency Swan is headquartered, complained it would
not 'save a single job on Tyneside'. Mr David Clark, shadow defence
secretary, said the scope of the inquiry should be expanded.

GERMAN politicians and rank-and-file trade union members last night called
for the resignation of Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the IG Metall
engineering workers' union, from board memberships for alleged
insider-dealing in shares in a Daimler-Benz holding company.
The affair also brought new pressure for an urgent law to ban insider
trading on the German stock exchanges.
Mr Steinkuhler, the leading trade union member on Daimler's supervisory
board, has denied the insider dealing charge but admitted buying almost DM1m
(Pounds 400,000) worth of shares in the holding company, MAH. The shares
increased in value by almost 20 per cent after a Daimler board decision to
exchange them for full company shares.
Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democratic party in the ruling
coalition in Bonn, said Mr Steinkuhler should resign all his supervisory
board positions - in Volkswagen, Thyssen and Daimler-Benz - if there was any
confirmation that he had abused his position.
Mr Heiner Geissler, a deputy leader of the Christian Democrat group in
parliament, and seven works councils at the Mercedes-Benz plant in
Stuttgart, the automobile subsidiary of Daimler, said he should resign.
A senior union official in east Germany, where IG Metall members are on
strike, was clearly shocked by the allegations.
There was also some sympathy, however, for Mr Steinkuhler, who has won a
reputation as a tough and successful negotiator in more than six years as
leader of the country's largest trade union.
The pressure for legislation to outlaw insider trading, promised by the
German government for the end of the year, was stepped up in Frankfurt
yesterday.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Outlook for UK inflation improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S short-term inflation outlook has improved in spite of stronger
than expected economic recovery in the past three months, the Bank of
England said yesterday.
In its latest quarterly inflation report, the Bank said it expected
underlying inflation to stay below its target ceiling of 4 per cent this
year and next. The government measure of underlying inflation is the retail
price index minus mortgage interest payments.
The Bank's report avoided giving any policy advice to the government and
made no mention of its views on future interest rates.
But it made clear that any weakening of sterling after the 5 per cent rise
in its trade weighted value since February would increase the risk of the
target's upper limit being breached.
The Bank said short-term inflation had risen slightly since February:
underlying inflation, when seasonally adjusted and expressed at an
annualised rate, was 4.1 per cent in March compared with December last year,
it said.
But the report said sterling's recent strength had 'lowered slightly' the
underlying inflation rate expected for this year and the chances of the
year-on-year increase exceeding the 4 per cent limit. However, the
government's decision to apply value added tax to domestic fuel and power
from April next year would probably add 0.4 percentage points to the retail
price index at that time and slightly increase the risk of inflation topping
4 per cent in 1994.
Earlier, the Central Statistical Office reported that manufacturing output
recorded its largest quarterly rise for more than four years.
Although manufacturing production in March fell by 0.3 per cent against
February, the CSO said this was largely in reaction to February's sharp rise
in sugar production.
Production between January and March was up by a seasonally adjusted 2 per
cent against the previous quarter, and 2.1 per cent higher than in the
corresponding period a year ago.
A sharp rise in consumer confidence, reported yesterday by Gallup, the
opinion poll company, provided further evidence that recovery was gathering
strength.
In its latest survey of consumer confidence, Gallup recorded its most
positive results for a year with 43 per cent of respondents expecting the
general economic situation to improve over the next 12 months and only 22
per cent forecasting a deterioration.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Personal View: How Workstart should work - Why the
government's Workstart pilots do not capture his original vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS J SNOWER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watch the government's employment policy over the coming weeks, for we are
in danger of losing an opportunity to cut Britain's unemployment rate
dramatically - perhaps by 50 per cent or more - without additional inflation
or cost to the exchequer. The promise lies in the proposal to give the
long-term unemployed the option of using their unemployment benefits to
provide vouchers for employers who hire them. This is the gist of my benefit
transfer programme, on which the government's Workstart initiative is based.
We have much to gain from giving it a try. If employers were paid as much to
provide work as people receive when they are out of work, a substantial
number of jobs is bound to be created. If the amount spent on employment
vouchers does not exceed what would have been spent on unemployment
benefits, the programme will necessarily be costless to the government. And
if the size of the voucher rises with the length of a person's unemployment
spell, the long-term unemployed receive the greatest incentive to become
productive.
The Workstart pilot schemes, however, fall strangely short of this vision.
They are available to just 1,000 people who have been unemployed for more
than two to four years. To hire these people, employers are offered a
subsidy amounting to Pounds 2,340 per year, which falls far short of the
Pounds 8,000 that the average unemployed person costs the taxpayer. In
comparison to what it saves in unemployment benefit, the government is not
offering much.
Beyond that, the pilots do not induce employers to retain employees once
their subsidies have run out. The simplest way of doing this is to provide
incentives for employers to spend the subsidies on training, so that
recruited workers become sufficiently productive to remain employable after
the subsidy period. The chance to promote training while reducing
unemployment is a godsend. People who have completed the government's
existing training programmes often fail to find jobs and, as a result,
workers often have little incentive to participate in them. By contrast,
employers which spend their job subsidies on training would invetiably have
an incentive to provide jobs once the training is completed and to ensure
that this training is appropriate to the jobs. And this training would cost
the exchequer nothing.
Why, then, are the Workstart pilots not designed to exploit these
opportunities? The simple answer, it appears, is that policy makers are
sceptical that this policy can really promote employment. Once the
employment objective has been abandoned, all that remains is to spread the
pain of unemployment more equally.
In my judgment, this approach is misguided. It rests on two dangerous myths.
The first is that Workstart could not create employment because, at the
current level of demand, there is only a fixed number of jobs available,
This overlooks the fact that, by reducing labour costs the subsidies lead
employers to reduce prices, stimulating demand, and to use labour more
intensively.
The second is that Workstart's ability to create jobs would be destroyed by
'deadweight' (when the subsidies are spent on people who would have been
employed anyway) and 'displacement' of existing employees by the unemployed.
But deadweight can be minimised by concentrating the subsidies on the
long-term unemployed, since these people have relatively little chance of
finding jobs. Displacement need not be a big obstacle either. When it is
discouraged - by giving employers bigger subsidies when they can demonstrate
that the new recruits are additions to their workforce - the subsidies
create new jobs directly. And when displacement is permitted, it can create
jobs indirectly by reducing job security of existing employees.
Once these myths are exposed, we can see the crucial issue that policymakers
should be addressing: how to make the Workstart subsidies maximally
effective in promoting employment and training. The more jobs are created,
the less the government will have to spend on unemployment benefits; then it
can afford to pay more generous employment subsidies, so that even more jobs
will be created. But this is precisely where the Workstart pilots will leave
us in the dark.
The Workstart pilots need to regain the vision that inspired them. With more
than 10 per cent of the population unemployed, we have little time to waste.
A programme that gives us the opportunity of slashing unemployment in a
voluntary, costless, non-inflationary way deserves to be adopted on a
national scale without delay.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Bank's report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOOD news is that the Bank of England's best estimate of underlying
inflation over the next 18 months is 3-4 per cent. The bad news is that
people do not believe the government will meet its 1-4 per cent target for
inflation in the long run. The worry is that the costs attendant upon
convincing people they are wrong will so frighten the government that the
sceptics will be proved right.
The Bank of England's latest report on inflation derives estimates of
expected inflation for between two and 25 years from now. Expected annual
inflation, it shows, rises from 4 per cent two years hence to more than 6
per cent 8 years from now, before declining to 5 1/4 per cent. At no point
is annual inflation expected to fall within the target range.
These results ought to make the chancellor weep. But it is not difficult to
see why people are so sceptical. Past performance is one good reason.
Another is the evident temptation. The ratio of net public sector debt to
gross domestic product is expected to jump from 33 1/2 per cent in 1992-93
to 49 3/4 per cent in 1997-98. Such a rapid rise will itself increase the
incentive to inflate, especially when the long-term real rate of interest on
conventional gilts would be double the economy's trend rate of growth,
should the government's inflation target be achieved. The rise in
indebtedness occurs despite the higher taxes announced for future years in
this year's Budget. But it may be doubted whether a weak government will
introduce these increases, never mind the further increases that may be
needed.
The most important reason, however, for questioning the government's
commitment is that achievement of its target may prove inconsistent with
steady economic growth and declining unemployment. 'Looking to the end of
1994 and beyond,' notes the report, 'the principal uncertainty concerns the
response of domestic factor costs - wages and profits - to the loss of
purchasing power resulting from depreciation of the currency.'
The long-term future for wages, both nominal and real, is the principal
doubt. If nominal wage growth were too high, the target for inflation would
either not be met or it would be met at the expense of a renewed squeeze on
profits, employment and growth. If real wage growth were to be too high,
inflation might be low, but growth would fail to reduce unemployment by any
large amount. Either way the government might panic and try to go for
growth, whatever the risks for inflation.
It is not good enough for the government to be determined to achieve its
target. It must convince others it is determined. Otherwise, the costs of
the achievement could prove excessive and the achievement itself
correspondingly less plausible. Sensible policymakers would be exploring
every possible means, including independence for the Bank of England, to
obtain the credibility that still eludes them.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Reign in Spain is put to the test: Recession and corruption
scandals threaten to unseat Felipe Gonzalez in three weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just a year ago, as Spain was celebrating the opening of the World's Fair in
Seville and preparing for what would be a glorious summer Olympics, few
could have predicted how quickly the tide would turn against Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez. An economy mired in recession and a wave of corruption
accusations against his Socialist party have turned the general election on
June 6 into a cliffhanger.
The election is being fought against the backdrop of last Thursday's 8 per
cent devaluation of the peseta, the third in eight months, and a crippling
economic slowdown. In the first quarter of the year 253,000 people lost
their jobs, almost 3,000 a day, to take Spanish unemployment to an historic
3.3m, or 21.7 per cent of the working population. This means 1m more people
are out of work now than in 1982, when Mr Gonzalez's Socialists came to
power.
Soaring unemployment merely compounds a gloomy economic picture. The deficit
on Spain's current account, in surplus until 1988, reached 3.3 per cent of
gross domestic product last year, though the recession is now causing it to
fall. The country had the second-highest trade deficit in the west last year
at Dollars 29.2bn. The government, which has overshot public spending
targets by up to 60 per cent in three of the past four years, has been
forced to delay promised personal tax cuts to prop up own finances.
But Mr Gonzalez is not fighting only on the economic front. The Socialists
face a series of corruption allegations over illegal party financing which
have undermined his credibility. He tried, and failed, earlier this year, to
persuade party officials, usually hostile to many government's economic
policies, to take responsibility for the irregularities but nobody was
willing to resign.
Outmanoeuvred and aware that the poor relationship between the government
and the party could not be easily smoothed over, Mr Gonzalez gambled on a
snap election, bringing the vote forward by about five months.
The essence of the gamble was simple. The economy would not show an upturn
before the election and, thus, the Socialists would probably lose their
overall majority in parliament. But Mr Gonzalez was confident the opinion
polls were accurate in showing him to be more popular leader than Mr Jose
Maria Aznar, the young new leader of the conservative opposition, the
Partido Popular (PP), and thus he might keep his job as prime minister. He
was banking on Spain voting, as before, for a strong political leader, and
not concentrating on subtle differences of policy.
The gamble was risky, but it was beginning to pay off: by last Thursday, the
Socialists had crept back into the lead in some polls after trailing at the
beginning of the campaign. With half the electorate still declaring
themselves undecided, the assumption took hold that Mr Gonzalez, rather than
Mr Aznar, had the best chance of winning them over. Most undecided voters
are disillusioned former Socialists who, according to a European diplomat in
Madrid, 'are just waiting for Felipe to give them a reason to stay with him
one more time'.
Then came last week's devaluation. It was a bitter blow to the prime
minister. It coincided with the announcement of a big leap in unemployment
and an uncomfortable 0.4 percentage point increase in inflation in April, to
an annualised rate of 4.6 per cent.
The gamble suddenly looked shaky. But, by early this week, it was difficult
to detect signs that the PP had been able to capitalise on 'Black Thursday'
and put itself decisively at the front of the race. Polls in next Sunday's
newspapers could tell a different story. At this point, however, and despite
the bad news, Mr Gonzalez is still very much in the race.
Partly, this resilience can be explained by the fact that official figures
do not reveal the truth about the economy. Real unemployment is much lower
than the official 3.3m and Mr Gonzalez himself reckons Spain's black economy
might be half as big again as the official Dollars 478.2bn gross domestic
product figure for last year. A few weeks ago, 400,000 small Spanish
investors bid for shares in the partial privatisation of the state's
Argentaria bank. The issue was oversubscribed nearly five times.
Mr Gonzalez is also helped by Mr Aznar's failure to present himself to
voters as a clear and attractive alternative. While he has been able to
unite his party over the past three years, Mr Aznar has failed to put
forward detailed proposals in the campaign on how to stimulate growth.
Instead, the PP has opened itself to criticism for welding together a vague
set of principles - lower taxes, more privatisations, tighter fiscal control
and maintaining infrastructure spending at current levels - that it is
marketing as its economic platform.
Mr Aznar says he needs to do an audit of the state of the country before
deciding how to revive the economy, something he can do only if and when he
assumes office. He cannot rule out raising taxes if the 'audit' shows the
economy in worse shape than he assumes it is. The problem for the PP is that
it agrees broadly with the government's efforts to encourage the Spanish
economy to converge with the rest of the European Community to meet the
timetable for economic and monetary union.
Mr Juan Lladro, one of Spain's leading businessmen and a producer of fine
porcelain figures, says 'very little' would change if the PP were to win the
general election. 'The PP is, in theory, conservative but, in practice, it
would be the same as the Socialists.'
Both parties agree on the need to contain public spending; freeze taxes and
then cut them later; lower interest rates, now at 11.5 per cent, when
inflation is lower; make it easier for employers to hire and fire; support
the peseta within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System; and use public funds to stimulate employment and investment.
But, says Mr Rodrigo Rato, the PP's finance spokesman: 'I, at least, have my
party behind me when I talk like this. Carlos Solchaga (the Socialist
finance minister) has to fight his party all the time.'
But, even with his party behind him in government, Mr Rato would find life
in the new parliament complicated. Spain's two big regional parties - the
PNV which runs the Basque country and the CiU which runs Catalonia - will be
the main power brokers in what is likely to be a hung parliament. If the
result is close, complex coalition negotiations could seriously delay the
formation of a government and result in new pressures being brought to bear
on the peseta.
The financial markets would expect a new administration to put together an
austerity package to cut the current account deficit and thus help anchor
the peseta at its new parity within the ERM. But the regions would demand a
heavy price for their co-operation in the form of a speedier transfer of
political powers from Madrid in areas such as health, education and taxes.
The Catalans and Basques intend to spend the rest of the campaign playing
the Socialists and the PP off against each other to ensure that both big
parties are as weak as possible after the election. The Socialists and the
PP need to win as many seats outright as possible to lessen dependence on
regional assistance.
For his part, Mr Gonzalez is concentrating on swaying undecided voters. He
could still stumble, but the worst of the economic news is probably behind
him. For many people who voted Socialist in 1989 and who are now wavering,
the main election issue is corruption. Building bridges to those former
supporters who now feel betrayed will be delicate work.
For instance, the Socialist attorney-general recently admitted he had
granted an audience to a former policeman jailed for involvement in a secret
war against exiled Basque terrorist group, ETA. The disclosure has renewed
concern that the government secretly financed this 'dirty war' and may
pardon the policeman. That suspicion could cost Mr Gonzalez the votes of
left-leaning doubters.
But, barring further revelations about the government's fight against ETA
during the 1980s, the odds on Mr Gonzalez's returning to the prime
minister's Moncloa Palace residence after June 6 must remain good. It should
be remembered that, two days before the referendum on whether Spain should
stay in Nato in 1986, polls showed Mr Gonzalez - who had staked his job on a
Yes vote - losing. He won.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Good news from Denmark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To the palpable relief of every European government the Danes have voted Yes
to the Maastricht treaty. Nowhere will the relief be more intensely felt
than in London, where the probable consequences for Mr John Major's
administration of a second No from Denmark were too shattering to
contemplate. Now the prime minister may focus on rebuilding the Conservative
party, which remains as sorely divided over Britain's place in Europe as
over any issue in its history.
His first task is to get the remaining stages of the ratification procedure
over with as quickly as possible. The bill will return to the Commons for
third reading tomorrow. Since Labour plans to abstain, the bill is likely to
pass with a convincing majority. The anti-Maastricht rebels will mount a
further assault in the Lords, but the government is confident that it has a
majority there. It also believes that it can see off further challenges,
such as the planned final debate on the social chapter, and lawsuits likely
to be sponsored by Conservative dissidents (to be heard in the British
courts) and trade unionists (to be heard, ultimately, in the European
Court). This lengthy tidying-up process may seem hazardous, but the positive
Danish vote changes the political climate in which it will be undertaken.
So much for Maastricht itself. The damage that this imperfect treaty has
done to the British body politic remains. Mr Major's best bet is to be true
to his convictions, in the expectation that if he does so the broad mass of
his party will rally behind him. A cabinet reshuffle whose principal effect
was to promote known Thatcherites would be a sign of weakness; Mr Major
should pay more regard to the fitness of the individual for the office than
to the party's factional balance.
For the same reason Mr Major should resist the temptation to pander to the
Eurosceptics. His stated policy, which is to take the lead in tabling
proposals for the 1996 review of the progress of European Union, is in line
with the public's lukewarm Europeanism. He will therefore press for
enlargement, decentralisation, and more emphasis upon intergovernmental
decision-making. Further discussion on whether Britain should return to the
exchange rate mechanism has been indefinitely postponed. This package is
unlikely to play well with continental enthusiasts for a Europe that looks
like a federal state, but it is probably the most the Conservative party
will accept.
It may sound unduly optimistic to propose a period of steady, competent,
undramatic government, but that is what the prime minister will probably now
aim for. He said last week that with a small majority a certain amount of
tacking and trimming was inevitable. Granted, but the Maastricht bill has
been the single most potent cause of parliamentary manoeuvrings. With that
behind him, he has to recover his reputation for down-to-earth
effectiveness.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTEGRATION of German trade unions into the structure of German
capitalism has been an abiding feature of the country's economy this
century. After the second world war, co-operation between trade unionists
and management, especially the joint presence of employees' and
shareholders' representatives on supervisory boards, greatly contributed to
West Germany's industrial recovery.
Sometimes, however, trade unionists are well advised to keep a clear
distance from the seductive world of money-making. By purchasing shares in a
Daimler-Benz holding company shortly before their stock market price rose
sharply, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the IG Metall engineering union leader, and a
member of Daimler's supervisory board, appears to have overstepped the
limits of both propriety and good sense.
Mr Steinkuhler is one of Germany's most gifted and astute union leaders. He
played an important part in the strike in the east German engineering
industry which has just ended with a partial, though probably pyrrhic
victory for IG Metall.
In contrast to Anglo-Saxon countries, insider trading in Germany is not
illegal, although banks and companies run a voluntary code to try to curb
it. As part of efforts to improve Germany's standing as an international
financial centre, the government is planning legislation to outlaw the
practice.
Mr Steinkuhler maintains that his share purchases were not prompted by
inside information. He bought nearly DM1m worth of Mercedes Holding (MAH)
shares in March and April, shortly before a formal supervisory board
decision to dissolve the company, giving MAH shareholders large windfall
profits. Such transactions by a person possessing both a sensitive public
profile and access to insider knowledge displayed an absence of caution, to
say the least.
Apart from anything else, the affair may raise doubts about Mr Steinkuhler's
standing among union members - especially relatively low-paid workers in the
east. Germany's roughly 4m people out of work, some of whom owe their
unemployment to unduly high wage rises since unification, may also ask
bitter questions.
Mr Steinkkuhler's behaviour has evoked uncomfortable memories of earlier
trade union blunders, such as over the Neue Heimat property scandal in the
1980s. He should now co-operate fully in the Frankfurt stock exchange's
insider-dealing inquiries. If suspicions of malpractice are upheld, he will
have no option but to resign.
On a wider front, the incident is a reminder of the temptations facing
individuals from both sides of industry in a corporatist business culture
based upon both consensus and a good deal of secrecy. The affair underlines
the need for more transparency in German business life.

The curse on Shakespeare seems to be spreading. Last February, the Royal
Shakespeare Company's production of Richard III at the Donmar Warehouse had
to be repeatedly put off because Simon Russell Beale, who plays the king,
developed back trouble, possibly from overdoing the hump.
A few Saturdays ago at the National Theatre, Alan Howard had to race through
a key speech as Macbeth before leaving the stage to be audibly sick. The
production was resumed 25 minutes later with an understudy. Now the formal
opening of King Lear, which should have taken place in Stratford last night,
has been postponed because Robert Stephens in the title role has a foot
infection.
Obviously too much fooling about naked in the storm. Word is that he may be
better tomorrow.

U-turns are becoming a fact of life for the prime minister, John Major. But
in excluding John Butterfill, the portly MP for Bournemouth West, from the
committee charged with scrutinising the finance bill, the government has
surpassed itself. This was a U-turn on a U-turn.
When Butterfill's name was missing from the list of committee members
originally published earlier this month, it was described as an 'oversight'
and the omission swiftly rectified.
But Butterfill has been dropped again. This time, according to one committee
member, 'a shady deal' had been hatched between the whips offices excluding
one MP from both leading parties.
Who is supposed to be deceived? All Westminster knows Butterfill is no
friend of the government's planned reform of the North Sea tax regime. His
presence on the committee - which began its deliberations yesterday - would
have resulted in an apparent majority for his proposed changes.

Not before time, the search for Barclays' new chief executive has finally
spread to the US and Observer understands that Tom Johnson, 52, the former
president of Manufacturers Hanover Corporation (now part of Chemical Bank),
has indicated that he's pretty keen.
Nothing official, of course. Head- hunters Spencer Stuart have yet to draw
up a short list and Barclays is still several weeks from making any formal
approaches. But Johnson has been sounded out informally to see whether he
would be interested in the position.
Given that Johnson has not had a high-profile job for nearly a year and a
half now - apart from a two-week stint at troubled real estate developer
Olympia &amp; York where he made an estimated Dollars 3m - it would be
surprising if he didn't show a passing interest in being chief executive of
an international bank which not so long ago regarded Citicorp as one of its
few real rivals.
Then again, Johnson has been mentioned as a possible head honcho of
everything from the FDIC to the New York Fed.
Meanwhile closer to home, rogue banking analyst Terry Smith has spotted that
the UK's three most successful bankers all have the initials BP - Brian
Pitman at Lloyds, Brian Pearse at Midland and Bruce Patullo at Bank of
Scotland.
Though none of these would accept the Barclays job, Smith's advice to
Barclays is to recruit a banker with the same initials. The only candidate
which springs to mind is Peter Burt, also of Bank of Scotland  - though it
is unclear whether the initials work their banking magic when they are in
reverse order.

Among the deft bits of prudent accounting which helped the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales to get out of the red in 1992,
one item stands out. The institute's Pounds 38,000 surplus is more than
accounted for by a doubling, to Pounds 109,000, in income from 'maintenance
of professional and ethical standards' - in other words, a substantial
increase in the number and level of fines against misbehaving members.

Who has the safer job - Jacques Attali, the president of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, or his twin brother Bernard, chairman of
Air France?
Until recently, the betting would have been that Bernard boasted the greater
degree of security, especially since the hullabaloo about the spending
habits of the EBRD. The presidency of the London-based EBRD was never going
to be an easy job, whereas the boss of France's flag carrier has long
enjoyed the support of President Mitterrand.
Now however, not only has the political wind swung round, but Air France's
losses have only been piling higher under Attali's pilotage. If France's new
centre-right government really does intend to match words with action and
adopt a much tougher stance towards state-owned loss-makers, such as SNCF
and Air France, then there could be some truth in the rumours that Peugeot
boss Jacques Calvet may be in the running to take over from Bernard Attali.
Having worked for Valery Giscard d'Estaing at one stage, Calvet's politics
are more in tune with the new government. During his 10 years at Peugeot,
Calvet has proved that he knows how to rationalise a business and cut
borrowings. And when it comes to fighting his corner, he is, if possible,
even more outspoken than British Airways' Lord King who restored the
fortunes of Britain's national flag carrier.

INFORMATION super-highways are becoming the rage on both sides of the
Atlantic. Their advocates argue that such fibre-optic networks would be able
to provide customers not only with basic telephony and cable television
services but a range of advanced services such as video libraries,
high-speed databases and home shopping.
US Vice-President Al Gore has picked up the idea, while a UK parliamentary
select committee has launched an inquiry into the subject. Companies are
also keen. Building such networks was the principal reason for this week's
Dollars 2.5bn investment by telecommunications group US West in Time Warner
Entertainment, a leading US cable television company. BT, the largest UK
telecommunications group, is anxious to get into the business too.
While there is nothing wrong with such enthusiasm, it is important that
information super-highways are built because of genuine consumer demand
rather than out of a desire by politicians and engineers to promote a
captivating new technology. Such a technology-driven approach, dubbed plan
cable, was tried by France in the 1980s and failed.
But if development of such networks is to be left to the market, it is
important that the market is allowed to function freely. Unfortunately, in
both the US and the UK, regulatory barriers prevent the main telephone
companies providing entertainment services over their networks. This
undermines the economics of fibre-optic technology, since the phone
companies are denied the chance to tap an important source of potential
revenue which could be used to pay back their investments.
There seems little reason why this restriction should not be removed in the
US. Mr Gore would be well advised to put his weight behind such deregulation
and abandon his current flirtation with subsidies.
In the UK, the situation is more complicated because the government made a
clear statement only two years ago that the ban would remain until 2001,
subject to possible review in 1998. The idea was to protect fledgling cable
TV companies from competition from BT until they were better established.
This argument was wrong-headed. Governments have no more business to
force-feed competition than they do to force-feed particular technologies.
But, given that the commitment was made, there would have to be compelling
reasons to overturn it. These are lacking since it is highly unlikely that
BT would immediately put fibre into people's homes even if the ban was
removed.
However, there is a compromise which would allow BT to get moving without
going back on promises to the cable industry. This would be for the
government to remove the ban now for those parts of the country where no
cable franchises have been awarded and to indicate that it favours lifting
the ban entirely in 1998.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Letter: An ode to social class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARY SWEET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have just read your excellent article, 'Victim of class action' (May
15). With all the talk about class and classlessness, I feel utterly
confused, and haven't the foggiest idea what, if any, class I am.
But perhaps my late father summed it up perfectly in a poem he used to
recite: 'There were two moles of equal worth; but not it seems of equal
birth. The one who said his blood was blue, was much the bloodiest of the
two'.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Letter: Transfer role of Tecs to further education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANSEL HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Many of us will endorse the headline to your leader 'Tecs in a tangle'
(May 10), but not with your conclusion that the 1,220 directors of Training
and Enterprise Councils are 'generally satisfied with the progress'.
The report on which you are commenting is not based on the responses of the
1,220 members, but on only 506 of them, or 41 per cent. Furthermore, only 17
per cent of the directors were very satisfied with overall progress,
compared with 26 per cent in last year's survey. While last year 7 per cent
thought progress was very unsatisfactory, that figure has increased to 10
per cent.
We should not be surprised that over the four years since the launch of Tecs
their goals have become diffused, the problems of training and retraining
more urgent and the climate for enterprise colder. The temptation is yet
another repackaged initiative and Mr Heseltine, the trade secretary, with
his one-stop shops, has fallen for that temptation.
The most urgent need is for technical and vocational education. In the years
concurrent with the Tecs' confused, faltering steps, the capacity of our
further education colleges, with their more dedicated and motivated staffs,
has transformed what was once called 'that neglected sector'.
I believe, having in the last 10 years served both as the chairman of an
enterprise trust and as the chairman of governors of colleges of further
education, that the latter, directed by professionals, assisted now by
dedicated nominees from the private sector, can provide the vehicle most
likely to deliver what the economy requires.
I urge perhaps not vainly - for the government is constantly tinkering with
its training initiatives - that the Tecs be closed down. Their training role
should be put where it belongs, in the further education sector, the
(lesser) enterprise role into the one-stop shops. As an additional benefit
some of the Pounds 2bn Tec budget would be saved.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Letter: UK brewing industry one of the most competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported on a study by Lehman Brothers which alleged that the UK
wholesale price of lager was twice the level in France and the Netherlands
and that brewer productivity in the UK fell 11 per cent between 1989 and
1991 ('UK brewers top list for dear beer', April 5).
Both these statements are incorrect. Government figures show a productivity
growth of 0.6 per cent between 1989 and 1991. Also, using this short period
does not give the full picture since productivity grew by 21.5 per cent from
1985 to 1991. These figures are based on UK employment data which include
work areas excluded from comparable Continental figures.
On price, the comparisons in the report are for standard lagers defined as
4.5 per cent to 5 per cent alcohol. This may be the right basis for
Continental countries where such beers account for at least 80 per cent of
sales; in the UK they account for a little more than 10 per cent of total
volume. The comparison is therefore between mainstream Continental beers and
specialist UK beers, and is not comparing like with like.
Typical supermarket prices for leading lagers of about 4 per cent convert to
Pounds 106-Pounds 113 a hectolitre. These figures include excise duty and
retailers' gross margins and yet are below the Lehman Brothers wholesale
price, net of all duties, of Pounds 117. Net of duty, but still including
the retailers gross margin, prices fall to Pounds 65-Pounds 70 a barrel.
Overall, it is clear the UK brewing industry is one of the most competitive
in the world, with five national brewers and a large number of smaller
companies providing active competition. This contrasts with most other
countries where there are invariably fewer leading players, and the industry
is often dominated by one or two companies.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Peace and its pieces: Managing difference is crucial to
avoiding war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How can people who feel profoundly different from each other live together
without fighting? In the present state of the world, it is hard to think of
a more urgent question. The disaster of Yugoslavia, not to mention Northern
Ireland, has made Europeans more aware of it. But it is no less urgent in
Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
The usual answer is that what is needed is strong authoritarian government,
feared equally by all. This has not solved the problem of war between states
but it has prevented, or at least contained, conflict within state borders.
The British, the Ottoman, and more recently the Soviet, empires all did this
while they lasted. In each case, the break-up of empire has been accompanied
or followed by bitter inter-communal fighting.
Clearly, such conflicts pose a more serious challenge to democracies, where
people are supposed to rule themselves and the will of the people is
ascertained by majority vote. Majoritarian democracy works only so long as
the citizens of a state feel that they constitute one people. If some of
them feel that they are actually a different people, or part of one, they
will not accept that the others have a right to represent and rule over them
simply by virtue of being more numerous within the state's borders.
How far does democracy depend on 'shared values'? That question was asked,
but not clearly answered, at an Aspen Institute symposium held in Israel two
weeks ago. It is a question that bothers Israelis for two reasons.
First, Israel is a state based on an ideology, Zionism, which is not shared
by two important minorities among its citizens, namely the Arabs and the
orthodox religious Jews.
Second, even among those who do accept Zionism, there is a wide cultural gap
between the founders of the state - European, or Ashkenazi, Jews - and the
Sephardi or oriental Jews, who arrived later but now form the majority. Many
Ashkenazim feel that democracy can be sustained only if the orientals
assimilate European culture and values, whereas many orientals are
determined to maintain their culture and feel they are the victims of
discrimination.
The problem should be familiar to anyone from western Europe, where concern
is often voiced about the supposed threat to democracy from minorities who
cling to Islamic or other 'imported' value systems. And there are now
similar anxieties in the US about the insistence of the Hispanic minority on
retaining its own language and culture. This is seen as a rejection of the
'melting-pot', which successfully fused earlier waves of immigration into a
homogeneous American culture.
At the symposium, a newspaper cutting was handed around, in which it was
reported that the French state has now decided to encourage education in
regional languages, after 800 years of trying to suppress them. Jacobinism,
or forced assimilation, has apparently been abandoned even in its
birthplace. Democracy is now seen as inseparable from pluralism, that is
from freedom for individuals to assert and maintain whatever group identity
seems important to them.
Does that mean that 'shared values' are no longer necessary? I am not sure.
One value at least needs to be shared, namely the acceptance of democracy
itself, or at least willingness to obey the law.
Clearly education has a vital part to play in convincing people that they
are indeed citizens of the state in which they live, with the rights and
obligations that this entails. But attempts to indoctrinate them with an
official or national ideology, or to suppress their inherited loyalty and
culture, are likely to be counter-productive. Witness the general derision
which greeted Lord Tebbit's suggestion, a few years ago, that support for an
overseas cricket team was incompatible with the obligations of British
citizenship.
The problem is more acute where a minority is concentrated in, or
historically identified with, a particular part of a state's territory.
There is then the temptation to think that 'good fences make good
neighbours', and to try and make frontiers correspond to ethnic divisions,
by applying the principle of self-determination. But how does one decide the
size and shape of the territorial unit to which this principle applies? And,
even if applying it solves the problem of the national minority by turning
it into a local majority, all too often the problem then simply reproduces
itself on a smaller scale with a local minority.
Almost inevitably, the process leads to uprooting people from their homes,
which can be done only by coercion. This often involves the most vicious
brutality, as is happening in Bosnia now. In most cases, it must be
preferable for people to find ways of living together without moving either
the frontier or the people themselves.
Precisely to help them do that, last December the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) appointed a High Commissioner for National
Minorities: the former Dutch foreign minister, Mr Max van der Stoel.
It has become a commonplace to say that there are now no good solutions in
Bosnia, and that Europe is paying now for its failure to avert the conflict
through timely preventive diplomacy. Mr van der Stoel is supposed to ensure
that such a fatal mistake is not repeated. Yet he has been given an annual
budget of just Dollars 250,000, and a staff of four. Surely avoiding further
Bosnias deserves a higher priority than that?
By the time you read this I shall have started a seven-week sabbatical,
during which I hope to explore the linguistic frontier between Latins and
Germans, from Dunkirk to Trieste.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Letter: Russia needs backing for targeted projects in
addition to aid at macro-economic level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir RONALD MCINTOSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader of May 13 ('G7's Russian roulette'), rightly underlines the
need for the western democracies to adopt a bolder and more imaginative
approach to Russia's economic problems.
Discussion has so far largely concentrated on the role western aid can play
at the macro-economic level by encouraging tighter budget discipline and
bringing inflation under some sort of control. These are of course essential
objectives which are crucial to the success of the reform process. But
Russia's economic miracle, unlike Germany's since the second world war, will
not be achieved simply - or perhaps even primarily - by macro-economic
policies, however well conceived and executed.
Because of the physical and mental rigidities engendered by years of state
control, macro-economic policy needs to be complemented by well directed and
painstaking action at the micro-economic level. And since tighter budget
discipline will have an adverse effect on most Russians' standard of living
for some time, micro-economic aid should be targeted at projects which are
directly relevant to everyday lives of ordinary citizens.
Technical assistance of the kind supported by the British government's
Know-How Fund has an important part to play in promoting beneficial changes
at the micro-economic level. But something more is required if the
long-suffering Russian people are to be given any hope of tangible
improvements in their standard of living while the macro-economic policies
do their work.
I believe part of the new western aid package should take the form of soft
loans, which would be repayable in foreign currency when the rouble becomes
fully convertible and available for financing new capital projects in such
fields as food processing and healthcare (two sectors where I have direct
experience of current conditions in Russia).
The financing of these projects - which could include such things as
dairies, bakeries, hospitals and medical equipment factories - should be
linked to the continuing provision of western technical assistance and
management expertise.
This approach would in my view meet an urgent human need and be of long-term
benefit (both economic and political) to Russia and the donor countries. It
would fit comfortably with the concept of a 'second Marshall fund' envisaged
in your own leading article.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Europe's new cold warriors: Mars is stepping up its battle
with Unilever in the ice cream market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European cold war between Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products
group, and Mars, the US food manufacturer, is hotting up. This month, a new
front was opened when Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission launched
an investigation into ice cream makers' distribution practices.
The inquiry, which will focus on the Pounds 350m UK market for 'impulse' ice
creams typically sold by small corner shops, marks an important advance for
Mars' three-year legal and regulatory assault on Unilever's grip over ice
cream sales across Europe.
The ferocity of the conflict, and the boisterous public relations campaigns
mounted by the two sides, show that this is no ordinary trade dispute. At
its heart lies a struggle for a rapidly-expanding business worth billions of
pounds a year, which is central to both companies' future.
Unilever is defending a commanding 40 per cent of European ice cream sales,
valued at about Pounds 6bn annually at retail prices. Ice cream is among the
most profitable and fast-growing of all the group's Pounds 11bn worldwide
food operations - owing to a stream of product innovations which have
recently injected new life into a previously unexciting business.
The catalyst was Mars' launch in 1989 of premium-priced ice cream versions
of its chocolate bars. Almost overnight, it created a thriving luxury sector
of the market into which many other manufacturers, including Unilever, have
moved and which is now the industry's biggest source of profits growth.
The problem for Mars is to avoid becoming a victim of its own success, as
rivals increasingly challenge its early lead. The company needs to secure
its position quickly to achieve satisfactory returns from its heavy
investments in ice cream - but also because it is under increasing
competitive pressure in its other businesses worldwide.
Mars' answer has been to attack Unilever's control over distribution and, in
particular, its long-standing use of a practice known as 'cabinet
exclusivity'. This involves supplying freezer cabinets free of charge to
small retailers who sell the bulk of impulse ice creams, on condition that
the freezers do not carry competitors' products.
Hostilities broke out in 1990, when Unilever obtained a court injunction in
Ireland prohibiting Mars ice creams from being stocked in Unilever cabinets.
Mars retaliated by appealing against the ruling and complaining to the
European Commission that the Anglo-Dutch group's distribution methods
violated EC competition law.
Last year, Brussels handed Mars a partial victory by outlawing separate
arrangements used by Unilever and Scholler, a German ice cream producer, to
keep rivals' products out of German retail outlets. The European Commission
expressed reservations about the commercially more important issue of
cabinet exclusivity, but it said it needed time to investigate.
When EC competition authorities will pronounce is not known. Nor is it clear
what will happen if Brussels, the MMC and the Irish court hearing Mars'
appeal reach different conclusions. But for the two companies, at least, the
issues in dispute are clear-cut.
Mars contends that cabinet exclusivity unfairly inhibits entry into the ice
cream market and penalises smaller producers, particularly in the many small
retail outlets which have room for only one freezer.
Unilever counters that it is entitled to exclusive use of its own cabinets,
and that its strength in ice cream stems largely from its products and
marketing expertise. It also points out that six companies have entered the
UK ice cream market in the past five years.
These arguments have failed to convince Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director
general of fair trading. When referring the case to the MMC, he suggested
that cabinet exclusivity was 'a major factor' in the growth of Unilever's
share of ice cream sales and that consumers would benefit if retailers were
free to stock a wider choice of products.
Sir Bryan's stance has heartened Mars. Some food manufacturers and
independent industry experts, however, claim to detect a hint of desperation
in the company's legal campaign and its readiness to shed some of its
habitual secrecy in an effort to drum up favourable publicity.
The campaign comes at a time when the privately-owned Mars is fighting an
uphill battle in established core businesses, notably confectionery, of
which it is the world's largest producer after Nestle of Switzerland.
The company's shares of its three biggest markets - the US, Britain and
Germany - are in decline, in spite of an aggressive marketing effort and
product innovations and relaunches. Rivals are also nibbling away at Mars'
sales of pet food, its other main product line, in several countries.
Some observers attribute these reverses to senior managers' preoccupation
with the ice cream business and to a recent sweeping reorganisation of Mars'
European operations. Several competitors report an unusually large number of
job applications from disaffected Mars executives, who say the company's new
European structure has left them confused about their roles.
Making a success of ice cream appears, therefore, of vital importance to
Mars, which has built a Pounds 20m plant in eastern France to supply the
entire European market. So far, however, its market penetration has been
uneven. Though the company will not disclose its total European ice cream
sales, the bulk is believed still to be in Britain, where it had about 10
per cent of the Pounds 770m ice cream market last year.
Mars' strength in the wrapped impulse sector, which is at the heart of the
distribution battle, depends on whose figures you believe. The company
claims 16 per cent of the UK market last year. Unilever puts Mars' share at
10 per cent. Both agree, though, that Unilever had about two-thirds of the
market, and that Mars' share fell slightly from 1991.
What is clear is that competition in the UK is set to intensify following
Nestles recent acquisition of Clarke Foods, the UK's second largest ice
cream maker. Not only is Nestle the world's biggest food manufacturer; it
also distributes and stocks Mars' ice cream in the 20,000 cabinets it owns.
Nestle will not say whether the arrangement will continue beyond this year.
But that seems doubtful, given that the two companies compete directly in
confectionery and that Nestle says it strongly favours cabinet exclusivity.
No wonder Mars' lawyers are working overtime. But how much does the company
stand to gain if they succeed? Most observers agree that the profits and
sales of Unilever, which has invested Pounds 20m in exclusive cabinets in
the UK alone, could be dented if the practice were banned. But few think the
damage would be severe or long-lasting.
Mars says its products emerged as best-sellers from a recent trial by a
chain of UK newsagents, which replaced freezers supplied by manufacturers
with its own cabinets. Since the trial was instigated and financed by Mars,
though, the results can hardly be deemed conclusive.
But many independent experts think Mars is investing too much faith in its
efforts to open the market. They point out that competitors of all sizes are
still pouring into the premium ice cream business. Many offer broader ranges
than Mars, which has relied entirely on making ice cream versions of its
leading chocolate brands.
'I think Mars is rather behind in the competitive game now,' says Mr Clive
Richardson of stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite. 'It should have won these
legal battles three years ago, when it had the market to itself.'
Undaunted, Mars insists it will press its legal campaign to its conclusion
and is confident of victory. But whatever the courts and regulators decide,
the company's struggle to re-capture its early lead looks as though it may
have only just begun.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Arts: Get down to business - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE FIREMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although work, business and finance occupy over 20m Britons for a large part
of the week, British television covers the area very sparsely. There is
nothing to compare with the old Financial News Network or its successor on
US cable television, CNBC. Neither does British television have anyone to
rival CNN's Lou Dobbs, who presents business and financial news with
urbanity and knowledge. Yet there are dozens of magazines covering the area,
most newspapers have substantial business sections and this newspaper exists
to give over most of its space to it.
The BBC broadcasts The Money Programme for 40 minutes on Sundays and has
Business Breakfast every weekday morning between 6.00 am and 7.00 am. The
ITV network has no business or financial programmes at all. Channel Four
used to have a first-rate popular programme dealing with personal finance
and business, High Interest, but it came to the end of its run recently and
there are no plans to replace it.
The Money Programme is broadcast at an awkward time, starting at 7.00 pm on
Sunday evenings. It gets a smallish audience - around 1.4m was the average
between January and May of this year. BBC 1's Business Breakfast has, on
average, only 199,000 viewers and, according to an analysis by Carat UK,
only 34,000 of them are 'business spenders'. Even Channel Four's down-market
The Big Breakfast gets 41,000 business spender viewers, and Good Morning
Television gets 53,000 of them.
On the basis of the audience figures, then, British broadcasters seem to
have got the balance of supply and demand about right. Or should one apply
the supermarket law that products given less display area disproportionately
undersell those with more area? Or are the programmes just not good enough?
Business Breakfast, which I have been watching recently in the course of my
enquiry, is a peculiar hotch-potch. Presenters read out the latest indices
and the overnight closes. The figures appear as captions at the bottom of
the screen. The information is of limited use to professionals, who would
know the figures already. To the general viewer, the information is as of
much use as periodic announcements of the height of the tide at London
Bridge, which keeps on going up and down and there is nothing you can do
about it.
Business Breakfast has a format borrowed from news magazines. There are two
presenters. The man does most of the difficult stuff, like interviews; the
other presenter is usually a woman, who, among other tasks, has to read out
the overnight indices. This is sometimes done by a presenter who gives the
impression that she is a little challenged arithmetically, since there are
discrepancies between what she reads out and the captions on the screen.
Last week the job was taken on by an escapee from a hair spray
advertisement, with Big Hair Band Second Wife Lip Gloss, which in this
respect at least put the show on a par with Financial News Network.
The format is that the presenters introduce or read the national and
international news, the local news, sports news and weather in a rolling
sequence. They break this up with reports from 'our European business
correspondent' or 'our North American Business Correspondent'. The North
American man reported from California about the wine industry there on the
day last week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassed its previous
all-time closing peak. This was not mentioned on the programme. Those
interviewed by the European correspondent are all suspiciously fluent in
English, which leads one to think that they might not have appeared if they
had not been fluent because of translation difficulties.
Getting knowledgeable guests to travel to the BBC's studios in West London
for a 6.00 am start is obviously difficult. Stockbrokers' analysts must know
about the dangers of agreeing to talk about company results due in an hour:
if they are wrong, they will never forgive themselves, if they are right no
one will remember. As a result, the producers have fallen upon the idea of
importing journalists as 'experts'. This produces the bizarre spectacle of
one journalist, the presenter, asking another journalist, the Expert, about
what other journalists wrote about the day before.
The greatest expert of all came from a regional British daily. Asked to
comment on a photograph in The Sun of several hundred Mercedes cars in a
field, apparently unsold, the expert gave the following baffling response:
'Well, I think Germany is finally having to wake up to the problem of excess
capacity in its industrial base. Britain and America, to a certain extent,
have had over 150 years to move away from industry, from cars and nuts and
bolts, toward high-tech service-orientated industries. Germany and in
particular East Germany has had barely 50 years to do this. And they are now
feeling the crunch. It's going to involve the loss of much capacity and, I
am afraid, very many jobs.'
In this week's Money Programme, the BBC's economics editor, Peter Jay, did
an analysis of Germany's economic situation, relating it to political aims
and giving a considered view on the prospects. Germany has lost its
productivity advantage relative to its competitors, which is perhaps what
the expert was trying to say. But when the expert spoke, he was working in
the wrong medium for him at the worst possible time of day for newspaper
writers, therefore giving no service to the viewers and doing no service to
himself.
On Monday morning, Business Breakfast carried an item about the Stock
Exchange's clamp-down on leaking. Professionals knew about it on Friday; it
was the lead story in this newspaper on Saturday and led most of the
business sections in other newspapers. The presenter summarised the story
and then did a short studio interview with Alastair Ross-Goobey, the chief
executive of Postel. This was the sort of item that should be on the show
every day: but it was notable because it was so exceptional.
What Earl Brian of Financial News Network realised was that the real demand
for a daily business programme was from the sort of people who sat around
watching the screens in hundreds of stockbrokers' offices around the US. The
key was to site the studios in low-rent areas in midtown Manhattan so that
guests could pop in on the way downtown to work in the morning and to switch
production to Los Angeles out of prime time to take advantage of the lower
wage rates for television production people in California. Success lay in
concentrating on delivering pure programme strands to committed audiences,
eschewing sports, general and local news.
It follows that the BBC should learn the lessons of modern technology and
falling rents. Television studios can now be anywhere: City of London rents
are such the BBC could afford to take space at the UK's financial centre,
and provide a proper service to the 20m. or so people who are so underserved
now.

First the plaudits. You will seldom see a display of acting in London to
match that of Alan Bates in The Showman at the Almeida in north London. For
variety, for depth and, above all, for sheer stamina Bates deserves every
prize. And although, on a rough reckoning, he has over 90 per cent of the
lines, the rest of the cast deserve the fullest praise, too, for their
unstinting support.
Written by the Austrian Thomas Bernard, the play centres on an
actor-writer-director who has aspirations to be Shakespeare, Verdi,
Metternich and Wittgenstein, to name but a few. Voltaire, Napoleon, FD
Roosevelt and Lady Churchill crop up as well. So do Hitler and Stalin. Bates
in the lead role has them all in his imagination.
The Showman, however, is really about Austria, which is a big subject, or at
least was when Austria had an empire. Possibly, in a micro-way, the country
has become psychologically more interesting now that it has not. Coming to
terms with an imperial past and a more modest present is a problem not
confined to Austria.
Yet it is here that the reservations begin. This is the second Bernhard play
to be performed in London in recent months. The first was Elisabeth II at
the Gate. Both suggest a peculiar dislike of modern Austria, but what I find
very hard to work out is whether this stems from a nostalgia for a glory
that has gone or is a complaint about a failure to adjust to being a lesser,
and democratic power. Probably The Showman is a subtle mixture of the two,
though you would have to be an Austrian to fully appreciate it.
My own view, seeing the play in English from an offshore island, is that it
comes down firmly on the side of Metternich: relatively civilised
authoritarianism with Austria running Europe rather than the great powers
breaking it up. But I may be wrong.
Apart from doubts about the play's intentions, the other reservation
concerns the structure. Bernhard has a pronounced tendency to allow his
central characters to rant. Not even John Osborne gave his leading figures
such continuous spleen and invective. In Osborne someone usually interrupts;
Bernhard scarcely ever stops. This creates an imbalance in the play.
For example, the wife in The Showman does little more than cough: the
grown-up children broadly kow-tow to their father. The only people not
wholly submissive are the inn-keeper and his family, but they dissent
largely in dignified silence and are tarnished (or perhaps blessed?) by
having what looks like a water colour of Hitler on the wall. Again, the
politics are obscure.
Still, if you want a relentless, egocentric near-monologue, here it is. A
few of the lines are very funny, such as Bates saying 'I wanted a genius for
a son, and all I've got is a nice person'. The direction by Jonathan Kent,
using the full depth and height of the Almeida stage, is  - like Bates's
performance - sensationally good.
For the record, Bernhard was born illegitimately close to a once little
known place called Maastricht in 1931. His Austrian mother spent a year in a
convent. He moved to Austria, established left-wing credentials and died in
1989. Yet it is a strange kind of socialism that comes out in The Showman;
perhaps the German title is more suitable: Der Theatermacher.
Obscurity belongs not only to Austrians. Gregory Motton's five-year-old A
Message for the Broken Hearted has been revived in a Liverpool Playhouse
production at the Battersea Arts. Motton still looks like an immensely
promising dramatist writing about pain. It would help, however, to give some
greater indication of context. And to pull the stage curtains every few
minutes or so may give the indication of a hospital for the seriously
disturbed, but it is an anti-theatrical device which holds up the action.
(The real setting is in and around a suburban house in south London.)
Motton's test will be at the Royal Court next month with his new play, The
Terrible Voice of Satan.
In fact, Motton would have fitted very well into the Springboards season of
new work from the Royal National Theatre's Studio at the Cottelsoe. This is
continuing with He Who Saw Everything, based on the ancient epic of
Gilgamesh and thought to be the world's oldest play. It is close to the
story of Noah's Ark and also Greek myth. Directed by Tim Supple, it is very
well done with some appealing musical accompaniment. But obscurity seems to
be the order of the week. It is unclear why Gilgamesh is played by several
characters.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Arts: The year of the shaggy dog - Cannes Film Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS

<TEXT>
A 40-foot Arnold Schwarzenegger threatens visitors to the 46th Cannes Film
Festival. Anchored to a barge in the bay, the inflatable Arnie points an
inflatable gun - wobbling a bit in the wind - towards the Croisette. 'Hasta
la vista, baby]', he seems to be saying to anyone complaining that the
Hollywood presence at Cannes '93 is not large enough.
For that is the festival grouch to date. No-shows from such as Spielberg,
Scorsese and Woody Allen, whose new films had all been tipped for Cannes,
fuel the murmurings of America's growing disdain for Europe's major movie
spree. Hollywood has sent its B team instead, with Abel Ferrara (Body
Snatchers), Steven Soderbergh (King Of The Hill) and Joel Schumacher
(Falling Down) waving a tattered US flag while the major studios save their
blockbusters for the American summer.
That half the 28 official Cannes entries are still in English tells us how
virulent that language has become in the age of the co-production; and
points to the presence of five British films in the official event, an
all-time record. One of these is Mike Leigh's Naked, competition
co-favourite to date with Jane Campion's extraordinary The Piano from New
Zealand.
Campion, who promised greatness in Sweetie and An Angel At My Table,
achieves it with this dazzling tale of passion and punishment in the 19th
century Antipodean bush. Holly Hunter is the young Scots widow whose father
pitches her into an arranged marriage with colonialist Sam Neill. But a
piano, a Scots-Maori neighbour (Harvey Keitel) and Hunter's little daughter
all play parts in the waiting cataclysm of sex, jealousy and violent
retribution.
The film is shot like a Victorian engraving come to life. Early on: the
buttoned-up, near-monochrome tableaux of cinephotographer Stuart Dryburgh
(Vigil) as he probes the misty shores and forests prowled by incongruous
shawls and black hooped skirts. Later: the thrilling fluency of camerawork
and feeling as love unpicks the characters' straight-lacing and opens up
their souls. The movie never stumbles into melodrama, nevers substitutes
reach-me-down cliche for hard-earned revelation. In the power of its imagery
and command of its emotions The Piano may well be - let us risk a sexist
superlative - the greatest film yet directed by a woman.
Some male chauvinist Europeans went madder for Naked: Mike Leigh's
gloom-laden tale of a group of London down-and-outs catalysed by the surly
wit of a visiting Mancunian (David Thewlis). Thewlis is obsessed with the
end of the world and with exorcising - or merely exercising - his own
chattery, epigrammatic despair. He first wreaks sexual havoc in an
ex-girlfriend's flat, then tramps the nocturnal streets meeting Odd
Characters of the kind we only find chez Leigh. A philosophical security
guard, a pair of screwloose Scots youngsters, a nymphomaniac . . . Finally
the tale comes full circle and Mr T hoofs off home again: but not before he
has laid waste parts of London's soul not even the recession had reached.
Newcomers to Leigh's cinema liked the film more than longtime loyalists.
From the maker of High Hopes and Life Is Sweet, where statements about life
and death are made through a prismatic miniaturism, Naked seemed to me full
of apocalyptic self-consciousness and cackhanded class comedy. One character
is a toff called Sebastian, whose sole function is to go through the movie
drawling upper-crust one-liners and treating women to some seigneurial
S-and-M. Elsewhere a nomadic, smash-and-grab pessimism is preferred to the
distilled comic power of Leigh's best work.
Leigh's film points, though, to a conspicuous trend at this year's festival.
It is the Year of the Shaggy Dog. Many competition movies, even those that
start out brisk and well-clipped, have ended up hairy, dazed and wandering
all over the place.
In Akira Kurosawa's Madadayo the initially touching tale of a retired
schoolmaster's decade-spanning friendship with former pupils - sort of a
Sayonara, Mr Chips - ends up going round and round like a scratchy record.
In Jim McBride's road movie The Wrong Man, 'picaresque' becomes a criminal
offence as Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Anderson and John Lithgow (husband, wife
and the murder-suspect sailor they pick up) zigzag all over Mexico, burning
the tarmac from one overacted amorous flare-up to another. And the Taviani
brothers' Fiorile is a dynastic epic about gold, love and Tuscan folklore
that pounds the centuries promising revelation but providing only reiterated
lectures about the corruption of money and redemptive virtues of love.
The best of that endangered Cannes species, the foreign-language film, came
from another pair of Italian siblings. Pupi Avati's Magnificat, produced and
co-conceived by brother Antonio, hews half-a-dozen stories from the rock of
Mediaeval social history. The carving is brilliantly skilful: here a young
girl's convent initiation or the birth agonies of a royal courtesan, there
the grim glimpse of an executioner's trade or a dying nobleman's search for
grace in a funeral pavilion by a river. Avati dovetails all these 10th
century vignettes into a movie that begins by presenting the past as a
'foreign country' but ends by irradiating it with understanding and insight.
The Cannes festival paints with a broad brush and there have been plenty of
artworks boasting louder, more lurid merits. In the Market, movies with
titles like Man With The Screaming Brain and Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy. And
in the Competition itself, my favourite popcorn-and-escapism movie so far:
Abel Ferrara's Body Snatchers.
Yes, this is another remake of the romp first put on screen in 1956 by Don
Siegel about space-spawned clone people taking over the world; and yes, my
colleagues thought the film vulgar, brash, pyrotechnic and unsubtle. But
then so did I. That is why, in a festival with more than its share of
unfocused and underplotted movies rotating in ever diminishing circles, I
liked it.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Arts: Monteverdi Vespers - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'BOC Covent Garden Festival of Opera and the Musical Arts' is the full
title of a new initiative occupying six of the halls, churches and theatres
in the Covent Garden area with festive music-making over the next 14 days.
Whether London, a city still in the grip of recession and already
over-supplied with competing musical events, really needs another such is
yet to be established (by audience numbers, for one thing).
But the bill of fare itself is full of bold strokes, unusual combinations,
meriting sympathetic attention. A specially mounted Magic Flute in the
Freemasons' Hall and G &amp; S Trial by Jury in the Bow Street Magistrates'
Court may prove to be brilliantly imaginative feats of planning, or else
merely gimmicky; less showy but assuredly substantial are the programmes of
music-theatre in the Donmar, the masterclasses and recitals at the Royal
Opera House, and the choral concerts (enticing ones: the Monteverdi Vespers,
Purcell's Fairy Queen, Handel's Belshazzar) in St Paul's Church.
And indeed, any festival launching itself - as this one did on Monday - with
Monteverdi followed by a firework display in the Covent Garden concourse
must have its heart in the right place. St Paul's is a fine location for the
1610 Vespers, intimate yet sufficiently resonant; and since those features
of ambience seemed to chime exactly with the stylistic tenets of the
performance by Paul McCreesh's Gabrieli Consort and Players, the experience
was continuously cogent, gripping, expertly co-ordinated.
McCreesh opted for small forces, particularly avoiding 'additive' scoring;
his consort of singers functioned equally efficiently in choral or solo
roles, and his directorial tread was unfailingly nimble. As ever in these
spare, British-accented accounts of Monteverdi currently in vogue, certain
essentially Latin qualities tended to go missing - grandeur, thrusting
boldness of colouring, a sense of elating instrumental and vocal virtuosity.
Only in the tenor-voice statement-and-echo phrases of 'Duo Seraphim' were
they in any way evoked: the singers, Charles Daniels and Mark le Brocq,
achieved at last the frisson, the mysterious lightning-flash of
drama-in-music for which I had been longing all evening.

Male summer absenteeism strikes the nation today, oddly coinciding with the
first one-day Cricket International between England and Australia (BBC1,
10.40am). This Morning (ITV, 10.35am) tries hard to beat off the cricket
competition by offering something utterly new - Loyd Grossman on a
gastronomic journey through France. The BBC still performs a public service.
One of its more valuable offerings is Open Space (BBC2, 7.40pm), where
members of the public use its facilities to make programmes. Tonight's is by
Jill Wright, director of the National Library Campaign, fighting the decline
in library funding. Eat Your Greens (Channel 4, 8.30pm) is a small-screen
pleasure. An instructive food programme; beautifully filmed and edited; and
presented by a very unsnobby cook, Sophie Grigson. But the joy of the day
for London commuters like myself will be watching the first of a new series
of Inside Story (BBC1, 9.30pm). It promises to go behind the scenes of
British Rail and explain why things go so wrong. Bad Company (BBC2, 9pm)
concludes the dramatisation of the Carl Bridgewater murder.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Charged up over contamination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new technology to eliminate soil pollution by applying low-voltage
electric currents promises to shave millions of dollars off the cost of
large-scale contamination clean-ups.
The new technique, being developed by a team at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, has attracted the attention of groups in the chemical, mining
and utility sectors, which are now facing large bills from soil
decontamination.
'It's essential for us to examine new technologies which would do the same
job at a lower cost,' says Vincent Mirabella, a consulting engineer at
Southern California Edison, which is helping to finance the project. The new
technology, which should be ready for on-site trials by the end of the year,
uses low-voltage electrodes inserted in the soil to pull out pollutants by
magnetic force.
Two different methods can be used. The first, known as electro-osmosis,
takes advantage of the water contained in the soil to flush out the
contaminants. All soil contains some water, and many ground pollutants are
dissolved in that water.
Water gives the soil a charge, commonly known as the soil pH. If an
electrode with a negative charge is inserted into the ground, the water,
bearing a positive charge, will gravitate towards it, bringing many of the
soil's pollutants along. The rest of the soil, which typically carries a
negative charge, would remain behind. The electrode could consist of a
charged wire running through a permeable pipe which is inserted into the
ground.
The second method, known as electro-migration, complements electro-osmosis.
The method is especially suitable for arid soil containing little water, and
soil holding large amounts of toxic metals. This technique pulls out the
pollutants at a slower pace, ion by ion. When the pollutants reach the
electrode, once again water is used to flush the contaminants out. 'With use
of both methods, we can remove about 95 per cent of contaminants from the
soil,' says Ronald Probstein, who heads the project at MIT. The electric
charge process offers some important advantages. First, the technology would
carry a relatively low cost, about Dollars 20 to Dollars 30 per tonne,
compared with an average Dollars 150 per tonne for current methods such as
excavation and pumping.
'If we used current methods to clean up all the contaminant soil in America,
we'd bankrupt the country,' says Richard Magee, executive director of
environmental engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. 'Either
we find a cheaper technology, or we resign ourselves to living with
contaminated soil.'
The MIT technology also promises to be kinder to the environment than
current clean-up methods. Under the excavation and incineration technique,
for instance, soil is dug out of the ground and placed in an incinerator to
burn off the pollutants. Critics complain that this method turns a ground
pollution problem into an air pollution problem. And by using traditional
pumping and draining techniques, soil ruptures are likely to occur.
Neither electro-osmosis nor electro-migration will be miracle cures for soil
pollution. Both, for instance, are painstakingly slow. Depending on how many
electrodes are used, a large field of polluted soil could take from a few
months to a year to clean up.
However, the process's supporters believe a year is not too long to wait
considering the scale of the problem. With the new technique's promising
cost and efficiency advantages, its successful development could go a long
way towards solving the daunting problem of ground-pollution clean-up.

FT  19 MAY 93 / People: Looking outside the McAlpine clan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Turnbull, 50, who headed the Rosehaugh property group in the final
months before it went into receivership, has resurfaced as finance director
of Newarthill, which controls the privately-owned construction business of
Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons.
Newarthill, named after the Scottish birthplace of founder Robert McAlpine,
is the bigger, but more private of the two construction companies connected
with the McAlpine family. The company, which was taken private in 1989, has
been hard hit by the recession and reported a Pounds 21.5m loss on turnover
of Pounds 267.8m in the year to end-October 1992.
Although a minority of Newarthill's shares are still publicly traded, the
company has long been run along the lines of a family partnership dominated
by members of the McAlpine clan.
However, since the end of its financial year it has strengthened its board
with two new non-executive directors - Sir Christopher Harding, chairman of
BET, and George Grover, a former senior partner of Debenham Tewson &amp;
Chinnocks - and it has now appointed its first finance director.
The company declined to comment on the new appointment. However, it marks a
return to reasonably familiar territory for Turnbull, a lawyer and chartered
accountant. After a stint at Scottish merchant bankers Noble Grossart,
Turnbull joined the privately-owned property and construction firm Hunting
Gate Group, as financial director in June 1982.
In 1991 he moved to Rosehaugh, one of the stars of the 1980's property boom,
which was already in serious financial trouble.
Less than a year after joining, he found himself in the chief executive's
seat as part of a management reshuffle prompted by the group's increasingly
worried bankers. However, attempts to refinance the group foundered and less
than a year after Turnbull was made chief executive, Rosehaugh was in the
hands of the receivers.

FT  19 MAY 93 / People: Englishman goes to market for Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time, an Englishman is to become chairman of what remains of
the Glasgow stock exchange.
Anthony Vine-Lott, 45-year-old managing director of Barclays Stockbrokers,
is to succeed Robert White of the Edinburgh stockbroker Bell Lawrie White as
chairman of the Scottish regional advisory group of the London Stock
Exchange.
Glasgow is one of the more active of the dwindling number of regional
branches of the Stock Exchange. It has the only firms of market-makers
outside London (two of them) and handles most settlements for Glasgow-based
stockbrokers, such as Allied Provincial.
The exchange, which employs about 20 people, claims to be second only to
London in the volume of business it handles.
Meanwhile, Barclays Stockbrokers is probably the biggest user of the Glasgow
exchange. It employs about 300 people in the city and does all share
transactions for retail customers of the bank's branches, as well as
handling back office work for a number of regional stockbrokers.
It claims to transact 10 per cent of all retail business in the UK.
Vine-Lott is one of the new breed of stockbrokers who came into the business
from the technology side rather than from dealing, having been a senior
executive of Wang UK in the early 1980s.
He helped design an electronic dealing system for Barclays de Zoete Wedd
before becoming md of Barclays Stockbrokers in 1988.
But he only works two days a week in Glasgow, spending the rest of the week
in London, and his home is in Kent.
He sees the Scottish regional advisory group as 'a local lobby group
sponsored by the exchange' which should work as a conduit to pass
information to members of the stock exchange and to obtain their views to
pass back to London. He wants to widen the role of the committee to
represent the views of quoted Scottish companies and Scottish fund managers
on stock exchange matters.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Hot air fuels the energy
debate - Gasification of wood could be a clean, abundant and renewable power
source
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE KIRWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past decade, pressurised biomass gasification has been trumpeted at
energy workshops and environmental conferences around the world as a clean,
renewable power source with realistic commercial potential.
Its proponents emphasise not only the abundant fuel source and the low-level
emissions released from burning the gas from wood heated at high
temperatures, but also the lack of any net increase in greenhouse gases -
provided trees are planted at the same rate they are felled.
Just how promising the future of the pressurised biomass gasificatian is,
will become clearer in coming months when the world's most advanced pilot
power stations are fired up in Scandinavia - joint ventures between leading
utility companies in Sweden and Finland.
The technological hurdle that scientists have faced over the years with
pressurised biomass gasification is at the turbine stage. Producing the gas
from wood is not a problem, but finding a turbine that does not foul when
fired from that gas is.
That is because the gas emitted from wood heated to temperatures of 900`C
contains various tar compounds, alkaline metals and dust. Both projects -
one, a demonstration plant, in southern Sweden and the other, a test rig, in
Finland - are equipped with a filtering technology designed to solve the
fouling problem. With a so-called 'hot gas cleaning' method, the gases are
cooled to 400`C, when the vapour alkalines such as sodium and potassium and
other compounds can be filtered out. The clean gas is then fed into
conventional gas turbines.
The two facilities will use each company's hot-gas filtering technology
which has been developed independently. The projects also differ in scope
and size. The larger of the two plants - in Varnamo, Sweden - is running
now. But diesel fuel is firing the turbine. The hot-gas filtering will be
put into use shortly and, in the autumn, the gas turbine will produce
electricity.
The Swedish plant, run jointly by Sydkraft and Ahlstrom, also uses combined
cycle technology where hot emission gases are recovered to heat water for
conventional steam turbines. The same plant will also use recovered heat to
fire a hot-water district heating system. The total output will be 15MW.
The other plant - in Tampere, Finland - is a retrofitted coal gasification
research project. Run by Vattenfall of Sweden and Tampella Power of Finland,
it will eventually produce 15MW. However, the initial stage, started in
early March, will test only the gas cleaning system. Eventually the gas will
be channelled into a gas turbine that will also be part of a combined cycle
system.
The joint venture between Vattenfall and Tampella is a more modest programme
than originally planned. A 40MW station to be built in Sweden was shelved
for financial reasons.
The joint-venture companies have each invested more than Dollars 40m (Pounds
26.6m) in the programme. Some of the money has come from the Swedish
government, which faces a long-term energy dilemma due to parliamentary
decisions to phase out nuclear power (50 per cent of its current power
source) by 2010, halt hydro expansion and cap carbon dioxide emissions.
Gasification technology is not new. It was developed more than 50 years ago.
Today there are ambitious, large-scale coal gasification pilot projects
under way in both the US and Europe.
But gasification of wood has three big advantages over coal: No sulphur
emissions, no hazardous waste ash and no increase in carbon-dioxide
emissions.
However, because coal is so cheap and has a higher heating value, it is
currently less expensive to import for gasification than to collect and
transport the large volumes of wood needed in biomass energy. 'That is where
a carbon tax must come into play,' says Nils Lindman, a biomass researcher
for Vattenfall.
'To make it economically viable, the true environmental cost of the other
fuels must be charged.' Sweden and Finland have carbon taxes but this is
just one reason why biomass gasification has been pioneered in Scandinavia.
Besides pursuing an environmentally sound energy policy, Sweden and Finland
have large expanses of forest.
Another potential environmental benefit of biomass concerns nitrogen oxide
emissions, which contribute to acid rain and are the by-product of burning
fossil fuels. Biomass gasification produces nitrogen oxide but again there
is a net decrease.
'A third of the timber cut down for paper and pulp production is left behind
and that scrap wood decays and causes nitrogen run-off,' says Lindman. 'By
collecting that scrap wood and burning it, the extraction (of nitrogen) is
much higher than the nitrogen burden caused by flue gas emissions.
'There is also the benefit of ash waste from biomass,' Lindman adds. 'This
can be used as fertilizer - unlike the waste from coal gasification which
must for the most part be landfilled as a hazardous waste.' This nitrogen
factor is especially important in Sweden where a new nitrous oxide emission
tax was put into effect in 1992.
The success or failure of these biomass gasification plants will have
worldwide implications. The Varnamo plant in Sweden will participate in a
Dollars 30m Global Environment Facility programme with plans to build a
large-scale biomass gasification plant in Brazil. The GEF is a joint project
between the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the
United Nations Environment Programme to help third-world nations implement
environmentally sound development programmes.
'We feel that biomass gasification is one of the few renewable energy
sources that could be economically competitive with conventional methods,'
says Phil Elliot, a project co-ordinator with Shell Oil, which is acting as
a co-ordinator in the GEF programme.
'The Varnamo plant faces some hurdles because it is a complicated
engineering process but I do think they will be able to work out the
problems.'

The environmental industry is hardly short of directories. But the recently
published Entec Directory of Environmental Technology* is one of the more
ambitious, and if comprehensiveness is the criterion, one of the most
successful.
Its foreword, by Nigel Bell of Imperial College, London, repeats the common
refrain that 'environmental issues present not only unparalleled challenges
but also unique opportunities'. Those unsubstantiated remarks are too
casually made in the environmental industry, given the importance of the
question. However, the attraction of the directory is not the text but its
extensive charts.
Its 1,000 pages in English, French, German and Spanish list 20,000 companies
in Europe supplying environmental technology. The first 800 are devoted to
classification: water, air, solid waste, hazardous waste, waste planning and
management, noise and vibration, energy, and 'environmental organisations
and consultancies'.
Each section is then subdivided again - for example, water is sliced into 14
mini-sections on water treatment, water pollution, sewerage and so on. The
companies which participate in those areas are then marked down one side of
a grid, while 30 products, such as fluoridation and desalination, are marked
along the top.
This categorisation - almost 1,000 groupings - is both a strength and a
weakness. It is enormously detailed, but if you are not sure which
sub-section you should be looking for, you may find it less helpful.
Provided readers are using it to help them locate technology suppliers, they
should be satisfied, but it is less useful in getting an overview of what
companies do, or of their size. The last 200 pages, though, contain an
excellent index of all companies' names and telephone numbers.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Management: Manning the hot lines - A look at today's launch
of Charterline, a state-of-the-art service to keep UK customers satisfied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses dealing with the consumer know that losing customers through
poor-quality service can be expensive. It is not only customers suffering
the bad service that are lost: they in turn pass on their dissatisfaction to
family and friends, multiplying the cost of failure.
Inviting disgruntled consumers to make contact by telephone can therefore
make good business sense. Not only does it provide an opportunity to remedy
the fault, it also helps identify the causes of complaint.
That is the philosophy behind the increasing use of the telephone as part of
the customer care arsenal. Computer hardware and software companies,
mail-order retailers and utilities such as BT, the telecoms group, are among
the businesses which provide cheap or free telephone helplines to keep in
contact with their customers.
Prime Minister John Major's Citizen's Charter, which aims to raise the
standard of public services, has spread the practice into the public sector.
Many government departments and agencies, health authorities and local
councils are now providing helplines to provide information to customers.
Later this morning, the use of helplines in the public sector will take
another step forward with the launch of Charterline by William Waldegrave,
the public services minister in charge of the Citizen's Charter. Initially
to be piloted in the East Midlands, Charterline will provide callers all
over the UK with information on what standards of service they can expect
from dozens of public services and utilities and how to complain when they
fall below standard.
Even in the three pilot counties of Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and
Derbyshire, the demand is estimated to be enormous. About 30,000 calls a
month are expected by consultants Price Waterhouse who are managing the
project for the Cabinet Office Citizen's Charter Unit.
Answering their questions means having details - names, addresses,
responsibilities, service standards, complaints procedures - of more than
200 public service organisations, including government bodies, quangos,
public transport operators, local councils, police forces and fire services.
Charterline also takes in privatised public utilities - water, gas,
electricity and telecommunications, their regulators and consumer bodies.
As the service spreads beyond the pilot area, it will add more organisations
to its database, and will finally have details of 1,400 public-sector
bodies. It will also include some basic information on 'out-of-scope'
organisations such as banks, building societies and airlines.
Charterline's aim is to provide the ordinary citizen with more information
about the Citizen's Charter and to encourage them to take up gripes with the
organisations concerned. But it will also provide essential management
information for the Citizen's Charter Unit in its efforts to improve the
public services. For the first time, the unit will have a tool for
identifying which services are creating most complaints - and which have the
best procedures for dealing with them.
The Charterline service will be run from IBM's National Call Management
Centre at Havant, Hampshire. The centre was established last year to handle
requests for computer maintenance from IBM's customers.
Its 100 operators already handle 24,000 calls a week, 24 hours a day. But
Charterline could mean a huge large growth in call handling at the centre,
with 18 new 'call agents' required to handle calls from the pilot area
alone.
The IBM centre meets its staffing needs through an innovative relationship
with Manpower, the recruitment specialists. Manpower is responsible for
recruiting the call agents, using a profile agreed with IBM, and remains
their employer.
'It gives me the flexibility I need to experiment with new approaches and
change things around,' says Mike Coleman, the centre's manager. 'It helps me
keep costs to the minimum and I don't have to hire and fire people.'
However, quality of service is the key to running a successful helpline,
says Coleman. Each agent receives five weeks' training which includes
customer care, telephone technique, stress training and learning how the
public services operate (there are plans for an NVQ vocational qualification
in call handling).
Team working is encouraged by grouping five call agents and a team leader in
a work station in which they all face each other. A much-coveted monthly
'Golden Telephone' award is presented to the best team and team members are
encouraged to nominate each other for 'Golden Eagle' awards for customer
care - these come with a Pounds 5 voucher.
Price Waterhouse has set challenging performance targets for the contract:
90 per cent of calls must be answered within 10 seconds, 98 per cent in less
than 20. Better response rates are possible, says PW's Robert Browning, but
the cost could only be justified in a commercial environment where
additional sales might result.
The success of Charterline will, however, also depend on whether it can
supply callers with the information they need. Each call agent watches a
computer screen on to which details of calls are entered. The system
identifies the organisation the caller needs to know more about and provides
details of service standards and complaints procedures. If the caller wants
to receive details of the Citizen's Charter, the agent can enter the request
for despatch the same day.
The system has been extensively tested by confronting agents with difficult
queries. One fiendish tester rang in to ask how he could arrange a meeting
with John Major for a man claiming to be a Martian. It is unlikely that many
of Charterline's inquiries will be quite so difficult to answer. However, no
one can really know if the system will take the strain until the calls start
flooding in later today.
One thing is certain: Charterline cannot be allowed to flop. If there is one
thing worse than neglecting the customer, it is to invite them to call in
and then mishandle their complaint.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Management: Do not underestimate the overtime ban - Reports
of a new era of UK industrial co-operation may be exaggerated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON MILNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most managers must rate industrial relations as the least of their current
worries given the virtual disappearance of strikes. But the absence of
strikes does not necessarily mean a contented workforce. Currently
conflict-free industrial relations appear to result more from worker
compliance than from co-operation with management.
The UK has seen important changes in industrial relations over the past
decade, with many observers now talking of the 'new industrial relations'.
One of the most important features of NIR is the decline in strike incidence
since the mid-1980s. There has also been a reassertion of managerial
prerogatives, the death of the closed shop and a slump in trade union
membership.
According to some, we have moved from an era of industrial conflict to one
of co-operation, with workplace relations no longer characterised by 'them
and us' attitudes, but simply referred to as 'us'.
The evidence on strikes is fairly clear cut. Fewer working days were lost
due to strikes in 1992 than in any other year since records began a century
ago. There were only 240 officially recorded strikes last year, less than a
10th of the number 15 years ago. But other evidence suggests that the NIR
label may be somewhat misplaced.
A strike has two basic elements: an unsatisfied grievance and an ability to
strike. The reduction in strike activity must have resulted from either a
decline in unsatisfied employee grievances and/or a decline in the ability
to strike. If advocates of NIR are correct, then a fall in the level and
intensity of grievances must be the more important explanation.
There are at least three points to make against the NIR case. The most
obvious is the current spring of discontent, with industrial action at the
Timex electronics plant in Dundee, on British Rail and buses, in the pits
and in schools.
Evidence has also emerged that the official record of strike activity does
not tell the whole story. Alongside the contraction in strike frequency was
a shift in favour of the overtime ban.
Using information collected by the CBI Pay Databank survey of manufacturing
pay negotiations, research at the London School of Economics* has revealed
that, on average in the period 1979-89, overtime bans were twice as likely
to occur as strikes. This was not the case throughout the economy, however,
as public-sector workers have continued to favour strikes over non-strike
action.
Why did employees turn increasingly to overtime bans to pursue their
grievances? Contributing factors include: the role of the law which
concentrated, before 1988 at least, on stamping out strikes and largely
ignored non-strike forms of action; leaner production systems, such as
just-in-time and other techniques which made an overtime ban more effective;
and high unemployment which appears more effective in discouraging strikes
than overtime bans. The common thread is that the overtime ban provides a
relatively low-cost way for workers to express their dissatisfaction.
A final piece of evidence on worker disquiet concerns the use of dispute
procedures. The recently published Acas report for 1992 reveals that the
statutory advisory and conciliation body was busier than ever last year.
Between 1976 and 1988 the use of collective conciliation closely followed
the pattern of strike incidence. But, since then, the paths have diverged.
As strike incidence has plummeted to an all-time low, the number of
conciliation requests has stayed stable at around 1,200-1,300 a year.
The number of individual conciliation cases shows a more marked trend
upwards. Last year Acas received more than 72,000 requests, up 12,000 on
1991. In part, this increase results from the recession, since most
conciliation cases concern claims for unfair dismissal. But it must also
result from a decline in workers' ability to pursue disputes in any other
way.
The decline in strike action is welcome. But it results largely from the
most disaffected employees no longer being able to take strike action,
rather than from an absence of grievances. The fact that some
dissatisfaction is still being expressed through non-strike industrial
action and the use of Acas suggests that the foundation of NIR is workplace
compliance rather than co-operation.
Compliant employees may be sufficiently productive when labour markets give
management the upper hand. But, when (and if) unemployment starts to fall,
the absence of a co-operative spirit may lead to problems of employee
turnover, absenteeism and a lack of effort.
The ball is firmly in the managerial court and has been languishing there
for some time. High-trust employee relations take time to develop and the
necessary initiatives must be employer led.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Jobs: Reaping the benefits of teamwork - The problems of
management science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY all of us work with other people. Most of us are interdependent in
the sense that we have to help, support and reward each other at work. No
one can whistle a symphony; it takes the team effort of an orchestra to play
it. Whether we call them groups, sections, squads or teams, most of us
realise how much our productivity and satisfaction is due to them. This
pretty obvious point is now the latest management obsession.
Management science, if there can be such a thing, is notoriously faddish.
Not long ago it was strategic planning that was the key to organisational
success. Then it had to do with organisation structure. After that the gurus
said that once the corporate culture (another oxymoron) was right, Eldorado
was just around the corner]
All these solve-all solutions have now reached their sell-by date. But there
is, fortunately, a new solution to all the hard-pressed manager's needs.
Teamwork, it seems, will solve all your problems and lead to happy, healthy,
productive workers.
So business sections of books shops bulge with books, nearly always written
by people called Chuck, Randy or Ed, on teams and teamwork. They rejoice
under crypto-sporting titles such as Team-Power, or How to be a team player;
Winning Big. Their message is simple: the power of the waterfall is nothing
but a lot of drips working together. No matter how great a warrior he might
be, a chief cannot do battle without his indians.
What supporters of the team concept argue is this: bearing in mind that
management is the art of getting things done through people, you need to let
your people know what your goals are - what you want to accomplish, why you
want to accomplish it, how they will benefit from it and the role they will
play in accomplishing it. This is another way of saying that the members of
the management team must be able to identify themselves individually with
the company's overall goals. No chief executive, no top management group
ever reached these goals by themselves. Unless the entire management team is
aboard, the company will never get there.
What has caused this explosion in restating the obvious? The answer is
partly in the American obsession with the Japanese, who are still perceived
by the Pearl Harbour generation as mindless, but highly disciplined,
killers. The post-war Japanese miracle has puzzled - indeed terrified - the
Americans. What is the Japanese secret of success? Answer - team-work.
The Japanese come from a collectivistic culture and hence naturally do
things in groups or teams. We in the Anglo-Saxon world come from an
individualistic culture, which selects on, rewards and values individual
effort. No matter how much teamwork achieves in our culture, the results
tend to get identified with a single name. We therefore have to endure
various mildly humiliating training courses (many in the great outdoors) to
encourage teamwork because it is not natural to us. While it is true that no
member of a boat crew is praised for the individuality of their rowing, this
is an exception to the rule. The Japanese, I presume, don't feel obligated
to attend individualism courses to learn how to 'become their own person',
or 'do things their own way'. They are natural collectivistic team players.
This individualism in our culture runs deep. We are, however, loyal to some
groups: usually those we have been forced to join, or with whom we have
endured hardship and difficulty. Family, school class-mates and fellow
military conscripts often do command our loyalty. But, because we don't have
jobs for life and find it easier to get promotion by moving between
organisations, we rarely stay long enough in a team to be really part of it.
The life of a team goes through various stages: forming (the getting
together); storming (arguing over who does what, who is leader, etc);
norming (the acceptable explicit and implicit rules); performing (actually
working well after the early stages have occurred); finally, teams go
through mourning (when they break up). But all this takes time and many of
us never really stay long enough in a particular team to appreciate its
worth.
But how seriously do companies which have swallowed the team solution really
take the idea? Yes, they do talk it up; go on endless (and expensive)
courses; they even partly restructure sections into 'new teams'. Yet very,
very few reward the team, rather than the individual. Most performance
management systems (the euphemism for how pay is determined) are explicitly
geared to the individual. Yes, team work in the sense of contribution to the
team may be a criterion which is rated, but it is usually only one of many.
Also, we rarely hire people with a team in mind or indeed hire whole teams.
Michael Winner got it right when he said: 'Team effort is a lot of people
doing what I say.' The teamwork philosophy of co-operation, interdependence
and group loyalty is counter-cultural.
Our business heroes are for the most part egocentric, rugged individuals,
not team players. Team work may be a really good idea, but don't fool
yourself either that it is a total solution or that a couple of fuzzy warm
courses will do the trick.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Bank says government inflation target achievable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England is reasonably confident that the government will be able
to hold underlying inflation below its 4 per cent target ceiling over the
next year and a half.
Contrary to some reports at the weekend the Bank's second quarterly
inflation report, published yesterday, suggested that the outlook for
underlying inflation to the end of year, as measured by the retail prices
index excluding mortgage interest payments, 'is no worse, and probably
slightly better' than indicated three months ago.
Changes since the last inflation report 'have lowered slightly both the
expected inflation rate and the probability of breaching the 4 per cent
limit during the course of this year,' the Bank says. 'The probability of
breaching the target next year may be a little greater than previously
envisaged, but the Bank's central expectation still is that the target will
be met.'
The future exchange rate of sterling, however, will be crucial to the
authorities' ability to meet the target. The report says that the 5 per cent
rise in sterling against its trade-weighted exchange rate index since
February 'has lowered somewhat' the risk of breaching the top of the target
range towards the end of this year and early next year. Any further increase
in the exchange rate would lower the probability of breaching the target, it
says. Conversely, a decrease in sterling's value would increase that risk.
The Bank expects Friday's retail prices figures for April to show a fall in
the underlying inflation rate from March's 3.5 per cent level, reflecting
the change from poll tax to the council tax. After that, however, the rate
will go back to 3.5 per cent by June as higher import prices pass through
into domestic retail prices.
It believes that underlying inflation will remain in the 3 per cent to 4 per
cent range in the next 18 months, largely because the inflation rate for
domestically produced goods will remain low. The output gap - between actual
output and a level of output in the UK economy consistent with a constant
rate of inflation - is likely to remain negative for some time, also
exerting downward pressure on inflation.
The Bank believes that inflation would probably have been constant 'over the
next year or so', had not the government announced plans to extend the scope
of value added tax to domestic fuel and power from April 1994. This increase
in indirect taxation means underlying inflation may rise next year.
The report says the main uncertainty surrounding inflation after 1994
concerns the response of domestic costs, such as wages and profits, to the
loss of purchasing power resulting from the depreciation of sterling since
last September.
If profit margins per unit of output or earnings per head do not rise,
increased demand will feed through into greater activity, and possibly
employment, without stimulating inflation, it says.
The Bank expresses some concern that the credibility of the government's
target of 1 per cent to 4 per cent underlying inflation over the life of
this parliament is still not reflected in prices on financial markets or in
opinion surveys.
It is vital that the target should be seen as a framework for policy over a
long period and that 'monetary and fiscal policy should be consistent with
achieving the target on a sustained basis', it says.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Major pledges to bolster industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night pledged to give substance to a new partnership
between government and industry by directing all of Whitehall's energy
towards broadening the economic recovery and strengthening the manufacturing
base.
In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry the prime minister
underlined his personal commitment to improving Britain's competitiveness.
That meant backing exporters, fostering public/private sector partnerships
to improve the nation's infrastructure, promoting free trade, removing
unnecessary government regulation and translating scientific research into
industrial innovation.
Mr Major had been told earlier by Mr Howard Davies, the director-general of
the CBI, that business wanted the government to listen to industry rather
than to its own rhetoric. The prime minister said in his speech that the
climate for industry to flourish was in place.
Admitting the mistakes that led to the inflationary boom of the late 1980s,
he added that the government had now delivered low inflation, low interest
rates and low tax rates.
Mr Major added: 'We have all learnt the hard lessons of those years. We will
not let inflation drive Britain off its course again.'
But he acknowledged that government also had a more direct role in helping
business at home and abroad. Decisions taken in Whitehall could help or
hinder industry in a 'thousand ways'.
Mr Major told the industrialists' annual dinner: 'All our policies - not
just our economic policy - need to be focused on the future strength of the
British economy.' He said that partnership between government and industry
would go well beyond the cash help for exporters and the tax cuts for
industry announced in the Autumn Statement and the Budget in March.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Manufacturing output shows large increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING output has recorded its largest quarterly rise for more than
four years, confirming that the recovery is building up strength.
In the January-March period production was a seasonally adjusted 2 per cent
higher than in the previous quarter and 2.1 per cent up on the corresponding
period a year ago, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
The increase in output has been especially strong among computer makers,
engineering companies and producers of metals and minerals products.
The last time manufacturers chalked up a bigger increase in output on a
three-monthly basis was November 1988.
In volume terms manufacturing production in the first quarter was the
highest quarterly figure since the last three months of 1990, when the
recession was just getting under way.
The figure for the latest quarter is still, however, 6 per cent below the
record volume registered in the second quarter of 1990, when factory output
hit a record.
Manufacturing output in March fell by a slight 0.3 per compared with
February. The CSO said much of this was because sugar production in the
earlier month was artificially boosted by the bumper harvest last autumn.
Taking into account the energy and water sectors, total industrial output
from all production industries was 0.3 per cent up in the first quarter
compared with the previous three months. It was 1.6 per cent higher than the
equivalent period last year.
The relatively small increase for all production industries - accounting for
about a third of gross domestic product - was mainly attributed to lower
output by the energy and water sectors, which fell 4.2 per cent between the
last three months of last year and the latest quarter.
In the first quarter metals production was up 6.6 per cent compared with the
last three months of last year, with minerals and related products showing a
5.1 per cent rise.
The engineering sector, which has been particularly affected by the
recession, showed a healthy 2.7 per cent rise while chemicals production
increased 1.2 per cent.
Chemicals output - relatively strong during the downturn - has been pushed
down lower in recent months as a result of slacker demand for
pharmaceuticals.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Confidence in property sees upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE IN the UK commercial property market has risen sharply in the
last three months, according to a poll by Gallup for CSW, a property
magazine.
It found that 94 per cent of the 100 property companies and institutional
investors polled believed that the market would show some improvement in the
next 12 months.
Some 17 per cent of respondents thought that a 'meaningful recovery' had
already started or would happen later this year, compared with 5 per cent in
January.
But 55 per cent of those polled did not expect recovery until next year and
28 per cent expected no revival to take place until 1995 or later.
The survey covered 100 property investors and companies owning nearly Pounds
60bn of property assets.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Bank of England's executive directors receive no pay
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL SIX of the Bank of England's executive directors received no pay
increase this year as part of an effort by the Bank to take a lead in
combating price and wage pressures, Peter Marsh writes.
The six include Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor, and Mr Eddie George,
the deputy governor who takes over the top job on July 1. The others are Mr
Tony Coleby, Professor Mervyn King, Mr Brian Quinn and Mr Andrew Crockett.
In the three years until January last year the directors' salaries increased
relatively fast to take into account pay increases in the private sector.
Under the new initiative their pay for the year ending next February is the
same as their 1992-93 salaries.
Earlier this week the Bank announced that Mr George had agreed a five-year
wage freeze from the start of his new job, pegging his pay at about Pounds
210,000. The new salary takes into account his move to the top job, and is
the same as that paid to Mr Leigh-Pemberton last year.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Recovery hopes rise sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS of a strong economic recovery have risen sharply, Gallup's
latest survey of consumer confidence shows.
The survey recorded the most positive results for a year, with 43 per cent
of respondents expecting the economic situation to improve over the next 12
months. Only 22 per cent expected a deterioration. The balance of 21 per
cent expecting an improvement, the highest for 12 months, compares with
April's balance of 4 per cent expecting the situation to worsen. The
improvement in consumer sentiment appears to come from a big fall in the
numbers expecting unemployment to increase in the year ahead. Forty-nine per
cent thought unemployment would increase, compared with 68 per cent in
April.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Prison officers raise threat of industrial action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRISON OFFICERS yesterday raised the threat of industrial action over the
introduction of private management to the state prison service.
Mr John Bartell, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, said there
was a 'distinct possibility' that the union's annual conference next week
could call for a national ballot on industrial action over privatisation.
Mr Bartell said staffing cuts and market testing were forcing down service
quality and exposing prison officers to danger. Officers were being made to
cut corners to save money and basic security procedures were not being
applied. There had been a 60 per cent increase in assaults on prison
officers in the past two years. Private management had produced farcical
results, said Mr Bartell, with a series of escapes after Group 4 took over
Britain's first privately managed prisoner escort service last month.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Prison policy not an open and shut case: Jail privatisation
is far from being a fait accompli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S second privately run jail opens this month, and Prison Service
officials have started formulating recommendations to the government on the
extent and pace of a further, sustained programme of private-sector
involvement in prison management.
But Mr Derek Lewis, the former television executive who became
director-general of the Prison Service last month, is concerned about the
degree to which private-sector issues are dominating public discussion about
prisons. He says it is 'absolutely wrong' to see his appointment as a step
towards widespread privatisation.
When Blakenhurst, in Hereford and Worcester, opens this month it will be the
first privately managed prison to accommodate convicted prisoners. It
follows the opening of the Wolds remand prison, Humberside, last year. The
private sector is also bidding to manage Strangeways, Manchester, and will
be invited to bid for the new Doncaster prison under the government's market
testing programme.
All are either new or refurbished buildings. One of the tasks facing Mr
Lewis and his colleagues is to find ways of extending market testing to
established, operational prisons. The spate of escapes and other problems
when Group 4 took over Britain's first privately managed prisoner escort
contract last month demonstrated the difficulties of switching an existing
service from the public to the private sectors overnight.
Mr Lewis will recommend which types of prison are likely to be suitable for
private management, and suggest how to ensure that private-sector
involvement is sustained. 'The last thing anyone wants is something that is
going to be here today and gone tomorrow,' he said.
The appointment of a director-general from the private sector when the
government is opening the service to private management aroused concern
among prison staff and penal reform organisations. But Mr Lewis said he had
been given no brief to engineer widespread privatisation.
'It is inconceivable, for as far ahead as I can see, that public-sector
prisons will not remain the dominant element of the prison service. The
private sector has existed in the US for 10 years and represents no more
than a few per cent of the prison places.'
He believes Britain's limited experiment in private management has already
proved a powerful agent for change in the traditionally centralised prison
system, and hopes it will continue to act as a stimulus and test-bed for new
ideas. 'But it is quite wrong to see the private sector as anything other
than one element in a broad programme to improve the prison service as a
whole. 'By comparison with the private sector there is an enormous amount
more activity going on in the rest of the prison service,' he said.
'This includes a progressive programme of devolution to governors so that
they have responsibility and accountability for the performance of their
prisons. And we are developing a code of standards against which we can
measure the performance of each prison on a systematic basis. This is a
sea-change so far as the prison service is concerned.'
Mr Lewis has ambitious ideas for performance measurement, by establishing
comparisons between Britain's prisons and successful systems elsewhere in
the world.
He regards the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Canada and parts of the US
system as good-quality services to share experience with Britain.
He has just completed a tour of US and Canadian prisons and believes that,
while Britain is in the lead in developing constructive relationships
between prisoners and officers, industrial programmes in North American
prisons are better developed.
He said: 'They are further down the road in increasing levels of wages for
prisoners and creating a virtuous circle of incentives. Progress in work is
an important factor in determining release dates in North America. That
seems to create a pretty powerful set of positive incentives, whereas our
incentives seem to be much more negative - if you misbehave you are punished
by loss of remission.'
Mr Lewis believes Britain might gain from adopting the greater staff
mobility found in the US and Canada, where probation officers sometimes
spend part of their careers as prison officers. He said: 'It gives better
understanding between functions, and eventually produces managers who are
much better equipped because they understand a number of activities at first
hand.'

FT  19 MAY 93 / City aims to recruit jobless 'locals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NON-PROFIT company was launched yesterday calling for 'a sea-change in
City recruitment culture' by hiring more people from neighbouring socially
deprived and high unemployment areas.
Local Recruitment Brokerage is a partnership between the Bank of England,
City employers Kleinwort Benson and S. G. Warburg and public-sector bodies
including Hackney and Islington councils, the Corporation of London,
Jobcentres and the City and Inner London North Training and Enterprise
Council.
Ms Jackie Sadek, director of the brokerage, said it was keen to encourage
companies to recruit among ethnic communities and women returners in
Islington and Hackney. But she emphasised it would 'never compromise on
quality'.
As many as 37 per cent of the ethnic community living in Islington have an
advanced educational qualification, but only 2 per cent of middle and higher
managerial City jobs are held by people from ethnic minorities.
The company, which will seek charitable status, will aim to link financial
and City institutions in their recruitment activities with local voluntary
and public-sector bodies which can find the appropriately qualified staff
locally.
Launching the brokerage, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England
governor, said the Bank was 'well aware of the high levels of unemployment,
the poor living standards and immense hardship that exist within a mile of
the City.'
The inspiration for the new company was a South Bank Polytechnic report two
years ago that pointed out that City employers did not look to the skills
and potential of the workforce on their doorstep, preferring to see the
whole of London and the south-east as their employment pool. It called for a
strategic partnership to create equal opportunity, bringing together private
City companies and the local authorities.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Patten eases governors' quandary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday gave school governors a
chance to avoid damaging confrontations with teachers and head teachers over
national curriculum tests.
Governors in England and Wales have a legal duty to implement the tests, in
spite of three teachers' unions boycotting them. Mr Patten has not heeded
calls by the National Association of Governors and Managers for the tests to
be made voluntary, but in a letter to governors yesterday he said they were
not expected to implement the tests if their teachers refused to administer
them.
He said governors will have performed their legal duties if they 'give a
clear lead that the professional course is to administer the tests', and
'satisfy themselves that teachers have been reminded of their duty to
administer the tests'.
Where boycotts do take place, governors are expected to 'consider carefully'
whether the tests can still be administered 'given the circumstances of the
school'. Finally, if any tests do take place, heads and governors are asked
to send the results to the department.
The Department for Education ruled out any attempt to impose sanctions on
governors, and said: 'We hope that as many people as possible will do the
tests. How governors, head teachers and local education authorities go about
doing it is a matter for them.'
Head teachers made it clear that the tests would not take place. Mr John
Sutton, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: 'The
simple fact is that our responsibility has been frustrated by the boycott of
the three unions.'
Secondary school head teachers in Hertfordshire yesterday told Mr Patten it
would be impossible to conduct tests for 14-year-olds this summer.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Cut-price advice plan for jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER Training and Enterprise Council yesterday launched a cut-price
redundancy counselling service for non-executive workers after trials
suggested it might reduce the time taken by some people to find new jobs.
The service, claimed to be the first of its kind offered by a Tec - the
employer-led bodies which administer government training schemes in England
and Wales - costs an employer Pounds 200 a day for up to 15 places on a
tutorial session with a qualified counsellor.
Daily rates in the private sector - usually for executives only - are said
to be in the Pounds 750 to Pounds 1,000 range.
Many smaller companies cannot afford to spend much on helping people they
make redundant - even though the government allows counselling costs to be
set against corporation tax.
Trials among six companies involved 200 redundant people. More than half
were back in work within three months.

FT  19 MAY 93 / More stay on at school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECORD proportion of 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds stayed in education in
England last year, figures released yesterday by the Department for
Education show.
They reveal that 66 per cent of all 16-year-olds stayed in full-time
education during the academic year 1991-92, compared with 60 per cent in the
previous year, while the proportion of 17-year-olds rose from 43 per cent to
49 per cent.
The government said the staying-on rate had increased 'dramatically', and
that provisional estimates for this year showed further 'leaps' to 70 per
cent of 16-year-olds, and 55 per cent of 17-year-olds.
Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, said the introduction
of new General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) would increase the
relevance of courses and stimulate greater participation.
He added: 'The government has also provided funding for a record 25 per cent
increase in student numbers in further education over the next three years.'
Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour's further and higher education spokesman, suggested
the figures were caused by the recession.
He said: 'We know, and most parents know, that this is entirely driven by
the lack of employment opportunities and a complete lack of faith in the
youth training alternatives which, significantly, have not attracted
anything like the same increase in numbers.'
Teachers' unions were also unimpressed. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of
the National Union of Teachers, said: 'With unemployment at around 3m can
anyone be surprised that more children are staying on?'
He also attributed rising staying-on rates to the continuing success of GCSE
examinations, which replaced the old system of GCE O-levels and CSEs four
years ago.
There were broad regional variations. In Knowsley, on Merseyside, only 43
per cent of 16-year-olds stayed in full-time education. This was exactly
half the proportion in the London borough of Barnet, where the 86 per cent
of pupils staying on was the highest proportion in the country.

THE Bank of England is to investigate Iraqi assets in the UK to identify any
which could be creamed off into a United Nations compensation fund for those
who suffered during the invasion of Kuwait, the Commons heard last night.
But Foreign Office minister Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd warned that it was thought
all such cash would be subject to prior claims.
Under a UN security council resolution, 30 per cent of the proceeds of oil
sales by Iraq under the Gulf war ceasefire terms will be placed in the fund
to compensate individuals, companies and countries. Iraq has so far refused
to make such sales.

PROFESSOR Patrick Minford, the leading economist, last night questioned the
chancellor's grasp of economics.
Prof Minford, one of the 'seven wise men' who act as independent economic
advisers to the government, said on Sky News: 'Norman Lamont says he wants a
stronger pound, but how can he possibly do so when the whole benefit of
getting out of the ERM was to let the pound drop, to find its own level, and
to let interest rates fall to allow the economy to recover? It's extremely
puzzling and it makes me worry whether he knows what he's doing.'
An ardent free-marketeer, Prof Minford has long advocated lower interest
rates and a lower pound.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Leasehold boost for tenants' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW concession aimed at increasing tenants' rights was made by ministers
yesterday as the House of Lords continued its discussion of the government's
controversial legislation on leasehold reform, Alison Smith writes.
The move will give eligible tenants the option of purchasing a lease
extension on their flats.
During yesterday's debate Lord Strathclyde, a junior environment minister,
responded to concern that if leaseholders failed to achieve the necessary
majority for enfranchising freeholds in a block of flats, they would not be
allowed the fallback right of extending their leases.
Lord Strathclyde said: 'I have decided that there is . . . a case for giving
all qualifying tenants the option of purchasing a new (extended) lease'.
Peers had warned tenants might not be able to persuade enough of their
neighbours to trigger enfranchisement and so would not benefit at all from
the leasehold reforms.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour electoral qualms reflected
in Plant report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS MORNING the Labour party's ruling National Executive Committee will
have before it the third report from the Plant Committee, a working party on
electoral systems chaired by Lord Plant, Professor of Politics at
Southampton University.
The report contains the committee's recommendations on appropriate electoral
systems for elections to the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the
European Parliament. If Labour adopts it the main opposition party will be
committed to electoral reform for the Commons for the first time since the
1920s.
The UK uses the first-past-the-post system for most elections, in which the
successful candidate is the one who receives the highest number of votes -
even if this is less than half the votes cast.
Opposition to this winner-takes-all approach has been growing among Labour
party members and that disquiet is reflected in the report, which says that
first-past-the-post fails to recognise the increasingly pluralistic nature
of British society.
The report says that the Commons would be strengthened if MPs represented
more closely the pattern of votes cast in various regions.
In seeking a new electoral system for the Commons, the report emphasises the
need to preserve the close link between MPs and constituencies to ensure
that elected representatives are accountable. This rules out electoral
systems such as Ireland's single transferable vote which has multi-member
constituencies, or list systems where voters choose parties rather than MPs
(as happens in Italy).
Lord Plant's personal preference was for a variant on Germany's electoral
system, with 500 MPs directly elected by constituencies and 150 others
nominated by parties so that seats in parliament reflect party support among
voters.
But he was unable to carry a majority for this system, largely because of
fears that it would create two classes of MPs. Instead, the committee went
for the supplementary vote, an electoral system devised by Mr Dale
Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, and used in no country in the
world.
Under the supplementary vote system, each voter would cast a first
preference and a second preference vote. If no candidate won more than half
the first preference votes, second preferences of the candidates with the
least votes would be redistributed to elect the candidate with the most
first and second preferences.
The supplementary vote system is not a proportional system - it could even
in some circumstances lead to a less proportional result than the current
first-past-the-post system.
But supplementary vote would involve the least change in the pattern of
representation in parliament. It would therefore probably encounter least
resistance if Labour ever tried to introduce it - many MPs would be
reluctant to vote for a change which might put them out of a job.
Its main advantage for its Labour supporters, however, is that it would have
reduced the number of Conservative MPs elected in the last election while
more than doubling the number of Liberal Democrats.
As Mr Campbell-Savours says in his contribution to the report: 'It is almost
inconceivable that there would not have been a Labour government, with the
support of the minority parties.'

FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government reaffirms need for
stable exchange rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT said yesterday that the best defence for sterling against
so-called currency speculators was to seek a stable exchange rate through
low inflation and low interest rates.
During discussions in the committee stage of the finance bill Mr Tony
Nelson, the Treasury economics secretary said: 'If you have stability, you
do not invite avalanches of speculation for or against a currency.'
Mr Nelson was responding to calls from the Labour party for the government
to state clearly what action it had taken to defend the pound against
currency speculators since sterling was forced out of the European exchange
rate mechanism in September.
Mr Alastair Darling, Labour frontbench spokesman on City affairs, said it
would be interesting to know what plans the government had to defend the
position of sterling in the future.
He said: 'Clearly at some stage the UK is going to go back into a fixed
exchange rate system prior to a single European currency.'
The government reiterated its opposition to an early re-entry to the ERM.
Mr Nelson said: 'It is not a realistic proposition to expect us to go back
into the ERM under current circumstances.' It would not happen until
'certain fundamental problems' inside and outside the mechanism had been
addressed, he said.
Mr Darling said the Labour party did not support the idea of a tax on
foreign currency transactions to deter speculation since this would penalise
legitimate business.
However, the opposition urged the government to consider what concerted
international action could be taken to prevent a repetition of the upheavals
witnessed among ERM currencies last year.
Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the government,
while complaining about the faults of the ERM, had proposed no reforms to
its structure.
Mr Beith added that the best way for the government to be able to deter
speculation was to move to a single European currency 'within which there is
no scope for speculation at all'.
Mr Nelson reminded the committee that although the government's economic
policy took into account the level of the pound, it had no specific target
for sterling's exchange rate.
Mr Nelson told MPs yesterday that the forecast cost of running the Treasury
in 1992-93 is Pounds 55.675m, compared with Pounds 44.969m in 1990-91.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Reform splits party down the line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISCUSSION in the national executive committee today about the report
from the Plant commission will mark a new phase in the Labour party's
crab-like and sometimes almost imperceptible progress towards electoral
reform.
The reason for the party's caution is immediately apparent. Long-standing
and deep divisions in Labour over electoral change were reflected even in
the commission itself. Its decision in favour of the supplementary vote
system, a limited form of proportional representation for electing MPs, was
taken by just nine votes to seven.
Among Labour MPs, those for and against electoral change are relatively
evenly matched in terms of numbers. Neither groups is so small that it could
be brushed aside.
The Labour campaign for electoral reform has the open support of just over
60 MPs and the closet backing of others. The campaign launched yesterday by
the defenders of the status quo - the parliamentary Labour
first-past-the-post group - has signed up 86 MPs so far and believes it will
be able to attract more than 100.
The split in the party goes right to the top. Mr John Major, the prime
minister, yesterday reminded the Commons that Mrs Margaret Beckett, the
party's deputy leader, had commented last year that: 'Any move on electoral
reform by Labour would be interpreted as defeatist'.
The fightback by those in favour of the status quo was stepped up yesterday,
with the launch of the new group which seeks to maintain the
first-past-the-post system for all elections. It has pledged to take its
campaign to the trade unions and to the constituency parties in the approach
to the conference. It claims support from the party's MEPs.
Mr Derek Fatchett, a junior frontbench spokesman and the group's chairman,
said Labour's last election campaign faltered when the party started talking
about constitutional issues and 'balanced government'.
He warned that any move on electoral reform would be a distraction from what
should be the priorities of a newly-elected Labour government and argued
that it would be unfair in giving a disproportionate advantage to the
Liberal Democrats. Against this background, the attractions of a referendum
are obvious.
Its potential disadvantage, in the embarrassing contrast between Labour's
approach to PR and its resistance to a referendum on Maastricht, seems a
small price to pay.
Many of those on both sides of the argument could live with a referendum as
the party conference decision, since each side believes it would win.
Mr Fatchett said: 'We would be extremely confident of winning that
referendum.'
Mr Jeff Rooker, a leading Labour campaigner for electoral reform, was
equally sanguine and said that he would not regard a referendum as a
'fudge'.
'The electoral system belongs to the British people, not to the
politicians,' he said.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers try to avert revolt on
post offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday ruled out making compulsory the payment of state
benefits direct into bank accounts, in an attempt to calm a threatened Tory
revolt over the impact on rural post offices.
Mr John Major signalled to MPs that in spite of Treasury pressure, the
government would not try to cut public spending by forcing pensioners and
others to be paid via their bank accounts.
'It is not the government's policy to remove the right of pensioners to
receive their pensions from the Post Office,' the prime minister said.
His comments came ahead of a Labour-initiated Commons debate today on
Automatic Credit Transfers, when Conservative MPs are expected to voice
alarm at the threat to rural communities if local post offices are hit.
Yesterday a succession of Tory backbenchers, including Mr William Powell, MP
for Corby, Mr Jacques Arnold (Gravesham) and Mr Robert Spink (Castle Point)
expressed concern in the Commons about the impact on post offices if social
security benefits were paid by ACT.
Ministers blame a lobbying operation by sub-postmasters for creating
unnecessary concern, but ministers and loyalist MPs are prepared to admit
that the government could have made its policy clearer earlier.
Now the government is working hard to quell any revolt. Mr Peter Lilley,
social security secretary, met backbench MPs yesterday and will today
reiterate the Conservative manifesto commitment to 'a nationwide network of
post offices'.
Mr Lilley, however, will say that the government is eager to encourage the
use of ACT, which results in substantial cost savings. On some benefits,
payment via post offices can be 14 times as expensive.
Ministers could offer the prospect that future privatisation would allow
rural post offices to compete with banks and other businesses.
Senior Tories said Labour had spoilt its chances of splitting off possible
Conservative rebels by tabling a motion linking the threat to post offices
to the government's 'mismanagement of the economy'.
The government amendment stresses a commitment to 'freedom of choice in the
means by which social security benefits are paid while reducing fraud and
unnecessary costs by extending the availability of ACT to all benefits'.
Sir Fergus Montgomery, Conservative MP for Altrincham and Sale, criticised a
pilot exercise launched by the Department of Social Security on ACT. He said
insufficient emphasis had been given to the fact that benefits would
continue to be paid through post offices.
Mr David Nicholson, Conservative MP for Taunton, urged ministers to accept
that the 'malaise' experienced by the party during the recent county council
elections should make proposals to privatise the Post Office 'a dead duck'.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster picks who empties its bins -
How little real power is at stake in the council elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN South Armagh, one of furthest-flung corners of the UK, the only
indication that local elections are taking place in Northern Ireland today
are the occasional posters advertising the local Sinn Fein candidates.
At the border village of Cullaville, where in the space of one mile one
crosses from the republic, into Northern Ireland and back into the republic
again, a more ominous hand-painted poster proclaims 'The barracks buster.
Reliable, accurate, effective.' referring to the IRA's latest heavy mortar
weapon.
Irish flags fly from the lampposts. Unlike the main roads that traverse the
border, there are no army checkpoints here. The only indication that one has
crossed back into the north is the better road surface.
A few miles further on at Crossmaglen a fortified police and army post,
bristling with radio antennae and observation towers, dominates the town's
square. A faded British flag flutters over the fortifications. The locals
refer to it disparagingly as 'the outpost'.
Conversation in the pubs centres on the fortunes of the local Gaelic
football teams. When the subject of politics is broached most people say
they are Sinn Fein supporters.
One man has his own question: 'Now what would an Englishman be doing in
Crossmaglen?'
Since direct rule from Westminster was imposed at the height of the troubles
in 1972 the province's councils have been stripped of most of their powers.
They administer cemeteries, garbage disposal and road cleaning, and have
some discretionary spending. But they have no say in affairs normally
associated with local government on the mainland, such as health, education,
housing and policing.
Across the province about 930 candidates are contesting 582 seats in 26
district councils. As in the general elections, national politics are of
little importance here. What will be tested instead is the balance of power
between the two unionist parties, the DUP and the UUP, and between the two
nationalist parties the SDLP, and Sinn Fein. The outcome may have a strong
bearing on whether the political talks process, abandoned last November
without agreement, can be put back on the rails.
In the last local elections in 1989 the more extreme of the two sides - the
DUP and Sinn Fein, suffered setbacks at the expense of the more moderate and
conciliatory UUP and SDLP.
The expectation is that should that trend be confirmed in today's elections
the British and Irish governments will be able to cajole the main parties
back to the negotiating table. A swing to the extremes will make the task
much more difficult.
But even should the moderates achieve further gains today, deep differences
remain between the UUP and SDLP on the timing of introducing greater local
powers.
The UUP manifesto demands 'an immediate restoration of accountable democracy
in Northern Ireland - the present system, wherein the most mundane local
problem can only be resolved by a department of central government or a
minister, is both remote and unresponsive.'
The SDLP has deep reservations about giving greater powers to local
government, outside the framework of a broader political settlement. The
SDLP prides itself on having introduced power sharing at local government
level with Unionist politicians, where the SDLP has been in a majority. In
Derry for example, an SDLP majority on the council rotates the position of
mayor, which is currently held by a member of the DUP.
The SDLP manifesto says: 'Belfast City Council on the other hand, controlled
at present by a Unionist coalition, has become a by-word for sectarian,
obstructionist politics of a kind that most of us hoped we had seen the last
of 20 years ago.'
The recent talks between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, has alarmed unionists who view it as the emergence
of a 'pan-nationalist front' comprising the two parties and the Dublin
government.
Although both Mr Hume and Sinn Fein emphatically deny they have agreed to
any electoral pact, the fact of them talking and issuing joint political
statements on the peace process could influence supporters to use their
transferable votes under the proportional representation system in the
province to support each others' candidates.
Sinn Fein have been told by all parties to the talks process that they
cannot expect a seat at the negotiating table until they first renounce
violence. Today's results are unlikely to change that position.
But the Loyalist gun attack on the Sinn Fein offices in Belfast on Monday
would seem to underline deep-seated Unionist fears of where the political
process may be heading.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Move to win over Tory rail rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS WILL try to reassure potential Tory rebels about the fate of
concessionary railcards after rail privatisation by emphasising that
attitudes to concessionary fares would be taken into account in awarding
franchises.
Only the disabled person's railcard is guaranteed by the privatisation
legislation. Ministers have argued that private-sector operators will want
to provide railcards voluntarily under the new arrangements - as British
Rail does now - because they are profitable.
But the issue is one of a handful on which uneasy Tory backbenchers are
seeking concessions from the government to make the proposals more workable
and more politically popular.
When the Commons debates the detail of the rail privatisation bill next week
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is expected to say that while
ministers do not believe the railcards should be rigidly protected in the
legislation, it would be reasonable for them to be a factor in the
competition for franchises.
The rebels are expecting to table their amendments to the legislation today,
and Sir Keith Speed, a former minister and a leading rebel, is likely to
meet Mr MacGregor before the end of the week.
Mr MacGregor saw more than 20 backbenchers on Monday evening and remains
confident that when the government's position on fares, line closures and
BR's ability to compete for the franchises is fully explained MPs are
broadly content with the plans.
While ministers are determined not to give way on allowing BR itself to
compete to run services they will seek to calm Tory fears about fare
increases and line closures.
They will emphasise that line-closure procedures will remain, and that fares
will still be regulated on monopoly services, arguing that on others
competition will prevent unreasonable rises.

THE PRIME minister yesterday rejected repeated demands by Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader, for a public inquiry into the Beverley Allitt child murder
case.
Mr Smith demanded: 'In view of the appalling negligence that has obviously
occurred why is the government refusing to have a full public inquiry with
the powers to require the evidence of witnesses on oath and compel the
disclosure of all documents?'.
But Mr Major stressed that Sir Cecil Clothier, a former health service
commissioner who is to conduct an independent inquiry, believed people would
be more willing to speak freely if the proceedings were not conducted in
public.

A RECORD Pounds 440,000 damages award to the widow of a former worker at
British Rail's Swindon works who died from asbestosis was cancelled by the
Court of Appeal yesterday.
The court allowed an appeal by BR and ordered a rehearing of the
compensation claim, which was launched by Mr Percy Coombs after he became
ill and taken over by his widow Sally after his death in 1989.
Three appeal judges held that Mr Justice Johnson wrongly refused to allow BR

FT  19 MAY 93 / Race bias case settled for Pounds 25,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ASIAN accountant who claimed he was demoted, victimised and forced to
take early retirement has accepted what is believed to be the largest
race-case settlement made by a local authority.
Mr Lakshman Pardhanani, 56, accepted Pounds 25,000 in an out-of-court
settlement from the Labour-controlled London Borough of Camden after taking
the council to an industrial tribunal, where he claimed racial
discrimination.
Mr Pardhanani joined Camden council's works department as finance and data
manager in 1986. He said that on the first day he was informed by the
assistant director that he would not be responsible for the full range of
duties and staff as advertised. The following year his department was
restructured and his post was abolished.
The Commission for Racial Equality, which backed his case at the industrial
tribunal, said two further posts, one created for him, and another at a
lower level, were also abolished.
Mr Pardhanani said after the settlement: 'With its declared commitment to
equal opportunities, Camden council appears to be an ideal organisation to
work for but my experience shows otherwise. It was traumatically different
from its promise. I suffered racial harassment during my time there.'
The CRE said the settlement was the largest race-case settlement by a local
authority.
Camden council, which has shed about 2,000 workers over the past two years,
decided to offer an out-of-court settlement after spending three weeks at
the industrial tribunal. It denied yesterday that any discrimination or
victimisation took place.
It said the settlement was reached outside the industrial tribunal with no
admission of liability on its part.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Building unions seek local-level pay deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE UNIONS covering 600,000 building and civil engineering workers intend
to seek company and site-level wage deals for members after rejecting the
employers' demand for a 12-month wage freeze.
The unions said in a joint statement after yesterday's breakdown of national
negotiations: 'To reject out of hand any increase on wage rates already as
low as Pounds 7,000 a year is simply to store up trouble for the future.'
They added that the 'employers' inability to negotiate a realistic increase
must also cast doubt on the credibility of their industrial relations
practices. There are doubtless many contractors now facing the task of
negotiating wages directly who will question the tactics of their national
negotiators'.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Faster electricity growth forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACCELERATION in the growth of demand for electricity in England and Wales
over the rest of this decade is forecast by the electricity industry.
The National Grid Company's annual collation of forecasts by the regional
electricity companies yesterday pointed to an annual average increase of 1.6
per cent compared with the 1.1 per cent forecast in last year's report.
It says that a number of prospective power generation projects have been
cancelled. As a result the large surplus of generating capacity of 60 per
cent foreshadowed by last year's report has been cut.
The surplus now appears to peak at between 24 per cent and 37 per cent in
1995-96, depending on the scenarios used. The uncertainty depends to some
extent on whether the large number of gas-fired power stations on the
drawing board would actually go ahead. Also unknown is the number of
potential closures of ageing coal-fired and first generation nuclear power
stations.
Mr Eric Eunson, the general manager of power systems development, said that
there was still a shortage of power generation capacity in the south of
England, and this created bottlenecks in the grid.
The NGC has proposed ways of hedging against possible shortages to make the
grid more commercially sensitive to strains in the system.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Failed debt trader's assets short by Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSETS OF London and Provincial Factors, the debt trading company that
failed in February, fall short of its liabilities by Pounds 6.76m, according
to documents to be formally presented to creditors today.
Unsecured creditors cannot expect a dividend. They include some small
businesses to which LPF had advanced some money against the full value of
their invoices. The outstanding balances now belong to LPF and some
businesses have experienced difficulties as result.
The value of the assets shown in the company's books is Pounds 9.11m but
estimates made by the directors suggest that realisations will total Pounds
4.58m.
Mr Scott Barnes, one of the receivers, said: 'The ultimate realisations of
assets will only become clear over the course of the next few months.'
Figures for LPF's trading performance for the eight months to February show
that on income of Pounds 1.5m the company had to make a Pounds 6m provision
for clients' bad debts after some failed, although the debt may have been
increased by the receivership. LPF made its money by lending to clients
against their invoices.
The Inland Revenue is investigating the circumstances of the collapse of two
of LPF's clients. The Fraud Squad is believed to be considering related
information.
The directors' statement of affairs said the shortfall included Pounds 2.77m
owed to clients on February 26.
Gota Bank of Sweden stands to lose Pounds 3.6m of its Pounds 5m loan secured
by a floating charge against the assets of the company. Any payment can only
be made after settlement of Pounds 3.16m in secured loans made to LPF by
four other banks.
Receivers at accountants Grant Thornton will tell creditors today that
agreement has been reached with 18 clients who have bought back their
invoices by returning monies lent.
One of the unsecured creditors is Mr Steve Mills, managing director of Leo
Colour Printers (formerly Leo Lithographics). He said: 'This mess has cost
me two of my best customers. I feel strongly that independent factors ought
to be more tightly regulated.'

FT  19 MAY 93 / Accountants back merger of institutes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's six principal accountancy bodies face the prospect of merger if
they follow the views of their members canvassed in a poll conducted earlier
this year.
The findings of the survey, due to be released today, show an overwhelming
majority in favour of 'rationalisation' of the profession.
That could lead to greatly increased co-operation and ultimately to the
merger of the existing professional bodies, each with their own
qualifications and different letters after the names of their members.
Nearly three quarters of a sample of 7,000 of the UK's 200,000 accountants
said rationalisation was necessary, with 43 per cent strongly favouring
reform. Just 19 per cent opposed a change.
The bodies affected are the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and the
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.
Publication of the survey results, conducted by the market research agency
Tenet Consulting, has been delayed following debate between the bodies over
the way to present the results.
Executives and elected officials have been highly sensitive to the subject
of mergers because several previous attempts to reduce the number of bodies
have failed in the last few years. The poll shows that members of the
Scottish Institute - who resisted a merger with the English Institute in
1989 - were the only ones with more opposition than support for
rationalisation.
Cipfa members, who rejected a merger with the ICAEW in 1990, have shifted to
favouring rationalisation. The bodies are to announce a working party to
consider the options, chaired by Mr David Bishop of KPMG Peat Marwick, past
president of the certified accountants, which will report back in July.

FT  19 MAY 93 / BT agrees payout over RSI claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT AND the National Communications Union yesterday agreed on an out-of-court
settlement over the case of 11 former data processing officers who
contracted repetitive strain injury.
Without admitting liability BT has agreed to make payments to the women
concerned and meet the union's legal costs. Neither side would disclose the
amount involved.
Mr Tony Young, the NCU's general secretary, said yesterday: 'Our members
will receive proper compensation.'
Mr Peter Archer, BT's employee relations director, said he was pleased a
settlement had been reached. 'When we started down this long, legal road
both sides believed this case would be seen as a test case for RSI injury
claims linked with keyboard work. When we studied the judgment we realised
it would not.'
In December 1991 the Mayor and City of London court ruled that the keyboard
operation was partly the cause of RSI among the 11, employed at Cardiff and
Swindon in the early 1980s, but that this was not due to BT's negligence.
The company had not been aware of the danger at the time.
A hearing scheduled for the Appeal Court this week has been deferred
indefinitely. About 90 other RSI claims against BT are also likely to be
resolved without recourse to the courts.
Mr Jim Moher, the union's chief legal officer, said BT had agreed to hold
joint discussions on establishing guidelines for dealing with the other RSI
compensation claims.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Revenue denies staff overstep powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPUTY chairman of the Inland Revenue yesterday rejected criticism that
tax inspectors placed undue pressure on taxpayers.
Mr Leonard Beighton told the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales there was no independent evidence of
inspectors overstepping their powers.
The targets set for inspectors were not yield but the number and quality of
cases they considered.
'Our job is to assess and collect the proper amount of tax, not the most tax
we can collect,' he said.
The person appointed to the new post of adjudicator 'will most certainly not
be a Revenue poodle', he added.
He said the Revenue was placing greater responsibility and accountability on
staff by shortening lines of communication and reducing layers of
management.
The traditional divide between the tax assessment and collection divisions
in the Revenue was being dissolved, with an expansion in the number of
district offices and of taxpayer assistance offices.
He said the Revenue was responding to findings in surveys of taxpayers which
highlighted the need above all for tax to be assessed accurately first time.
It had set up initiatives such as a review into why errors are made.
The Inland Revenue will accept computations of business profits in figures
rounded to the nearest Pounds 1,000 from single businesses or companies with
an annual turnover of not less than Pounds 5m, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial
secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday.
The aim is to reduce the compliance burden on large businesses which produce
their statutory accounts in round thousands but have to repeat the
accounting work in exact pound units solely for tax purposes, he said in a
parliamentary answer.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Personal pensions under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSIONS NEED a radical overhaul, including the introduction of a new
national personal pension scheme and sharp increases in the basic state
payout, says the Institute for Public Policy Research.
The institute, a left-of-centre think tank, says in a review of UK state and
private pension provision published today that the new personal pension
scheme should invest in a new class of government bond.
It says that the government's increasing reliance on personal pensions for
retirement provision is badly misguided. The cost of operating a personal
pension is about four times that of state schemes and offers a reasonable
level of benefit to a very limited percentage of people, it says.
Personal pensions are not practical for those earning less than Pounds 8,000
to Pounds 9,000 a year because they cannot contribute enough to make the
contract worthwhile, it says. The average salary for those without an
occupational pension scheme, for whom personal pensions are advised, is
about Pounds 8,750.
The institute says the government should substantially increase state
pension benefit instead of relying on personal pensions. 'The higher basic
pension would be set, as a minimum, at the income support level for
pensioners. An allowance for housing costs would be paid in addition.'
It says the increases could be financed by restoration of the Treasury
supplement to the National Insurance Fund. The cost would be covered in part
by the abolition of the income tax age allowance.
Necessary tax increases among the working population could be phased in
sufficiently slowly to have minimal effects on take-home pay, it says.
The institute urges an overhaul of the state earnings-related pension
scheme, with the government creating a new national personal pension scheme
to be funded by member contributions - which would in effect be long-term
savings. It proposes the investment of these contributions in a new
government security - 'national insurance pension bonds' - with the capital
value linked to an index of national average earnings.
Interest would be in line with the assumptions underlying calculations of
tax incentives offered to those who contract out of this type of provision.
The institute is urging an overhaul of occupational pensions regulation
which would include rules protecting the benefits of those who switch jobs.
There should be industry schemes for those whose employer makes no pension
provision, it says.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Crossrail pressure resisted by Major
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT tried yesterday to head off pressure from business leaders
for a swift decision on the timing of legislation needed before the Pounds
2bn London Crossrail scheme can go ahead.
As Mr John Major chaired a cabinet committee called to discuss the future of
the joint public-private sector project, Downing Street played down
suggestions that an early decision was vital if the project was to survive.
Mr Major faced a dispute between the Treasury and the Department of
Transport over the spread of risk between the private and public sectors.
When agreed, the formula is expected to set the trend for other joint
projects - including the extension of the Jubilee underground line -
following a change of rules announced in the Autumn Statement.
The prime minister is keen to encourage more private involvement in
infrastructure projects, but the Treasury insists that commercial sponsors
should not be allowed to make a return without risk.
However, in a letter to The Times today, 13 business leaders complain there
has been little progress since the project was given approval in October.
They emphasise that they understand pressures on public spending, but say
they do not expect the Treasury to foot all of the bill - the private sector
had indicated its willingness to contribute substantial sums.
Signatories include Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of
British Industry; Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of
Directors; Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange; Mr Mick
Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential; Mr Colin Parsons, chairman of

FT  19 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC urged to curb cement imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GERMAN Cement Industry Federation yesterday urged the European
Commission to apply anti-dumping measures promptly against east European
cement makers to prevent unfair competition in the German market.
Cement makers in Germany, together with other European cement enterprises,
filed a complaint to the EC last year. Pointing to the continued increase in
cement imports from eastern Europe, Mr Jurgen Lose, head of the federation,
said yesterday he expected the Commission to issue a ruling soon.
Ironically, the largest west European cement makers have been vying to
acquire shares of the cement industry in eastern Europe in order to secure
cheap production costs close to the Community borders.
In the Czech republic, where the cement industry was the first one to be
sold to foreign investors, the Belgian Cimenterie CBR, Heidelberger Zement,
Germany's largest cement producer, and Holderbank of Switzerland have bought
significant equity shares in local cement companies. Heidelberger Zement is
also currently negotiating the acquisition of a cement company in Hungary.
But the German cement industry federation argues that imports from these
countries represent unfair competition for cement producers in Germany and
is undermining the local cement industry. East Europeans have been selling
one tonne of cement at DM60 (Pounds 24), while German producers offer their
products at DM130-DM140 a tonne.
East Europe exported 5.4m tonnes of cement to Germany in 1992, up 50 per
cent on the previous year. German cement producers sold 33m tonnes of cement
in their domestic market last year.
The federation wants such imports to be reduced or their increase curbed by
higher custom tariffs and quotas. East European producers represented 75 per
cent of all 1992 cement imports into Germany.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEDERAL jury in Newark, New Jersey, yesterday cleared Westinghouse
Electric and a New Jersey engineering company of charges that the two had
bribed former Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos to win a 1976 contract
to build a nuclear power plant, Our New York Staff reports.
The Philippine government accused Westinghouse and Burns &amp; Roe of funnelling
nearly Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) in bribes to Mr Marcos through an
associate. The Philippines sought Dollars 26.6m in compensatory damages.
Most of the counts in the suit had been dismissed by the judge, who ordered
them to be sent to outside arbitration.
The trial had gone ahead on three remaining counts.
General Raul Goco, Philippines solicitor general, said: 'This does not end
the process. . . but we are very disappointed.' He said his country was
engaged in arbitration with the two companies before an international
tribunal in Geneva over allegations of breach of contract, negligence, civil
conspiracy and anti-trust violations.
Mr Louis Briskman, Westinghouse senior vice-president and general counsel,
said at the end of the two-month trial: 'We are pleased an impartial jury
has reaffirmed Westinghouse's innocence and the integrity of our business
practices. . . This issue is almost 20 years old and it has been reviewed
over and over again since the mid-1970s. Once again we have been
exonerated.'

turned into one of the most important for western suppliers seeking orders
to upgrade nuclear plants in eastern Europe.
Westinghouse said the contracts were the largest yet awarded for safety and
performance related upgrades of Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. The
customers are the plant owner, Ceske Energeticke Zavody, and the primary
plant supplier, Skoda Prague.
They are also the first such orders for a western company for the VVER1000
type of reactors, widely viewed as the Soviet design that approximates most
closely to western safety standards.
Overall costs for upgrading the 81 Soviet-designed nuclear stations in
Russia, Ukraine and eastern Europe have been estimated at Dollars 10bn.
There are 38 VVER1000s in operation or under construction.
Westinghouse was told in September it had been selected to supply a Dollars
220m instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) system to the Temelin plant, which
has two units each of 1,000MW, and a month later that it would supply the
first core and four reloads of fuel.
But the Czech government only formally announced in March that it would
continue construction of the plant.
The I&amp;C system will be manufactured at Westinghouse factories in Pittsburgh
and Brussels, with participation of companies in the Czech republic. The
fuel will be made in the US but Skoda Plzen, the reactor vessel supplier for
the two Temelin units, will join Westinghouse in fuel testing and
development programmes.
Equipment suppliers have been pushing western governments and supranational
bodies to step up financing for nuclear safety work in eastern Europe. In
this case, 85 per cent of financing has come from the US Exim Bank and
Belgian export credits, the balance provided by European banks. The Czech
government is guaranteeing the loans.

FT  19 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Gatt sounds warning over EC preferential
trading - How fears of a 'fortress Europe' have proven unjustified as
markets become more open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's single market programme has generally made its
markets more open to foreign trade and fears of a 'fortress Europe' have so
far proved unjustified, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concludes
in its second review of EC trade policies.
However, Gatt's economists remain concerned about the extension of
preferential trading arrangements, which apply to three-quarters of EC
external trade. The report also warns that economic recession, compounded by
problems related to German reunification, eastern Europe and the stalemate
in the Gatt trade talks, 'has increased the risk that more defensive trade
policies will be followed'.
The cautiously favourable tone of the report is in marked contrast to the
highly critical approach of Gatt's first EC review in April 1991. EC
officials, calling the latest assessment 'pretty fair', said this reflected
trade liberalising developments over the past two years and a less severe
attitude on Gatt's part towards preferential trade accords.
The single European market, designed to ensure the free flow of goods,
services, capital and labour from January this year, has 'improved access,
transparency and legal security in many sectors,' the report says.
Many national import restrictions, especially on goods from Asia or eastern
Europe, have been scrapped. The Community has also taken steps to liberalise
a number of industrial sectors - notably telecommunications, pharmaceuticals
and coal - by harmonising standards and regulations, reducing entry barriers
and introducing competition into previously strictly controlled areas.
In several sensitive areas, however, the picture is less clear cut. In
steel, Gatt notes that subsidies have been curbed and voluntary restraint
arrangements with the US abandoned. At the same time, 'the EC's resolve to
defend these achievements is under challenge' from stronger import
competition, a 'dramatic decline' in domestic demand and deteriorating
export markets, exacerbated by countervailing and anti-dumping actions in
the US and Canada.
EC import surveillance remains in force and some steel imports from central
Europe and Egypt have recently been subjected to anti-dumping duties or
price undertakings, the report notes.
Elsewhere, Community-wide restraints have replaced the previous maze of
national import curbs, for example on cars, bananas and canned tuna and
sardines. The uneasy 'consensus' with Japan on cars is intended to provide
temporary and declining relief for EC producers until full liberalisation by
the year 2000.
However, the new banana import regime is under challenge in Gatt from Latin
American producers who face tougher restrictions in the unified market.
EC agriculture in general remains highly protected, with about one-half of
farm income coming from price and other supports, according to Gatt. The
reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy agreed last year imply a
significant decline from 1993-94 onwards in levels of price support for
cereals, beef and veal. But while reduced support may cut overproduction and
exports, the impact on import demand is less clear. Other subsidised
products, especially milk and sugar, 'are largely unaffected by the reform
package,' the report says.
Gatt has similarly equivocal views on the extension of EC preferential
trading arrangements to the European Free Trade Association, central and
eastern Europe, and Mediterranean countries.
This has led to 'a complex hierarchy' of overlapping preferential trading
systems within Europe, spreading outwards from the EC to the European
Economic Area agreements with Efta countries (except Switzerland), the
Europe Agreements with central and eastern European countries and parallel
agreements among the Ceecs and between them and Efta members.
While these moves liberalise trade in many products, they depart further
from Gatt's non-discriminatory trading principles, the report says.
EC officials counter that less than 30 per cent of imports actually benefit
from preferences and that, with trade representing a quarter of GDP, the
Community is a more open economy than either the US or Japan.
Easy access to the EC market is seen as vital for eastern and central
Europe. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria
sent 75 per cent of their total exports to the Community in 1991, roughly
half of which entered duty-free.
Gatt's economists praise the EC for its commitment not to take unilateral
action in pursuing trade grievances where multilateral remedies exist
(making an implicit comparison with the United States). However, they are
concerned about frequent EC recourse to anti-dumping action, and the use of
safeguard provisions under the new Europe Agreements which Gatt says may be
contrary to international fair trade rules.
The report warns that recent moves to give the executive European Commission
more powers in trade policy matters, for example in anti-dumping cases, may
increase flexibility but may also make decision-making more vulnerable to
short-term pressures and vested interests.
That danger, Gatt argues, makes it all the more vital to conclude a
successful Uruguay Round agreement that would put in place a stable and
effective framework of multilateral rules and disciplines.

Hoegh said that the de-livered price of the carriers included interest and
other costs.
The contract includes an option for a third car carrier.
The shipowner said the carriers would replace two ships which had been sold.
The new ships can carry 6,100 cars and will have flexibility to use capacity

FT  19 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Gatt gives qualified welcome to recent EC
trade developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gatt's governing council yesterday gave a qualified welcome to recent EC
trade developments, despite reservations on some individual policies and
programmes, Frances Williams writes.
Gatt members broadly agreed that the single market had enhanced market
flexibility and improved business opportunities for internal and external
suppliers alike. However, there was criticism that the replacement of
national restrictions by Community-wide measures had raised external trade
barriers for cars, canned fish and bananas.
Defending EC policies, Mr Roderick Abbott, head of international trade
policy in Brussels, said that trade with countries outside Europe (excluding
oil) accounted for two-thirds of total trade and nearly 70 per cent of EC
imports entered duty-free or on best available terms.
EC harmonisation aimed to reduce trade barriers, while the Europe Agreements
with eastern Europe were designed to eliminate all restrictions within a
specified period.
Gatt membership has risen to 111 with the accession yesterday of St Vincent
and the Grenadines, a tiny Caribbean banana producer.

LAST YEAR'S oilseeds dispute between the US and the EC cost Allied-Lyons,
the UK food and drinks group, between Dollars 2m and Dollars 3m (Pounds

Montagnon. This represents the expense of building up and storing stocks in
the US as a precaution against the imposition of sanctions, it said when

Among Allied-Lyons' products that would have been hit was Courvoisier
cognac. 'Resolution of the Gatt agreement is important to us,' said Mr

FT  19 MAY 93 / Cambodian Elections: UN team chief condemns Cambodian
factions

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YASUSHI AKASHI, who heads the embattled United Nations Transitional
Authority in Cambodia, yesterday bitterly criticised Cambodian factions
which have failed to co-operate with the UN's peacekeeping mission and
warned them not to disrupt the election scheduled for next week, Victor
Mallet reports from Phnom Penh.
In a statement issued in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, Mr Akashi
condemned an upsurge of violence in recent days, including an artillery
attack on Siem Reap airport and the assassination of three election
campaigners, one from the royalist party Funcinpec and two from the Buddhist
Liberal Democratic party.
'In doing our utmost to create and maintain at least the minimum acceptable
conditions for the conduct of an election, we have been hampered by the
unco-operativeness and outright hostility of some of the Cambodian parties
that signed the Paris agreements,' he said.
Mr Akashi's attack was aimed at the government in Phnom Penh, which has
intimidated voters throughout the country and is blamed for the murder of
dozens of opposition party officials, and at the Khmer Rouge, which has
threatened to disrupt the election after flouting the Paris peace accords it
and the other three factions signed in 1991.
'Any armed attack on voters or polling stations will be considered an act of
betrayal against the Cambodian people,' he said. 'I will recommend to the
(UN) Security Council the international community give all support to the
new Cambodian government in bringing to justice the perpetrators of such
crimes.'
Mr Khieu Kanharith, spokesman for the Phnom Penh administration, meanwhile
said the government may not launch an offensive against Khmer Rouge
guerrilla strongholds if it won the election.
'If we win, and if the Khmer Rouge stay quiet in their zones, we will not
take any military action,' he told a news conference. 'We have more
important things to do.'
He also claimed that the Khmer Rouge and Funcinpec had infiltrated 800
agents into Phnom Penh. to organise demonstrations or even an armed
insurrection.
In the election campaign, which ends today, the government has sought to
portray itself as the only party which can protect Cambodians from the Khmer
Rouge.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Pressure mounts for Clinton to recognise Angolan government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration is coming under increasing domestic and
international pressure to recognise the Angolan government of President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos.
Influential black Americans, including the Rev Jesse Jackson and Congressman
Kweisi Mfume of Maryland who heads the congressional black caucus, are
urging the step to make it clear to Mr Jonas Savimbi and his rebel Unita
movement that renewed fighting in Angola is unacceptable to the US.
Mr Jackson has urged President Bill Clinton to invite President Ibrahim
Babangida of Nigeria to Washington to demonstrate the US commitment to
democratic reform in Africa. Mr Mfume wants direct talks with Mr Clinton to
emphasise the gravity of several African problems.
The case for Angolan recognition, which has strong support inside the State
Department, is being given fresh impetus this week by celebrations
commemorating the 40th anniversary of the African-American Institute, a
private-sector interest group.
Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, plans to address the institute,
as will President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. It is possible Mr Christopher
will use his speech to make a policy statement on Angola.
Mr Savimbi refused to accept the results of last September's elections,
narrowly won by Mr Dos Santos, and ordered the civil war renewed. Last week
Unita rejected the latest peace plan offered by US, Portuguese, Russian and
UN negotiators.
For many years Mr Savimbi has enjoyed the backing of US conservatives, most
conspicuously Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina, who
portrayed him as a heroic bulwark against Soviet and Cuban ambitions. Mr
Clinton was accused this week by Mr Anthony Lewis, the New York Times
columnist, of refusing to take an initiative in Angola for fear of upsetting
Mr Helms and his cohorts.
Mr Anthony Lake, national security adviser, who has been turning his
attention to African problems, conceded in a recent speech that the US could
have reacted more strongly to Mr Savimbi's rej-ection of last September's
election results.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Cambodian Elections: Polling stations in the battleground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KOMPONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TO ORGANISE an election when four-fifths of the polling stations are likely
to be within artillery range of a notoriously brutal guerrilla group which
has vowed to disrupt the voting would seem like folly anywhere else.
An election, however, is what the United Nations is determined to hold in
Cambodia from May 23 to May 28, despite the concern among senior UN election
officials that Khmer Rouge guerrillas will attack polling stations with
guns, mortars and small arms.
Nervous Cambodian voters can hardly have been comforted by the announcement
that the US is sending 6,500 flak jackets, 10,000 helmets, medical supplies
and flares for the election workers and monitors, and Australia is providing
six armed Blackhawk helicopters.
In Kompong Cham, the most populous province in Cambodia and one of the
richest by virtue of its fertile farmland, the difficulties facing the UN
Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) as it seeks to bring peace and
democracy to a country which has known neither for more than 20 years are
all too evident.
Here on the banks of the Mekong river, and throughout the country, Khmer
Rouge attacks on Untac and fighting between the Khmer Rouge and the Phnom
Penh administration have abated somewhat in the last 10 days.
But most Cambodians and western diplomats regard it as an ominous lull
rather than a cause for celebration; and even in this climate of relative
calm the pot-holed road between Phnom Penh and Kompong Cham is best
travelled with an armed UN escort of Indonesian troops because of daily
killings and robberies by unidentified gunmen.
Under the terms of the Paris peace accord signed by the four main Cambodian
factions in 1991, all soldiers and guerrillas were supposed to have been
disarmed before this election, but the decision by the extreme left-wing
Khmer Rouge to flout the agreement means that voters will go to the polls in
the midst of an unfinished civil war.
The fact that the two military protagonists - the Khmer Rouge and the
government installed by the Vietnamese invasion which overthrew the Khmer
Rouge in 1979 - are both still heavily armed is dangerous not only for
voters and election workers but also for the credibility of the election
itself.
On the one side, Cambodian government forces have threatened to kill people
who fail to vote for the government's Cambodian People's Party; in Kompong
Cham province alone at least 16 opposition campaigners working for the
royalist party Funcinpec or for the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party have
been murdered.
On the other side, Khmer Rouge guerrillas - who fear the government will win
the election and receive the international recognition withheld for the last
14 years - want to discredit the poll and have threatened to kill those who
vote.
In many cases UN volunteers working as district electoral supervisors feel
they are risking their lives for an election of dubious validity, and 60 out
of more than 400 nationwide have resigned since a Japanese volunteer was
killed last month.
Security concerns have forced Untac to reduce the number of polling sites in
Cambodia to about 1,500 from 2,200. In Kompong Cham province, which will
account for 18 of the 120 seats in the new constituent assembly, UN
officials reckon that only 70 per cent of the 703,613 registered voters have
a reasonable chance of reaching a polling station.
'I will not say that conditions are there for free and fair elections,' says
Mr Theo Noel, the outspoken Canadian who is provincial electoral officer for
Kompong Cham. 'If you talk to General (John) Sanderson (Untac's military
commander) he will say everything is okay. It's not true.'
Untac has been unable to stop blatant intimidation of voters by the
government, and has stood by while Khmer Rouge guerrillas expanded the area
under their control. Last year they were present in four of the province's
16 districts; today they are active in 15.
The strongest justification now offered by UN officials and diplomats for
pressing ahead with the election is that the alternatives - cancellation or
delay - would be worse.
In the words of Mr Noel, it would be 'a disaster for the UN and a disaster
for Cambodia' to call off the voting. 'We have no choice,' he says. 'If we
had an alternative I would never say yes to this.'
For all the violence, many of the country's 4.8m registered voters still
seem keen to vote. 'They are very scared, but they still want absolutely to
go to the election,' says Mr Noel, although he acknowledges that voters will
stay away if the Khmer Rouge does decide to attack polling stations. 'The
bottom line is that if they have the choice between their life and the vote,
they will choose their life.'

<TEXT>
MALAWI'S President Kamuzu Banda has pledged to do everything in his power to
ensure the June 14 referendum on whether the country should switch to
multi-party rule is free and fair, Reuter reports from Blantyre.
He announced he had accepted a proposal mooted by the United Nations that
there should be a single ballot box at each polling station rather than
separate ones for Yes and No votes.
Mr Banda's pledge came as Amnesty International said pro-democracy
campaigners in the referendum were likely to face attacks, death threats,
arrest and prosecution.
'I will do everything to make sure this is a free and fair referendum,' the
president said. The government had previously insisted that two ballot boxes
be used at each polling station, prompting opposition charges that this
would make vote-rigging easier.
Pro-democracy activists in Malawi, who had threatened to boycott the
referendum if two boxes were used, described Mr Banda's announcement as a
'humiliating defeat' for the ruling Malawi Congress party.
Amnesty, a London-based human rights organisation, said in a report that
regulations appearing to protect free speech for campaign participants were
deeply flawed and ineffective.
'Those who do speak out for multi-party democracy are likely to face human
rights violations. Unless the government takes urgent steps to guarantee
basic human rights, the referendum cannot be considered fair,' it said.
Amnesty has been refused access to Malawi, ruled for 29 years by
life-President Banda, after alleging serious human rights abuses there for
many years.
It called on the government to protect the rights of participants in the
referendum campaign and to release Mr Chakufwa Chihana, a trade unionist
serving a nine-month jail sentence for sedition.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UN calls for new priorities in development aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIALISED and developing nations need a new agenda to make sure that
development benefits people, not governments, according to a United Nations
report.
Warning that 90 per cent of the world's people are excluded from
participation in the economy or in politics, the annual Human Development
Report, prepared by economists for the UN Development Programme, calls for
development to benefit women, rural dwellers, ethnic minorities and other
groups that have been shut out.
'Many of today's struggles are more than struggles for access to political
power. They are struggles for access to the ordinary opportunities of life -
land, water, work, living space and basic social services,' said Mr William
Draper, UNDP's administrator, in a foreword to the report.
The report uses a composite index of life expectancy, educational
achievement and purchasing power to gauge the level of human development in
each country, and warns that income levels do not always equate with human
development.
'Several countries - such as Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Madagascar,
Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Uruguay - have done well in translating their income
into the lives of their people: their human development rank is way ahead of
their per capita income rank.
'Other societies - such as Algeria, Angola, Gabon, Guinea, Namibia, Saudi
Arabia, Senegal, South Africa and United Arab Emirates - have income ranks
far above their human development rank, showing their enormous potential for
improving the lives of their people,' the report says.
The report ranks Japan's level of human development highest, ahead of
Canada, Norway and Switzerland.
Barbados, Hong Kong and Cyprus are the highest ranked developing countries.
But adjusting for gender disparity pushes Japan down to 17th position
because of high maternal mortality rates and wage discrimination.
The report notes that whites in the US would rank first, but that US blacks
and Hispanics have lower development rankings than many third world
countries, with far worse levels of mortality, education and income than
whites.
The report sees some signs of encouragement, however. Global military
spending has declined by a cumulative Dollars 240bn (Pounds 160bn) since
1987, for example, and if developing nations merely froze their military
spending at 1990's level, they would release another Dollars 100bn over the
next decade.
It calls for accelerated disarmament, new patterns of economic development
to combat the 'jobless growth' that has emerged in recent years, and a
pragmatic middle way between the advocates of free markets and of state
intervention.
The report calls on industrialised countries to reorient their aid towards
the poorest countries and away from high militar spenders.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Strong yen brings Japanese little joy: Michiyo Nakamota sees
no early import boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE of the yen's value against the dollar has been cited by both
Japanese and US officials as a factor that would help stimulate Japanese
consumption of imported goods and, in the long run, reduce Japan's Dollars
126bn (Pounds 82bn) trade surplus.
But so far, for Japanese corporations and consumers alike, the impact of the
yen's appreciation this year has brought little to rejoice about.
'There are only demerits of endaka (the yen's appreciation) but no merits,'
laments Mr Yasuaki Takano, president of Sanyo Electric, who explains that
because utility costs have not come down his company has seen none of the
benefits of a higher yen.
In spite of the yen's rapid rise over the past few months, and the fact that
Japan imports a large proportion of its raw materials and basic foodstuffs,
there is spreading scepticism in Japan whether a higher yen will bring the
desired benefits to consumers and importers and eventually help reduce the
country's bloated trade surplus.
The yen appreciation has raised calls from industry and consumer
associations alike for measures to ensure that the benefits do not disappear
in the maze of Japan's complicated distribution system but are passed on
fully to end-users and consumers.
The government's Economic Planning Agency has started a survey of imported
products to determine whether there is room for price reductions as a result
of the yen's rise.
Both the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Japan Federation of
Employers' Associations are meanwhile looking into price differentials
between Japanese and overseas markets.
While the prices of some imported products have been reduced to reflect the
higher yen, the impact of these isolated cases is far outweighed by the
refusal of the utilities, for example, to pass on the benefits. Oil
companies said last week they would cut petrol prices. But in spite of calls
from industry leaders and consumer groups to reduce their prices, the big
electric power and gas companies have been reluctant to do so.
The utilities say that when planning for this year they based their cost
calculations on an oil price of Dollars 16.50 a barrel whereas the price of
oil is now about Dollars 18.50 and has recently been higher. They claim
further that any benefits of a higher yen are absorbed by the rise in
employee and capital expenditure costs which they must bear regardless of
the yen's appreciation.
While it is still too early to determine the impact of the yen's rise on
demand for imports, it is thought that it may be minimal. 'A 10 per cent
appreciation of the yen is not likely to have a visible effect,' says Mr
Takao Komine of the EPA.
A feeling that the yen's appreciation will do little more than stimulate
overseas travel is aggravated by a heightened sense that the cost of living
in Japan is much higher than that of other countries. The higher yen
increases price differentials between Japan and other markets when prices
are denominated in yen.
So the price of a pair of jeans in the US at Dollars 50 now appears much
cheaper to a Japanese in Tokyo then it did in January - at Y111 to the
dollar it is only Y5,550 compared with Y6,200 at an exchange rate of Y124 as
the year began.
The overall impact is to create the impression that the higher yen has done
little to increase consumers' purchasing power at home.
At the same time, experience has shown that a higher yen does not
necessarily lead to lower import prices since the difference often gets lost
in the high margins claimed by the many intermediaries in Japan's
distribution system.
Reform of Japan's convoluted distribution system and government regulation
of industry would go much futher than a higher yen in reducing the cost of
living in Japan, Mr Komine points out. As such, in contrast to a higher yen,
it would also help reduce price differentials.
The high cost of building a house in Japan could, for example, be reduced by
30 per cent if the distribution and contracting systems were simplified, the
Japan Research Institute points out.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SRI LANKA'S ruling United National party has won the largest number of seats
in six of the seven provincial councils in Monday's elections.
In the prestige battle for the island's capital Colombo, however, it was
beaten by its traditional rival, the Sri Lanka Freedom party of Mrs Sirima
Bandaranaike, the former prime minister.
The SLFP led a newly formed left-wing coalition including the communists and
the socialists. No polls were held in the war-torn Tamil-dominated north and
east.
Mr Sirisena Cooray, the UNP general secretary who is also housing minister,
described the national outcome as 'a clear vindication' of the programme of
President Ranasinghe Premadasa, assassinated by a Tamil 'Tiger' suicide
bomber on May 1.
'Mr Premadasa's poverty alleviation programme and his new scheme to open 200
textile factories helped the rural poor and gave new hope to the village
youth,' he added. The murder also produced a wave of sympathy for the
populist president who spent most of his time in remote rural areas.
Another killing ten days earlier undoubtedly helped the Democratic United
National Front to make a spirited debut. Its leader, Mr Lalith
Athulathmudali, a former UNP minister, was gunned down when he was
addressing an election rally last month.
Mr Athulathmudali and two fellow ministers had been sacked from the
government after their attempt to impeach Mr Premadasa proved abortive.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Japan's trade surplus rises 44% to Dollars 10bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade surplus last month rose 44 per cent from a year earlier to
Dollars 10.25bn (Pounds 6.6bn), as the yen's appreciation led to a sharp
increase in the dollar value of exports, while imports remained weak.
The surplus with the US rose 22.6 per cent on a year earlier to Dollars 4bn,
while the surplus with the EC fell 6.4 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn, mainly
because of a 20.4 per cent fall in car exports that accompanied an increase
in local production abroad by Japanese makers.
Apart from a 14 per cent appreciation in the yen over the year, the surplus
was fuelled by strong demand from Asian economies for Japanese manufactured
goods, highlighted by a 56.3 per cent surge in exports to China.
However, domestic demand for imports has fallen as the economy has slowed,
resulting in a 1.7 per cent increase in imports in dollar terms, but, in
yen, a 12.3 per cent fall. Mr Geoffrey Barker of Baring Securities said the
trend indicates that the economy is 'bumping along the bottom'.
The Ministry of Finance said the seasonally adjusted surplus was Dollars
11.2bn, up from Dollars 9.6bn in March, with exports 3.2 per cent higher at
Dollars 31.5bn and imports 2.8 per cent lower at Dollars 20.3bn.
Exports of ordinary machinery were 15.8 per cent higher, as were those of
transport machinery, while those of metallic products, in particular steel,
were 15.3 per cent higher, thanks to a trebling of orders from China.
Demand from an overheated Chinese economy pushed up Japanese exports
remarkably for a range of products. Car exports were six times higher than a
year earlier, video camera exports were ten times larger, bus and truck
exports were almost four times higher, and chemicals exports more than
doubled.
China has become Japan's second largest trading partner, surpassing Taiwan
and South Korea and behind only the US, but the rapid increase in exports
could create a new area of trade friction. Last month, China had a surplus
in bilateral trade of Dollars 272m, but that does not include Japanese
exports through Hong Kong, which have also risen sharply.
Meanwhile, Japan's wholesale prices fell 0.5 per cent last month compared to
the previous month, and were 2.8 per cent lower than the same month last
year, the Bank of Japan said. Bank officials said the decline was because of
lower prices for raw materials, made cheaper by the yen's appreciation.

FT  19 MAY 93 / US housing starts rise by 6.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US housing starts rose 6.7 per cent last month and by 11 per cent compared
with April last year, indicating the market is rebounding after severe
winter weather hit construction in the first quarter, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.
The figures follow other signs of stronger growth after the weak first
quarter, including a 1.2 per cent increase in retail sales between March and
April and a modest rise in industrial output last month.
The rise in starts was broadly based, affecting all regions except the
mid-west, where they fell fractionally, and most types of residential
property including family homes and apartment buildings. Starts in the
northeast, the area worst hit by bad weather, rose 22.5 per cent between
March and April.
Building permits - a guide to future construction trends - registered a
healthy 5.8 per cent increase last month.
The increase in starts, a volatile monthly series, was reassuring news for
forecasters who were disturbed by the weakness of the housing market in
recent months in spite of the lowest mortgage rates for two decades.
Most economists are projecting a steady recovery of housing as the summer
progresses.
Even after last month's increase, starts were still running at an annual
rate of 1.21m, 3 per cent below the average level in the fourth quarter of
last year and lower than would be expected in a normal economic recovery.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Bank move puts Mexico on new path: Making economic reforms
stick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A country where few if any institutions limit the power of the president,
the decision this week to grant Mexico's central bank autonomy over monetary
policy is a historic break with tradition. For the first time in memory, a
Mexican president is willingly ceding control over a key instrument of
economic policy, not just for himself, but, barring more changes, for his
successors.
The immensity of the change has itself bred scepticism, with many doubting
that the central bank could withstand presidential pressure in a conflict of
wills. But if the bank buckles, it will not be for want of legal backing.
The constitutional amendment granting independence, and subsequent
regulations governing the constitution, will make the bank as independent as
the German Bundesbank or the US Federal Reserve, government ministers say.
The amendment gives the central bank full autonomy over its credit, meaning
that the government cannot borrow from the bank to finance its deficits. It
gives the bank a governing body that cannot be easily removed, since board
members' terms of office will be staggered, and long (probably six to eight
years). The bank will be legally bound to pursue monetary policy congruent
with price stability.
In the short term at least the constitutional amendment does not imply
significant changes in monetary policy - the administration of President
Carlos Salinas has never borrowed money from the central bank. Interest
rates are set in the market, by investor demand for government paper, supply
of paper in the primary market by the finance ministry, and central bank
intervention in the secondary market.
Since the federal government is now running a budget surplus, if it does not
like the market interest rate for its debt, it need not offer the paper. But
were the government having to finance a budget deficit, it would either have
to accept the market interest rate on its debt or instruct the central bank
to buy through the market government paper at below market rates. This
latter move will now be unconstitutional.
In short, the constitutional change will ensure that in the future monetary
policy will be independent of fiscal policy - in contrast to the 1970s and
1980s when fiscal indiscipline provoked monetary expansion and inflation. If
the government wants to issue debt it will have to pay the rate the market
demands. Monetary policy will thus be geared to price stability and
short-term liquidity needs.
A problem might arise when the government's exchange rate target conflicts
with the central bank's commitment to price stability. A government official
says that, as in Germany, exchange rate policy would remain the prerogative
of the finance ministry, but a regulatory law would be drawn up to decide
who had authority over policy areas of common interest to the government and
central bank, such as banking supervision.
Nevertheless, if conflicts arose between the central bank and the president,
some analysts doubt that the bank could prevail. Many supposedly autonomous
Mexican institutions, such as the Federal Electoral Institute, or the
Supreme Court, have rarely exercised independence.
The government says it has chosen to push through the reform now to
consolidate the macroeconomic reforms of the past decade and
institutionalise the commitment to low inflation, believing central bank
independence has to happen after, not before, stabilisation. Inflation has
responded to tight monetary policy and fiscal surpluses, falling from nearly
160 per cent when President Salinas came to power in December 1988 to 10.4
per cent in the year to April.
But concerns over the vulnerable state of the economy will have played their
part. Uncertainties over both the North American Free Trade Agreement and
the race to succeed President Salinas could yet unsettle financial markets
and provoke a run on the peso. The autonomy of the central bank is one way
of re-assuring such markets that economic policy is not going to change.
President Salinas will also have the luxury, at the outset, of choosing the
head of the central bank and all the other board members - the figure five
has been mentioned. There is speculation that Mr Miguel Mancera, who has
been head of the central bank since 1982 and who recently turned 60, may
soon retire, safe in the knowledge that his long ambition of central bank
independence has been obtained.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Latin American buyers in retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN American art had been one of the few bright spots during the
three-year decline in the international antiques market. But in New York on
Monday night even this sector experienced difficulties. Christie's auction
brought in Dollars 8.25m (Pounds 5.4m), but half the 64 lots on offer were
unsold.
There are still buyers for exceptional works. Rufino Tamayo's vast painting,
(almost 4 metres by 14 metres) 'America', commissioned by the Bank of the
Southwest in Houston in 1955, sold for Dollars 2.58m, a record for this
Mexican artist. Three other works by Tamayo also sold well.
In contrast only four of the nine paintings by the Colombian artist Fernando
Botero, famous for his portraits of fat men and women, found buyers.
Sentiment was not helped when the painting on the special catalogue of his
works was withdrawn as a fake before the auction. There was also no buyer
for 'My dress hangs here', a claustrophobic view of Manhattan by the
fashionable Frida Kahlo, which was expected to break the Dollars 1m barrier.
The Latin American market is dependent on newly enriched Mexican, Colombian
and Venezuelan collectors. The unexpected blip in demand is partly
attributable to higher reserves imposed by sellers, and partly to fears
about the prospects of their national economies.
Another market which has continued to thrive in the recession is
Pre-Columbian art, which started from a low price base. At Sotheby's on
Monday an Olmec cylindrical ritual container, dating from the first
millennium BC and found at Chalcatzingo in Mexico, sold for Dollars 233,500,
an auction record.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Argentina turns down IMF request
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S central bank has rejected International Monetary Fund demands
that the government take measures to curb the heavy inflow of capital.
A Fund mission in Buenos Aires has expressed concern at the heavy volumes of
capital flowing into Argentina because of its economic liberalisation and
strong growth. About Dollars 8bn in private capital entered the country last
year, a figure likely to be repeated this year.
Mr Roque Fernandez, president of the independent central bank, said IMF
officials had called on the government to impose 'marginal reserve
requirements to put a limit on capital inflows. We do not think this is a
good idea. If capital inflows are too great, interest rates will decline
sufficiently for (capital) not to come.'
Under Argentina's 1991 convertibility law, the central bank can only print
local currency if it is fully backed by gold, hard currency and a limited
amount of government securities. This means that capital inflows are
immediately monetised. The monetary base rose to Dollars 12.2bn in March,
compared with Dollars 9.2bn a year earlier.
Economists have warned that the heavy capital inflows, threaten to stimulate
excessive consumer demand.
Chile, the first Latin country to begin implementing free market economic
policies, has revalued its currency to discourage capital inflows.
Argentina's capital inflows are financing a heavy current account deficit of
Dollars 8bn a year, which is leading to concern over the sustainability of
its reforms.
Mr Fernandez rounded on the IMF saying: 'Either we believe in market prices
or we do not. It is not consistent to look for restrictions at a time when
we are integrating Argentina with the rest of the world.'

FT  19 MAY 93 / Brazilian negotiators reach preliminary accord with
commercial creditiors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN negotiators have reached a preliminary accord with commercial
creditors over a new balance of debt conversion options in its 'Brady-style'
agreement reached in principle last July, according to bankers, Christina
Lamb reports.
Creditors have agreed to Brazil's demand to set a maximum of 40 per cent of
the Dollars 41bn (Pounds 26.6bn) debt for conversion into par bonds and a
minimum of 35 per cent into discount bonds.
Par bonds are fully guaranteed for principal and 12 months' interest and are
the most expensive instrument for Brazil. Discount bonds are also fully
secured but are less attractive to bankers because they carry a 35 per cent
discount and pay only market interest rates, which are at a historic low.
The next step is for lawyers on both sides to go over the fine print of the
debt agreement. Brazil still faces the hurdle of negotiating an accord with
the International Monetary Fund to provide money for guarantees.
The latest figures show that the total stock of Brazil's foreign commercial
debt has fallen from Dollars 44bn to Dollars 41bn, partly as a result of
payments but also because of large purchases of debt titles by Brazilian
banks.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Brazil's restless military finds favour: Disillusioned
Brazilians question the efficacy of democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING phone-in programmes in the run-up to Brazil's plebiscite last month
on its political system, callers would often ask why ditadura, or
dictatorship, was not an option. Disillusioned by the failure of the
country's politicians to deal with pressing social and economic problems,
Brazilians are increasingly talking of the military as the only way out.
The word golpe, or coup, is cropping up everywhere from leading newspaper
columns to pavement bars. This is a remarkable turnround for a people who
only a few months ago were congratulating themselves on the strength of
their renascent democracy and the restraint shown by the armed forces over
last year's street campaign which helped produce the impeachment of
President Fernando Collor.
While the Brazilian army is far from sending tanks into the streets, there
is undeniable stirring in the ranks - the result of desperation over the
squeezed military budget combined with anger at the country's humiliating
position as the laggard of the continent.
Senior officers have begun making barely veiled political statements and
pointing at Chile in the 1980s and Peru now as examples of how much easier
it is to implement reform with an autocratic regime. Last month General
Zenildo Lucena, the army minister, warned that Brazil's high levels of
social misery were threatening democracy.
In recognition of the gravity of the situation, President Itamar Franco met
yesterday with the army chief and three military ministers to hear their
grievances, after publicly praising them for 'exemplary behaviour in this
moment of extreme difficulty'.
The meeting follows an inflammatory article by Brigadier Ivan Froto, the
airforce commander, in last Thursday's Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper. Aside
from the usual warnings of American designs on the Amazon the article
attacked Congress and the executive and described the airforce as going
through 'the worst crisis in its history' because of government failure to
update equipment and keep salaries abreast of inflation.
So strapped for cash are the forces that men doing national service are sent
home on Thursday nights for the weekend to save electricity. Wages are so
low that it is common to see junior officers hitchiking back to barracks and
many sergeants have two jobs, working off-duty as mechanics.
But perhaps the real problem is the failure of the military to find a role
eight years after the 21-year period during which it ran the country. Brazil
has no serious territorial disputes and the high command has been reluctant
to involve its men in activities such as combating drug-trafficking for fear
of them being corrupted.
At the same time their collective pride has been hurt by seeing Brazil, once
the motor of Latin America, constantly referred to as dragging down the
continent. One officer said: 'What particularly rankled was hearing the
Clinton administration describe Argentina as a tiger. And Chile - why we
export a whole Chilean economy a year.' A document has been circulating
among officers praising the 'successes' of Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori's government. Mr Fujimori suspended Peru's Congress last year in an
'institutional coup'.
Moreover the population is increasingly turning on the government and
politicians over their failure to combat inflation, poverty, hunger and
unemployment. The battered reputation of Congress recently suffered a
further blow with the revelation that aid money for alleviating the drought
in the north-east was mostly used by congressmen to drill wells on their
private estates.
President Franco is on his third finance minister in six months and has
shown no signs of being able to control Brazil's 1,500 per cent annual
inflation. Mr Carlos Castello Branco, a leading commentator, said yesterday
that each successive government was 'worse than the last'.
By contrast the military has retained its credibility. Their years in power
saw the 'Brazilian miracle,' with growth rates second only to South Korea
and very limited repression in comparison with other Latin American
countries.
Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the influential governor of Bahia, said in a
recent interview: 'I don't want to be an alarmist but imagine what would
happen if the military were to say 'let's work to reduce inflation. Let's
clean up the administration. Let's end unemployment. Let's reduce poverty
and inequality. We'll work for this and we want power.' Nobody could be
against these aims - it would set public opinion alight.'
The sheer scale of Brazil's problems is doubtless a factor discouraging the
military from re-entering the political arena.
But the economic crisis is increasingly provoking law and order problems,
such as sackings of supermarkets in Rio and a flourishing separatist
movement in the south. Mr Villas-Boas Correa, a political analyst, says: 'If
the crisis starts to explode I can't see the military staying in their
barracks watching.'

BELGIUM, which takes over the EC presidency in July, will press ahead with
implementing Maastricht's goals during the second half of the year, even if
Britain fails to ratify the treaty. But Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign
minister, said last night the Danish referendum result made him confident
all 12 member states would soon be ready to move towards greater European
union.
Priorities for the six-month Belgian presidency would include preparing the
next phase of economic and monetary union, and a common foreign policy.
The second stage of Emu - including establishing a European Monetary
Institute, forerunner of the central bank - begins next January 1 and should
end with a single European currency in 1999 at the latest.
Mr Claes said last night that the demanding timetable was essential. But he
added that Maastricht's tough economic criteria for joining a monetary union
might have to be renegotiated if recession continued. Mr Philippe Maystadt,
Belgian finance minister, came out in favour of amending the criteria at the
weekend.
Earlier in the day, in a speech entitled 'Against Euro-pessimism', Mr Claes
said the original Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act, which laid the
foundation for the barrier-free internal market, were not enough to respond
to the economic and political challenges of the 1990s. 'It's time to take a
further step and the Maastricht treaty gives us the means to do so,' he
said.
Pressed on the possibility that certain member states might not ratify the
treaty, Mr Claes told an invited audience in Brussels that the Belgian
presidency would still continue the task of deepening the Community with 10
or 11 member states, 'because there is no alternative'.
He said Belgium intended to 'exploit all the new possibilities offered by
the Maastricht treaty for following a true common foreign and security
policy'. That would include preparing the administrative framework for such
a policy, and asking member states to define the areas in which common
action could be developed.

integration

DENMARK'S approval of the Maastricht treaty, and the Edinburgh opt-outs, is
unlikely to expunge the country's reputation as the reluctant European,
judging from Danish politicians' comments on yesterday's vote.
The MPs, who refused to take a No for a no when the voters rejected the
Maastricht treaty in a referendum last June, were happy with yesterday's
endorsing vote.
But their satisfaction was tempered by the realisation that the size of the
No vote leaves the country deeply divided on the issue of European
integration.
The Yes vote was 'big, but not big enough,' said Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen,
foreign minister for 10 years until last January. He felt that the size of
the vote against the Maastricht treaty would limit the room for government
manoeuvre as the shape of European union was hammered out over the next few
years.
Mr Holger K Nielsen, leader of the left-wing Socialist People's party which
switched from opposition last June to support for a Yes as a result of the
Edinburgh deal, said the size of the No vote 'places an obligation on the
Yes side to ensure the Edinburgh agreement remains the basis of Danish
policy.
'The big No vote emphasises that Denmark cannot go along with anything
resembling a united states of Europe,' he said. Mr Nielsen's supporters
failed to follow their leader yesterday, according to polling institutes;
only about 20 per cent of them voted in favour.
The Edinburgh agreement allows Denmark to opt out of the Maastricht treaty's
clauses on a unified currency, co-operation on defence and police, and union
citizenship. The country could choose to 'opt into' these policies in
future, but not without new referendums.
The vote in favour of the treaty, by 56.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent, still
leaves a large gap between the popular vote and politicians. The Edinburgh
agreement was endorsed by seven of the eight parliamentary parties and more
than 90 per cent of members.
Politicians and commentators last night attributed the swing since last year
to two factors - the Edinburgh agreement and the change of government in
January this year.
The Edinburgh deal reduced fears that the treaty would erode the country's
sovereignty and independence, the issue which most opponents cited last year
as their reason for voting against it.
The change of government brought the country's largest party, the Social
Democrats, back into office after 10 years in opposition, with Mr Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen as prime minister.
'It has made an impression on Social Democratic supporters that there is a
Social Democratic government. It has given authority to our pleas for a Yes
vote,' said Mr Mogens Lykketoft, finance minister.
Last year Social Democratic supporters voted 60-40 against the treaty. This
year, according to preliminary results, a narrow majority voted in favour.
But it was enough to tip the balance.

FT  19 MAY 93 / The Danish Referendum: Now real debate on European union
begins - Vote is unlikely to end crisis of legitimacy surrounding the treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER

<TEXT>
DENMARK'S decisive Yes to Maastricht will cause the political establishments
across Europe to breathe a sigh of relief. In the UK, the result should tip
the scales decisively in favour of Mr John Major as he pushes the Maastricht
bill through its final stages in the UK parliament. Barring an upset in the
British or German courts, ratification seems secure.
Yet the Danish Yes is unlikely to end the crisis of legitimacy surrounding
the treaty. When EC leaders agreed Maastricht in December 1991, they hailed
it as point of departure for European political and monetary union; but even
the latest Commission polls show public support for European integration is
tumbling.
The Danish endorsement does not amount to a true test of public support for
European union. The version of Maastricht which Danes approved yesterday
contains legally binding opt-outs on core elements of the treaty, including
the single European currency, European citizenship and defence policy.
A senior European Commission official declares the treaty will have no
obvious impact on the fundamental problems facing the EC such as rising
unemployment, low investment, public spending crises in almost all the
member states and monetary instability.
The Danish Yes should free the Commission and member-states to focus on the
Community's pressing challenges: enlargement negotiations with Austria,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden; the political and economic integration of the
former Communist countries of eastern Europe; and the issue of European
competitiveness in relation to the US and Asia, itself the subject of an
in-depth study ordered by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president.
A senior EC official listed several 'tests' for the Community in the coming
months: making the single market work, including the removal of lingering
restrictions on the free movement of EC citizens; concluding the Uruguay
Round in the Gatt trade talks; and ensuring stability inside the European
exchange rate mechanism so as to maintain the credibility of the EC to
monetary union by 1999 at the latest.
Paradoxically, the Danish Yes may reignite the debate on European union. The
run-up to European parliament elections next year is an obvious launch-pad;
so, too, the sense among the European federalists that they no longer need
worry about frightening the minimalist Danes or the British as they edge
toward ratification. Belgium, which takes over the EC presidency from
Denmark on July 1, is in the lead.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, is coming from a different
direction. In a speech to the French parliament yesterday, he spoke of a new
division of labour within the Community so that countries such as France,
Britain and Germany could take the lead on security matters. He also hinted
that the EC needed to make institutional changes to cope with 16 or more
members. The first clues on Commission thinking will probably come next
month when it offers an opinion on Malta's request for membership.
Last weekend, Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian foreign minister, came out in
favour of watering down the strict Maastricht 'convergence' criteria for
monetary union - a move which would allow an inner core of EC member states
to move forward to fixed exchange rates, but which would alarm the
Bundesbank, which has insisted that Maastricht must be respected to the
letter.
All this may simply be letting off steam; but it may also suggest that the
debate on the future course of the EC may be about to begin. For if
Euro-sceptics and Euro-enthusiasts agree on anything, it is that Maastricht
settled nothing.

A CROSS-SECTION of the 40,000-strong Danish community in London crowded into
the Danish embassy last night to salute the Yes vote with warm Tuborg beer
and sausage sandwiches.
A Danish embassy official explained his frustration at not being able to
deliver the scene of excitement desired by a television cameraman. Mr
Rudolph Thorning Petersen, the Danish ambassador, explained in dignified
tones the Yes would lead to a more open Community. Even though the 56.8-43.2
per cent margin showed a large minority of Danes were suspicious of the EC,
the main point was 'we have a majority'.
Asked about the presence in Denmark of British politicians and journalists
touting for No votes, the ambassador said, for quotation, Denmark always
liked to extend hospitality. Privately, he was more scathing.

THE European Commission in Brussels was jubilant last night as news of the
first exit poll indicated a comfortable majority for ratification.
'The treaty will certainly go through now,' smiled one of the Commission's
top civil servants, who said he expected the Maastricht treaty to be in
place by September 1.
Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner for external political affairs,
described the outcome as 'an important day for Europe' and said 'we are
looking with high expectations towards London' for the British House of
Commons to complete its ratification of the treaty.
Sir Leon Brittan, the British commissioner for external economic affairs,
expected the Danish vote to give Mr John Major's government a strong boost
in getting the Maastricht bill through.
'The Danes have decided after long and detailed analysis that the Maastricht
treaty, far from forcing them down the road to an over-centralised and
bureaucratic union, will strengthen ties between European nations without
threatening their identity,' Sir Leon said.
'This conclusion is as relevant for Britain as it is for Denmark,' he added,
'and it will substantially boost the British ratification process.'
Officials dismissed the possibility of a treaty upset in Germany, where
although both houses of parliament have ratified Maastricht, it is being
challenged on constitutional grounds in the courts.
Officials from Norway and Austria, which along with Sweden and Finland are
negotiating entry to the EC, were also mightily relieved and hopeful that
the change of heart among Danish voters would boost waning Euro-enthusiasm
in their own countries. A No in Denmark would have scuttled their
negotiations.
Several commissioners emphasised that Brussels and the Community could now
get back to work after nearly a year of internal wrangles.
Mr Henning Christopherson, the Danish commissioner in charge of economic
affairs, stressed the need to get on with the second stage of economic and
monetary union (Emu), due to start next year with the creation of the
European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of an eventual European central
bank.
Mr Christopherson insisted that Emu and a single currency was still a viable
goal by its earliest date in 1997. 'I still believe that a majority of the
member states could meet the (fiscal and monetary convergence) criteria,' Mr
Christopherson said. 'A lot can be done within the next three to four
years,' he added.

THE DANISH referendum result was welcomed by Nordic politicians and business
leaders, who believe it will speed up their countries EC membership talks
and have a positive influence on sceptical public opinion. Sweden, Norway
and Finland are all due to hold referendums on EC membership in the next two
years.
'With a Danish No it would have been very difficult to get a Yes in Sweden,'
said Mr Bengt Westerberg, Sweden's deputy prime minister.
The result was also welcomed by Norwegian prime minister Mrs Gro Harlem
Brundtland although she warned that 'the issues we face are very different
from those faced by the Danes. We are preoccupied with energy, fish and
regional policy.'
However, with popular opinion in both Sweden and Norway against membership,
politicians in both countries face a difficult task in taking their
countries into the community. Some believe they may be forced to seek Danish
style opt-outs to take their electorates with them.
An opinion poll published in Norway yesterday showed 51 per cent of the
electorate against membership, four percentage points more than in April,
with only 30 per cent in favour.
A recent Swedish opinion poll showed 44 per cent of voters against the EC,
with 34 per cent in favour. The anti-vote in the country has ranged between
41 and 53 per cent since Denmark's first vote on Maastricht last June.
Relief over the outcome of the vote was underlined by Mrs Kaci Kullman Five,
leader of Norway's pro-EC opposition Conservative party. She said: 'If the
Danes had voted No, opposition in Norway would have been irreversible.'
Business leaders reacted positively to the news. Mr Magnus Lemmel, director
general of the Swedish Federation of Industries said: 'EC membership is very
important for us. We need to have exactly the same terms as our competitors.
We cannot afford to be discriminated against.'
But those opposing membership were not disheartened by the vote. Ms Eva
Britt Svensson, chairwoman of Sweden's 'No to the EC' group, predicted that
the Danish vote would further swing Swedish public opinion against the
community. 'People will realise that its political, monetary and economic
union they are voting for and not the EC,' she stated.
Sweden and Finland began negotiations on EC membership in February, and are
hoping to join the community in 1995. Norway, which rejected membership in
1972, began fresh negotiations on membership last month.
Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the leader of Sweden's opposition Social Democrat party,
said the Danes had taken a 'wise decision' which would open the way 'for a
common European fight against unemployment and social and union rights'.

FT  19 MAY 93 / The Danish Referendum: Commission looks for a key to unlock
the Community - David Gardner describes how previous Danish vote has
hamstrung Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EVEN with the vote by the Danes in favour of Maastricht, the European
Community faces a struggle to break free from the sort of Euro-gridlock in
which it has been trapped since Denmark first rejected the treaty last June.
So, at least, conclude surprising numbers of top officials in Brussels, who
fear that little will be achieved by the new, two-year Commission which
started work this January.
Speaking before the Danish referendum result was known, one senior
Commission official remarked: 'We are in the doldrums.' He was harking back
to the fabled 'Euro-pessimism' of the 1970s and early 1980s, when the EC was
becalmed - until the integrationist winds of the single market programme,
the reform of EC finances, and German unification, sped the Community
towards the Maastricht treaty on monetary and political union.
The delays in Denmark and Britain in ratifying Maastricht, plus the
constitutional challenge to the treaty in the German courts, sent the EC
into limbo. 'We are simply blocked,' a top trouble-shooter at the Commission
complained recently. 'We can make no statement or proposal which might in
any way affect ratification.' He and his colleagues hope the Danish Yes will
revive confidence and activity.
Brussels has been operating under a self-denying ordinance since last June.
But the second half of last year was no less frenetic for that, dominated by
crisis management as the exchange rate mechanism linking EC currencies was
sundered by speculators betting against the feasibility of the economic and
monetary union plan at the heart of Maastricht.
December's Edinburgh summit, against heavy odds, secured: a deal on an
expanded EC budget; a truce in the power struggle between Brussels and the
larger member states; and, after all manner of legal pirouettes, a formula
allowing the Danes to put Maastricht in a new wrapping for yesterday's
referendum.
Shortly afterwards, a Commission with seven new faces among its 17 members
was named for this year and next - half the normal term. But since then it
has all but gone underground.
After the marathon of 282 measures needed to create the single market, a
fall-off in legislative output was expected. But so far this year Brussels
has produced only 'communications' - something between a White Paper and a
wish-list - and tinkered with regulations. Bold ambitions to fill
acknowledged gaps in the single market, like the liberalisation of
telecommunications, energy and postal services, have been watered down
and/or pushed into the future.
The Commission is the legislative engine of the EC, with sole right to
propose laws, which then only the council of ministers can decide, sometimes
with amendments from the European parliament. When the Commission is
hamstrung, so is the Community.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, was lambasted for the anaemia of
the Brussels programme for 1993-94, when he presented it to the parliament
in February. This year's legislative programme is dominated by 194 'pending'
measures, long stranded in Council after sharp encounters with intractable
national interests.
The current Danish presidency of the EC, precisely because of the trouble it
has had persuading its voters that the EC can meet their social and
environmental concerns, has been trying to prise free two measures.
It is pushing for agreement by next month on: the European Works Councils
directive, blocked by the UK, which would oblige supranational companies to
consult their workers on jobs changes, new technology and investment, and
relocation decisions; and the carbon/energy tax.
The Commission and half the member states regard the tax (which would rise
to Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent by 2000) as indispensable if the
EC is to meet its commitment under the Rio Climate Change Convention. This
requires it to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000.
Five more states have grudgingly accepted the principle of a tax, but
Britain remains strongly opposed.
Both these measures are Commission flagships, but Brussels has been able to
do little more than urge them along, and await the outcome.
But there are still other obstacles tightening the Euro-gridlock, and
blocking any quick movement out of it.
This Commission was appointed for two years, in part to synchronise it with
elections to the European parliament in June next year. The latter will have
the right under Maastricht to screen appointed commissioners formally. The
treaty also gives it near equal say with the council in shaping those EC
laws which are passed by majority vote among the member states.
The parliament is unwilling to supply its 'opinion' - mandatory for all
legislation under the consultation procedures for non-single market measures
 -because once Maastricht is ratified its legislative clout will increase.
At March's council of transport ministers, for instance, measures on air
traffic control, transport infrastructure and trans-European networks all
lacked the Strasbourg avis needed for them to go forward. 'Why should we
play ball now when we can play with a bigger ball later,' said one
parliament official.
However, if the ratification hold-up keeps the Commission inert until the
end of the year, it will only be a few months after that, probably in April,
that MEPs will take to the election hustings, leaving but a brief window of
legislative opportunity. For by June 1994 at the latest, the Twelve will
appoint a successor to Mr Delors, moving an already transitional Commission
into the lame duck stage, with some officials predicting the replacement of
about two-thirds of its members.
Is there a way out of this gridlock? The Commission's recently announced
plan for an EC-wide programme to address structural unemployment may be one
way forward.
One senior Commission official predicts a leap ahead by Germany, France and
the Benelux countries to lock the parities of their currencies soon after
ratification. This, he argues, would create a 'hard core' for Emu, which the
remaining member states wanting to join it could aim at.
On one thing he is certain: 'We need, we must have, a rebound, something
solid.'

THE Danish countryside, bathed in brilliant sunshine, looked as
picture-perfect yesterday as the country's political parties liked to
portray it in their stirring television campaigns for the referendum on the
European Community's much-battered Maastricht treaty.
The rolling fields and woodlands of Sjaelland wore a hundred shades of
spring green, splashed with the vivid yellow of oilseed rape, the EC's most
fashionable subsidised crop. Red and white Danish flags flew over many of
the typically immaculate farmsteads, not because it was a special day but
because it is a popular Nordic custom to fly the national emblem.
In fact, if you looked closely, there was a blemish. Here and there, a
weed-ridden, untended field testified to that other EC farm policy, the
set-aside scheme, which pays farmers not to till some land in an effort to
curb overproduction.
Nor are Denmark's farmers as pleased by the prolonged spell of warm weather
that has had Copenhagen's street-side cafes and bars overflowing with happy
customers this month. The rape crop has grown to only about two-thirds of
its normal height at this stage of the season and a repeat threatens of last
year's drought-hit low harvest.
But in Dalmose, a small farming village 95km southwest of Copenhagen, there
was at least anecdotal evidence that neither the recent painful adjustments
of the EC's agricultural policies, nor the weather, would break the loyalty
of Denmark's farmers to a Community that has been bountiful to them since
the country joined in 1972.
In the first referendum last June, when Denmark voted narrowly to reject
Maastricht, most farmers voted Yes. Smiling at the suggestion that she had
voted No this time, Mrs Karen Petersen, a farmer's widow, replied: 'Of
course not. We farmers here will all vote Yes.'
At the polling station in the village school, Mr Niels Pedersen, the
official in charge said that by mid-morning, the number of those who had
already voted was ahead of last year at the same stage, suggesting, he said,
a big overall turnout.
The ballot papers were simple. Startlingly so, given the complexities of the
Maastricht treaty itself, and the subsequent 'opt-outs' granted to Denmark
by its EC partners in Edinburgh last December so that its embarrassed
leaders could go back to their people for a second poll.
Voters, who, after two campaigns, were proclaimed credibly enough by Prime
Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen to be the best informed on the subject in the
EC, simply had to place a cross in the Yes or No box. The only reference to
what they were voting on was a notice at the polling station entrance
stating blandly that it was a referendum on parliament's approval of 'the
Edinburgh decision and the Maastricht treaty'.
Most campaign-weary Danes, whether they voted Yes or No, must have one thing
in common this morning: a heartfelt wish that there will be no more
referendums on Europe for a long time to come.
All except the schoolchildren. As most polling stations are in schools, the
Maastricht kerfuffle has to date meant two extra holidays for the majority
of pupils.

NORWEGIAN opposition to membership of the European Community swelled to 51
per cent this month, up 4 points from April, according to an opinion poll
published yesterday in the Conservative newspaper Aftenposten.
Uncertainty over the outcome of Denmark's second referendum on the
Maastricht treaty was seen by political analysts as the cause of the rise.
Although Danish approval of the treaty would have little affect on Norwegian
public opinion, the analysts said, its rejection would reduce the chances of
a Yes vote in Norway's membership referendum, expected in 1995.
The Norwegian electorate narrowly rejected joining the EC in 1972, but
Brussels and Oslo began fresh negotiations last month.
Yesterday's poll suggested support for membership had fallen to 30 per cent,
from 36 per cent in April, while the proportion of undecided voters had
risen to 19 per cent, from 17 per cent.
The survey also revealed that opposition was strongest among women, with
just 23 per cent in favour, against 39 per cent of men.
The toughest issues in the current negotiations will be Norway's exclusive
right to its rich fishery resources, the role of the state in oil policy,
and the extent of participation by state-owned companies in oil and gas
licences.
Brussels and Oslo are due to begin negotiations on fish this autumn. Mrs Gro
Harlem Brundtland, prime minister, recently pointed out that it was just
this issue that left Norway outside the Community in 1972.
Mrs Brundtland also expressed strong disapproval last week of EC plans to
introduce an oil and gas licensing directive at a time when the Norwegian
government is struggling to convince a resistant electorate of the benefits
of joining the EC.
The directive is due to be discussed in Brussels on June 25. Mrs Brundtland
warned that if it were adopted without Oslo's influence it would have an
adverse affect on the outcome of a membership referendum.

TWELVE Danes have begun a private legal case to try to block the Maastricht
treaty, Reuter reports.
The Copenhagen city court has yet to decide whether to accept the case,
which challenges the treaty on the grounds that it would enable Community
law to overrule the Danish constitution.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, prime minister, said the group had no case. But the
12 are hoping to delay ratification of the treaty in Denmark and prevent it
going into force throughout the EC.
Mr Rasmussen claimed that Maastricht would make 'no changes in the
relationship between the constitution and EC law'. He added: 'A ruling from
the EC court which conflicts with the Danish constitution is totally
improbable.'

FT  19 MAY 93 / Cosa Nostra chief taken in Sicily raid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN security forces yesterday announced the arrest of Mr Nitto
Santapaola, the most wanted member of the Cosa Nostra, the umbrella
organisation of the Sicilian Mafia.
Mr Santapaola, who has been sought by authorities for more than 10 years,
was surprised at a farm about 80km from his Catania base during a night raid
by 400 police.
His capture follows the arrest in January of Mr 'Toto' Riina, his main ally
in the ruling commission of the Cosa Nostra. Although Interior Ministry
officials said yesterday there were 25 people still on the government's
most-wanted list, these two arrests represent a significant blow to the
Mafia's organisation.
Mr Santapaola's capture came five days after a car bomb exploded in the
wealthy Parioli residential district of Rome, injuring 23 people. Police are
working on the theory that the bombing was the work, at least in part, of
the Mafia.
Mr Nicola Mancino, interior minister, told parliament yesterday that it was
a reasonable assumption the bomb was aimed at Mr Maurico Constanzo, a
television talk-show host. Mr Constanzo's car passed three seconds before
the explosion, but he was protected from the blast by a wall.
However, some parliamentary deputies questioned whether the bomb was not
part of a destabilisation campaign conducted by dissident elements within
the security services.
Mr Luciano Violante, head of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, said
yesterday: 'The arrest of Santapaola is not a reply to the bombing in
Parioli. . . rather it is another piece in the strategy of continuous
assault on the structure of Cosa Nostra, which the state has been carrying
out firmly over the past year.'
Police claimed they had been closing in on Mr Santapaola for some time.
Already 105 arrest warrants had been issued against members of his clan and
a further 39 against its allies.
The raid was carried out by a special group flown in from the mainland. Mr
Santapaola offered no resistance, and merely asked to have a brief breakfast
with his wife before being escorted to a maximum security jail.
The farm where Mr Santapaola was arrested belonged to Mr Pietro Rampullo,
arrested last September and alleged to be behind the killings of two
anti-Mafia judges - Mr Giovani Falcone, who died on May 23 last year, and Mr
Paolo Borsellino, who died two months later. Mr Santapaola is suspected of
involvement in the killings.
Police claim the arrest resulted from investigative work, rather than the
testimony of former Mafia members who had agreed to co-operate under witness
protection programmes.
However, there are suggestions that Mr Riina's and Mr Santapaola's violent
methods in running the Cosa Nostra had lost them support within the
organisation, and that some families were happy to see them captured. In
both instances they were caught in or near their home bases.

<TEXT>
THE world's main powers, already in disarray over their Bosnian policy after
the recent European tour of Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State,
yesterday appeared to be heading for a serious rift.
The US set the alarm bells ringing on Monday night by stating that it would
not attend a foreign ministers' meeting of the UN Security Council on
Friday, as proposed by Moscow.
That meeting, which will not now take place, had been called by Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, with the specific purpose of discussing
the latest Russian proposals for a stage-by-stage implementation of the
Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia.
Washington's reason: that it was not yet ready to discuss joint steps by the
international community in Bosnia because of continuing differences over
what action should be taken, merely underlines the seriousness of the
disagreements. Though no different from those that existed before Mr
Christopher's European tour, they have been reiterated with some precision
over the past 48 hours. Deep US scepticism about the workability of the
Vance-Owen plan, is coupled with a conviction that some kind of military
action against the Bosnian Serbs is now required. This contrasts with the
view of the European Community and Russia that the international peace plan
must remain the basis of a settlement and that military action would
undermine humanitarian relief efforts and endanger European peacekeeping
forces already on the spot.
Mr Christopher told the House of Representatives yesterday that he
considered the Vance-Owen plan could not be implemented in its present form,
given the Bosnian Serbs' opposition to it. And while the administration had
no intention of acting alone, it would continue to press for lifting the
arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems. At the same time, the EC put out a
statement in Brussels that it remained fully committed to the Vance-Owen
plan. In the eyes of the US's European allies pressure should be applied
mainly in the form of a complete blockade of supplies to the Bosnian Serbs,
with the exception of food and medicines. The EC countries have been
encouraged by the stated willingness of President Slobodan Milosevic to seal
Serbia's frontier with Bosnia, though it is far from clear how effective the
Serbian measures will be in practice.
The Russians have not spelled out in detail their ideas about a
stage-by-stage implementation of the Vance-Owen plan, which might be
impossible to carry out as long as the fighting continued. But Mr Kozyrev
said yesterday that Presidents Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Alija
Izetbegovic of Bosnia, whom he had seen earlier in the day, had both shown
willingness to implement the peace plan.
The French, meanwhile, have taken the Russians at their word, suggesting
that both the US and Russia should send ground troops to Bosnia to help
protect Moslem safe areas set up by the UN.
Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, said in an interview that, while France
could not provide more than the 5,000 troops it already has in Bosnia, it
wanted the big powers 'to relieve our efforts'.
However, the proposal seems most unlikely to get off the ground, given that
neither the US nor Russia have shown any inclination to contribute any
ground troops.
For the Bosnian Serbs, the rift between the main members of the Security
Council has come as a welcome respite, just as they appeared to have been
forced against the wall by international pressures.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Brussels steps up pressure on Italian steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has stepped up pressure on the Italian government to
justify the planned restructuring of Ilva, the state-owned Italian steel
company.
Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, has written to Mr Paolo
Savona, the Italian industry minister, identifying problems with the latest
plan and calling for a rapid response - possibly including drastic capacity
cuts.
Separately, the Commission has decided to renounce 40 per cent of its DM175m
(Pounds 71m) loan to Klockner-Werke, the troubled German steel and
engineering group.
It is now waiting for the German company to sign an agreement to cut this
year's production by 20 per cent in crude steel, and from 4.2m tonnes to
3.7m tonnes in hot rolled products.
Once confirmed, the decision will allow Klockner, which has been fighting
bankruptcy, to go ahead with a debt rescheduling deal involving all its
creditors. Commission officials claimed yesterday that the German company's
plans were in line with the EC's calls for capacity cuts across the whole
Community industry and did not amount to special treatment for Klockner.
Mr Van Miert's letter to the Italian government is the latest in a tense
exchange between Brussels and Rome. Mr Savona wrote to Mr Van Miert after an
industry ministers' meeting two weeks ago to voice his concern at the
commissioner's analysis of the Ilva plan. Iri, the Italian state holding
company, had only submitted the new plan three days earlier.
But in his letter Mr Van Miert confirms his original opinion that the Ilva
plan involves Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of state aids. he says such subsidies
will have to be accompanied by up to 3m tonnes of capacity cuts, if the plan
is to fit into the EC package. The Italian authorities say they are happy to
go along with the EC steel plan, but deny that subsidies are involved.
A Commission spokesman said yesterday that the letter was neither a
criticism of the Ilva plan, nor an ultimatum, but he added: 'It's based on
certain observations and a serious analysis. If we don't have a quick
solution, the whole EC plan will be in jeopardy.'
Mr Van Miert wants member states to decide on a series of controversial
aid-and-restructuring cases involving the Italian, Spanish and east German
steel-makers at a special meeting of industry ministers in July.

THE Polish prime minister, Ms Hanna Suchocka, met Solidarity trade union
leaders yesterday in an eleventh-hour attempt to prevent a general strike,
Reuter reports from Warsaw.
The negotiations produced no early sign of a breakthrough to head off
Solidarity's threat to call a nationwide walk-out if the government fails to
make a deal with teachers and health workers who are already on strike for
more pay. The government has repeatedly said it cannot meet the strikers'
pay demands and although one official said the two sides had agreed to set
up a joint team to review some issues, a Solidarity leader said the talks
were 'difficult'.
Ms Suchocka has said she cannot meet the strikers' pay demands because of
tight budget restraints under an agreement with the International Monetary
Fund.
'If the negotiations fail, the union will oblige its parliamentary deputies
to file a motion for a (parliamentary) no-confidence vote against the
cabinet,' the Solidarity chairman, Mr Marian Krzaklewski, said before the
talks began.
Solidarity's national commission is expected to meet today to decide whether
to go ahead with a general strike and demand a parliamentary no-confidence
vote.
Ms Suchocka called on Monday for a truce with her political rivals to
prevent a crisis over the two-week-old wave of strikes.
The appeal has so far received a cool reception. Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski,
a leader of the Democratic Left Alliance of former communists, said: 'The
speech resembled a meal that is well presented, but has no taste.'

FT  19 MAY 93 / A thoroughly modern union man: Perhaps too modern for his
membership, writes Quentin Peel of Franz Steinkuhler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HE IS trim, dapper, fast-talking, and very much the modern trade union man.
He sits on the supervisory boards of three thoroughly blue-chip German
companies, Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen and Thyssen.
He wears suits designed by Hugo Boss, and ties from Armani. He is
chauffeur-driven to work every day in a Mercedes from his home in the Taunus
mountains, where Frankfurt's bankers live, to his offices near the main
railway station in the city centre.
He smokes good cigars, and unashamedly enjoys fine food.
He earns about DM270,000 (Pounds 110,000) a year, and has undoubtedly saved
a bit for his old age, like the careful Swabian he is. He jogs every day,
and plays tennis with Mr Edzard Reuter, the chief executive of Daimler and
Germany's top industrialist. The two are on familiar terms, calling each
other Du.
Now it is clear that Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of IG Metall, the giant
engineering workers' union and undisputedly Germany's most powerful union
leader, is not averse to substantial speculation on the stock exchange. He
has admitted buying almost DM1m worth of shares in a Daimler holding
company, in a deal which netted him a windfall profit of DM64,000 almost
overnight.
He may yet prove to have been a bit too modern for his membership. For the
storm surrounding Mr Steinkuhler showed no sign of abating yesterday.
Indeed, it appeared to be gathering strength as trade unionists joined
conservative politicians urging him to resign.
Although he came from the left to take over his union, Mr Steinkuhler has
proved to be a reforming figure, respected in board rooms and the
Chancellor's office as a man with whom one can do business.
When Chancellor Helmut Kohl launched his bid to negotiate a 'solidarity
pact' last year with the opposition Social Democrats, trade unions and
employers, the first man he called in for secret talks was Mr Steinkuhler.
Once he was persuaded that a deal could and should be done, insiders were
convinced Mr Steinkuhler would deliver.
The negotiations lasted six months, instead of the 12 weeks intended, but
the deal was done. Mr Steinkuhler won a promise that ailing enterprises in
east Germany would get a new lease of life. In exchange he was supposed to
have promised pay restraint from his members.
The deal has held true in west Germany, but in the east Mr Steinkuhler
promptly led his members out on strike in defence of their deal for rapid
wage equalisation. Mr Kohl got his solidarity pact on paper; Mr Steinkuhler
preserved his reputation as a militant.
Yet now the union's hard man looks likely to fall foul of the rash of
scandals which has beset the German body politic.
There is no doubt he is a tough negotiator and a hard task-master, even
within his own slightly scruffy union office block in Frankfurt. They know
him there as 'Kaiser Franz', undisputed boss of a highly centralised
organisation since 1986, when he took over at the relatively young age - for
a union leader - of 49.
His immediate response to the latest accusations of insider dealing in the
shares of Mercedes Holding was typical. He came straight out, admitted the
deal, but denied insider knowledge. The shares were moving, and it was a
perfectly normal deal, he declared.
In spite of the recognition that German trade union leaders are well paid,
and that they move in top business circles on the supervisory boards of all
the main industrial companies, the revelation that Mr Steinkuhler was able
to come up with almost DM1m for the deal is proving hard for most of his
members to swallow.
Yet they also believe that it is a classic right-wing coup against a modern
left-wing leader; somebody leaked precise details of share dealings carried
out by Mr Steinkuhler's bank on his behalf.
The question is can he switch blame on to some conservative plot against
workers, or has he exhausted his members' sympathy by behaving too much like
the capitalists he was elected to fight?

GERMAN politicians and rank-and-file trade union members last night called
for the resignation of Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the IG Metall
engineering workers' union, from board memberships for alleged insider
dealing in shares in a Daimler-Benz holding company.
The affair also brought new pressure for an urgent law to ban insider
trading on German stock exchanges.
Mr Steinkuhler, the leading trade union member on Daimler's supervisory
board, has denied the insider dealing charge but admitted buying almost DM1m
(Pounds 400,000) worth of shares in the holding company, MAH. The shares
increased in value by almost 20 per cent after a Daimler board decision to
exchange them for full company shares.
Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democratic party in the ruling
coalition in Bonn, said Mr Steinkuhler should resign all his supervisory
board positions - in Volkswagen, Thyssen and Daimler-Benz - if there was any
confirmation that he had abused his position.
Mr Heiner Geissler, a deputy leader of the Christian Democrat group in
parliament, and seven works councils at the Mercedes-Benz plant in
Stuttgart, the automobile subsidiary of Daimler, called for Mr Steinkuhler
to step down from his board membership.
A senior union official in east Germany, where IG Metall members are on
strike, was clearly shocked by the allegations. 'Here we are haggling over
getting our members DM60 extra a month,' he said, 'and the media are talking
about DM1m.'
There was some sympathy, however, for Mr Steinkuhler, who has won a
reputation as a tough and successful negotiator in more than six years as
leader of the country's largest trade union. Mrs Ursula Engelen-Kefer,
deputy leader of the DGB trade union federation, said the share dealing was
'an entirely private affair.'
The pressure for legislation to outlaw insider trading, promised by the
German government for the end of the year, was stepped up in Frankfurt
yesterday. Mr Rudiger von Rosen, chief executive of the German stock
exchange, said it was imperative reform was brought forward.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Norway's whaling go-ahead defies ban

NORWAY said yesterday it would allow the killing of 296 minke whales this
year, in defiance of an eight-year ban. It is prepared for possible sabotage
attempts on its whaling fleet.
Mr Johan Joergen Holst, the foreign minister, told parliament that the quota
would include 136 whales to be taken for scientific research.
Whalers were disappointed with the quota and some larger vessels might find
it uneconomical to hunt.
'In fixing this year's quotas we have followed the recommendation of the IWC
(International Whaling Commission) scientific committee,' Mr Holst said.
Norway had chosen to fix the quota at the lowest level the IWC would have
allowed had it followed its own rules. 'We wish to demonstrate that Norway
is going forward carefully on this issue.'
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Oslo had fixed a budget of NKr11m (Pounds
1m) to cover an information campaign and pro-whaling lobbying activities
primarily in Washington, London and Bonn. The US Congress is reviewing a
proposal calling for limited sanctions against countries which resume
commercial whaling in defiance of a 1985 IWC moratorium, reaffirmed on
Friday.
In Brussels last night Mr Holst demanded that the EC remove the minke whale
from its list of animals considered in danger of extinction. He reiterated
that Norway's decision to resume commercial whaling was based on evidence of
the IWC's scientific committee that the minke whale was no longer an
endangered species.
Robert Thomson adds from Tokyo: The Japanese government has said it will
abide by the IWC's decision last week to deny it permission to catch 50
whales in addition to its annual take of about 300 minke whales for
'research purposes'.
Japanese whalers also took 154 whales last year from within the country's
territorial waters. With Japanese government approval it can increase that
catch without breaching the IWC's ban.
While the government was unhappy with the IWC's decision to extend the
moratorium on commercial whaling, it fears an open violation of the
commission's rules could lead to criticism from the US government.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Kohl set to reopen Turkish wounds

TURKEY'S often fraught relations with Germany start afresh today with the
visit to Ankara of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The visit coincides with a period of considerable political change. Mr
Suleyman Demirel has just been installed as president and the search for his
replacement as prime minister, and perhaps a new coalition government, is
barely under way.
In a row last year over the use of German military aid in Turkey's fight
against Kurdish rebels, the late President Turgut Ozal outraged German
opinion when he compared the polices of Mr Kohl with those of 'Hitler's
Germany'.
There remains a residual resentment of Bonn's sometimes high-handed
attitude, but no Turkish administration can afford to ignore Germany,
Turkey's most important trade and investment partner.
Germany is also a leading aid donor, and has provided DM6bn (Pounds 2.4bn)
in military assistance either bilaterally under Nato programmes, or as part
of the 'cascade' effect following Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) arms
reductions.
If relations are strained today it will partly reflect realisation on both
sides that special economic ties have changed.
With the challenges of reunification, German assistance is expected to tail
off. Direct military aid to Turkey, together with Portugal and Greece, has
already stopped, while remittances from Turkish workers - at about Dollars
2.1bn (Pounds 1.36bn) in 1992, a vital part of balance of payments - have
peaked.
The labour issue is at the centre of Turkey's problems with Germany. Many
Turks believe it is the main reason for German opposition to Ankara's bid to
be a full member of the EC.
Instead of furthering these European ambitions, the presence of the guest
workers or Gastarbeiter has merely underlined the fact, for many Germans at
least, of Turkey's differences in religion and customs.
There is a programme to encourage repatriation; Turkey's Emlak Bank arranged
for mortgages in Germany to be transferred and the switching of social
security dues was guaranteed.
Lump sum payments were also used as inducement, with little success.
Germany's Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the official aid arm, then
launched a cheap loan programme with an interest rate of 3 per cent over 40
years for Gastarbeiter setting up businesses in Turkey.
However, many of the businesses were unable to survive once the subsidies
ran out. Moreover, much of the funding was diverted into 'Turkey's extended
family network'. The loan programme has been cancelled.
For those who have returned the problems of adjustment are often immense.
'We have a generation who do not speak good Turkish or good German. We are
dealing here with a problem of identity,' says Mr Midhat Seref, head of the
overseas workers department at the Turkish Labour Ministry.
Today's three-day visit by Mr Kohl coincides with the trial of two
right-wing activists charged with killing three Turks in a firebomb attack
in Moelln last November.
Many Turkish officials hope the tragedy will lead to a rethink of Germany's
immigration policy.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Soviet coup leaders may walk free

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE trial of the 12 Soviet coup leaders seemed set to disintegrate yesterday
after a judge ordered the dismissal of the prosecuting team for prejudging
the outcome by publishing a book about the defendants.
Presiding judge Anatoly Ukolov granted a motion by the defence that the
prosecutors should be removed from the case because of 'serious violations'
of legal procedure by the Russian prosecutor-general, Mr Valentin Stepankov,
and his deputy, Mr Yevgeny Lisov.
Defence lawyers had argued for the prosecutors' dismissal on grounds of
bias. They alleged that Mr Stepankov and Mr Lisov had violated defendants'
rights last year when they published a book, Kremlin Plot, that described
them as criminals.
Mr Stepankov is not personally prosecuting the case, but was responsible for
appointing the prosecution lawyers.
The decision by the military branch of the Supreme Court to suspend the
trial pending a decision by parliament on what to do next is a stinging
indictment of the prosecution's incompetence and an embarrassment for
President Boris Yeltsin.
It is now unlikely that the men who declared a state of emergency on August
19, 1991, and brought tanks into Moscow to prevent what they saw as the
collapse of the Soviet Union will ever be brought to justice.
There were bad omens from the very start, when Mr Stepankov had the 12
indicted on the charge of betraying the Soviet motherland - which the
defendants argued they were trying to save. The charges had to revised
subsequently in order to make them more likely to stick. In the meantime,
video-taped interrogations of the accused were sold to the media and the
culprits in the prosecutor's office were never discovered.
Having already degenerated into near farce, the trial is unlikely to recover
from this latest blow. Deputies, locked in confrontation with President
Yeltsin over his determination to dissolve the conservative-dominated
parliament, are unlikely to take any decision to help the trial along. Even
if it does, the defendants' lawyers have a an arsenal of other delaying
tactics, including the ability to declare any of the elderly defendants too
ill to attend.
The trial only resumed yesterday after being suspended three days after it
opened when Mr Alexander Tizyakov, the 67-year-old former leader of a
hardline industrialists' union, was taken to hospital with heart trouble.
But despite being released from jail on grounds of illness pending the final
judgment, two of the other defendants, Mr Vladimir Kryuchkov, the former KGB
chief, and Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, head of the Soviet parliament, have been
attending anti-Yeltsin demonstrations and meetings of the recently-unbanned
Communist party.
The popular scorn they faced at the time has now given way to mixed feelings
in society, with many people regretting the passing of the Soviet Union
despite the fact that its demise was accelerated by the coup attempt.
Intended to provide a lesson in democracy, the trial has become a victim of
the fragility of Russia's democratic institutions - in this case an
incompetent and unfocused prosecutor general's office.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Key dates leading to Steinkuhler's share windfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRONOLOGY of Mr Franz Steinkuhler's share purchases.
December 1975. Mercedes Holding (MAH) is founded to prevent the Flick family
selling the bulk of its 39 per cent shareholding in Daimler-Benz to the Shah
of Iran. The holding company acquires just over 25 per cent of Daimler
shares. Shares in MAH are quoted but half are owned by companies and
financial institutions loyal to Daimler management. Between 1975 and 1992
MAH has no function but to own shares in Daimler, and shareholders receive
the same dividend as Daimler shareholders. But Mercedes shares stand at a
discount of 20-30 per cent to Daimler.
December 18, 1992. MAH annual meeting in Frankfurt. Prof Ekkehard Wenger,
the maverick professor of business studies at Wurzburg University and one of
Germany's leading shareholder activists, forces shareholders to vote on a
motion calling for abolition of MAH. Shareholders vote 99.9 per cent in
favour of preserving the status quo.
December 22, 1992. A leading article in the Borsenzeitung, Germany's most
authoritative financial newspaper, says MAH is no longer justified. But in
the absence of concrete plans to get rid of the structure, the huge discount
to Daimler shares remains.
March - April 1993. Mr Steinkuhler buys 2,100 MAH shares for almost DM1m
(Pounds 400,000).
March 24. Daimler announces it will seek a share listing in the US by the
end of the year. MAH's share price starts to rise, with the discount to
Daimler shares dropping from 25.52 per cent on March 22 to 19.79 per cent on
the morning of April 2.
April 1-2. Daimler supervisory board meets, attended by Mr Steinkuhler, a
board member for 15 years. Dissolution of MAH agreed - US investors do not
approve of such anti-takeover devices and MAH complicates Daimler's plans to
hold a large rights issue. On April 1 Mr Steinkuhler buys half his shares.
Friday, April 2. Daimler announces that MAH is to be dissolved. In late
trading MAH jumps DM84.50 to close at DM575. Shares climb higher on Monday
as the discount disappears: MAH shares are to be exchanged for Daimler
shares later this year.
April - May. Mr Steinkuhler - with other members of the Daimler supervisory
board - is interviewed by officials from the Insider Dealing Commission of
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. They are investigating circumstances behind
the rise in MAH's share price prior to the April 2 announcement.
May 17. Story of Steinkuhler share purchases breaks, based on documents
leaked to Stern magazine from the Stuttgart branch of the BfG Bank, the
former trade union bank.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Ukraine PM demands new powers: Kuchma argues strong
executive rule would arrest economic decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma yesterday asked parliament for
expanded powers over the economy to push through the country's stalled
market reforms.
In a tough address to the legislature, the prime minister called for an
extension of the government's authority to rule the economy by decree; for
control over the central bank, the state privatisation body and the state
anti-monopoly commission; and for direct jurisdiction over presidential
representatives who have executive power in Ukraine's regions. He wants the
extraordinary powers to be granted for a year.
For the past six months the government has had the authority to rule the
economy by decree, but those powers ran out yesterday. The prime minister
asked the legislature not only to extend but to expand the government's
authority, arguing that it would be possible to arrest Ukraine's economic
decline only through 'strong executive rule'.
Parliament, which spent the day debating the proposals and hearing reports
from other government officials, is expected to decide by the end of the
week.
In what promises to be one of the most critical weeks in Ukrainian politics,
the legislature is also due to debate the controversial Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (Start 1).
Although the Ukrainian legislature is dominated by conservative
ex-communists, Mr Kuchma appears likely to be granted the extra powers he is
seeking.
He has the backing of the other two top figures in Ukrainian politics,
President Leonid Kravchuk, scheduled to address parliament today, and Mr
Ivan Pliushch, chairman of the legislature.
In his address, Mr Kuchma, who has threatened to resign if he is not given
the additional powers, outlined the government's goals on agrarian reform,
small and medium-sized privatisation, liberalisation of foreign trade,
monetary reform and the creation of a social safety net.
He accused the National Bank, which issued 1,230bn coupons worth of credits
at the end of March which triggered a 50 per cent devaluation in the
Ukrainian currency, of undermining the government's reform efforts.
'It is not the fault, but rather the tragedy, of the National Bank that it
cannot resist the pressure of factory directors,' Mr Kuchma said. 'Our
central bank sometimes behaves as though it were a charity.'
In defence of his policies, Mr Viktor Iushchenko, bank chairman, said
parliament and the government often forced the bank to issue credits. He
also announced a jump in interest rates to 240 per cent a year.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Romania's steel workers join strike

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENS of thousands of Romanian steel workers entered the second day of a
strike yesterday, demanding pay increases to match price rises, Reuter
reports from Bucharest. 'Around 30,000 workers are now on strike and all our
union members are ready to stop work this week if we fail to reach an
agreement with our employers,' said Mr Ioan Homos, leader of the Metarom
trade union.
Metarom claims to have 90,000 members, or some 70 per cent of the workforce
in the steel industry. Workers in the non-ferrous sector, including the
country's big aluminium smelters, were affiliated to a separate trade union
and had not joined the stoppage so far, Mr Homos said.
Metarom wanted a minimum monthly wage of 50,000 lei (Pounds 52.50) for
skilled workers compared with the current average of 34,000 lei.
Yesterday workers in the big steel plants of Hunedoara, Calan, Otelul Rosu
and Easteel also joined the strike. The prime minister, Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu,
has appointed a team of negotiators to discuss Metarom's claims.
Earlier this month Romania's big trade unions, comprising more than 6m
workers, won pay concessions from the government after threatening a strike.
The government agreed to raise public sector minimum monthly wages to 30,000
lei from 17,600 lei.
Prices for heating, bread, milk, butter, water, energy and public transport
are expected to rise by up to 800 per cent now that price controls have been
lifted since May 1. Bread prices have already risen by 450 per cent.

FT  19 MAY 93 / French minister praises political ties with London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government's drive to forge closer ties with its fellow conservatives
in France won reciprocation yesterday from Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign
minister, who hailed 'the excellent climate' that had been achieved in
Anglo-French relations in the past two months. In an interview published in
yesterday's Le Figaro, Mr Juppe said France's relationship with Britain was
'not an alternative, but a complement to' its compact with Germany.
The Bonn-Paris relationship was the European Community's main motor, but not
the sole one. The minister said as the EC grew, it would have to let certain
members take the lead in certain areas.
A Community of 15 or 17 members 'will not be able to do everything all
together', he said.
He added that it was obvious 'France, Germany and Britain have a special
responsibility for security'. In general terms, Mr Juppe attributed the
identity of interest between France and Britain to the fact they were 'old
and great powers' whose permanent membership of the United Nations Security
Council gave them a special role.
But this has been cemented by very close co-ordination between the two
governments in the Bosnian crisis. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, was the first minister Mr Juppe met after he assumed office.
Meanwhile, the British prime minister, Mr John Major, is to visit Paris
before the end of this month - one of the first foreign leaders to call on
the new centre-right government.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Mitterrand mocks UK as new TGV link opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand yesterday inaugurated the extension of the TGV
(train a grande vitesse) high-speed link from Paris to Lille, the first leg
of the high-speed rail network that is to extend to London and Brussels by
the mid-1990s.
In a mocking reference to the British for not yet deciding on a high-speed
link on its side of the channel, Mr Mitterrand said: 'They will race at
great pace across the plains of northern France, race through the tunnel on
a fast track and then be able to daydream at very low speed, admiring the
(English) landscape and the countryside . . . until the day when someone
over there in London decides to harmonise the way of doing things between
the continent and the island,' he said.
The British government only recently decided to build a fast track from
London to the tunnel and it has yet to approve the route because of likely
protests from people living in southeast England.
On the French side, Lille is expecting the TGV to turn it from a decaying
industrial backwater into an important European regional centre. It is
integrating its TGV station into a huge new FFr5.2bn (Pounds 620m) business
centre, and even touting itself as a rival to Lyons for the French site of
the mooted European central bank.
According to Mr Bruno Bonduelle, a leading Lille businessman, the city has
within a radius of 250km, stretching to southeast England, Belgium, the
Netherlands and the Paris area, '80m of the richest people on the planet'.
Amiens to the west, and Valenciennes to the east, complain, however, that
the shortest routes to Calais and Brussels lie through their cities, not
through Lille whose mayor, Mr Pierre Mauroy, they claim, used the political
pull as a former socialist prime minister to win the route.
The opening took place, however, against a background of complaints by rail
users about the higher fares (ranging from FFr207 to FFr481 for a round
trip) they will have to pay to help recoup the FFr18.5bn cost.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Sterling rises on hopes of calmer ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL European currencies, including sterling and the Italian lira, rose
strongly against the D-Mark in the build-up to yesterday's Yes vote in
Denmark, writes James Blitz.
Investors sold D-Marks after taking the view that a clear result in favour
of the Maastricht treaty would ease tensions in Europe's exchange rate
mechanism.
In recent weeks investors, fearing a No vote, had been seeking a safe haven
against currency turmoil and a renewed threat to economic and monetary union
by buying D-Marks and Swiss francs.
German government bond prices also fell yesterday, to the benefit of Italian
and French bonds.
Sterling gained a pfennig to close at DM2.4875 after the final Danish
opinion polls showed a clear majority for the treaty. The Italian lira was
also a strong performer, closing at L909.2 against the D-Mark from a
previous close of L914.9.
The dollar gained significantly from the D-Mark's weakness, rising more than
a pfennig in Europe to finish at DM1.6272, a 7-week high. It closed in
London at DM1.624 and at DM1.62465 in New York.
The dollar was also supported by speculation about tighter monetary policy
in the US.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Proposals for electoral change threaten to split Labour
party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR MPs opposed to electoral reform launched a campaign yesterday against
a working party's proposals for sweeping changes to the way parliament is
elected.
The proposals, which are to be discussed today by Labour's ruling national
executive committee, are made in a report by the opposition's working party
on electoral systems, chaired by Lord Plant of Highfield.
The report recommends abolishing the first-past-the-post system used for
elections to the House of Commons in favour of an untried system known as
the supplementary vote. It also recommends switching to proportional
representation for elections to the European parliament and for the second
chamber Labour proposes to introduce to replace the House of Lords.
The NEC discussion was intended to launch a consultation period on the Plant
report before a decision at the autumn party conference. Now it looks likely
to open up a new split in the party, already deeply divided over internal
reforms such as the loosening of links with the trade unions.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, will be hoping to avoid an open split by
backing the idea of a national referendum on electoral reform at today's
meeting.
Mr Smith is cautious about electoral reform, although he is said to have
accepted the case for change. But a group of MPs opposed to reform launched
a campaign to retain the first-past-the-post system.
Mr Derek Fatchett, chairman of the group, warned that for a newly elected
Labour government to spend its first year or two on electoral reform would
be 'Labour's equivalent of a new Maastricht bill', in terms of its
divisiveness and irrelevance.
The Plant report says the present system fails to reflect the changing
nature of British society. It examines three options for changing the UK's
electoral system so that the number of MPs from each party more closely
reflects party support, without losing the direct link between MPs and
constituencies.
All three options would have left the Conservatives short of an overall
majority at the last election and would almost certainly have resulted in a
minority Labour government.
By a narrow majority, the Plant committee recommends that Labour should
adopt the supplementary-vote system devised by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, MP
for Workington.
That would allow voters to express a second preference, which would be taken
into account if no candidate won more than 50 per cent of the
first-preference votes.
Other recommendations in the report include:
Introducing four-year fixed-term parliaments;
State funding for political parties;
Limits on national spending by parties in general elections.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Danish Yes vote boosts treaty: Maastricht wins 56.8% support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK delivered a decisive vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty on
European union last night, to the profound relief of its partners in the
European Community.
The Yes victory, by a margin of 56.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent with all the
votes counted, reversed last June's rejection of the treaty by Danish
voters. Last year's result had thrown into serious doubt the EC strategy for
closer economic and political union.
Yesterday, in a turnout of 86.2 per cent, Danes voted to accept Maastricht,
this time with the crucial proviso of the Edinburgh agreements which gave
Denmark a series of opt-outs from the treaty's key programmes.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime minister, claimed victory shortly after
the first computer predictions were broadcast. 'I am happy that it is such a
clear result . . . it is a very important Yes,' he said.
Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, foreign minister, proclaimed: 'This is good for
Denmark and it is good for Europe.' Looking forward to the EC summit in
Copenhagen next month, which Denmark will chair as current president of the
Community, Mr Helveg Petersen said: 'Denmark can speak with greater
authority.'
Ms Drude Dahlerup, spokeswoman of the anti-treaty June Movement, had
conceded defeat shortly after the first exit polls, saying: 'It's clearly a
disappointment. It's a historic decision going the wrong way.'
But she said the size of the No vote showed that: 'The people are still
divided and parliamentarians must listen to all those people who voted
against the treaty.'
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said last night that
Denmark's decision would provide 'a stimulus to the Community'. The Yes vote
would help the EC to leave behind a difficult period of 'inaction' at a time
when it faced 'many internal problems - especially economic stagnation and
rising unemployment'. Mr Delors added: 'For all these reasons, Europe needs
a new impulse.'
The EC welcomed the Danish vote, saying it would allow Denmark to continue
contributing to the process of European union. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German
foreign minister, said the vote was 'a rejection of the Euro-sceptics'. He
went on: 'By voting Yes, the Danish people have decided their future lies in
common with their partners in the EC on the basis of the Treaty on European
Union . . . I am happy that the Danish voters have acted with real European
responsibility.'
After Denmark, only Britain and Germany, where the treaty is being
challenged in the constitutional court, have not yet ratified Maastricht. Mr
Kinkel said he hoped all member states would now clear the way for
Maastricht ratification before parliaments went into recess for the summer.
Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman for the Christian Democrats in the
German parliament, said the vote meant 'the British cannot hide behind the
Danes. Such an attitude was always unworthy of them. Now they must decide
for themselves whether their answer is Yes or No.'
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, said: 'The
Danes have decided after long and detailed analysis that, far from forcing
them down the road of an over- centralised and bureaucratic union, the
Maastricht treaty will strengthen the ties between European nations without
threatening their identity.'
Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner for external political affairs,
described the outcome as 'an important day for Europe'.
'We are looking with high expectations towards London for the British House
of Commons to complete its ratification of the treaty,' he added. France,
which last June had initially urged EC partners to brush aside Denmark's
rejection of Maastricht, last night welcomed yesterday's vote.
The foreign ministry, with an eye to British ratification, said it was
important to implement Maastricht as soon as possible. In the first Danish
vote last June, the verdict went against ratification by 50.7 per cent to
49.3 per cent, a majority of only 46,000 votes out of almost 3.3m cast.
The Edinburgh EC summit last December granted Denmark opt-outs from the
treaty's provisions on a unified currency, defence policy, community-wide
legal and police co-operation, as well as union citizenship.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Britain will speed up ratification, says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night seized on Denmark's endorsement of Maastricht to
signal that Britain would now press ahead quickly with ratification of a
treaty that has threatened to split the Tory party.
Amid undisguised jubilation in Whitehall, ministers said the government
hoped to complete the tortuous ratification process before parliament's
summer recess at the end of July.
Mr Major, speaking to businessmen at the annual dinner of the Confederation
of British Industry, said the government now intended to 'get on with doing
business for Britain in Europe'.
Emphasising that ratification was essential to ensure that Britain was not
sidelined in Europe, the prime minister commented: 'The issue is British
jobs, British sales, Britain's future . . . the sooner we put this
debilitating business behind us, the better it will be for British
business.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, added that the
government's objective now was to 'get on with life after Maastricht'. The
prime minister, who has seen his government's authority drained, said the
Tory party should put behind it the 'incomprehensible and interminable'
wrangling over Maastricht.
Conservative Euro-sceptics acknowledged that the Danish result had severely
dented their hopes of wrecking the agreement. But they vowed to continue to
fight British ratification in the House of Lords and in the courts.
Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit will lead another rebellion against the bill
in the Lords but Mr Major is confident they will fail. Lord Tebbit, who
intends to table amendments to the legislation calling for a British
referendum, vowed last night that the 'fight' would go on.
The prime minister expects to defeat a separate legal challenge from the
Tory Euro-sceptics over the status of Britain's opt-out from the Treaty
social chapter.
The only remaining option for the sceptics would then be to join with the
Labour party and vote for the scrapping of the social chapter opt-out.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the opposition would continue its
campaign for the opt-out to be removed. He said: 'Unlike Britain, the people
of Denmark were fortunate enough to be presented with a version of the
Maastricht Treaty which contained the Social Chapter.'
The Maastricht bill will complete its passage through the House of Commons
tomorrow. In spite of the threat of a rebellion by 40 or more Conservative
Euro-sceptics, the bill's move to the House of Lords is guaranteed because
of Labour's decision to abstain on the crucial third reading vote.
Senior ministers acknowledged that wounds in the Tory party from the bitter
struggle over the treaty will take years to heal.
The government has already been warned by its supporters that any move to
take sterling back into the European exchange rate mechanism - as required
under the treaty - would provoke an even bigger revolt.

FT  19 MAY 93 / Labour committee proposes sweeping electoral reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING CHANGES to the way parliament is elected are proposed in a report
by the Labour party's working party on electoral systems.
The committee, chaired by Lord Plant of Highfield, recommends abolishing the
first-past-the-post system now used for elections to the House of Commons,
in favour of an untried system known as the supplementary vote. Labour's
national executive committee meets today to discuss the report.
The discussion will begin a consultation period on the Plant report before
further NEC discussion in advance of a decision at the autumn party
conference. However, it looks likely to open up a new split in the party,
already deeply divided over internal reforms such as the loosening of links
with the trades unions.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, will be hoping to avoid an open split by
backing the idea of a national referendum on electoral reform at today's
meeting.
Mr Smith is cautious about electoral reform although he is said to have
accepted the case for change.
But a group of MPs opposed to electoral reform yesterday launched a campaign
to retain the first-past-the-post system for elections to the commons.
Mr Derek Fatchett, chairman of the group, warned that for a newly elected
Labour government to spend its first year or two on electoral reform would
be 'Labour's equivalent of a new Maastricht bill', in terms of its
divisiveness and irrelevance.
The Plant report says that the present system fails to reflect the changing

for Workington. This would allow voters to express a second preference which
would be taken into account if no candidate won more than 50 per cent of the

Other recommendations in the report include:

the elected second chamber which Labour proposes to replace the House of
Lords.
Introducing four-year fixed-term parliaments.
State funding for political parties, and restrictions on national spending
by parties in general elections.
Measures to improve the electoral process, by registering more voters,
making postal voting easier, moving elections to the weekend and allowing
votes to be cast up to eight days in advance.

FT  19 MAY 93 / D-Mark hit by easing of tensions in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of a Yes vote in the Danish referendum weakened the D-Mark
yesterday, as international investors took the view that such a result would
significantly ease tensions in Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
Several European currencies, including sterling and the Italian lira,
enjoyed strong rises against the D-Mark, as Danish opinion polls pointed to
a clear ratification of the Maastricht treaty and a period of calm in
Europe's fixed exchange rate system.
This reversed a trend of recent weeks in which investors, fearful of another
Danish No, sought a safe haven against currency turmoil and a renewed threat
to European economic and monetary union by buying D-Marks and Swiss francs.
German government bond prices also fell to the benefit of Italian and French
bonds.
Danish opinion polls helped the pound to close a pfennig higher against the
D-Mark on the day, at DM2.4875. The Italian lira was also a strong
performer, closing at L909.2 against the D-Mark from a previous close of
L914.9.
The dollar gained significantly from the D-Mark's weakness, rising more than
a pfennig to peak at DM1.6272 in Europe, and reaching a 7-week high. It
later closed in London at DM1.6240.
An additional factor pushing the dollar higher against the German currency
was speculation that the Federal Reserve's federal open market committee
would lean towards tightening monetary policy at its meeting in New York
yesterday.
Expectations of a rise in short-term US interest rates have followed last
week's US inflation figures, which were higher than anticipated. The results
of the meeting, which took place yesterday and continues today, will not be
known for some weeks.

DENMARK delivered a decisive vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty on
European union last night, according to computer predictions and exit polls
broadcast on Danish television.
The result came as a huge relief to European Community leaders as well as to
the Danish government. Last June's initial rejection of the treaty by Danish
voters convulsed the EC, throwing its strategy for closer economic and
political union into doubt.
Computer forecasts of the final result, based on 46.7 per cent of votes
counted, showed a win for the Yes campaign by 56.8 per cent to 43.2 per
cent, overturning the Danish rejection of Maastricht in a previous
referendum last June.
The prediction was in line with exit surveys by the Gallup organisation and
the AIM polling institute, published as polls closed, both of which forecast
a 57 per cent to 43 per cent victory for the Yes camp.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime minister, claimed victory shortly after
the first computer predictions were broadcast. 'I am happy that it is such a
clear result . . . it is a very important Yes,' he said.
Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister, proclaimed: 'This is good
for Denmark and it is good for Europe.'
Looking forward to the EC summit in Copenhagen next month, which Denmark
will chair as current president of the Community, Mr Helveg Petersen said:
'Denmark can speak with greater authority.'
Ms Drude Dahlerup, spokeswoman of the anti-treaty June Movement conceded
defeat shortly after the first exit polls, saying: 'It's clearly a
disappointment. It's a historical decision going the wrong way.'
But she said the size of the No vote showed that 'the people are still
divided and parliamentarians must listen to all those people who voted
against the treaty.'
The Danish government is expected to unveil today a package of economic
measures to expand domestic demand and reform the income tax system which it
was holding back until sure of a Yes vote.
France, which last June had initially urged EC partners to brush aside
Denmark's rejection of Maastricht, last night welcomed the subsequent Danish
approval. The foreign ministry, with an eye to British ratification, said it
was most important to implement Maastricht as soon as possible.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, said last
night: 'The Danes have decided after long and detailed analysis that, far
from forcing them down the road of an overcentralised and bureaucratic
union, the Maastricht treaty will strengthen the ties between European
nations without threatening their identity.'
Sir Leon added that the vote was as relevant to Britain as to Denmark.
After Denmark, only Britain and Germany, where the treaty is being
challenged in the constitutional court, have not yet ratified Maastricht.
In the first Danish vote on June 2 last year, the verdict went against
ratification by 50.7 per cent to 49.3 per cent, a majority of only 46,000
votes out of almost 3.3m cast. Yesterday, turnout was estimated at 85 per
cent, exceeding last year's 83 per cent.
With the vast majority of the Danish parliament supporting Maastricht, the
country's leaders sought a way of going back to the electorate. This was
secured at the Edinburgh EC summit last December when Denmark was granted
opt-outs from the treaty's provisions on a unified currency, defence policy,
Community-wide legal and police co-operation, and union citizenship.
The Edinburgh agreement was backed by more than 90 per cent of the Danish
parliament, representing seven of the eight parliamentary parties. Opponents
argued it was a meaningless excuse to hold a second poll on the treaty,
which itself has not been changed.

FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Euro-sceptics vow to carry on fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night seized on Denmark's apparent endorsement of
Maastricht to signal that Britain would now press ahead quickly with
ratification of a treaty which has come close to splitting the Conservative
party.
But while his party's Euro-sceptics acknowledged that the forecast Danish
result had severely dented their hopes of wrecking the agreement, they vowed
to continue to fight British ratification in the House of Lords and in the
courts. Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit will lead another rebellion against
the bill in the Lords but Mr Major is confident they will be unsuccessful.
The prime minister also expects to defeat a legal challenge from the Tory
Euro-sceptics over Britain's opt-out from the social chapter.
Amid jubilation in Whitehall, ministers said the government now hoped to
complete the tortuous and bitter ratification process before the summer
parliamentary recess at the end of July. The prime minister, who has seen
his government's authority drained by the bitter struggle over the treaty,
voiced the hope that the Tory party would now put its differences behind it.
Speaking to businessmen, Mr Major said the the ending of the uncertainty
surrounding Maastricht would provide a boost to economic recovery in Britain
and elsewhere in Europe. The Community could now go forward as 12 into the
next intergovernmental conference in 1996.
The Maastricht bill will complete its passage through the House of Commons
tomorrow. Despite the threat of a rebellion by 40 or more Conservative
Euro-sceptics, the bill's passage to the House of Lords is guaranteed
because of the Labour party's decision to abstain on the crucial third
reading vote.
Senior ministers acknowledged last night that the wounds in the Tory party
from the bitter struggle over the treaty will take years to heal.
The government has already been warned by its supporters that any move to
take sterling back into the European exchange rate mechanism - as required
under the Maastricht treaty - would trigger an even bigger revolt among its
supporters.
Even if Mr Major manages to complete the ratification process by the end of
July, Britain now looks likely to be the last of the 12 formally to endorse
the treaty.
But colleagues were claiming last night that without the concessions for
Denmark negotiated by the prime minister at last December's Edinburgh
summit, Maastricht would have collapsed entirely.

<TEXT>
TOYS 'R' Us, the rapidly expanding US toy retailer, yesterday reported a 25
per cent improvement in net earnings for the first quarter of 1993, to
Dollars 35.4m, or 12 cents a share, reflecting stronger margins for products
sold.
A year earlier, the company posted net profits of Dollars 28.3m, or 10 cents
a share. Sales advanced to Dollars 1.29bn in the latest quarter, from
Dollars 1.17bn a year earlier.
Mr Charles Lazarus, chairman and chief executive, said comparable toy store
sales in the US rose 2 per cent in the quarter, with strong increases in
basic toys and video games.
Same-store sales also improved in Spain, Canada and the UK. In Germany and
France, however, local economic conditions put pressure on sales and
comparable store sales fell.
The company's Kids 'R' Us clothing stores had flat store sales in the
quarter, but operating earnings rose significantly, reflecting 'continued
improvement in inventory management and expense control,' Mr Lazarus said.
The company plans to open 40 toy stores in the US and 60 stores
internationally, including its first stores in Belgium, The Netherlands,
Portugal, Switzerland and Australia. It already operates 540 toy stores in
the US, as well as 167 international toy stores and 215 clothing stores.
Tiffany, the New York-based jewellery group, posted a sharp drop in
first-quarter net income on modestly-improved sales, reflecting higher
operating expenses and consumer caution in the face of weak economies around
the world.
Net income for the first three months of 1993 fell to Dollars 1m, or 7 cents
a share, from Dollars 3.1m, or 20 cents a year earlier. Sales rose to
Dollars 109.5m from Dollars 107.2m.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Plateau repeats its support for Dixon Motor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOSTILE bid for Plateau Mining by Kingstream, a small Australian
exploration company, closes on Thursday and both sides have sent
communications to Plateau shareholders.
Kingstream says the rival proposal for Dixon Motor Holdings to reverse into
Plateau would result in Plateau shareholders having '10 per cent of a motor
dealership in the north of England which in 1992 had a turnover of Pounds
46m producing a net profit of only Pounds 250,000'.
Its own offer however would give shareholders 22 per cent of a steel-making
venture 'ideally placed to serve the booming south-east Asian market and
with a projected turnover in excess of Pounds 400m'.
Plateau's board continues to recommend the Dixon deal and suggests that 'the
few selective statements that Kingstream make about the Dixon Group give a
misleading impression.
'Dixon has a proven UK-based business, is consistently profitable and has
always been in a position to pay divi-dends.
'On the basis of its published accounts, Kingstream has had no profits, has
no net cash and has not paid dividends.'
Plateau says the Dixon proposals coupled with a disposal to Delta Gold, the
Australian mining group, are worth in the region of 7.6p a share, compared
with Kingstream's all-paper offer worth, at best, 4.8p.

<TEXT>
SONY Music Entertainment (Japan), a core unit of the Sony group's domestic
software business, saw a 39.7 per cent increase in profits for the fiscal
year to March.
Pre-tax profits of the parent company rose to Y22.4bn (Dollars 202m) from a
year earlier due to the success of new Japanese recordings and the expansion
of its domestic repertoire.
Net profits gained 41.2 per cent to Y11.9bn from a year earlier, while sales
grew by 8.4 per cent to 100bn.
However, the shares of the company, whose western recording artists include
Michael Jackson, suffered from profit-taking on the second section of the
Tokyo stock exchange yesterday, ending Y30 lower at Y5,180.
The company said CD and record sales of their Japanese artists climbed 21.7
per cent the last fiscal year and enabled the company to counter
depreciation costs.
In spite of the gains made last year, Sony Music predicted a decline of 10.0
per cent in pre-tax profits to Y20.2bn this current business year, with
sales down 2.6 per cent at Y98.1bn.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Spurs forced to issue statement on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTTENHAM Hotspur, the north London football club, was forced to put out a
profit statement yesterday after Mr Terry Venables, who is fighting to keep
his job as chief executive, broadcast a profit forecast on BBC Grandstand on
Saturday.
Mr Venables made the unauthorised forecast of a Pounds 5m profit during the
BBC's coverage of the FA Cup final at Wembley. The drama of his sacking and
reinstatement on Friday has provoked as much excitement as the 1 - 1 clash
between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday.
With Tottenham's share price rising from 89p to 103p yesterday, the board
headed by Mr Alan Sugar, who wants Mr Venables out, announced that pre-tax
profits amounted to about Pounds 4m for the 10 months to March 31.
It made clear that Mr Venables' statement was 'without the board's
approval'.
Mr Venables' method of giving out price - sensitive information jars with
stock exchange rules about making such announcements to the market as a
whole.
The Pounds 5m figure for Spurs' financial year to May 31 was in line with a
forecast by its broker, Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken.
The other factor driving up the share price yesterday was speculation about
the amount Mr Sugar, who owns 48 per cent of the shares, was prepared to pay
Mr Venables for his 22 per cent stake.
Mr Sugar has offered to match what Mr Venables paid for the shares.
Confusing reports on this led to some market speculation that the figure
might be as high as 125p a share.
Mr Venables, who described the offer as derisory, paid 75p for about 2.9m
shares when he and Mr Sugar took control of the club in mid-1991.
He later converted an Pounds 800,000 loan to the club into about 640,000
shares as part of a Pounds 7m rescue rights issue, at 125p a share, which
was underwritten by Mr Sugar. .
According to these figures, the average price Mr Venables paid was 85p,
which is less than Friday's closing price.
Mr Venables also borrowed most of the Pounds 3m he has invested, leaving him
with a loss on his financing costs.
In broadcasting the Pounds 5m forecast, he also drew attention to the low
p/e ratio on which Tottenham was trading - little more than three times at
89p. This rises to more than 8 times if about Pounds 3m gains from player
sales, notably Paul Gascoigne, are deducted from the forecast.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SEP shares rise 5p as first half profits
double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON FARRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE progress in the first half and good prospects for the year as a
whole, SEP Industrial Holdings, the general engineering group, is
forecasting an increase in dividend.
Pre-tax profit for the six months ended March 31 1993 jumped from Pounds
378,000 to Pounds 883,000, and exceeded the figure for the whole of the
previous year. The shares closed 5p higher at 28 1/2 p.
The interim dividend is raised to 0.35p on the higher capital (0.3p) and the
total will be not less than 0.75p (0.65p).
The manufacturing division lifted profit from Pounds 87,000 to Pounds
234,000, which had added to the board's confidence in recovery prospects.
Distribution activity increased 'quite noticeably' in recent weeks. Jaton
Holdings, acquired in January, made a substantial contribution, with
turnover of Pounds 4.13m and operating profit of Pounds 397,000.
Earnings per share for the half year came to 1.2p (0.7p).
Shareholders' funds at March 31 were estimated to have increased to Pounds
12.5m after the sale of Cediwal by the Belgian subsidiary, proceeds of the
placing and open offer in January, and the surplus of Jaton's net assets
over the purchase consideration.

FT  18 MAY 93 / US West finds cable role in deal with Time Warner: Nikki
Tait on increased co-operation between two US industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement that US West, one of the seven US regional telephone
companies resulting from the break-up of AT&amp;T, will invest Dollars 2.5bn in
Time Warner Entertainment, part of Time Warner, the giant media and
entertainment conglomerate, marks an important step in the fast-evolving
relationship between the US telecommunications and cable industries, writes
Nikki Tait in New York.
To date, that relationship has largely been one of confrontation  - a battle
over who will bring communications into American homes over the coming
decade. Now, it seems, co-operation may be the order of the day.
At a financial level, the deal is complex. Essentially, US West will put up
Dollars 1.5bn when the deal closes, hopefully later this year. The remainder
will be supplied over a four-year period. This investment will give US West
a 25.5 per cent interest in Time Warner Entertainment, the company's filmed
entertainment, programming and cable arm.
Time Warner will continue to own 63.27 per cent of TWE, and have operating
control of much of the division. Remaining equity will be split between
Itochu Corporation (previously C. Itoh) and Toshiba, existing partners in
TWE.
But the relationship between Time Warner and US West is expected to run a
good deal deeper than this. Out of US West's total investment, Dollars 1bn
will be devoted to developing Time Warner's planned 'full service networks'.
This is the highly-ambitious interactive cable-based home entertainment and
communications network, which the company outlined in detail earlier this
year.
At present, Time Warner's plans for the full-service network centre on
Orlando, Florida, where it hopes to start demonstrating the system by the
end of 1993, and then make it available to residential customers by 1994.
Using more sophisticated technology than the traditional coaxial cable
systems, the full-service networks promise customers a vastly-increased
range of services  - including the ability to call up movies on demand,
conduct interactive games, full-motion shopping, access to distance
learning, and so on. Over a five-year period, Time Warner hopes to extend
the networks to about 25 US metropolitan areas.
All this is costly. According to one senior Time Warner executive yesterday,
the company's capital expenditure on cable is currently about Dollars 400m a
year. In the five years between 1994 and 1998, it is expected to average
about Dollars 800m annually  - and most of the money will go on the
full-service networks development. US West's Dollars 1bn will be welcome.
But US West will also play a big operational role in the partnership. The
full-service networks venture will be run jointly and involve employees from
both groups.
TWE's full-service networks, however, will not venture into US West's
territory, which stretches from Denver, its home town, up to Seattle in the
north-west; indeed, Time Warner will shed its modest cable operations in US
West's 14-state telephone service area. This a recognition of the
restrictions which still limit Baby Bells' forays into US cable. At present,
telephone companies are barred by Federal law from owning cable TV systems
in the markets in which they provide a telephone service.
Nevertheless, in formidable fashion, yesterday's deal emphasises the
determination of US telephone companies to carve a large role in cable's
future. It comes only two months after Southwestern Bell agreed to buy two
cable TV systems in suburban Washington for Dollars 650m from the
privately-owned Hauser Communications, a deal which must still secure
regulatory approval.
That was the first attempt by any US telephone company to acquire a US cable
TV group, although Southwestern Bell owns and operates a system in Britain,
and spurred speculation that it could set off a scramble by other
telecommunications companies.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Crackdown on crime bosses startles Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RIO judge has taken the first step towards ending crime networks
throughout Brazil. The surprise move could herald the end of Brazil's
traditional soft approach towards organised crime.
The regular monthly court appearance for the bicheiros  - men who run Rio's
massive illegal gambling network  - is usually a formality. They pay off
local police and politicians, and the case investigating them for
Mafia-style activities has been running for seven years with no progress.
But last Friday 12 of the city's 14 biggest crime bosses were handcuffed and
led away agape after Judge Denise Frossard ordered their arrest for
'threatening public order' after one of their bodyguards (an off-duty
military policeman) was caught trying to enter the courtroom armed with a
Colt 45 and a Magnum revolver.
Inspired by recent events in Italy, Ms Frossard's decision could put her own
life at risk. An editorial in the Jornal do Brasil newspaper
enthusiastically described it as 'perhaps the most impressive moment in
Brazilian judicial history'. Ms Alba Zaluar, a leading authority on crime in
Rio, says: 'This may finally break the vicious circle of a justice system
where only the poor go to jail.'
Brazilians were riveted to their television screens watching the 12 men
being led away and transferred under police escort to the Ary Franco prison
to share a cell with eight others. There was much mirth as prison guards
refused to allow the entry of an exercise bike brought by one of their
aides.
Ms Frossard's ruling has been supported by her colleagues and Rio's chief
justice says he will resist all pressures to drop her from the case. The
move follows the opening of investigations into 15 of the city's top-ranking
policeman for alleged corruption.
But the bicheiros have powerful friends. The gambling racket turns over
millions of dollars a week and, although illegal, it is conducted openly on
almost every street corner of Rio. The bicheiros finance many of the city's
football clubs and run Carnival, sponsoring all the main samba schools. Only
two months ago they were seen by 50m television viewers being embraced by
the mayor of Rio during the Carnival parade.
A sentence is expected on Friday. Even if convicted, the bicheiros are
expected to carry on running their lottery from jail and analysts fear they
may use their estimated 30,000 strong ranks to unleash a campaign of
violence in Rio.

Farmers yesterday blocked the main road from Lisbon to Portugal's second

Reuter reports.
Reporters at the scene said about 100 farmers had blocked the road near
Batalha, about 100km north of Lisbon. Police were diverting traffic to avoid
the barricade, which had caused tailbacks of up to 1km.
The farmers' protest followed demonstrations by fishermen over two weeks to
protest against cheaper Spanish fish flooding auctions in Portugal.

Germany is scrapping separate trade data for the old East and West Germanys.
The Federal Statistics Office said it would no longer publish separate trade
figures for the two regions of the united Germany, Reuter reports from Bonn.
Officials said that it had become too complicated to calculate the data in
time because of the creation of the European Community's single market.
In the past, the office published pan-German trade figures for each month,
followed by release of separate sets of data for west and east Germany later
in the month.
The office plans to release pan-German February trade data today.

<TEXT>
Turkish troops killed 13 Kurdish guerrillas and wounded two in a gunbattle
in south-east Turkey, agencies report. An official at the regional
governor's office in Diyarbakir said the clash, the bloodiest since rebel
Kurds declared a ceasefire in March, took place on Sunday near the town of
Kulp.
Turkey says it does not recognise the unilateral ceasefire proclaimed by the
banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and has called on all PKK fighters to
surrender unconditionally.
More than 5,600 people have been killed since the PKK began fighting for an
independent Kurdish state in 1984.

<TEXT>
A PAY and productivity dispute in Sweden's electrical sector escalated
yesterday when employers locked out about 17,000 workers, many of whom have
been striking for more than a week, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in
Stockholm.
The move came after both employers and unions rejected a mediation offer.
The conflict threatens to disrupt production at both of Sweden's leading car
manufacturers, Saab and Volvo, and to curtail activity in the building
industry.

FT  18 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gambling and hotels group Ladbroke continued to recover from its recent
mauling, adding 8 at 177p in hefty turnover of 6.8m. The shares have
underperformed in recent weeks as worries resurfaced over its gearing and
prospective property write-downs. There was also a stock overhang,
compounded by fears that a scrip issue next month will bring more stock into
the market.
However, sentiment has improved in recent sessions, with more positive
leisure analysts arguing that the stock was looking too cheap to be
justified and that its betting business in particular was well placed.
NatWest Securities, which recently put out a weighty tome on the issue, was
yesterday reiterating its buy recommendation.
Stanley Leisure benefited from the positive gambling talk and put on 5 at
215p.
The continuing weakness in crude oil prices, ahead of the June 8 Opec
meeting, took the steam out of the oil shares sector. Oil prices are said to
have fallen around 70 cents a barrel since the middle of last week.
BP lost 4 to 316 1/2 p, with the market surprised at the shares' performance
after last week's move by one leading UK institution which bought a block of
more than 20m shares. UK funds, big sellers of BP for much of last year, are
thought by some oil sector specialists to be 'running for cover' and seeking
to top up their holdings in BP. Much of the selling of BP yesterday was said
to have emanated from the US.
Shell, the FT-SE 100's best individual performer last week with an 8.1 per
cent rise after the splendid figures, eased 1 1/2 to 609 1/2 p.
Lasmo, still viewed as one of the most likely candidates to drop out of the
FT-SE 100 after the inclusion of Zeneca and the forthcoming evaluation of
the 100 index, edged up 1 1/2 to 154p in spite of evidence of sustained
selling pressure from income funds.
British Gas slipped 1 1/2 to 293 1/2 p ahead of Thursday's first-quarter
numbers and also after comment in the weekend press, which suggested that
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's inquiry may be moving to a position
where it may seek an opening up of the domestic gas market, a move which is
thought may not be viewed favourably in the City.
APV shed 4 to 95p after Cazenove, the company's broker, downgraded current
year profits expectations. The recent selling of GKN, following a clutch of
broker's downgradings, appeared to have come to an end, leaving the shares
to advance 9 to 443p ahead of tomorrow's annual meeting. A squeeze in
Hunting brought an improvement of 6 to 210p. Vosper Thorncroft was in demand
and put on 7 at 541p.
Turnover in Smiths Industries of 2.2m included an agency cross of nearly 1m
shares. The stock hardened a penny to 357p. Bargain hunters went shopping
for Simon Industries, helping the shares firm 3 to 58p.
UK flag carrier British Airways had a busy session ahead of today's expected
announcement of a Pounds 400m-plus rights issue. Heavy selling saw the stock
fall 6 1/2 to 297p in brisk trade of 7.3m shares.
The company, which also reports final figures today, is expected to come in
with profits for the year to March 1993 of around Pounds 200m, against last
year's figure of Pounds 285m.
Profit-taking in Lonrho left the shares 4 lighter at 113 1/2 p. Computer
graphics company Division Group made a spectacular market debut. The shares
closed at a 56p premium to the issue price at 96p, with 10m shares having
been dealt by the close.
Pharmaceutical stocks surged as US buyers were seen, helped also by some
positive weekend press in the UK. Glaxo rose 14 to 655p, SmithKline Beecham
'A' 15 to 481p and Wellcome 16 to 755p.
Food manufacturers were mostly strong, a mixture of market gossip and
technical factors underpinning the rises. Of the major stocks, Northern
Foods rose 10 to 270p as dealers reported a large buyer in the market. Tate
&amp; Lyle firmed 4 to 386p on rumours of an imminent deal to buy a Spanish
sugar refinery. Finally, old bid talk once again swirled around United
Biscuits, the shares advancing 7 to 421p.
Weekend press comment helped Marks and Spencer climb 6 to 355p, as the
market waited eagerly for today's trading statement, which is likely to set
the trend for the rest of the retail sector.
There was speculation that Allied-Lyons would announce some form of
equity-raising event with its results today. A convertible bond, or
preference share issue seem to be the market favourite, although more
cynical analysts said the 'Allied rights issue' story was a tired one. The
shares shed 2 to 543p.
Catering group Compass, which reports results this week, jumped 19 to 525p.
The shares have underperformed in recent weeks. Allied Leisure gained 4 at
57p as it confirmed the appointment of Mr Bill Davis, former head of the
English Tourist Board, as non-executive chairman. After a weekend of
boardroom rows, Tottenham Hotspur climbed 14 to 103p. A company statement
attempted to play down talk of profits mentioned in weekend press reports.
The prospect of above average profits and dividend growth at Lloyds Bank saw
the shares outperform the rest of the big banks and close a net 11 higher at
545p. TSB, where Hoare Govett was said to be a keen buyer of the shares,
added 3 1/2 at 185p.

FT  18 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Whitbread dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The jury remained out following final results from Whitbread which saw a
sparkling performance from the retail division reined in by a flat domestic
brewing side. Echoing the sentiment, Whitbread 'A' shares edged forward a
penny to 482p.
The improvement in the group's food and public houses businesses helped
other selected drinks stocks, with Scottish &amp; Newcastle gaining 5 at 463p
and Bass 8 at 533p.
Analysts warned that Whitbread's split fortunes were likely to produce a
two-way pull on the stock. Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest Securities, said:
'Whitbread is one of the most expensive stocks in the sector and not
justified by its earnings growth.' Reiterating his negative stance, he added
that the company's 6 per cent earnings per share growth for this year and a
forecast 8 per cent next year was half of that predicted for the All-Share.
Ms Alex Oldroyd at SGST retained a hold stance, adding that improving
margins and strong brands could stand Whitbread in good stead should there
be a change of sentiment on the sector.

FT  18 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Upgrade lifts Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE upgrading in its profits forecast by French-owned stockbroker Credit
Lyonnais Laing (CLL) was the trigger for another outstanding performance by
SG Warburg, regarded as one of the UK's leading merchant banks and
integrated securities houses. Warburg is heavily involved in the forthcoming
ICI rights issue and is global co-ordinator of the third issue of BT shares.
At the close of business SG Warburg shares were 28 ahead at a record closing
high of 701p. Earlier, the stock had touched an all-time intraday peak of
704p. Turnover amounted to 301,000 shares.
Mr Neil Baker, merchant banks analyst at CLL, said he had lifted his
estimate of pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March 1993 from
Pounds 131.2m to Pounds 154.2m - the top of the market range - and his
estimate for the year to end-March 1994 from Pounds 182m to Pounds 267m.
Most analysts' estimates for the 1993-94 year are said to be below Pounds
200m.
Mr Baker said the key to the upgrading of his forecasts for the bank was an
expected upturn in the performance of Warburg's investment banking
operation. 'The shares are cheap on a prospective price/ earnings multiple
of nine times against a market p/e of 14 times,' added Mr Baker.
Another booster for Warburg shares came from the stock's probable elevation
to the FT-SE 100 Index, possibly after the next scheduled meeting of the
FT-SE steering committee on June 9.

FT  18 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE in stock index futures sent the near month contract sharply ahead
in thin trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
But for an early sell order which caused the decline of the June contract on
the FT-SE 100 from its opening of 2,854 to 2,846, it moved steadily ahead,
pulling the underlying equity market higher.
The strong demand for the contract meant that June maintained a steady
premium of around 10 points for most of the session, although actual dealing
remained very low.
It reached the day's high of 2,870 in the last hour of trading and finished
at 2,864, up 15 from its previous close and around 6 points above its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 5 points. Turnover at the
official close was a mere 4,557 lots, although that total was boosted in
after-hours' trading.
Volume in traded options was also poor. The day's total came to 24,332
contracts, against Friday's 27,986, and the total included 4,175 lots dealt
in the FT-SE 100 option.
BT, which was also busy in the underlying equities, attracted a resurgence
of strong support in the traded options after news of the group's move into
satellite dish retailing. It was the busiest option with a total of 4,566
lots dealt, and the 420 puts were the busiest series.
It was followed by Hanson with 1,971 contracts traded, and the Euro FT-SE
100 option with 1,693.

FT  18 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares unhurt by rights issue fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market moved confidently yesterday into a week which will be
featured by important data on the UK economy as well as by trading
statements from a number of Britain's leading companies. While trading
levels remained unexciting, the blue chip stocks made further progress and
support for the second line issues took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index near to its
peak again.
The stock market's satisfaction with its progress towards the middle of its
current trading range was undimmed by the general expectation that today may
bring a rights issue from British Airways in the Pounds 500m-plus range,
perhaps accompanied by fund-raising in the brewery sector.
Nor did the market seem unduly dismayed by suggestions in the weekend press
that the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin, published today, will argue
strongly against any cut in base rates by its political masters. The focus
of attention this week is likely to be the disclosure on Thursday of the
latest statistics on UK unemployment, earnings and wage costs.
After drifting down in early trading to test the Footsie 2,840 area, the
market then steadied and, helped by a squeeze in stock index futures,
climbed steadily throughout the rest of the session. But the big players
were mostly on the sidelines.
The UK market was driven for much of the day by demand for blue chip
pharmaceutical stocks as the prolonged cloud thrown over the sector by
worries about the Clinton administration's plans for US medical care was
lifted somewhat by recommendations by a leading New York investment bank.
Trading in both sides of the new ICI group continued as fund managers
position themselves ahead of the formal demerger on the first day of June.
Among the domestically orientated of the London market, retail and store
shares found buyers as sector analysts began to look for good news on the
progress of the UK economic recovery when Marks and Spencer, the leading
high street retailer, reports progress today.
Although checked by a slow opening on Wall Street, where the Dow Average was
about two points off in London trading hours, the UK market closed very near
the best level of the day.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 2,858.1 for a gain on the
day of 11.1 points. The index has been at 2,867 in the past week in a
trading range believed to extend to around 2,980.
Seaq volume dipped to 533.7m shares from the 620m recorded on Friday, when
retail business remained just above the Pounds 1bn mark now seen as the
market's daily norm. At these volume levels, London's stockbrokers are
finding comfortable profits, while marketmakers also have room for
manouevre.
Non-Footsie business, boosted by heavy activity in a new issue stock,
constituted around 66 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total, against daily
averages of around 62 per cent.
From today, the Financial Times will be progressively changing the way it
calculates price/earnings ratios in the London Share Service pages to make
use of the earnings formula devised by a sub-committee of the Institute for
Investment Management &amp; Research (IIMR). Details, page 21 (UK companies).

FT  18 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation fears cloud
prospects for equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices finished mostly flat in moderate trading yesterday as
sentiment was dampened by concern about inflation, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 6.92 up at 3,449.93 and the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 was 0.81 firmer at 440.37, but declines led advances by 1,078
to 839 on the New York SE after volume of 227.6m shares. The Nasdaq
composite gained 1.59 at 677.96.
Following last week's worryingly strong April consumer and producer prices
data, the markets' focus of attention has shifted to bond yields, inflation
and monetary policy. Bond yields have risen considerably in the last few
days on the inflation fears, and speculation has intensified that the poor
inflation news has killed any chance of another easing of monetary policy by
the Federal Reserve.
Even worse, concern is growing that, if inflation continues its upward climb
over the next few months, the Fed may be forced to raise interest rates to
slow the pace of economic activity. Such a move would be bad for bonds, and
for equities, which have been helped hugely by extremely low domestic
interest rates.
These concerns cast a cloud over trading yesterday, subduing interest in
stocks generally. Volume was relatively light throughout the day, and prices
rarely moved from their opening levels. Otherwise, the main focus of
attention was on individual sectors.
Drug shares, which have fluctuated wildly in recent weeks, enjoyed an upturn
yesterday, buoyed by reports that President Clinton's healthcare reform team
will recommend that the government set guidelines for drug prices, and not
legally binding price controls.
The reports lifted the entire sector. Pfizer appreciated Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 71 5/8 , Merck Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 , Schering-Plough
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 66 3/8 and Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 43 3/4 , all in active trading.
Time Warner moved ahead Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 35 in volume of 5.9m shares
after the company announced an agreement with US West in which the regional
telecommunications group will buy 25 per cent of Time Warner's cable and
entertainment operations for Dollars 2.5bn. US West was steady at Dollars 41
1/8 .
Airline issues took another hammering amid fresh concern about the effect on
industry earnings of the latest air fare war. Delta declined Dollars 1 to
Dollars 58 3/8 .
Rank Xerox fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 72 1/4 after warning that sales in
its core document processing business would be weak in the second quarter.
Kmart slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 22 1/2 on disappointing first-quarter
operating earnings.
Canada
TORONTO closed softer but above the day's worst as retreating gold issues
and the looming Ontario budget, scheduled to be revealed tomorrow, took the
steam out of recent gains. The TSE 300 index ended 20.8 off at 3,792.5 and
falls outpaced rises by 358 to 311 after reduced volume of 51m shares.
Bombardier, CDollars  5/8 easier at CDollars 10 7/8 , said it is preparing a
claim of about CDollars 450m relating to cost overruns incurred to complete
its Eurotunnel shuttle-train cars contract. It intends to pursue the claim

FT  18 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei easier as Hong
Kong puts on 1.7 per cent

SHARE PRICES fluctuated to end on a mixed note after investors bought
equities on dips, but late futures selling left the Nikkei average easier on
balance in light trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average was finally 91.36 off at 20,565.51, after setting a
day's high of 20,689.49 and low of 20,520.03. The Topix index of all first
section stocks finished at 1,611.25, up 5.54, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index firmed 2.54 to 1,243.57.
Volume languished at 330m shares, compared to Friday's 567m, and declines
narrowly outscored rises by 515 to 485, with 182 issues unchanged.
Brokers said buy orders from government-managed public funds supported
equity prices during the session, but that no specific sector or issue gave
a boost to the Nikkei average.
Investors expressed the hope that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which led
the market during its major advance in March, will settle above the Y1m
mark; a break through this level would have a positive effect on the market
and, in all likelihood, encourage a wave of fresh buying, brokers added. NTT
closed Y12,000 higher at Y997,000.
Meanwhile, most market participants are expected to stay on the sidelines in
the short term, in order to examine the agglomeration of company earnings
reports due to be released this week.
Foreign exchange considerations, too, are expected to keep institutional
investors cautious. Investors, in particular, are expected to study Friday's
April money supply data for any signs of economic recovery.
The banking sector drew active buying. Mitsubishi moved forward Y40 to
Y2,510, Daiwa Y30 to Y1,070 and Sumitomo Y20 to Y2,010.
Motor issues gained a little ground: Toyota appreciated Y10 to Y1,700 and
Honda firmed Y10 to Y1,420.
Telecommunications equipment manufacturers eased. NEC finished Y10 softer at
Y1,030 and Fujitsu Y13 lower at Y792.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 38.27 higher at 22,828.74 in volume of 16.0m
shares.
Roundup
STRONG performances featured among the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG finished sharply higher on growing optimism about the resumption
of meetings of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. The Hang Seng index
climbed 118.83, or 1.7 per cent, to a record close of 7,124.12. Turnover
amounted to HKDollars 5.4bn.
Blue chips reaped the biggest gains, with HSBC Holdings adding HKDollars
1.50 at HKDollars 72, followed by Cheung Kong, which gained 60 cents at
HKDollars 27.60. Jardine Matheson was another strong performer, rising
HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 56.
AUSTRALIA slipped towards the close as gold shares retreated following lower
world commodity prices. The All Ordinaries index lost 11.6 to 1,686.9, while
the golds index declined 28.7 to 1,723.3. Turnover came to ADollars 305.8m.
In the resources sector, BHP receded 6 cents to ADollars 13.90 and CRA shed
20 cents to ADollars 13. Western Mining eased 5 cents to ADollars 5.28.
Among specialist gold stocks, Placer Pacific dipped 2 cents to ADollars 2.55
and Plutonic 20 cents to ADollars 4.70.
ANZ declined 6 cents to ADollars 3.54 after reporting slightly disappointing
interim results last Friday.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its gains of last week by a marginal 0.36 in the
composite index to 720.36. There was selected foreign buying of blue chip
stocks, but turnover contracted to MDollars 1.70bn from MDollars 1.93bn.
MANILA gathered upward pace, the index rising 11.31 to 1,616.04 in turnover
of 555m pesos. An improvement in San Miguel 'B' shares, up 2 pesos at 127
pesos, helped to support the market.
TAIWAN was disappointed that the central bank did not cut interest rates
over the weekend as had been anticipated. The weighted index lost 105.42, or
2.3 per cent, at 4,460.11 in TDollars 23.9bn turnover.
Among the weakest spots, Acer fell TDollars 1.10 to TDollars 24.70 and China
Steel TDollars 1.10 to TDollars 21.10.
SEOUL was stronger on bargain hunting following recent weakness. The index
put on 11.79 at 717.17 in turnover of Won513bn. Financial issues performed
well, with Commercial Bank of Korea up Won370 to Won10,000.
SINGAPORE lost ground on profit-taking after its record-breaking run last
week. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 17.12 to 1,846.27.
Sembawang Shipyard, which was among the leaders in the past week, closed 40
cents down at SDollars 12.60 in volume of 1.8m shares.
BOMBAY opened higher but closed the session sharply lower after investors
took profits following recent gains. The BSE index settled 56.53 off at
2,300.99.
NEW ZEALAND showed a good performance from Telecom ahead of today's annual
results, the shares gaining 4 cents at NZDollars 2.79. The NZSE-40 capital
index rose 7.44 to 1,588.34 in turnover of NZDollars 27m.

FT  18 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Pharmaceuticals drive Zurich
to new peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES were mixed as, market by market, investors looked at different
sectors, individual companies and other characteristics, writes Our Markets
Staff.
ZURICH broke through the SMI 2,200 level, the index ending 20.0 higher at an
all time high of 2,205.2, led by another strong performance in the
pharmaceuticals sector. Ms Susan Haylock, of NatWest Securities in London,
said that investors were realising that their worst fears about the
potential impact of President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform in the US
were unlikely to be realised.
Ciba-Geigy registered shares were the day's most active issue, rising SFr8
to SFr634. Roche certificates added SFr70 to SFr4,590.
Against the trend, Oerlikon-Buhrle bearers shed SFr5 to SFr520 as the group
said that losses at its holding company would prevent it from paying a
dividend on its 1993 results.
PARIS fell back with many investors unwilling to take positions ahead of the
long weekend - the bourse will be closed on Thursday and Friday. The CAC-40
index slipped 16.02 to 1,835.72 in moderate turnover of FFr2.2bn.
There was speculative interest in BNP, a privatisation candidate, after it
announced that it was to nominate as chairman the present head of CCF, who
oversaw that group's privatisation in 1987. BNP CI's rose FFr17 to FFr548
while CCF dropped FFr2.50 to FFr230.
BSN shed FFr15 to FFr874 ahead of today's first quarter sales figures which,
some analysts forecast, could show a 6-7 per cent drop over the same 1992
period.
AMSTERDAM saw a heavy fall in Heineken which some analysts attributed to
disappointing results from UK brewers, and reaction to Spanish devaluation
given its exposure to that market. The shares lost Fl 4.20 to Fl 179.60.
The CBS Tendency index eased 1.0 to 106.5. KLM fell Fl 1.30 to Fl 25.60 on
weekend press reports that the airline might report sharply lower earnings
when it publishes its figures for the year to end-March next month.
MILAN made a mixed start to the June account although privatisation
candidates put in a strong showing as the market gave a broad welcome to the
appointment of Mr Romano Prodi as the chairman of Iri, the state holding
company. The Comit index rose 0.56 to 539.55.
Hopes of a quick sale helped Credito Italiano L79 higher to L2,927, as the
share traded ex rights worth L85 a share.
Fiat was steady at the start, adding L1 to fix at L6,551 before sliding 3
per cent to L6,350 after hours.
Olivetti fell L34 to fix at L1,350 ex-rights, before subsiding further to
L1,315 on the kerb. Analysts said that the share price had taken the L903bn
rights issue in its stride, and that weekend news that Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, the chairman, had admitted that the company paid bribes to
political parties had had little effect.
FRANKFURT went through the motions, trading narrowly in a thin market as the
DAX index eased 6.63 to 1,627.88. Turnover fell from DM6.3bn to DM4.7bn.
Deutsche Bank was the active stock among DAX constituents, rising DM3.80 to
DM698.50 ahead of Wednesday's dividend payment and following a
recommendation from brokers James Capel.
The laggard in banks was Dresdner, ex a DM12 dividend and down a net DM5.30
to DM374.20 after the Capel sell recommendation in last week's quarterly
review of the German market. Capel liked banks in general, as interest rate
beneficiaries, along with insurances and high yielders.
MADRID saw profit-taking after last week's devaluation, and some caution
ahead of today's Maastricht vote in Denmark. The general index closed 0.93
lower at 252.96.
Banks, strong last week on interest rate sensitivity, mostly fell, BBV
losing Pta95 to Pta3,070 and Santander Pta130 to Pta5,490. Utilities were
mixed after last week's belated response, but Sevillana dropped Pta22 at
Pta428.
BRUSSELS edged lower in quiet conditions ahead of today's Danish referendum
and the Bel-20 index slipped 2.58 to 1,212.45. Against the trend, Petrofina
added BFr190 or 2.3 per cent to BFr8,420 on optimism for the 1993 earnings
outlook after Friday's annual shareholders' meeting.
HELSINKI fell on the threat of labour conflict in the country's export
sector starting on Wednesday, the HEX index closing 14.15, or 1.2 per cent
lower at 1,150.71 after an earlier fall of about 2 per cent. Turnover was
lower than usual at FM70.1m.
ISTANBUL edged lower as profits were again taken after last Thursday's
record close. The 75-share index eased 46.1 to 8,229.91 with Sunday's
election of Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel as president already discounted
by the market. WARSAW's WIG index eased by 22.0 to 2,541.6 in record
turnover of 353.3bn zloty, up from 302bn on Friday. The WIG has previously
risen by a phenomenal 96 per cent in just over a month, from 1,310.7 on
April 8 to 2,563.6 on May 13.
Turnover has also shown a marked increase over the period, from between 30bn
zloty and 70bn zloty in the first week of April.

FT  18 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Devaluation sets scene for higher
Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's 8 per cent devaluation of the peseta last Thursday provided a spur
to equity prices in Madrid last week, while the soaring gold price
underpinned the advance seen in Johannesburg.
Mr Sushil Wadhwani, director of UK and European equity strategy at Goldman
Sachs, comments that the peseta devaluation is good news for Spanish
equities over the medium term for four reasons:
It has allowed interest rates to fall, particularly important because Spain
is one of Europe's most interest rate-sensitive markets.
Since the peseta has now fallen by more than 20 per cent since last autumn,
foreign investors may find the market attractive on the assumption that
there is little further currency risk. Furthermore, foreign investors had
been deterred by the possibility of a new tax on short term speculative
flows which now looks extremely unlikely.
The devaluation provides competitive advantage for industry, although the
direct benefits to quoted companies are relatively modest because of foreign
currency debt.
The likely improvement in trade performance will make Spain's recession less
deep.
Mr Wadhwani believes that the market could rise by at least 7 to 8 per cent,
although he cautions that after the initial euphoria, investors might focus
again on uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming elections. 'While the ride
to rather higher levels could be a bumpy one, it remains our favourite
European market on a 12-month view.'
Hopes that the bullion price would breach Dollars 370 an ounce supported
Johannesburg.
One London-based analyst noted strong US and European demand last week for
South African gold shares which, he said, remained cheap on yield
considerations compared with their North American counterparts. He added
that the sector's latest quarterly results had been good and that the
outlook for the current quarter was also positive.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Money Markets: BoE bulletin awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING interest rate fut-ures declined yesterday as dealers took the view
that the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin, due out today, will take a
firm line against allowing inflation to rise, writes James Blitz.
Sterling's strong performance on the foreign exchanges last month meant that
the April producer prices showed a fairly low level of underlying inflation.
However, the Bank is this week expected to stamp down on suggestions that
the government's recent political difficulties will bring another interest
rate cut.
The June short sterling contract reflected those expectations, opening 5
basis points down at 93.89 yesterday morning. It later edged up to close at
93.91 as sterling performed fairly strongly against the D-Mark on the
currency markets.
The three-month sterling deposit rate firmed slightly yesterday amid similar
expectations, finishing at 6 1/16 per cent compared with a previous close of
6 per cent.
That rise in three-month cash came in spite of a cheap flow of daily funds.
The overnight lending rate fell as low as 3 per cent at one stage, following
a shortage of Pounds 1.35bn.
If yesterday's dealing was quiet, it was probably because dealers are
waiting for a raft of data due out later this week, including the
unemployment figures and the retail prices index.
That mood of expectation also dominated in Europe, where dealers were
waiting for the Bundesbank council meeting which, this week, is due tomorrow
because of the German holiday on Thursday.
The outlook for German rates this week is very mixed. Dealers are
anticipating another 25 basis-point cut in the discount rate, and there has
been some talk of the rate coming down by  1/2 percentage point.
Call money edged higher yesterday, touching 8 per cent and reflecting the
tight conditions that remain in the German cash market following a
significant net drain of funds last week. There are some expectations of a
rise in the repo rate.
Euromark futures were slightly weaker, reflecting that mood. The June
contract closed at 92.84, down 3 basis points on the day. The June Pibor
contract, however, finished 4 basis points firmer at 92.68.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rallies at London close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR rallied sharply against the D-Mark in late European trading
yesterday amid increasing speculation that Denmark would vote 'yes' to the
Maastricht treaty in its referendum today and that the Bundesbank would
reduce short-term interest rates tomorrow, writes James Blitz.
In recent weeks, expectations that the Danes could reject the Maastricht
treaty have led to some inflows into the D-Mark and the Swiss franc. But a
raft of opinion polls in recent days has underlined that, this time, the
Danes will probably ratify the treaty, making the D-Mark less of a safe
haven in Europe.
The latest opinion poll showed the 'yes' vote at 50 per cent and the 'no'
vote at 32 per cent, a far better performance by the pro-treaty lobby than
was the case a year ago. Mr Christian Dunis, an economist at Chemical Bank
in London, said the Maastricht treaty was increasingly looking like a
non-event.
At the same time, there was speculation that the Bundesbank would lower its
discount rate by as much as  1/2 percentage point this week, following last
week's larger than expected reduction in the repo rate to 7.60 per cent.
The Bundesbank went out of its way last week to calm down expectations of
another cut in interest rates. However, a 25 basis-point reduction in the
discount rate already appears to have been discounted by dealers at the very
least.
A meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, due tomorrow, has
also been the cause of speculation that the US central bank may lean towards
tightening interest rate policy soon.
Amid all of these factors, the dollar rose at the end of the day, peaking at
DM1.6170 and closing in London at DM1.6160, up nearly  1/2 pfennig on
balance. In New York it eased back to end at DM1.6140.
Within Europe, the D-Mark weakened slightly against several currencies as
dealers awaited tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting.
The French franc ended rather stronger against the German currency, at
FFr3.366 from a previous close of FFr3.373. One factor helping the French
currency higher was the Bank of France's decision not to leave interest
rates unchanged at what is now a once-a-week intervention in the money
markets.
Sterling closed higher, at DM2.4775 from a previous DM2.4650, as dealers
awaited today's quarterly inflation report from the Bank of England. The
assumption in the market was that the Bank would take a hawkish line on
inflation following suggestions that the UK government might cut base rates
again to help it out of its political difficulties.
The Italian lira was also firm against the D-Mark, in what was seen as a
belated response to a comment made last week by Mr George Soros, the
currency speculator, that Italian capital markets were worth investing in.
The lira ended at L914.9 from a previous L918.1.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexico seen buying more US meat
under Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US LIVESTOCK farmers will boost their exports of meat and animal products to
Mexico significantly if the North American Free Trade Agreement is ratified,
a Texas University study predicts.
At a time of fierce debate in the US over who will gain and who will lose
under the ambitious agreement, a team of farm economists at the Texas A &amp; M
University predicts a five-fold increase in beef and veal exports from the
US to Mexico over the decade ahead, with a three-fold rise in pork sales and
a doubling in poultry exports.
Exports of livestock products like hides, dairy products and fats would also
increase, with US grain farmers selling an additional 430,000 tonnes of
grain as poultry and cattle feed.
In the past, Mexico's farm sector has been heavily protected from foreign
competition, mostly by non-tariff barriers. As a result, imports are
comparatively small - for example, barely more than 1 per cent of beef
consumed in Mexico is imported.
Liberalisation under the Nafta is expected to provide a double benefit to US
livestock farmers - not only will barriers to their exports fall but rising
standards of living in Mexico are forecast to boost meat consumption
significantly.
US farmers already account for 85 per cent of Mexico's livestock and meat
product imports, with exports valued at Dollars 558m in 1990. The
preferential access under the Nafta is expected to raise this share to 90
per cent.
The US has maintained a large surplus in its trade in livestock products
over the past decade, rising from Dollars 137m in 1980 to Dollars 200m in
1990, the study shows. Live animal exports to Mexico peaked at Dollars 163m
in 1989, accounting for almost one fifth of the US total.
The study assumes meat prices in Mexico will fall by 5 per cent as a result
of the Nafta, with incomes rising by 5 per cent. It estimates that this will
boost US beef and veal exports from 26,000 tonnes in 1990 to 129,000 tonnes
by the end of the decade, with pork up from 18,000 to 63,000 tonnes, poultry
up from 44,000 to 113,000 tonnes, and mutton and lamb up from 8,000 to
12,000 tonnes.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin producing countries in
quandary over languishing prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS OF the Association of Tin Producing Countries finished a meeting
here at the weekend confused about what action to take to try to shore up
world tin prices and prevent further hardship in the industry.
The association groups Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria,
Thailand and Zaire, together accounting for about 60 per cent of world tin
production. In 1981 tin was fetching between MDollars 32 (USDollars 12) and
MDollars 34 a kilogram on the Kuala Lumpur tin market; they are now
languishing close to the MDollars 14-a-kilogram level.
In 1985 the International Tin Council's buffer stock operations collapsed
and more than 100,000 tonnes of stockpiled tin was released on to the
market. The industry has never recovered.
In 1987 the ATPC introduced an export quota scheme to try to control world
supply and bolster prices. But prices have refused to rise. Because of
continued low prices members exported a total of 76,578 tonnes last year -
12.1 per cent below the total amount allowed within the scheme.
At the same time world tin stocks have increased. The association estimates
that world tin stocks stood at 40,000 tonnes at the end of March 1993, up
from 38,200 tonnes at the end of last year. Originally it had been hoped to
bring global stocks down to 20,000 tonnes by the end of 1993.
There is widespread frustration at the situation. Mr Redzwan Sumun, the
ATPC's executive secretary, said that members were now debating whether it
was worthwhile carrying on with the export quota scheme. 'The stock level is
nowhere near our estimates. . . it makes our export curbs meaningless.'
The association has put forward various reasons for the continued depressed
state of the tin market. The recession in several industrialised countries
has resulted in a big drop in demand: in 1991 global tin demand fell by more
than 14,000 tonnes. The ATPC says demand was reduced further last year -
from an estimated 176,000 tonnes in 1991 to 172,000 tonnes.
Meanwhile a number of countries not in the ATPC - Peru, Burma, Vietnam and
Portugal - have been increasing their exports. The former Soviet Union,
until recently a large tin importer, is desperate for foreign exchange and
has become a tin exporter.
The problems of the tin market have also been aggravated by growing Chinese
exports.
China and Brazil are now the world's two top tin producers. While not ATPC
members, both countries have agreed to observe quotas set by the
organisation: Brazil was set an export quota of 24,000 tonnes last year,
while China was allotted 15,000 tonnes. The ATPC says Brazil's tin exports
were 19,900 tonnes last year - nearly 30 per cent below its quota.
'Only China was estimated to have exported in excess of the agreed amount,'
says the ATPC. Exactly how much tin China is now exporting is not clear; it
refuses either to confirm or deny that it is breaking its quota. But some
ATPC members estimate that China exported more than 30,000 tonnes of tin
last year.
'China is one of the main causes of low tin prices,' says a metals trader.
'It produces at costs well below countries like Malaysia and doesn't seem to
care too much about the general state of the market.'
The US is the other focus of discontent among the tin producing countries.
The US Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is selling off increasing amounts of
its substantial tin stockpile. The ATPC says that the DLA sold 6,200 tonnes
in 1991 and 8,800 tonnes last year.
Tin producers claim that such disposals are doing further damage to the tin
market. The ATPC is urging the DLA to enter into a long-term disposals
programme to minimise market disruption. But traders say there are
indications that the DLA is intent on disposing of a further 12,000 tonnes
of tin this year.
There seems little hope for relatively high cost producers like Malaysia,
until recently the world's leading tin producer. The country's tin miners
say that present price levels mean that they are producing at a loss. The
industry has shrunk in recent years: last year Malaysia produced 14,339
tonnes of tin-in-concentrates, down from 20,710 tonnes a year earlier.
One of the country's biggest tin mining companies, Malaysia Mining
Corporation, announced earlier this month that it was pulling out of the
business. As a result the country's total production this year is likely to
fall to well under 10,000 tonnes.
The optimists say that as the industrialised world climbs out of recession
then tin demand is bound to increase and prices will rise. The pessimists
disagree: they say that even if demand increases, non-ATPC maverick miners
have shown they can make nonsense of efforts to control supplies.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: N Sea oil price slide continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil prices fell a further 10 cents yesterday, adding to a 60-cent
downturn since the middle of last week as negative sentiments reasserted
themselves amongst traders. The price of North Sea Brent crude for July
delivery slipped back to Dollars 18.40 a barrel yesterday from Dollars 18.48
on Friday.
The market has been kept in broad equilibrium for the past month as
pessimistic and optimistic reports have tended to cancel each other out
without affecting the price. But traders have adopted a more gloomy tone in
the past few days while demand has remained erratic.
Some traders are beginning to doubt the strength of the US recovery and are
becoming uncertain about oil demand in the peak driving season - the summer
months.
At the same time news last week of Kuwait's plans to push for a higher quota
at the next meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
led to fears that Opec's current production discipline could be jeopardised.
Some North Sea platforms will be shutting down in the next few months for
summer maintenance programmes. This can lead to temporary tightness in the
Brent market and can push prices higher. But higher prices will also depend
on increasing demand.
Refiners have been in the market buying supplies in recent weeks, but their
purchasing patterns have been erratic and are currently not strong enough to
keep prices above Dollars 19 a barrel.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China appears ready to remove
barriers against foreign miners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER YEARS of procrastination, China at last appears willing to begin
dismantling nationalistic barriers against foreign involvement in its mining
sector, including gold prospects.
Participants in a conference held in Beijing last week, among them
representatives of some of the world's biggest mining houses, came away
convinced that change was in the wind; although it was unclear how quickly
China would replace existing legislation.
Mining company representatives, used to sterile discussion on the need for
liberalisation, were surprised when, on the eve of the conference, Chinese
officials, responding to international pressure, halved the rate of gold
royalties in draft legislation.
While the proposed 10 per cent royalty rate is still outrageously high by
international standards, especially compared with those in developing
countries where rates of between 2 and 3 per cent apply, apparent Chinese
flexibility was regarded as a good sign.
Chinese regulations at present ban foreign companies from involvement in the
exploitation of gold reserves, but China is anxious to secure capital and
perhaps more important the advanced minerals treatment technology required
to exploit this lucrative area.
Mr Graham Reid, a senior manager of CRA of Australia, said that although the
Chinese had a 'fair way to go' in their efforts to attract foreign miners,
he had found attitudes displayed by officials of the Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources 'very encouraging'.
He noted that Chinese officials responded with alacrity to suggestions by
the foreign participants, who included representative of Newmont Mining of
the US, Cominco of Canada, De Beers of South Africa, and BHP of Australia;
although he also observed that substantial change to legislation would
require the approval of the Chinese parliament.
Among the more positive developments was a Chinese undertaking to study a
proposal that the country should adopt a model 'contract of work' allowing
prospective mining ventures to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, thus
facilitating much greater flexibility.
Mr Reid, CRA's general manager for exploration, noted that this approach was
operating successfully in parts of Africa and in Indonesia  - a contract of
work's main appeal is that it overrides existing laws - where it had proved
an effective means of 'kick starting' mining exploration and development.
Chinese mining officials have made it clear that they are under pressure to
boost activity in the mining sector, which is lagging far behind the rest of
the economy. China's economic boom has heightened demand for a whole range
of minerals, both ferrous and non-ferrous.
Mr Reid said that foreign miners would, however, proceed cautiously and
would want to be sure that any new mining regulations were consistent with
domestic laws. 'Western mining companies like laws that are drafted with
particularity and clarity,' he observed.
Western miners were also likely to insist that disputes be settled by
international arbitration and not within the Chinese system. This was a
concept that was fairly alien to the Chinese.
Foreign mining representatives also pressed the Chinese last week on the
need to make available larger areas for exploration, but at the same time
urged regulations that would oblige exploration companies to surrender
prospective areas that were not being exploited, thus ensuring 'turnover'.
Other issues that preoccupied the conference, jointly organised by the
United Nations, included access to foreign exchange, and guaranteed
unlimited rights to export product. The Chinese were also pressed to clarify
a tax regime that might apply to new mining ventures

FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rhodium market plunge
undermines platinum metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN platinum group metals producers face having to cut output and
shelve expansion projects because of the collapse in rhodium's price,
suggests Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group.
The South Africans, who last year produced 73.5 per cent of the western
world's rhodium supply, are unlikely to be compensated for the steep drop in
revenue from rhodium by the recent surge in the price of platinum, which has
been buoyed up by activity in the gold market.
Mr Keith Green, operations director, precious metals division, for Johnson
Matthey, said that in 1990 rhodium brought the South African platinum group
metal producers revenue totalling USDollars 2.2bn. This year JM projects
that rhodium revenue will fall to Dollars 1.7bn.
Worries about production problems at Rustenburg Platinum's new refinery
drove the price of rhodium, an essential material for some automotive
catalysts, up from Dollars 1,280 in November 1989 to a record Dollars 7,000
a troy ounce in July 1990. Consequently, in 1990 rhodium contributed 45 per
cent more revenue to the South African platinum group metal producers than
did platinum.
About 87 per cent of rhodium is used for automotive anti-pollution
catalysts. High prices and weakening car sales caused the Japanese
automotive companies in 1992 to use rhodium from strategic stocks
accumulated over previous years and they virtually withdrew from the market.
'Industrial consumers also had surplus rhodium as a result of thrifting and
recovery programmes put into operation after the escalation of the rhodium
price in 1990,' JM points out in its annual survey of the platinum group
metals market.
Meanwhile, South African mines attempted to maximise revenues and their
total rhodium output rose by 58,000 ounces to 278,000 ounces. This
outweighed a reduction in Russian deliveries to the West, left total western
supplies up by 30,000 ounces at 378,000 ounces and pushed the market into a
surplus of 54,000 ounces.
Rhodium's price was back at Dollars 1,850 at the end of 1992. It retreated
to Dollars 1,400 an ounce in March this year, since when it has fallen below
Dollars 800.
Mr Green said at the launch of JM's platinum metals survey in London that it
took only a very small surplus of rhodium to depress prices. South African
producers were having to 'run fast to stand still' and they faced
considerable financial pain if platinum remained about Dollars 360 an ounce
and rhodium Dollars 900 an ounce.
Japanese car producers also dug into their stocks of platinum last year and
this caused a dip in purchases by the world automotive industry, from 1.56m
ounces to 1.55m. Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of the annual survey, estimated
that the Japanese car makers had reduced their platinum stocks from 18
months of supply to about six months.
Other points from the survey were:
Demand for platinum last year fell by 6 per cent to 3.8m ounces, mainly
because of lower investment and industrial purchases.
Supplies of newly mined platinum fell 8 per cent to 3.82m ounces following a
sharp drop in Russian sales. Supply exceeded demand for the third successive
year, by 20,000 ounces, down from 120,000 ounces in 1991.
South African supplies were stable at 2.75m ounces. Russian shipments to the
West fell by nearly a third to 750,000 ounces.
Platinum's price last year averaged Dollars 360 an ounce, down from Dollars
376 in 1991. This year it is likely to range between Dollars 330 and Dollars
390 an ounce, 'unless an unexpected event occurs'.

GOLD was fixed at Dollars 369.25 a troy ounce on the London bullion market
yesterday afternoon, its highest level since December 1991 and up from the
morning setting of Dollars 367.85. Dealers said the market had consolidated
last week's gains and was expected to move higher. They noted that it was an
absence of selling more than steady buying that was underpinning prices.
Some had been expecting producers to sell into the market once it came close
to Dollars 370, and have been puzzled by their absence so far. Gold could
well break through the Dollars 370 barrier sometime this week, dealers said,
which could then trigger further rises on option-related buying. BASE METAL
prices closed above earlier lows on the LME, ending mixed, as markets
pondered the next move. Dealers said fresh losses were seen in zinc, nickel
and lead, while copper at one stage appeared to be heading back towards
recent 5 1/2 -year lows. Sentiment is fragile, and when selling emerges,
buyers are conspicuous by their absence. Technical factors helped to brake
the falls after the heavy losses sustained on Friday.

EUROPE'S high-yielding government bond markets continued to rally on
expectations that Denmark will vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty and
thereby help to revive moves towards economic and monetary convergence in
Europe.
Bond market participants said some investors were adopting a 'wait-and-see'
strategy ahead of today's Danish referendum, and the Bundesbank Council's
meeting tomorrow.
The Spanish government bond market continued to rally following last
Thursday's devaluation of the peseta and Friday's interest rate cuts.
The Bank of Spain lowered its money market overnight rate from 12.77 per
cent to 12.00 per cent yesterday, raising hopes of further cuts in the
central bank's key interest rates.
The Meffsa contract quoted on the Spanish futures exchange jumped from 87.79
to 88.43, and in the cash market, five-year bonds slightly outperformed the
10-year area, lifted by healthy foreign investor buying. The 10-year, 10.90
per cent bond yielded 10.99 per cent against 11.11 per cent at the previous
close.
ITALIAN government bonds rallied on a combination of convergence hopes,
expectations of good inflation figures, and a favourable L1,500bn bond
auction.
The Liffe futures contract rose from 98.39 to 98.65 as net yields fell at
yesterday's 10-year BTP auction from 11.09 per cent to 10.71 per cent.
The tranche of March 1, 2003 BTPs, paying a coupon of 11.50 per cent, were
assigned at a price of 97.45, compared with 95.30 at the previous tranche of
the paper on May 3.
THE ECU bond market closed about a quarter point higher on positioning ahead
of Denmark's Maastricht vote. Analysts said theoretical Ecu bond yields were
already approaching 30 basis points below the actual composite yield as the
market discounted a Yes vote.
ACTIVITY in the German bond market was muted ahead of today's Danish
referendum and German repo result, and tomorrow's Bundesbank council
meeting, dealers said.
The Liffe bund futures contract traded down from its high of 94.78 to a low
of 94.54 before short-covering helped to push the contract up to 94.72 by
late afternoon.
Dealers warned that a Danish vote in favour of European economic and
monetary union would probably prompt further switching out of bunds and into
the higher-yielding European bond markets.
FRENCH government bonds made small gains, outperforming the German market
with the result that yield spreads narrowed even further - from 39 basis
points to 37 basis points in the 10-year area.
On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the June bond futures contract ended
at 117.44, up 0.10.
THE UK government bond market opened on a weak note but rallied later to
make up most of Friday's losses.
The gilt market lost half a point on Friday, with prices pulled down by the
Bank of England's auction announcement. The Bank plans to auction stock in
the 10 to 15- year area, and further details of the specific stock, coupon
and amount will be announced today.
In the futures market, the futures contract rose from 103.07 to 103.23 in
relatively light volume, while cash bonds slipped back slightly in the
auction stock area.
Dealers expect the gilt market to be distracted by the slew of economic data
and news due to be released this week, as well as the Danish referendum
result and Bundesbank meeting.
THE JAPANESE government bond market continued to take its cue from the stock
market, with bond prices ending lower as the Nikkei average closed up 91.36
points at 20,565.51.
Bond dealers said the bond market's weakness also reflected supply concerns.
Last week saw some local government bond issuance, while this week dealers
expect utilities to tap the market, and the regular government bond auction
is due to take place next week.
The September futures contract opened at 107.13 and reached a high of 107.22
before ending the day at the low price of 106.84. Prices weakened further in
London trading with the contract moving to 106.75.
THE US Treasury yield curve flattened yesterday after longer-dated prices
fell amid continued concern about the outlook for inflation and monetary
policy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at
101 15/16 , yielding 6.966 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 23/32 , to yield 4.009 per cent.
In the wake of last week's unexpectedly strong consumer and producer prices
figures, investors have become very nervous about inflation and how it might
affect the Fed's stance on monetary policy.
Although analysts said that policy was likely to remain unchanged, at least
until more prices data was available, investors fear that the apparent
resurgence of inflation may force the Fed to raise interest rates to slow
the pace of economic activity. It was this fear that was behind the drop in
longer-dated prices yesterday.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Lesser to retire as
vice-chairman of Bankers Trust
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust, the New York banking and securities trading group, announced
yesterday that its vice-chairman, Mr Edward Lesser, will retire at the end
of the year. His departure follows the restructuring of the division he led
for the best part of a decade.
Under the restructuring, the business focus of the cash management,
securities processing and investment management operations (known
collectively as Profitco) run by Mr Lesser was reoriented towards customer,
not product, groupings. Originally, the reorganisation involved setting up
seven client groups, under the new name of Global Assets.
That reorganisation, however, ran into early problems. The number of
customer groups was reduced to five, a move which led to the departure of
two managing directors, from the private banking and information services
areas. Then yesterday, Bankers Trust announced that the Global Assets and
the investment management groups would be consolidated with the funds
management division, into a new group called Global Investment Management.
Although Mr Lesser remained in charge of the division following its initial
restructuring, the changes led to speculation that he would step down from
the company.
Mr Lesser, 59, joined Bankers Trust in 1955. In 1984 he helped form Profitco
and was credited with the idea of turning the custodial and
information-processing businesses of the bank into profit centres in their
own right.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Belgium benefits from strong early
sales into Far East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW issue activity was subdued yesterday, ahead of today's Danish
referendum, but dealers expect the flow of deals to pick up if the Danes
vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty this time.
Among the borrowers said to be eyeing the Ecu market were the European
Investment Bank, the European Community, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Spain and
Italy.
The focus of attention yesterday was the Kingdom of Belgium's Dollars 500m
Eurobond due 1998, which benefited from strong early sales into the Far
East.
The issue, arranged by JP Morgan, was officially launched in London time,
but underwriters were alerted in advance, allowing sales to be made
throughout the Far Eastern trading day.
Belgium has been a rare visitor to the international markets in recent
years, which helped fuel demand for the issue. The pricing, at 21 basis
points above the five-year US Treasury yield, was considered fair for an
AA+/AA1 sovereign borrower.
Several underwriters said they had sold substantially more than their
allotments, while others said demand was strong but only in certain areas.
The improved performance of the dollar recently has encouraged interest in
three to five-year paper among certain investors.
A number of other dollar offerings are about to be made. Toyota Motor
Finance is expected to launch a Dollars 200m - Dollars 300m three-year deal
today, while the Asian Development Bank is preparing a Dollars 500m 10-year
issue via Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan.
In addition, Chubu Electric Power is said to be planning a swap-driven deal
in the Canadian dollar sector, though it may shift elsewhere if better
arbitrage opportunities are available.
Elsewhere, General Electric Capital Corporation launched a L150bn issue due
2000 via Deutsche Bank. The deal met firm demand, due to strong interest in
high-yielding currencies.

software project

<TEXT>
THE Chicago and New York Mercantile Exchanges have agreed to develop a
Dollars 15m software project to upgrade and standardise their trade-clearing
systems.
The project, which stops short of common clearing for the two exchanges,
will produce a state-of-the-art system that the exchanges hope will become a
standard throughout the world in the futures industry.
The planned system will, for the first time, allow each exchange to back up
the others' operations in the event of a calamity, a feature that has become
more urgent in the wake of the Chicago flood in 1992 and the World Trade
Center bombing in February. Both disasters disrupted US futures trading.
The CME and the Nymex are, respectively, the second and third-largest
futures exchanges in the US, after the Chicago Board of Trade.

<TEXT>
TWO leading players in the LDC debt market have stopped making a market to
other market makers, citing excessive inter-dealer activity in the sector by
comparison with other markets.
Merrill Lynch and ING New York both said they would continue making markets
to clients.
'We did not feel it was a necessary function any more,' said Mr Scott
Gordon, chief trader at ING in New York. Instead, the New York office will
concentrate on managing its own portfolio and trading with investors. The
London office will continue a full market-making service.
Merrill said it would continue making a market to a narrow selection of
other market makers, but would 'focus more on customer flows'. The decision
affects trading in London and New York. According to traders, there are
about 10 market makers in the sector.

Siam City Cement, Thailand's second-biggest cement producer, said foreign
exchange profits and increased cement sales sharply raised its first-quarter
earnings, Reuter reports.
Siam said net after-tax profit rose to Bt620.2m, or Bt3.18 a share, from
Bt299.5m, or Bt1.54 a year ago. It said the strong results could also be
attributed to a corporate decision to delay taking depreciation and interest
payments charges for its fifth cement kiln.

<TEXT>
BANGKOK Bank, Asia's largest regional bank outside Japan, reported a jump in
first-quarter net profits to Bt3.7bn (Dollars 148m) from Bt2.4bn in 1992.
Analysts in Bangkok said that although the figures included extraordinary
gains, notably from the Bt100m sale of land on the Chao Phraya river in
Bangkok, the bank's forecast of a 20 per cent profits growth this year looks
easily achievable.
Net profits in 1992 rose to Bt10.54bn from Bt7.3bn in 1991.
In spite of increased competition and an economic slowdown the Bangkok Bank
continues to benefit from a wide spread between deposit and lending interest
rates and its dominance in corporate lending.
The bank accounts for around a quarter of total deposits in Thailand. The
spread between what it charges prime borrowers and its six-month savings
rate is now 3.75 per cent.
First-quarter outstanding loans totalled Bt599bn in the quarter, up from
Bt520bn last year.
The bank is trying to reduce its reliance on corporate lending by
emphasising high margin retail lending and investment banking. Non-interest
revenue rose to Bt2.3bn from Bt1.7bn.

Japanese life and non-life insurers, which announce their 1992-93 results
next month, will disclose problem loans for the first time, although on a
much smaller scale than those of Japanese banks, for the year 1992-93,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Nippon Life Insurance, Japan's biggest life insurer, said it may have about
Y20bn (Dollars 180m) in problem loans at end-March 1993, or about 0.2 per
cent of loans then outstanding.
Of these, Y5bn were in bad loans to clients who had gone bankrupt and Y15bn
in non-performing loans on which interest payments were in arrears for six
months or more.
The five big insurers, including Dai-ichi Mutual Life, Sumitomo Life, and
Nippon Life, each appear to have problem loans totalling less than Y50bn.

Sintokogio, Japan's leading maker of casting machines, announced its pre-tax
profits declined sharply for the financial year to March 1993.
Pre-tax profits dropped by 47.9 per cent from a year earlier on lower

eased by 17.6 per cent at 41.2bn.
The Nagoya-based company expected a sharp 58.8 per cent drop in its pre-tax

investment.
Sales are expected to decrease by 10.3 per cent to Y37bn this year.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nintendo ponders the threat to
its market dominance - An uncertain future for Japan's third-largest profits
earner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE sparsely-furnished head office of Nintendo in the traditional capital
city of Kyoto belies the success of Japan's third-largest profit earner.
There is nothing about the drab walls that line the corridors or the
nondescript furniture that sits in otherwise bare meeting rooms that gives
even a hint of the wealth the Japanese video games manufacturer has
generated.
This austerity seems characteristic of Nintendo's approach to business.
While the company is likely to have surpassed Matsushita, the world's
largest consumer electronics manufacturer, in terms of profits, it operates
with just 892 staff in Japan, compared with about 150,000 at Matsushita.
Nintendo is also sparing in its product range.
While its main competitor Sega is busy launching a new advanced games
machine, Nintendo has chosen to stay with its latest generation machine,
which it believes has more potential for generating profits.
It has a strategy of keeping costs and risks to a minimum by subcontracting
all manufacturing apart from some assembly work and testing.
This lean, mean strategy has yielded enviable results.
NRI, the research arm of Nomura Securities, forecasts Nintendo will report
non-consolidated pre-tax profits of Y167bn (Dollars 1.5bn), up 7 per cent
from Y156bn in 1991, when it announces its results this month. The figure
beats the Y102bn forecast for the year by Matsushita.
Profit per employee comes to roughly Y187m. And although Nintendo expects
capital expenditure for the year to be about Y10bn, it also has a cash pile
of Y289bn or 58 per cent of total assets.
It has built up a formidable presence in its home market, where it controls
about 95 per cent of the market by its own estimates, and overseas.
For a company that used to derive most of its income from selling playing
cards, that is a remarkable achievement.
While a low-cost structure helps, a better clue to Nintendo's prosperity may
lie in the formula for success it used in generating profits from playing
cards for nearly 100 years since it was founded by the great-grandfather of
Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's president, in 1889.
What Nintendo learnt in the card business was that entertainment value, or
software, is what differentiates one set of playing cards from another.
For example, by introducing cards with Disney characters on them, Nintendo
was able to create high demand among Japanese children. It has taken a
similar approach to its electronic games business.
Nintendo relies for the bulk of its revenues on just three money-spinning
machines: the Nintendo Entertainment System, the portable Game Boy and the
16-bit Super NES, and their software.
The reason why the company has done so well is because its software is so
much more entertaining than that of other video games manufacturers, says Mr
Tokio Sotani, managing director.
Nintendo's obsessive concern with software quality has led it to keep tight
control over the production of the software cartridges even though it has
more than 100 outside software producers writing games for it in addition to
its in-house software staff of 150.
Mr Sotani is confident that as long as there are attractive games to play
the popularity of video games will not wane.
However, the future, may not be so certain for Nintendo.
Recently it has had to combat a wave of bad publicity when it was discovered
that excessive use of video games machines could trigger fits among people
with a certain type of epilepsy. More worrying is the growing success of
Sega, its arch rival.
Overseas, Sega has won about 40 per cent of the market in both the US and
Europe. Sega beat Nintendo to the market with a games machine using CD-ROM
discs which can store far more information than conventional cartridges.
Sega has taken the lead in bringing games software directly into the home by
tying up with Time Warner and TCI, two of the largest US cable television
companies, to provide Sega video games on cable television.
Other competitors, including large consumer electronics companies such as
Matsushita, are piling into the video games market with product launches
expected this year.
'Competition is getting a bit tougher. But I haven't seen anything from
Nintendo that shows that they have done something to adapt to the new
environment,' says Mr Jeff Camp, industry analyst at Jardine Fleming.
Nintendo has yet to reveal plans for introducing CD-ROM games machines or
how it would act on its stated intention to use satellite broadcasting to
bring games into homes.
Nintendo's response to suggestions that it has been slow to adapt to a
changing market is outright contempt for competitors who rush to bring new
products to the market that neither consumers, nor they themselves, may be
ready for.
'We will not bring out CD-ROM until software producers are sufficiently
satisfied that they have come up with software that is truly different,'
says Mr Sotani.
However, even Nintendo accepts that it faces a challenge.
'I believe 1994 will be a turning point,' says Mr Hiroshi Imanishi, general
manager of the general affairs department.
Although outwardly confident of the company's ability to maintain its market
dominance in Japan, Nintendo managers are aware that the tide could turn in
the years ahead.
The nature of the video games market, according to Mr Yoshiyuki Kinoshita,
industry analyst at NRI, is that changes in market share come when there is
a shift to the next generation technology.
Such a shift to multi-media technology has begun with the use of CD-ROM.
Depending on which company is able to make the most of the new technology,
even Nintendo's total dominance in Japan could be challenged.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: San Miguel lifted by lower costs
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER interest charges enabled San Miguel, the Philippine food and beverage
conglomerate to lift first-quarter profits to 617m pesos (Dollars 24.7m),
Reuter reports from Manila.
The 1993 first-quarter income was about 5 per cent higher than its year ago
level of 589m pesos, the company said.
Consolidated net sales firmed slightly to 13.6bn pesos from 13.4bn pesos.
The company said a 34 per cent drop in interest costs as a result of
declining interest rates helped it post higher profit in spite of lower
income from operations. It was helped by an increased contribution from
affiliates, particularly Nestle Philippines.
San Miguel's income from operations eased 13 per cent to 1.3bn pesos in
January to March largely as a result of a decline in sales volumes because
of the effects of severe power shortages on the economy.
The company said improved operating efficiencies, particularly in beer and
soft drinks, cushioned the drop in sales volume.

United Airlines and USAir have agreed to extend the deadline for United's
purchase of USAir's Philadelphia-London route by 30 days, to June 14, writes
Our New York Staff.
United said that the extension would provide extra time to secure government
approval of the transaction. United signed an agreement with USAir in March
to buy the route with the intention of transferring it to Chicago.
Under the UK-US bilateral aviation agreement, United cannot operate services
from Chicago to London. But the airline hopes the switch will be approved
following US government clearance for British Airways to buy a 19.9 per cent
stake in USAir.

<TEXT>
Swedbank, the newly-merged savings bank group, reports a sharp reduction in
first-quarter losses, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Operating
deficit fell to SKr864m (Dollars 118m) from SKr2.94bn after loan losses of
SKr2.78bn against SKr4.63bn. The comparative figures represent one quarter
of 1992 totals.
A rising share of problem loans meant net interest income for the period
fell 8.1 per cent to SKr2.92bn and total income dropped to SKr3.90bn from
SKr4.01bn. However, a cost-cutting drive reduced operating expenses by 14
per cent to SKr1.99bn and helped the operating result before credit losses
to improve to SKr1.91bn from SKr1.69bn.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Xerox stock suffers after
chairman's warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
XEROX shares fell sharply yesterday after Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, warned
that second-quarter earnings in the company's core document processing
operations could drop below the Dollars 1.12-a-share level posted a year
ago.
However, he said he still expected full-year earnings for those operations
to show an increase on 1992.
Wall Street was surprised by the announcement and by the close Xerox shares
were down Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 72 1/4 in active trading. The opening was
delayed by a backlog of sell orders.
Mr Allaire said the earnings fall reflected fundamental changes in the
management of the company's document processing business, the realignment of
the US salesforce and continued weak economic conditions.
These factors had already affected first-quarter results, released last
month, which showed overall net income of Dollars 189m, or Dollars 1.77 a
share, against a loss of Dollars 529m, or Dollars 5.68, in the same period
last year when the company took accounting charges. Income from the document
processing business was Dollars 125m, or Dollars 1.12, against Dollars 103,
or 91 cents. Revenues were unchanged at Dollars 3.3bn.
Mr Allaire said yesterday that, after the second quarter, 'we expect sales
momentum to increase as we realise the benefits of the sales
reorganisation'.
His comments, in a conference with security analysts, were made in view of
the planned offering of 6m shares, announced in March, which the company
said would go ahead this summer.
Mr Walter Fitzgerald, an equity analyst with RAS Securities, said the stock
market was probably overreacting yesterday. The company's new products were
going well and, although European markets remained flat, it was on target,
he said.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: MGM cuts loss despite drop in
film revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY BENNALLACK-HART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METRO-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood studio taken over by Credit Lyonnais, its
French bank creditor, yesterday reported reduced first-quarter losses.
Net losses were Dollars 51.21m, against Dollars 87.4m a year earlier, on
lower revenues of Dollars 196m compared with Dollars 298.9m.
The net losses include extraordinary losses of Dollars 9.83m on repurchases
of debt during the quarter. As a result the company anticipates lower
interest costs in the future. Last year's first-quarter results included a
one-off charge of Dollars 33m related to changes in accounting for income
tax.
MGM said the results for the current period reflected a fall in feature film
revenues due to quarter-to-quarter differences in the timing of theatrical
releases and availability of product for home video and pay television
markets. Revenues in the feature films and television programming operations
dropped to Dollars 149.2m from Dollars 243.5m.
Theatre revenues fell to Dollars 46.87m from Dollars 55.37m, mainly due to
currency fluctuations. MGM said theatre operations remained profitable and
investment in multiplex theatres in Europe would continue.
Mr Alan Ladd and Mr Dennis Stanfill, co-chairmen, said the company had
'accelerated MGM's development and production activities with the support of
Credit Lyonnais'. They indicated, however, that these increased activities
would not be immediately reflected in the company's results, due to the long
lead times for development and production of feature films.

<TEXT>
Spar Aerospace, best known as Canada's space company, is making a determined
shift into commercial products, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
'We are not leaving the space business,' Mr John MacNaughton, president,
told the annual meeting in Toronto, 'but we can raise margins significantly
by concentrating more on satellite-based communications and remote sensing
systems.'
This means Spar will move away from the design and manufacture of
satellites, robotic and aviation systems, towards integrated communications
and information systems, he said. Recent acquisitions were designed to speed
the process.
Space-related business will be down to less than 50 per cent of Spar's
revenues by 1996.
Spar's first-quarter net profits slipped to CDollars 2.9m or 22 cents a
share, from CDollars 3m or 26 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars
116m against CDollars 104m.

ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the leading power engineering group, has improved
first quarter operating earnings by 1 per cent to Dollars 409m, writes Ian
Rodger from Zurich. It expects pre-tax profit for 1993 as a whole to be at
about the same level as last year's Dollars 1.11bn.
The group said the downturn in demand in Europe continued in the quarter,
putting pressure on prices and reducing volumes for several ABB businesses.
However, the depreciation of currencies in countries such as Sweden, where
the group has important operations, has created opportunities.
Indications of an economic recovery in North America have not yet shown up
in the group's new order figures, but orders from Asia continued to grow
well. New orders in the first quarter were down 3 per cent from a year
earlier but the order backlog at end-March was Dollars 29.4bn, up 11 per
cent.

<TEXT>
TELEFONICA de Argentina, the largest of the country's two privatised
telephone companies, has unveiled net profits of USDollars 143.7m for the
first half to March 1993 on sales of USDollars 853m.
This compares with first half net profits of USDollars 93.7m the year
before, on sales of USDollars 731.4m.
Argentina's telephone system has become hugely profitable following its
privatisation in 1990. In the financial year to September 1992, Telefonica
earned taxable profits 81 per cent ahead at USDollars 293.2m on sales 38 per
cent up at USDollars 1.58bn.
Telefonica, controlled and operated by the Spanish Telephone Company
Telefonica de Espana, holds a legal monopoly over services in the southern
half of Argentina.
Its smaller rival Telecom de Argentina, which is controlled and operated by
the French and Italian state companies, reported a 172 per cent rise in net
profits to USDollars 150.3m in the year to September 1992, while revenues
rose 36 per cent to USDollars 1.2bn.
Telefonica said it would invest USDollars 2.5bn over the next three years,
after investing USDollars 1.2bn in the two years since privatisation.
Telecom de Argentina plans investment of USDollars 3.3m for the same period.
Telefonica financed 80 per cent of the investment programme out of cash flow
and raised the rest from banks and the capital markets. The company is

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Firm Chinese foothold for
Pacific Dunlop / A look at an Australian conglomerate poised to increase its
investment in a boom region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Dunlop, the Australian conglomerate, is about to make a substantial
leap forward in its China business with the registration of a Shanghai-based
holding company to be known as Pacific Dunlop Holdings (China).
This would be only the third instance of a foreign company securing Chinese
approval to set up such a vehicle to oversee business in China which, in
Pacific Dunlop's case, is growing by leaps and bounds.
Mr Howard McDonald, head of Pacific Dunlop corporate affairs, said his
company planned to increase its investment in Asia to about ADollars 1bn
(USDollars 702m) by the end of the century from the present ADollars 500m.
Much of this additional investment will go to China where the company's
current stake is ADollars 120m.
'Our primary objective is to be a participant in China's growth as well as
establishing efficient sourcing for the Australian market for such items as
clothing and footwear,' said Mr McDonald.
China's powerful Ministry of Foreign Trade has approved the setting up of
the Pacific Dunlop holding company. Final approval, which rests with the
local Shanghai municipality, is expected to be a formality.
Pacific Dunlop's investments in China comprise nine factories. These include
two cable factories, a sock factory in Beijing, underwear-manufacturing
ventures in Guangdong province and in Shenzen, adjacent to Hong Kong, and a
shoe factory in Shanghai.
Mr McDonald said that at present rates of growth, China would in the next 10
years be supplying one-quarter of the world's textile requirements.
China-made underwear, for example, accounted for 45 per cent of the
Australian market, and Pacific Dunlop, through its Bonds and Holeproof
brands, had the lion's share.
Pacific Dunlop is also examining ways in which to become more involved in
food processing in China through its Pacific Brands Food Group. Among
options being considered are setting up manufacturing ventures in China and
increasing exports from Australia as Chinese consumer demand grows for such
items as dairy products and French fries.
The company's investment strategy in China dictates that it retain a
controlling 51 per cent interest in joint ventures. But, in fact, average
shareholding of its China-based enterprises ranges between 60 and 65 per
cent.
Pacific Dunlop's main requirement of its China partners is not a financial
contribution so much as 'on ground' support in selecting staff, securing
land for factory construction and, perhaps most important, procuring orders.
In the booming Shenzen economic development zone, Shenzen Olex Cables, a
Pacific Dunlop subsidiary, is a good example of this strategy. Olex's
partners are the China National Posts and Telecommunications Appliances
Corporation and the Shenzen Science and Industry Park Corporation, both of
which have 10 per cent of the local joint venture.
After a year of operation - production began in early 1992 - the factory is
producing near capacity at about 2,500km/day of telecommunications cable,
and is having no trouble disposing of the product in the Chinese market
where demand is almost insatiable. Annual requirements are estimated at
about 10m km of cable which takes traffic in both directions against local
production of 7m km.
But the requirement that Olex China, a ADollars 30m venture, import most of
its copper wire coupled with the continuing sharp depreciation of China's
currency, the yuan, is squeezing profits in a highly competitive market.
South Korea and Taiwan are big suppliers at low prices.
Other challenges facing managers at the Shenzen plant include intermittent
power blackouts - China's overburdened infrastructure has difficulties
coping with the economic boom - and a workforce that needs close supervision
in the absence of effective local Chinese middle-level management at this
early stage.
Olex managers also have to 'fly by the seat of their pants' in scheduling
production because Chinese consumers like to avoid longer-term contracts,
and demand for different types of cable tends to vary almost by the week.
'This is a very difficult way to operate a business,' observed an expatriate
manager.
But in spite of teething problems, Pacific Dunlop clearly regards the cable
business as a lucrative growth sector. Apart from its Shenzen and Tianjin
plants, it is planning a third. Olex China also recently opened a
representative office in Beijing.
Mr McDonald noted that Pacific Dunlop's China trading relationship stretched
back over a quarter of a century; and that both Mr John Gough, its chairman,
and Mr Philip Brass, its managing director, have been personally involved in
the China trade for much of that time. Mr Brass, in fact, is a member of the
mayor of Shanghai's business advisory committee.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Investor revolt in sleepy Canada
 -Companies are now listening to shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL meetings of Canadian companies, even the biggest and most troubled
ones, are invariably sleepy affairs. Shareholders ask few, if any,
questions.
With the exception of a handful of church groups, murmurings of dissent tend
to come from grumpy individuals rather than assertive institutional
investors. The most satisfying part of a meeting is often the lunch that
follows.
Such low-key politeness suits the style of Canada's notoriously clubby
business establishment. 'It's a different system here (from the US),' says
Mr Robert Sillcox, head of investments at the Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System (Omers), the country's second-biggest pension fund. 'We
tend to do things more quietly and behind closed doors.'
There is, however, unmistakable evidence that Canadian companies are
listening more closely these days to the corporate governance concerns of
minority shareholders.
In the past month or two alone, activist shareholders have made some
significant headway.
A torrent of criticism surrounding Royal Bank's pending purchase of the
operations of troubled Royal Trust has led to the trust's independent
directors launching their own review of the deal.
BCE, the country's biggest conglomerate, and Canadian Pacific, the transport
and resources group, both agreed prior to their recent annual meetings to a
change in rules to allow secret voting.
Earlier, Donohue, a Quebec forest products company, bowed to pressure from
outside shareholders by watering down a share-swap plan which entrenches the
control of its largest shareholder through multiple-vote shares. Donohue
also agreed to appoint independent directors to its board.
Mutual Life took the unusual step for a Canadian insurance company of
disclosing solvency ratios in the latest annual report. Trizec, North
America's biggest listed property developer, has promised to boost the
number of independent directors on its board, while TransCanada PipeLines
will soon separate the duties of chairman and chief executive.
Pressure for improved corporate governance is coming from several
directions. The financial problems of some of Canada's best-known companies
have made many investors restive.
A portfolio manager at one large investment management firm singles out the
empire controlled by Messrs Peter and Edward Bronfman, which has frequently
been criticised for poor disclosure and for discrimination against minority
shareholders. In particular, the unexpectedly steep slide in fortunes of
Royal Trust, a Bronfman-controlled company, has raised questions about
directors' responsibilities and the adequacy of public disclosure.
Despite the low-key way business is done in Canada, the activism of US
institutional investors has not gone unnoticed north of the border.
Mr William Mackenzie, partner at Allenvest Group, a Toronto securities firm
specialising in representing disgruntled minority shareholders, says more
and more clients are taking part in proxy votes aimed at improving corporate
governance.
Omers, which has significant stakes in about 50 of the companies which make
up Toronto's TSE300 index, this year became the first Canadian institution
to publish a detailed list of proxy voting guidelines.
The 36-page document spells out Omers' policy on such topical corporate
governnance issues as executive stock option plans, leveraged buy-outs,
unequal voting shares and environmental practices.
Another trend encouraging greater accountability is the loosening grip of
family owners and foreign multinationals, long a hallmark of corporate
Canada.
Several foreign companies, including British Petroleum, Lasmo and RTZ, have
sold their former Canadian subsidiaries to a wide spread of institutional
and retail investors.
The financial troubles of the Bronfman and Reichmann empires have also
brought wide ownership to what were formerly tightly-controlled companies,
such as MacMillan Bloedel, the forestry group, and John Labatt, the brewer.
Allenvest lists 18 companies to lose a controlling shareholder recently. The
firm is urging the new owners of these companies to become more active in
appointing directors, opposing 'poison pills' designed to entrench existing
management, and scrutinising executive compensation.
Without such scrutiny, widely-owned companies run a risk which has become
apparent in the financial-services sector. No single investor is allowed to
own more than 10 per cent of a domestic bank. The result, in the words of Mr
David Atkins, a partner of accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Toronto, is
that management is king.
With shareholders wielding little real power, prime responsibility for the
governance of financial institutions has passed to government regulators,
who have laid down some of the strictest rules anywhere.
For instance, audit committees comprised of external directors are now
compulsory. All federally-regulated insurance companies must attach
actuarial certificates of loss reserves and actuarial liabilities to their
financial statements.
Mr Atkins predicts increased pressure from regulators for wider disclosure,
and for greater accountability by directors and auditors. Managers of
financial institutions are 'in a defensive, rather than an assertive mode',
he says. 'A lot of Canadian management feels that they've had these things
imposed on them.'
But improvements in Canadian corporate governance are likely to evolve much
more slowly than in the US. Furthermore, many institutional investors still
sense they have more to lose than to gain by flexing their muscles over
corporate governnance.
Mr Bob Bertram, senior vice-president for investment at the Ontario Teachers
pension fund, mentions the potential consequences of a decision not to
invest in companies with non-voting shares.
'When you take a stand on principle, you're going to eliminate an awful lot
of investment opportunities,' he says

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: PC manufacturers launch
new-generation range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW generation of personal computers, based on Intel's new
high-performance Pentium microprocessor, were introduced yesterday by
several PC manufacturers.
However, short supplies of the chip are likely to limit sales severely. The
Pentium chip is Intel's fifth generation of PC microprocessors. The Silicon
Valley company dominates the field.
It's 486 microprocessor is the 'brains' inside most current PC models. Intel
began shipments of Pentium chips to PC-makers in March, but said supplies
would be limited in the current quarter.
Intel said Pentium had 3.1m transistors and would be capable of 112m
calculations per second, about five times faster than the 486.
Mr Albert Yu, Intel senior vice-president, said yesterday: 'The Pentium
processor enables a whole new class of systems. We expect initial products
to be high-end servers, as corporations downsize applications, and high
performance desktops for customers who require increased performance.'
Intel expects to ship 'hundreds of thousands' of Pentium chips this year and
to 'cross the 1m mark' in 1994.
Leading the companies offering Pentium PCs are Compaq Computer, with
machines ranging from a Dollars 5,000 (Pounds 3,247) desktop computer to
network servers priced from Dollars 18,000.
Other PC-makers introducing Pentium systems include AST Research, NEC, NCR,
Zenith Data Systems, Dell Computer and Advanced Logic Research. Unisys and
Hewlett-Packard are launching Pentium servers.
Notably missing from the companies introducing Pentium PCs was IBM PC, the
largest PC-maker. IBM is expected to wait until the new chip is available in
higher volumes before launching products.
Initially , Pentium PCs are expected to appeal to users of advanced
applications such as computer-aided design and financial analysis that rely
on the performance of the microprocessor 'brain' in a PC. Analysts predict
it will be about two years before the Pentium chip supplants the 486 in the
'mainstream' PC market.
Several PC manufacturers are already offering 'upgradeable' 486 PCs , with a
socket to plug in a Pentium microprocessor at a later date. However, the
design of Pentium systems is more complex than current PCs because the new
chip requires special cooling systems.
This may cause problems in 'upgradeable' PCs that are not equipped with
specially designed fans, analysts said.

<TEXT>
OERLIKON Buhrle, the Swiss armaments, engineering and retailing group, said
sales and orders in the first four months of 1993 were sharply lower than in
the same period of last year.
However, Mr Hans Widmer, chairman, forecast that net income this year would
be higher than the SFr37m (Dollars 25.3m) recorded last year, as
cost-cutting continued.
Oerlikon, which has been subjected by new management to restructuring after
six consecutive years of losses up to 1991, said orders in the first four
months were 17 per cent lower and sales were 10 per cent lower. The declines
were mainly due to delays in incoming orders at its Pilatus light aircraft
subsidiary and its Contraves armaments unit.
A controversial SFr250m order from the South African government for 60
Pilatus trainer aircraft has been delayed because of fears the aeroplanes
could be used for military purposes.
Mr Widmer said the future of both Pilatus and Contraves was uncertain
because of the possibility that the Swiss government would outlaw all
weapons exports within the next two years.
He said it was clear the group as a whole 'would be hurt' by such a
development, but it could finance the contraction out of operating earnings.
Pilatus was hoping to secure its future with the development of a light
business model, the PC-12, and by taking over the business of Piper, the
bankrupt US aircraft maker. Mr Ernst Thomke, chairman of Pilatus, said the
certification of the PC-12, expected for this summer, had been delayed
because tests showed a need to strengthen its wings.
Mr Beat Baumgartner, Oerlikon finance director, said no dividend could be
paid in the current year again because of a SFr67m deficit in the parent
company.
The group aimed to eliminate the deficit by the end of 1994.
Landis &amp; Gyr, the electrical engineering group, said its sales fell 4.6 per
cent to SFr1.4bn in the six months to March.
New orders were off 1.2 per cent to SFr1.5bn.
The group, controlled by Mr Stephan Schmidheiny, expects net income for its
year ending in September 30, 1993, to be about the same as last year's
SFr78.4m, mainly as a result of cost-cutting.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Steep fall at K mart surprises
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ANALYSTS scrambled to cut their full-year earnings estimates for K mart
yesterday morning after the US retail group surprised Wall Street with a
57.1 per cent fall in underlying profits for the first quarter of 1993, in
spite of a 9.2 per cent rise in sales.
Stripping out extraordinary items and the effects of accounting changes, the
underlying net profits fell to Dollars 50m, or 11 cents a share, on sales of
Dollars 9.03bn in the latest quarter from Dollars 116m, or 26 cents, on
sales of Dollars 8.27bn a year earlier.
In the 1993 quarter, K mart had a one-time charge of Dollars 10m. Accounting
changes reduced earnings by an additional Dollars 17m, bringing
first-quarter net income to Dollars 23m, or 5 cents.
Although the company, which operates around 2,400 discount stores and
several chains of specialist stores, had warned investors to expect a
shortfall in first-quarter earnings, the erosion was worse than most
analysts had expected. K mart shares closed down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 22
1/2 .
The company blamed severe weather in March for its disappointing
performance. Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said
consumers had responded well to the company's spring and summer merchandise,
suggesting 'that the unsatisfactory results in the first quarter were
largely weather related.'
K mart's Pace warehouse club chain made a Dollars 24m operating loss, while
the Builders Square unit recorded slim operating earnings of Dollars 1m. A
year earlier, Pace broke even and Builders Square had operating earnings of
Dollars 15m.
Profits at Builders Square were hurt by a Dollars 4m increase in
pre-operating costs, linked to a more aggressive expansion programme, and by
the entry of new competitors.
K mart's gross margin slipped to 23.6 per cent of sales, compared with 24.4
per cent.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Pebereau takes over at BNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHEL Pebereau, chair-man of the French bank Credit Commercial de France
(CCF), is to become the head of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the
state-controlled bank that is set to be privatised later this year.
The appointment of Mr Pebereau, who succeeds Mr Rene Thomas at the helm of
France's third-largest bank, is the first leadership change at a state-owned
enterprise since the new government won power seven weeks ago, pledging a
sell-off of state assets in order to liberalise the economy and to help
reduce the budget deficit.
However, the change of leadership at BNP, announced yesterday, bears little
resemblance to the politically-motivated personnel changes which occurred
when power last alternated between left and right in the 1980s. Mr Thomas,
aged 64 and not in the best of health, had indicated he wanted to retire
last year, but the then Socialist government was unable to agree on a
successor.
The 51-year-old Mr Pebereau is well placed to take BNP into the private
sector, since he did the same with CCF in 1987.
CCF - where Mr Charles de Croisset, one of two managing directors, is tipped
to be named later today to succeed Mr Pebereau - has done well since
privatisation. It was one of the few French banks to announce a rise in
profit last year, up 7.6 per cent to FFr978m (Dollars 181m).
By contrast, BNP announced a 26 per cent drop in profit last year to
FFr2.17bn.
However, this was far better than the 1992 performance turned in by Credit
Lyonnais, France's other big state-owned bank, which recorded a FFr1.85bn
loss, and keeps BNP in the forefront of institutions that may be privatised.
Under Mr Thomas' stewardship since 1982, BNP has had a reputation for
cautious expansion. This is not expected to change dramatically, since Mr
Daniel Lebegue, one of the internal candidates to succeed Mr Thomas, is
staying on as BNP managing director.
BNP's main foreign venture has been an agreement to co-operate with Dresdner
Bank abroad, particularly in eastern Europe, with the French and German
banks eventually aiming to take 10 per cent holdings in each other.
This arrangement was endorsed by Dresdner shareholders last week.
BNP shareholders - the French state (which holds 72.9 per cent), UAP, the
state-owned insurance company (10 per cent) and private shareholders (17.1
per cent) - are expected to endorse the Dresdner deal at their annual
meeting later today.
But BNP privatisation may be too much for the depressed Paris bourse to
digest at one go. At its current share price, BNP, with a FFr1,429bn balance
sheet at end-1991, is valued at more than FFr40bn. When the Conservatives
were last in power in the mid-1980s, their biggest single sell-off was
Societe Generale bank, for FFr18bn.

10% to SKr315m

ATLAS COPCO, the Swedish tool manufacturing group, increased profits after
financial items by 10 per cent in the first three months to SKr315m (Dollars
42.9m) from SKr286m in the same period last year.
The group said it benefited from the lower value of the krona, which offset
a substantial drop in volumes. Sales rose 12 per cent to SKr4.29bn from
SKr3.83bn, while orders were 5 per cent higher at SKr4.62bn.
Operating earnings after depreciation fell 13 per cent to SKr285m,
reflecting the drop in volumes, the group said. 'Demand in Europe continued
to decrease during the first quarter due to the overall weakened economy,
particularly in Germany, Italy and Spain. Rising demand in Great Britain and
North America did not compensate,' it stated.
The group's main division, compressor technology, saw operating profits
slump to SKr202m from SKr261m, although sales rose to SKr1.96bn from
SKr1.78bn.
Profits in construction and mining technology fell to SKr38m from SKr46m,
but industrial technology improved to SKr78m from SKr41m on the back of
cost-cutting.
The lower overall operating performance was offset by a sharp drop in
interest expenses and a positive impact from exchange rate movements.
The group is sticking to its forecast of improved earnings for 1993.
However, the weak sales trend is expected to continue, especially in Europe,
which now accounts for 54 per cent of orders, compared with 61 per cent a
year ago.
All other regions have increased their share at Europe's expense, with
Asia/Australia accounting for 17 per cent of orders, North America 16 per
cent, Africa and the Middle East 8 per cent and South America 5 per cent.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Canny conversion to a new faith
/ Assessing Silvio Berlusconi's change of heart on listings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE surprise conversion of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's media magnate, to
the cause of popular share ownership is almost akin to one of the
scantily-clad soubrettes on his TV game shows taking holy orders.
Few entrepreneurs have so publicly flaunted their distaste for the stock
market and their determination to retain sole stewardship of their
companies. Even after winning control in 1991 of the Mondadori publishing
group, Mr Berlusconi did nothing to raise his stock market profile.
Mondadori and Standa - Italy's second-biggest retailing group, purchased by
Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest holding company in 1988 - are the only listed
parts of his empire. In both cases, the listings existed prior to
acquisition by Fininvest.
So what explains last week's sudden change of heart, with the decision to
list Silvio Berlusconi Editore, a publishing and commercial printing
operation, as part of a complex share swap into Mondadori?
The main motive is financial. After its rapid rise in the 1980s and early
1990s, when sales soared with the Standa and Mondadori acquisitions,
Fininvest is now in what one group director calls a 'consolidation phase'.
Although it has emerged relatively unscathed from the recession so far,
Fininvest is feeling the strains of growth. Net group borrowings grew to
L3,050bn (Dollars 2.07bn) at the end of 1992, the latest year for which
figures are available. Interest charges amounted to L500bn in 1992. While
the group may not be under direct pressure from its bankers to divest,
opportunities for further growth via debt-financed acquisitions are starting
to look severely restricted.
In essence, the flotation of SBE is linked to an offer to swap SBE shares
with those of Mondadori. It will be the preliminary to the placing of a
substantial stake in SBE.
Mondadori is Italy's biggest publisher, with a prestigious book list and a
stable of leading magazines, including Panorama, Italy's best-selling weekly
news magazine. Sales last year rose by 13.9 per cent to L1,600bn, while net
profits recovered strongly to L57.1bn from L10.1bn in 1991.
Meanwhile, SBE made net profits of L29.7bn on sales of L320bn in 1992. The
company, which has substantial commercial printing activities, is best known
as the publisher of TV Sorrisi e Canzoni, Italy's biggest-selling magazine.
Shareholders in Mondadori will be able to exchange one ordinary share for
one share in SBE. The ratio for holders of non-voting savings stock will be
four Mondadori shares for three in SBE.
Fininvest already owns almost 70 per cent of Mondadori's ordinary shares and
about 80 per cent of the savings stock, which will be swapped into SBE
equity. A further 20 per cent of Mondadori's ordinary shares were sold to
SBE directly last month.
Outside shareholders in Mondadori have little option but go along with the
deal, which values Mondadori ordinary shares at L15,000, against a closing
price of L10,825 before last Thursday's stock market suspension. The savings
shares are being valued at L11,250 against a pre-suspension close of L6,905.
After the swap, SBE will have about 9 per cent of its shares on the stock
market. SBE is then likely to place up to 49 per cent of its total capital
in order to raise up to L600bn in fresh funds, based on the offer price for
Mondadori shareholders.
The transaction may only be the first sign of a new-found affection for the
stock market on Mr Berlusconi's part. Some analysts predict he will
eventually list minority stakes in two other parts of his media, retailing
and financial services empire, which made net profits of about L60bn on
group sales of L11,000bn in 1992.
The first may be RTI, Mr Berlusconi's three highly-successful Italian
television channels, packaged together with Fininvest's Videotime film and
transmission interests. The second could be Mediolanum, the small insurance
group purchased by Fininvest in 1984.
Special reasons could explain the RTI transactions. Trading conditions at
RTI, one of the pillars of Mr Berlusconi's financial success, have grown
increasingly tough following criticism of its advertising activities.
The principal attacks have focused on RTI's pioneering use of on-screen
sponsorship of products on its popular quiz and game shows. The practice has
been attacked by competitors and Italy's supervisory authority, which wants
to limit the duration of such spots.
The attacks on RTI include a campaign by magazine and newspaper publishers
claiming that Fininvest's channels are gaining an unfair slice of the market
by undercutting rates. Together, they have put the normally ebullient Mr
Berlusconi on the defensive. Taking RTI public via a big flotation could
multiply its lobbying power by creating an army of new shareholders.
Mr Berlusconi's seeming conversion to the cause of the stock market may not
come from the heart, but he is canny enough for his head to tell him it is
the right step in the circumstances.

FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Wallenberg group tumbles into
the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTOR, the Wallenberg family's key holding company, plunged heavily into
the red in the first quarter following a worse performance from Saab-Scania,
its wholly-owned vehicle and aerospace unit, and a lack of capital gains.
The consolidated loss after financial items amounted to SKr542m (Dollars
73.8m), compared with a profit of SKr1.15bn in the same 1992 quarter.
The value of the group's investment portfolio remained virtually unchanged
from the year-end at SKr23.2bn - failing to keep pace with the stock market,
which rose by 9 per cent over the same period.
Investor said last year's result benefited from SKr1.31bn in capital gains,
whereas there had been no share sales in the first three months of 1993.
But it also noted a significant downturn at Saab-Scania and said the company
was set to report a loss after financial items in 1993 because of adverse
market conditions. Saab-Scania made a loss of SKr92m during the quarter,
against a SKr211m profit in the same 1992 period, as sales fell to SKr6.2bn
from SKr6.8bn.
Investor said demand for Saab-Scania's main commercial products, trucks and
aircraft, had fallen further and was expected to remain weak during the rest
of 1993. 'We see no recovery this year,' said Mr Lars Kylberg, Saab-Scania
chief executive.
A particular casualty of the downturn has been Scania Trucks &amp; Buses, where
earnings have fallen sharply.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Lynx back in profit at midterm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp turnround was achieved by Lynx Holdings, the USM-quoted computer
services and leisure products company, with a pre-tax profit of Pounds
105,000 for the six months to March 31 compared with a deficit - including
exceptional losses of Pounds 131,000 - of Pounds 258,000 for the
corresponding period last year.
Mr RA Pinnington, chairman, said the performance of the radio communications
and computer systems and software businesses had been ahead of expectations
in the first half, with a particularly large increase in business being
experienced by the radio communications operation.
Earnings for the half year were 0.83p against losses of 1.68p, and the
interim dividend goes up from 0.25p to 0.3p. Turnover for the period was
Pounds 4.72m (Pounds 3.23m restated).

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Changes to FT London Share Service
statistics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH EFFECT from today readers of the London Share Service pages will start
to notice a capital 'N' against the names of some companies.
The symbol indicates that the version of the company's earnings used in the
FT's price:earnings ratio and other statistical calculations have been
changed to the 'headline earnings' formula devised by a sub-committee of the
Institute for Investment Management &amp; Research (IIMR) and proposed in draft
form in early March.
The FT has chosen the formula proposed by IIMR because it represents the
broadest available consensus on a 'single number' treatment of earnings.
Although still subject to final review it constitutes the considered
response of the institutional investment community to the adoption by the
Accounting Standards Board of Financial Reporting Standard 3 on corporate
earnings (FRS 3).
UK companies will not be required to report their results in line with FRS 3
until after June 22. Many have already done so, however, and the Financial
Times has been taking full account of this for the past three months in its
company reporting.
We believe the number of companies complying with FRS 3 is now large enough
to justify using a new basis for earnings wherever it is required for
statistical purposes.
The aim of the IIMR headline earnings formula is to include a company's
actual activities during the reporting period, including those activities
which have been with the company only for part of the period. Key features
are:
All trading profits/losses are included in the earnings number. Items which
are abnormal in size or nature are included but should be flagged.
Profits and losses on the sale of fixed assets or of businesses should be
excluded. This does not apply to assets acquired for resale, such as
marketable securities.
Profits and losses arising in activities discontinued at some point in the
period, or in activities acquired at some point in the period, should remain
in the earnings figure. Costs of eliminating a discontinued operation, or of
making an acquisition, are excluded.
Although it will be surprising if we do not encounter difficulties with some
individual companies' figures, we are confident that the IIMR headline
earnings formula will provide a factual and robust basis for the statistical
calculations on which FT readers rely.
Further information on the FT's treatment of earnings is available from The
Manager, FT Statistics, One Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Hams beef up burger bars - Planet
Hollywood, London's latest gourmet attraction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHY MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO-ONE ever lost money underestimating the good taste of a burger eater, so
there is some reason for Mr Robert Earl's quiet confidence that the London
branch of his latest Planet Hollywood theme restaurant, which opened
yesterday, will outstrip the success of the Hard Rock Cafe chain he helped
build.
The four Planet Hollywood outlets sell burgers against a backdrop of movie
clips, loud theme tunes, and other memorabilia including Charlie Chaplin's
cane, Rocky's motorcycle and Judy Garland's dress from the Wizard of Oz. The
Hard Rock Cafes feature rock memorabilia.
Mr Earl, 41, and partner Mr Keith Barish, the film producer, have put up
most of the Dollars 40m cash behind the Planet Hollywood chain. Mr Sylvester
Stallone, Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mr Bruce Willis, the actors, are
minority backers.
This, with the recent injection of Mr Earl's four other London restaurants
into the Pelican Group and his seat on its board, marks his return to
British business after five years in the US.
Theme food has become popular as punters drink less and must be tempted to
eat more. Mr Earl expects the London Planet Hollywood, the fourth in the
chain, will gross Pounds 15m a year. This he says would be about Pounds 3m
more than the outfits he sees as his main competition - the Hard Rock Cafe,
TGI Friday's and Terence Conran's Quaglino's.
He is considering flotation: 'I miss the Stock Exchange. I like having
institutional shareholders. I like having the ability to create new
businesses through public funds - and success can be measured openly.'
It looks like another chapter in the Earl success story. There is, however,
a bit of gristle in the burger. Mr Peter Morton, co-founder of the Hard Rock
chain and owner of all the Cafes in the western half of the US, is bringing
Dollars 400m legal actions against Mr Earl and the Rank Organisation, which
owns the eastern Hard Rocks.
Mr Morton argues that Rank and Mr Earl allowed Planet Hollywood to copy the
Hard Rock motif illegally, and stole trade secrets when they both had duties
to the jointly-owned Hard Rock licensing corporation which markets the
lucrative trade mark.
Mr Morton declines to comment, but Mr Earl says that some of his claims have
been thrown out: 'He has successfully taken up a lot of my time, but these
are basically bullshit allegations, and he hasn't produced any evidence.'
Mr Earl has made a fortune selling hamburgers and hype. No doubt the burgers
are 100 per cent meat, but Mr Earl no longer lives up to his nasty personal
myth.
The native North Londoner who now lives in Orlando, Florida, is not the
laugh-a-minute, name dropping, braggart, full of wild claims who cannot sit
still. He thinks carefully before he speaks, and even his shirt is subdued:
'You think this is loud? I think Paul Smith would be very upset to hear
that.'
He believes jealousy is behind the press jibes: 'The more successful one is,
you have to recognise I am going to get more and more unfavourable press -
that is the nature of England.'
The hype surrounding his business acumen is harder to assess. He has made
millions. Earl watchers talk about a combination of luck, creativity, energy
and an autocratic style.
He says: 'I think I am pretty good at inspiring people. I can mix with
anyone from royalty down to the kitchen porter. I also work about 14 or 15
hours a day. But I am lucky. Most people would not consider it work because
of the excitement, the celebrity involvement.'
Detractors prefer to remain nameless, but say there's a jackall behind the
hype: 'He often deals from behind a fax machine and usually his faxes are
one-liners, very pointed, very abrasive. He cultivates the
friend-to-celebrities image. You don't hear about the ruthless way he treats
people.'
One anonymous friend concedes: 'Of course he doesn't always deliver. How can
you possibly? But he's succeeded more often than most. The difference
between him and the rest of us is that he picks up his luck and runs with
it.'
He certainly ran with his first company, President Entertainments, which
floated in 1984 valued at Pounds 5.2m, and was the vehicle for theme
restaurants in Britain and the US.
If, in common with many other companies in the 1980s it grew rapidly (from
six to 65 restaurants) through acquisitions funded by rights issues,
placings and paper deals, if earnings increased little more than half
against quadrupled pre-tax profits, and if aspects of the balance sheet look
a little adventurous from the perspective of the 1990s, well, in 1987 he
sold it to Pleasurama, the casino and hotel operator for Pounds 63m.
Mr Earl agreed to run a new US subsidiary for Pleasurama and negotiated a
contract which expired last year, reputedly yielding him a Pounds 30m
profit-linked bonus.
Rank inherited Mr Earl and Hard Rock International through its 1990 takeover
of Mecca (which had bought Pleasurama in 1988). It must now cough up the
cash while Mr Earl and Mr Barish, who bought Rank out of Planet Hollywood,
develop the rival.
Last night, at the lift-off party, Mr Robert Earl mixed with Hollywood
royalty and perhaps the odd kitchen porter. He will be wishing on these
earthbound stars to draw customers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, a leading provider of electronic security services and vehicle auction
services with operations in North America, the UK and continental Europe,
announced net income of Dollars 26.2m (Pounds 17m) for the quarter ended
March 31.
That compared with Dollars 42.4m previously, which included unusual items
and other non-recurring net gains of Dollars 23.3m.
Net sales for the 1993 period were 13 per cent ahead at Dollars 330.4m and
operating income rose 11 per cent to Dollars 45.9m.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive, said the results showed
that the year had started according to plan with the electronic security
services and auction service businesses performing in line with
expectations.
Primary earnings per common share for the quarter were 20 cents (34 cents).

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 2m exceptional charges push Hartons
further into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Hartons Group, the distributor of semi-finished plastics, deepened
from Pounds 5.36m to Pounds 6.25m in 1992.
The directors continue to defer the declaration of a preference dividend.
Losses per share were 8.5p (8.1p).
Pre-tax losses on continuing operations were Pounds 2.52m (Pounds 4.66m)
after net exceptional costs of Pounds 45,000 (Pounds 859,000).
There were exceptional charges of Pounds 2m (Pounds 1.22m). Some Pounds
1.84m related to goodwill in the consideration for a loss-making Spanish
subsidiary, which was previously written off on acquisition. The goodwill
had to be shown as Hartons' holding in the subsidiary was reduced to 25 per
cent since the year end.
The company said Spanish labour law made the alternative of re-organising
the subsidiary expensive and difficult.
Net interest charges were Pounds 2.57m (Pounds 2.99m). Borrowings stood at
Pounds 11m (Pounds 14.8m) at the year end and the group is committed to
reducing them.
The directors said the results were disappointing but concealed a
significant improvement in the underlying position of the group in a harsh
economic climate, which deteriorated in this period in continental Europe.
Restructured UK operations achieved an operating profit of Pounds 684,000
(losses Pounds 1m).
The French subsidiary, also restructured, incurred an operating loss of
Pounds 500,000 (profit Pounds 30,000) on underlying turnover down 20 per
cent. The company disposed of its resin business in June, which made about a
third of turnover.
The Benelux operations made Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 90,000) at the operating
level on turnover up 39 per cent.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Temptation of a safe, but undynamic
investment / A look at Northern Ireland Electricity, whose pathfinder
prospectus is published today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE a company which was guaranteed fixed revenues on the bulk of its
most profitable business, regardless of whether sales volumes went up or
down. Investors looking for a safe, if undynamic, home for their funds would
be sorely tempted to buy into it.
Next month they will be given the opportunity when the government sells off
Northern Ireland Electricity, the last non-nuclear power company to remain
in the UK public sector, for between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m.
The guarantee of income stems from a regulatory regime which is among
several factors setting NIE apart from the other electricity companies in
the United Kingdom.
The differences - good and bad - will come under close examination in the
next week or so as the more than 400,000 people and institutions who have
registered an interest in the flotation decide whether to buy shares. A
pathfinder prospectus on the sale will be published today.
Northern Ireland Electricity is what remains of the province's state
electricity company following the disposal last year of four power stations
to trade buyers for about Pounds 350m.
Like the 12 regional electricity companies (recs) in England and Wales it
enjoys a monopoly to distribute power in the area it serves.
Unlike them, it also transmits the power, a function that in England and
Wales is undertaken by the National Grid. In theory NIE could face more
competition than the recs in supplying electricity - that is buying it from
generators and selling it on - but so far only one company, Northern
Electric, has applied for a supply licence.
NIE's penetration among the province's 1.5m population is much more limited
than is that of the regional companies in England and Wales because oil and
coal supply 81 per cent of the fuels market. This gives the company headroom
for volume expansion, particularly as there is as yet no competition from
gas and the population is relatively young and consumer goods oriented.
But the most significant difference between NIE and the regional electricity
companies is in the way they are regulated. The Northern Ireland electricity
system is not linked to that in Great Britain, or indeed the Irish Republic,
and it is regulated separately.
Whereas the recs are negotiating with Ofer, their regulator, on changes to
formulae influencing supply profits and will soon discuss the more lucrative
distribution business, NIE's formulae for the next four years are already
established.
Dr Patrick Haren, chief executive, says this gives NIE more certainty. 'We
are further down the track,' he says, pointing to the widespread belief that
the reviews in England and Wales will follow examples set in the NIE
regulation.
The most significant formula is that governing transmission and
distribution, which provides more than 80 per cent of company operating
profits. In an attempt to encourage energy conservation, Mr Geoff Horton,
the Northern Ireland regulator, has introduced a system whereby he regulates
revenues rather than price per unit.
Three quarters of total revenues are allowed to grow in real terms by 3.5
per cent annually but, for this three quarters, volume growth does not
affect income. If volume growth exceeds expectations NIE must reduce prices
in the following year, but if volume growth falls short NIE can increase
tariffs.
The effect is a highly secure revenue stream. Although this provides
stability, it limits the advantages accruing from stronger volume growth
than on the mainland. In addition it may take away an incentive for
management to market aggressively, skills which may be needed later in the
decade if British Gas decides to compete in the market on completion of a
pipeline from the mainland.
Dr Haren says the advantage of the regulatory regime is that NIE must
concentrate on costs to generate increased profits in transmission and
distribution. 'Recs can allow the economy to drive volume sales and profits.
We have to be vigorous about cost management.'
Jobs are an obvious target. In the last three years NIE has cut about 8 per
cent of its workforce which now stands at about 3,700, but NIE still has six
employees per thousand customers compared to the recs' 3.6. Although this is
partly explained by the wide geographic base of NIE's operation, it leaves
scope for further reductions as the company adopts the more rigorous
practices of the private sector.
The City believes that Dr Haren is well qualified to lead the management in
this period of change. Still only 42, he joined NIE from the Electricity
Supply Board in Eire where he started as an engineer, but later switched to
finance. Generally, the management at NIE is perceived as well balanced in
age and experience. 'They may not set the world alight but they are
comparable with that at most recs and better than some,' says one analyst.
In spite of inherent advantages they have at NIE, managers face two main
challenges, one resulting from high capital expenditure needed over the next
few years, the other from the political problems in Northern Ireland.
Problems associated with terrorism can be exaggerated. As Hoare Govett
points out, the government practice is to replace assets in Northern Ireland
which are damaged through terrorism. None the less terrorism has been and
remains a threat; the headquarters of the NIE was bombed in the 1970s and
the interconnector with Eire was severed following terrorist action.
Even if any attack on NIE had no impact on NIE's finances, it would be
unlikely to leave the share price unscathed.
The other inherent problem at NIE stems from the province's remoteness and
the age of the transmission system, half of which dates from the 1950s or
earlier. NIE is likely to have to pay Pounds 110m for an interconnector to
Scotland which is planned for mid-1990s.
Even without allowing for interconnector costs, Hoare Govett estimates
capital expenditure to rise to Pounds 125m by 1995-6 from last year's Pounds
57m and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, NIE's financial adviser, says gearing could
reach 65 per cent by 1996-7.
However, Hoare Govett believes real dividend growth should be similar to the
recs in the long term.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sterling decline boosts BIT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE year ended March 31 1993 British Investment Trust has seen its net
asset value rise by 20.7 per cent, principally from the effect on the stock
market levels of the fall in the value of sterling in the second half.
The value per share was up from an adjusted 164p to 198p. Ordinary
shareholders' funds stood at Pounds 616.9m, compared with Pounds 512.4m.
On the income side, the contribution from investments fell to Pounds 24.4m
(Pounds 25m) while interest and other income rose to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds
11.5m). Some of the companies within the portfolio cut their dividends and
there was a decline on the UK side for the first time in many years.
With the outlook for income remaining uncertain in the current year, the
directors have decided to maintain the BIT dividend at 4.5p for 1992-93; the
final payment is 2.6p.
Revenue attributable to ordinary holders was Pounds 13.48m compared with
Pounds 13.42m for earnings of 4.48p (adjusted 4.34p) per share.

Pre-tax losses at Jermyn Investment, the property investor, grew by Pounds
58,000 to Pounds 831,000 in the year to end-December. However a lower tax
charge of Pounds 42,000, against Pounds 72,000 left losses per share lower

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Finsbury Smaller in fund raising
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FINSBURY Smaller Companies Trust has announced that it is in discussion with
S G Warburg Securities with a view to raising additional funds.
The investment trust believes that, as recovery develops, small company
shares are likely to show higher levels of capital gain and dividend growth
than large company shares.
The trust, formerly known as Lancashire &amp; London, was the subject of a
hostile bid from Anglo-Scandinavian in 1991. After beating off the bid, the
trust, along with others associated with the empire of the late Sir Walter
Salomon, was renamed. Cross-holdings in the group were also reduced.
Finsbury Smaller no longer has holdings in any of the rest of the group;
however, Finsbury Trust and Ocean Wilsons retain holdings in Finsbury
Smaller Companies, of 15.9 per cent and 9.4 per cent respectively.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Whitbread turns to eating out in quest for
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE some of the UK brewers have been chasing volume to offset flat or
declining beer sales, Whitbread has been looking elsewhere for its growth.
As yesterday's results highlight, the UK's fourth largest brewer is
increasingly concentrating on its managed retail business, which includes
Whitbread Inns, Beefeater, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday's restaurant chains as
well as the expanded Thresher's high street off-licence business.
This is no accident. There is excess capacity in the brewing sector, margins
are under pressure as a result of aggressive discounting by Whitbread's
larger competitors, and the Supply of Beers Orders have necessitated a wide
ranging reorganisation of the tied house estate.
In contrast the eating out market has been one of the fastest growing
consumer markets over the past decade. Between 1982 and 1992 UK consumer
spending on eating out grew in real terms by 70 per cent, while beer sales
were flat. Last year consumers spent Pounds 16.6bn on eating out compared
with Pounds 13.5bn on beer.
With a modest upturn in consumer spending under way Whitbread's recent
investment in its managed retail operations appears to be beginning to pay
off.
Whitbread Inns, the group's managed pub business, increased profits,
turnover and market share last year. Drinks sales grew by 6 per cent while
food sales increased by 11 per cent. Overall, Whitbread's managed estate
derives 35.9 per cent of its business from food, while the competition
manages only 13.7 per cent.
Within the restaurants businesses all three domestic chains managed to
increase sales and profits. Beefeater increased its sales by 2 per cent and
profits by 4 per cent, despite a decline in average weekly covers from 1,120
in 1989 to just over 900 in August last year.
Similarly, Pizza Hut recorded a 3 per cent growth in sales and a 24 per cent
increase in profits. Since November Mr Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's chief
executive, said sales have grown strongly each month and significant
efficiency gains are benefiting margins. TGI Friday's also benefited from
emerging economies of scale as sales grew by 15 per cent and profits more
than doubled.
The other star performer in the division was Thresher. Following the
acquisition of Peter Dominic from Grand Metropolitan last year Thresher now
has 1,600 shops and is the leader in the Pounds 5bn-a-year home drinks
market.
The expanded off-licence group managed to increase profits by 30 per cent
and sales by 40 per cent. Whitbread's concentration on building its beer
brands has also helped it in the take home business.
Although the beer and drinks division itself only managed a modest increase
in sales and profits last year, Whitbread claims the largest share, 17 per
cent by value, of the take home market.
Overall the Whitbread's managed retail estate businesses boosted profits by
13 per cent to Pounds 135.7m (Pounds 119.9m) on turnover of Pounds 1.56bn
(Pounds 1.38bn) last year and now accounts for almost 60 per cent of group
turnover and more than 51 per cent of profits from continuing operations.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Division shares off to good start with 96p
close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Division Group yesterday got off to a flying start with the price
touching 107p, as dealings began following a placing at 40p per share. After
opening at 79p, the shares closed the day at 96p.
Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester stockbroker, placed 15.4m shares in
Division, which makes 'virtual reality' software and hardware for
professional users, with 20 institutional investors and 450 private
investors.
Market makers received 5 per cent of the issue, about 770,000, and the 20
institutions 70 per cent.
Division, established in 1989, has developed a complete virtual reality
system, suitable for a wide variety of applications, where the ability to
operate is in three dimensions rather than the conventional two-dimensional
systems which have been around for some years.
Sales have been made in Japan, north America and throughout Europe.
In its last full trading year, Division incurred a loss of Pounds 100,000 on
Pounds 1m turnover and in the five months to March 1993 made a small profit
of Pounds 19,000 on sales of Pounds 746,000.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Osprey buy-out claim countered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STUART Duncan, chair-man of the management team which has negotiated the
Pounds 2.2m buy-out of the marketing services division of Osprey
Communications, yesterday countered a City claim on Friday that his group
was expected to make a loss in the current year.
Indeed Mr Duncan said: 'The historical profits of the marketing services
division have always been in the order of Pounds 500,000, and profit
forecasts for the current year - as Osprey can confirm - will also be in
line with this.'
The buy-out company - Communications in Business Group - has the support of
Montague Private Equity, part of the HSBC Group, and the Bank of Scotland.
CBG consists of three companies - Bryan, Constantinidi &amp; Brightwell, TOP
Counsel and Communications in Business - which have operated side-by-side
mainly in the leisure and travel areas. Clients here include Brittany
Ferries, Texas Tourism, Bermuda Tourism and Stansted Airport, while
non-travel clients include Costain and the City of Westminster.
The buy-out is one of a series of moves involving Osprey. Conditional on the
completion of the disposal is the acquisition of SMS Communications Group,
headed by Mr Jack Rubins. Osprey is also to launch a 1-for-3 rights issue to
raise Pounds 1.3m net. Its shares rose from 32 1/2 p to 34p on the day.

FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Regent at 15p premium
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THEIR first day's trading under a full market listing, shares in Regent
Inns opened at 149p and touched 151p before closing at 150p, a premium of

FT  18 MAY 93 / US West finds cable role in TWE deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement that US West, one of the seven US regional 'Baby Bells',
will invest Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.62bn) in Time Warner Entertainment, part
of Time Warner, the giant media and entertainment conglomerate, marks an
important new step in the fast-evolving relationship between the US
telecommunications and cable industries, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
To date, that relationship has largely been confrontational - a battle over
who will bring communications into US homes over the next decade, with
complex regulatory restrictions muddying a simple competitive fight. Now, it
seems, co-operation may be the order of the day. 'This knocks the regulatory
paradigm into a cocked hat,' remarked Richard McCormick, US West's chairman.
At a financial level, the deal is complex. Essentially, US West will put up
Dollars 1.5bn when the deal closes, hopefully later this year. The remaining
money will be supplied over four years. This will give US West a 25.51 per
cent interest in Time Warner Entertainment, which covers the parent's filmed
entertainment, programming and cable interests. Time Warner will continue to
own 63.27 per cent of TWE, and have operating control of much of the
division. Remaining equity will be spilt between Itochu (previously C. Itoh)
and Toshiba, existing partners in TWE.
But the relationship between Time Warner and US West is expected to run
deeper. Out of US West's total investment, Dollars 1bn will be devoted to
developing Time Warner's planned 'full-service network'. This is the
ambitious interactive cable-based home entertainment and communications
network, which the company detailed in January.
According to Time Warner yesterday, capital expenditure on cable is
currently about Dollars 400m a year. Between 1994 and 1998, it is expected
to average about Dollars 800m annually - and most of this will go on
developing the full-services network. US West's Dollars 1bn will be welcome.
The other Dollars 4bn, according to Time Warner, will come from internally
generated cash-flows.
The full-service network venture will be run jointly and involve both
groups' employees. 'US West brings intimate knowledge of network switching
(which) permits efficient tracking and billing of the myriad transactions
that will cross the network,' said Mr Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman.
Other Time Warner executives noted US West's experience in selling to the
business community. And US West can boast direct experience of working
alongside a cable company: it has already linked up with TCI, the nation's
largest cable operator, to provide telephone and cable services in the UK.

FT  18 MAY 93 / GE Capital may control GPA for less than Dollars 300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GE CAPITAL may be able to exercise its option to take control of GPA Group
for less than Dollars 300m (Pounds 194.8m), according to lenders of the
troubled aircraft leasing company.
GPA yesterday made the first payments due to bondholders after it received
Dollars 100m in the form of a bridging loan from its core lenders.
The group's board, which met yesterday, is confident that key shareholders
will underwrite an additional loan worth up to Dollars 150m, which would be
partially convertible into equity, enabling it to make payments to
bondholders due by the end of June. Its banks have also agreed to extend
their waiver of breaches on its banking covenants until the end of next
month.
The group still has to agree the price of the option allowing GE Capital to
take 65 per cent of its equity, with the possibility of purchasing 80 per
cent if certain conditions are fulfilled.
Several of the group's lead bankers yesterday said that negotiations are
currently being conducted within a price range of Dollars 200m to Dollars
300m.
GPA would not comment. However, one of its advisers said the company
believed GE Capital could be persuaded to pay more for a controlling stake.
The final figure will not be paid until GE Capital exercises its option,
which under the terms of the deal could be as late as March 31 1997.
GE Capital is not expected to exercise its option in the short-term. GPA's
bankers believe its agreement to purchase 45 aircraft for Dollars 1.35bn may
be enough to guarantee its survival for up to 18 months.
Up to Dollars 350m of the total amount GPA is receiving for the aircraft is
in the form of progress payments or deposits that it forwarded to
manufacturers when ordering the aeroplanes.
If the deal with GE Capital goes ahead, this will now be repaid to GPA,
bolstering its balance sheet.
The group's banks have made it clear that they will not consider writing off
any of their borrowings in the immediate future.
One of GPA's lead bankers said: 'Any attempt to make the banks take a
haircut would jeopardise the whole deal.'
GPA's 138 lenders may agree to a further restructuring of the group's
Dollars 5.23bn borrowings if the deal with GE Capital is completed.

FT  18 MAY 93 / BT sticks a foot in the home entertainment door: A foray
into dishes masks deeper ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT's bid to enter the satellite dish market announced last week is more
unwelcome news for Mr Alan Sugar's Amstrad, the leading UK supplier. But it
is a side show in a far larger game: whether, and if so when and how,
Britain's telecoms giant is allowed to break into the home entertainment
market using its fixed network.
BT is straining at the leash. Its government licence forbids it from
providing 'entertainment services'. The ban, imposed in the 1991
telecommunications white paper to allow the fledgling cable TV companies to
establish themselves, is due to remain until 2001, and may continue even
thereafter.
'We cannot understand why the government should go to such enormous lengths
to protect some foreign-owned cable companies,' says Mr Alan Rudge, BT's
director of development and procurement. 'We are being held back in a dying
technology longer than we would like. We see fibre as the technology of the
future; copper is the past.'
BT condemns the ban as nonsensical and a threat to its long-term competitive
position, since the latest optical fibre technology makes it feasible and -
in its view - affordable to lay advanced optical fibre taking TV, telephone
and data services right into the home.
With only about 3.2m homes able to receive satellite TV, there is plenty of
room to expand the existing dish market for BSkyB's broadcasts. With a foot
in the home entertainment door, BT would be in a stronger position to
exploit the market through fibre, whenever it is allowed to do so.
It may not have to wait until 2001. Oftel, the industry regulator, is
empowered to ask the government to lift the ban in five years' time. Also,
the meaning of 'entertainment services' in the 1991 white paper is unclear.
BT argues that it does not extend to on-line video services  - which involve
two-way communication between the viewer and broadcaster; the cable
companies are adamant it does; Oftel says it is a 'grey area'.
There is 'a good possibility', says Mr Rudge, that BT will soon approach
Oftel about providing an on-line video service. If it gets the green light,
it could probably do so through its existing copper wires, but the new
market would give the company a spur to extending the fibre network, which
is currently restricted to trunk routes and larger companies within the
local loop. Within five years BT could have a fibre network covering the
whole local loop in most large cities.
Although they currently have only about 450,000 broadband subscribers, cable
TV companies are relaxed about BT's dish ambitions. Says Mr Nick Caunter,
marketing manager of Videotron: 'We are not too concerned about BT entering
the dish market, which is is already heavily marketed and more limited.' But
they are determined to keep BT out of the fixed-wire entertainment business
until 2001, by when analysts expect them to have around 6m subscribers over
128 franchise areas.
Far more than pop videos and interactive games is at stake. The cable
companies, laying their own fibre-optic networks in the local loop, are
offering telephony services hand-in-hand with TV options. The take-up of
telephony by domestic subscribers has so far been small, but by 2001 the
cable operators hope to have done to BT in the local loop what Mercury is
achieving in the business market.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Recession hits French chemicals group profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, which is expected to be privatised shortly by the French
government, yesterday reported operating profits down 19.3 per cent from
FFr2.162bn (Pounds 250m) to FFr1.7bn for the first quarter.
The group suffered a 7.9 per cent fall in turnover from FFr21.5bn to
FFr19.8bn. Excluding exchange rates, the fall was 4.7 per cent. Turnover was
also affected by last year's European Community common agricultural policy
reforms.
The company warned that operating income during the first half of the year
was likely to remain weak due to sluggish economic conditions.
However, it predicted that improvements from the health and agrochemicals
divisions should contribute to operating income gains during the second six
months.
The situation facing fibres and chemicals would continue to be difficult, it
added.
Operating profits at the organic and inorganic intermediates division fell
from FFr264m to zero, on sales down 16.8 per cent at FFr3.572bn. The
speciality chemicals posted trading profits down 25 per cent from FFr196m to
FFr147m on turnover down 15.5 per cent at FFr3.347bn.
Trading results at the fibres division also fell, this time 78 per cent from
FFr232m to FFr51m on turnover down 19.2 per cent at FFr2.871bn.
Agrochemicals operating profits fell 22.6 per cent from FFr625m to FFr484m
on turnover down 11.9 per cent at FFr2.86bn. About 53 per cent of its
turnover is in Europe.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Whitbread up 13% after boost from food operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD, the UK brewing and retailing group, managed to increase full-year
pre-tax profits by 13 per cent led by a strong performance by the group's
branded restaurants and pub food operations.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 251.2m in the year to February 27 from
Pounds 222.1m in the same period last year when profits were reduced by a
Pounds 37m exceptional charge to cover unusually high bad debts among the
group's free trade loans.
Trading profits increased by 2 per cent to Pounds 232.6m on turnover which
grew by 7 per cent to Pounds 2.35bn.
Earnings per share increased to 39.44p from 35.78p and a final dividend of
13p, against 12.4p a year earlier, lifts the full-year payment about 5 per
cent to 17.75p from (16.95p).
As expected a revaluation of Whitbread's property portfolio led to a
write-down of Pounds 595m or 22 per cent of book values.
Despite the size of the write-down only Pounds 6m was charged to the profit
and loss account. The bulk, Pounds 576.6m, is seen as temporary and has been
taken from the revaluation reserve.
The group's balance sheet remains strong with net borrowings of Pounds
399.5m, down from Pounds 453.3m last year, equivalent to gearing of 19.3 per
cent.
Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive, said the strongest performance was in
Whitbread Inns, the managed pub business, which improved sales, profits and
cash flow despite the recession. 'In the second half of the year our branded
restaurants and pub food operations began to show growth in covers and this
continued into the new financial year,' he said
Profits from the managed retail operations increased by about 13 per cent to
Pounds 135.7m on turnover that increased by the same percentage to Pounds
1.56bn. Whitbread Inns, Beefeater, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday's all posted
higher sales and profits.
The beer division increased its market share to 13.5 per cent from 13.2 per
cent despite extremely tough competition and a 2 per cent volume decline in
the overall beer market. Operating profits rose 4 per cent from Pounds 67.4m
to Pounds 70.4m on turnover 1 per cent ahead at Pounds 896.4m.

FT  18 MAY 93 / M&amp;G increases dividend after strong rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G Group, Britain's largest unit and investment trust company, yesterday
announced a 14.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.8m for the
six months to March 30 and an 11 per cent increase in its interim dividend
to 10p.
It also announced a reorganisation of board responsibilities. Group managing
director Mr Paddy Linaker, 59, said he will retire in July 1994 and will be
replaced by Mr David Morgan, 60, managing director of M&amp;G's investment
division.
M&amp;G noted that all areas of its business had increased profitability.
Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism provoked a
fundamental change in investor confidence, leading to buoyant share prices
and renewed interest in the company's principal products, investment and
unit trusts. Total funds under management have risen Pounds 2.4bn to Pounds
10.96bn.
Mr Linaker expressed concern about the effects proposals from the Office of
Fair Trading to require independent financial advisers to disclose
commission payments would have on sales.
Separately, M&amp;G is expanding the support services it provides to the IFA
sector to increase market share. Mr Linaker said the company had no plans to
start a direct sales force for at least the next two to three years. 'Among
other things, we think such a thing might damage our IFA network,' he said.
However, while unit trust sales were up sharply to Pounds 232m from Pounds
158m, redemptions were also up sharply as well, so net sales totalled only
Pounds 4m. Mr Linaker said the very high levels of redemptions were a cause
for concern. 'We are doing some research into redemptions,' he said.
However, some of the activity may relate to M&amp;G's investment performance
which has suffered during the recession because of its bias towards small to
mid-sized companies, which have performed poorly. Mr Linaker said M&amp;G's
Recovery Fund and Income Fund have performed well over the past six months.
Sales of M&amp;G life and pensions products declined to Pounds 80m from Pounds
84m. Mr Linaker said this may reflect concern about investment performance
as well as fears among IFAs that M&amp;G no longer viewed them as its leading
sales channel.

FT  18 MAY 93 / IG Metall head in row over purchase of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Franz Steinkuhler, the most prominent and powerful trade union leader in
Germany, yesterday admitted spending almost DM1m (Pounds 400,000) in a
speculative purchase of shares in a Daimler-Benz holding company.
At the same time he rejected accusations that, as a member of the Daimler
supervisory board, he was guilty of insider trading.
Mr Steinkuhler heads IG Metall, the giant engineering workers' union, which
is currently involved in controversial strike action in eastern Germany to
gain rapid wage equalisation with the west.
He is said to be determined not to resign.
A union official admitted, however, that 'some people will be astonished' at
the revelations. 'There will always be social envy,' he said.
Mr Steinkuhler denied that he had any prior knowledge of a move to dissolve
the holding company, Mercedes Holding, which left him with a windfall profit
of DM64,000 on the shares he had bought.
He summoned an extraordinary press conference at his union headquarters in
Frankfurt yesterday to counter the charge of insider trading, and quoted Mr
Edzard Reuter, the chief executive of Daimler, in his defence.
'I cannot prove what I did not know at the time,' Mr Steinkuhler said.
Insider dealing is not legally barred in Germany, although bankers and
company officials are bound by a 'gentlemen's agreement' not to use inside
information. The government has promised to introduce legislation to control
the practice next year.
Mr Steinkuhler said he bought the shares with cash he had available to pay a
future income tax demand, for some DM976,000, shortly before they rose
almost 20 per cent in value.
Union officials admitted yesterday that Stern, the weekly news magazine,
appeared to have precise and accurate details of share transactions carried
out for Mr Steinkuhler by BfG bank.
They confirmed that the union leader, always known for his smart dressing
and good lifestyle, had an annual salary of 'more than DM200,000'.
According to a report in this week's issue of Stern, Mr Steinkuhler bought
2,100 MAH shares between March 18 and April 1 this year, for almost DM1m.
Half the total was bought on April 1, the very day he was attending a
supervisory board meeting of Daimler-Benz.
MAH was a special holding company established in 1975 to prevent the Shah of
Iran from acquiring a big stake in Daimler, Germany's largest company. Its
sole function is to hold a 25.23 per cent stake in Daimler.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Government knew of arms sales to Iraq via Jordan, inquiry
told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government agreed an important defence package with Jordan in 1985
although it suspected Jordan was being used to divert military equipment to
Iraq, according to evidence gathered by the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, inquiry counsel, said yesterday: 'Papers we have
seen show that by 1985 there was government knowledge that Jordan was being
used as a diversionary route for military equipment to Iraq.'
Under government guidelines at the time, during the Iran-Iraq war, no
equipment which might prolong the conflict should have been exported to
either combatant.
The revelation at the start of the second week of public hearings in the
Scott inquiry raises potentially embarrassing questions about a deal that
involved government ministers, and a secretive government-owned company.
Government documents held by the inquiry team show that in September 1985,
the government signed a memorandum of understanding between the UK and
Jordan. This was later to result in a Pounds 270m defence package which was
arranged by International Military Services (IMS), a defence company wholly
owned at the time by the Ministry of Defence.
In response to questions in parliament, both Mr John Major and Mrs Thatcher,
when prime minister, have in the past refused to comment on IMS on grounds
of commercial confidentiality.
Miss Baxendale referred to previously restricted MoD documents which show
that IMS was criticised by two defence officials in July 1985 for allegedly
attempting to evade the guidelines. The criticism referred to a contract for
armoured recovery vehicle spare parts to Iraq which were instead used to
supply tanks.
The inquiry also heard evidence yesterday from Sir Adam Butler, minister for
defence procurement between September 1984 and September 1985.
Questioned about government knowledge of Jordanian diversion of military
equipment and of the internal criticism of IMS, Sir Adam said he had no
personal knowledge of either, although he accepted that his post made him
responsible for IMS's conduct as a company.
The inquiry, headed by Lord Justice Scott, was set up in November in
response to public controversy surrounding the collapse of the
Matrix-Churchill case in which three former directors of the machine tools
company had been accused of illegally trying to export arms-making equipment
to Iraq. The inquiry is investigating whether official guidelines were
breached with the knowledge or complicity of the government.
The inquiry next Monday will take evidence from Sir Hal Miller, a former
leading Conservative backbencher who in April 1990 revealed that he had
warned the government about Iraq's supergun two years before parts for it
were seized by UK customs officers.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Retail sales growth boosts activity in other sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEADY growth by retailers is stimulating a pick-up in activity among
wholesalers and manufacturers, a Confederation of British Industry survey
shows today. The results indicate that the UK recovery is becoming better
established.
The CBI's monthly survey of the distributive trades says retailers in April
increased year-on-year sales volumes for the fourth month running.
Wholesalers stepped up orders with suppliers last month by the greatest
amount for more than five years, suggesting that manufacturers are starting
to share the benefits of recent increases in consumer spending.
For the distributive trades as a whole - retailers, wholesalers and car
dealers - the year-on-year increase in sales volumes last month was the
highest registered for four years. This month is also expected to be a good
one by many in the sector.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, head of CBI forecasts, said the survey - covering 490
businesses and 15,000 sales outlets - showed a 'definite pattern' of
stronger retail activity, boosting sales in other parts of the supply chain.
Damping any impressions that Britain may be about to see a strong upturn
from the recession, the CBI said sales trends in retailing, which accounts
for about a quarter of gross domestic product, had failed to accelerate in
recent months. Sales volumes in many parts of the distributive sector were
still below levels considered normal.
The monthly survey, taken between April 20 and May 5, shows that last month
a balance of 17 per cent of retailers reported a year-on-year rise in sales
volumes. The balance is the proportion of shops registering an increase in
sales less those reporting a fall.
It continued the trend of year-on-year sales increases first reported in
January, but the balance was less than the 25 per cent registered in March.
Wholesalers reported sales strongly ahead in April, compared with the
corresponding month last year. For the first time for more than seven years,
wholesalers think their stocks are inadequate to meet demand from retail
customers.
Among car dealers, sales rose in April compared with the same month last
year, although by a smaller amount than earlier this year.
The improvement in sales has been mainly reported by the largest stores,
confirming the impression that consumers are shopping for bargains at
outlets more likely to be offering discounts. Mail order companies have
generally experienced strong sales growth. Wholesalers selling office
equipment and computers have done particularly well.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Results of EC-wide poll show fall in support for integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A EUROPEAN Community-wide poll showing a fall in support for European
integration has been withheld by the European Commission until after today's
referendum in Denmark on the Maastricht treaty.
Senior Commission officials say the Eurobarometer poll, carried out by
independent national market research organisations under the aegis of the
Commission, shows a sharp drop in support for European unification in Spain,
Portugal and Greece, which until recently were solidly behind the Community
and Maastricht.
The survey took place before last week's latest devaluation of the Spanish
peseta and Portuguese escudo. But a similar survey last autumn, just before
the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism for EC currencies, triggered
strongly negative reactions in the UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland -
all of whose currencies ended up either having to devalue or float.
Three senior Commission officials confirm that Brussels decided to hold back
the latest Eurobarometer survey until the Danish referendum is over, even
though all recent opinion polls in Denmark point to a Yes vote. Formally
Commission officials in charge of the poll say although the results are
ready, publication has been held up until May 25 by procedural delays.
Officials who approve the interpretation of the results were only due to get
the figures last night.
The survey results this time last year were released on May 15. In 1991, in
the run-up to the Maastricht treaty, the spring survey emerged on May 2,
brimming with Euro-enthusiasm.
In spring 1991, 80 per cent of those polled supported 'efforts being made to
unify western Europe', with only 11 per cent against. A year later, in the
wake of the Maastricht summit, the majority was still 76 to 16 per cent.
Even by last autumn, the last published Eurobarometer poll after Denmark's
rejection of Maastricht, 73 per cent favoured unification with 19 per cent
opposed.
In last autumn's poll there were absolute majorities for the treaty in only
six countries; relative majorities (excluding the 'don't knows') in four;
and majorities against in the UK and Denmark, the two countries holding up
ratification. In Spain and Portugal, however, half those polled were
undecided.

<TEXT>
There will be a lot of red faces in financial markets, and probably some red
ink as well, if Danish voters reject the Maastricht treaty in today's
referendum. In theory a Yes vote would be a tonic for bond markets on the
edges of Europe's inner monetary core. With the Maastricht treaty back on
the rails there should be nothing to stop their yields converging with those
in Germany. With the exception of the Danish market itself, though, much of
this has already been anticipated. Ten-year French yields, for example, are
only around 35 basis points higher than those in Germany. Since a Yes vote
would allow Denmark to reduce its artificially high short-term interest
rates, there should be room for strong gains in short Danish bonds, which
currently yield around a full point more than their German equivalent.
The more awkward question concerns the impact on the German bond market. A
Yes vote in Denmark would finally deprive the D-Mark of pretension to safe
haven status. The German bond market would thus, once again, have to be
judged on its fundamentals. These include a relatively high inflation rate,
a large budget deficit which has resisted control, as well as a deepening
recession accompanied by cuts in short-term rates and a weaker currency.
That is no recipe for falling long-term yields.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who bought M&amp;G's shares as a geared investment in the UK stock
market had their faith rewarded by its half-year performance. A 28 per cent
increase in funds under management represented an impressive performance
when matched against the 16 per cent rise in the London market over the same
period. The virtues of the group's old fashioned emphasis on high-yielding
income and recovery stocks became apparent as the UK began to emerge from
recession. Its recovery fund recorded a 34 per cent rise in value following
a resurgence of interest in industrial companies.
The unsettling aspect of M&amp;G's results, however, was the disappointing level
of net unit trust sales at just Pounds 4m. Overall, unit trust sales grew by
47 per cent but redemptions were also sharply higher. There has recently
been high turnover in the unit trust industry as a whole. It may simply be
that, with equities finally recovering their historic highs, some investors
are cashing in their chips. But even though the trend is improving, M&amp;G is
sufficiently concerned to start researching the phenomenon.
Such worries may dampen the surge in M&amp;G's shares, which have outperformed
the market by 16 per cent since the start of the year. Sentiment may be
further damaged by the Office of Fair Trading's proposals requiring
independent financial advisers to reveal commission payments. This may not
help M&amp;G, which is heavily reliant on this distribution channel.

FT  18 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Whitbread
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitbread is starting to look more like a retailer than a brewer. Its answer
to the challenge from volume brewers like Bass is to walk away from the
battle for market share. Instead, it is now pushing its brand values, its
strengths in the off-trade, and, above all, food where its turnover is
beaten in the UK only by McDonalds. That looks a sensible approach. With a
share of only 13.5 per cent of the UK beer market, Whitbread could hardly
expect to win any battles based on volume. Instead of chasing low margin
business in the free on-trade it is almost certainly better off
concentrating on food where margins are higher and the gearing to recovery
greater.
Some risks remain. Whitbread will be at a disadvantage over brewers which
can manage greater economies of scale. It must also resist pressures from
supermarkets on its margins. The chances are that the sluggish beer market
will continue to hold back growth this year, but its approach may still give
it an edge over other brewers. Indeed the strategic question may eventually
become one of the extent to which it should remain in brewing at all.
Doubtless the arrival of Sir Michael Angus as chairman has helped focus
Whitbread's thoughts. He also appears to have homed in on a financial
weakness: poor cash generation. Last year's improvement reflected reduced
spending on plant, property and acquisitions and there will be a smaller
inflow from pub sales from now on. That should not matter much for a company
with such modest gearing, but Whitbread's restrictive share structure
precludes rights issues. It has to play safer on debt than others.

FT  18 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: US West calls Time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As is usually the case with those who have debt worries, Time Warner's
decision to part with some of its most valuable jewels is a sign of weakness
rather than strength. The company's new chairman, Mr Gerald Levin, has
recently made strenuous efforts to tackle the Dollars 10bn debt pile he
inherited from the 1989 merger of the two companies. He also wants to invest
in fibre-optic networks which will revolutionise the transmission of
information. With Time Warner's balance sheet stretched, he cannot afford to
do both out of operating cash flow alone. Hence the sale of 25 per cent of
Time Warner Entertainment to the regional telephone company US West for
Dollars 2.5bn.
The Dollars 1bn of equity which will flow into the entertainment business
will help fund the Dollars 5bn, five-year investment programme in
fibre-optic networks. Time Warner has made the Faustian bargain because it
gives it a head start on the competition and Time would find it difficult to
raise equity through the stock market at the kind of price US West is
paying. Time also argues that it is acquiring experience in handling
advanced switching technology from US West. It is at least arguable,
however, that it could have bought that expertise without ceding such a
large equity stake. US West, meanwhile, gains a share of the database which
will be the cornerstone of the network's profitability.
When fully optical networks are operating, the price of data transmission
will fall dramatically. Profits will then come predominantly from the
value-added services that can be sold through the wires, such as high-speed
computing, video telecoms, information and entertainment. Time Warner may
come to wish it had been able to pawn, rather than sell, those jewels.

FT  18 MAY 93 / 'UK knew arms leaked to Iraq': Scott inquiry learns
shipments via Jordan were suspected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government agreed an important defence package with Jordan in 1985
although it suspected Jordan was being used to divert military equipment to
Iraq, according to evidence gathered by the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, the counsel for the inquiry, said yesterday:
'Papers we have seen show that by 1985 there was government knowledge that
Jordan was being used as a diversionary route for military equipment to
Iraq.'
Under government guidelines at the time, during the Iran-Iraq war, no
equipment which might prolong the conflict should have been exported to
either combatant.
The revelation at the start of the second week of public hearings in the
Scott inquiry raises renewed and potentially embarrassing questions about a
deal that involved government ministers, and a secretive government-owned
company.
Government documents held by the inquiry team show that in September 1985,
the government signed a memorandum of understanding between the UK and
Jordan. This was later to result in a Pounds 270m defence package which was
arranged by International Military Services (IMS), a defence company wholly
owned at the time by the ministry of defence.
In response questions in parliament, both Mr John Major and Mrs Thatcher,
when prime minister, have in the past refused to comment on IMS on grounds
of commercial confidentiality.
Miss Baxendale referred to previously restricted MoD documents which show
that IMS was criticised by two defence officials in July 1985 for allegedly
attempting to evade the guidelines. The criticism referred to a contract for
the supply of armoured recovery vehicle spare parts to Iraq which were
instead used to supply tanks .
The inquiry also heard evidence yesterday from Sir Adam Butler, minister for
defence procurement between September 1984 and September 1985. Questioned
about government knowledge of Jordanian diversion of military equipment and
of the internal criticism of IMS, Sir Adam said he had no personal knowledge
of either, although he accepted that his post made him responsible for IMS's
conduct as a company.
The inquiry headed by Lord Justice Scott was set up in November in response
to public controversy surrounding the collapse of the Matrix-Churchill case
in which three former directors of the machine tools company had been
accused of illegally trying to export arms-making equipment to Iraq. The
inquiry is investigating whether official guidelines were breached with the
knowledge or complicity of the government.
The inquiry next Monday will take evidence from Sir Hal Miller, a former
leading Conservative backbencher who in April 1990 revealed that he had
warned the government about Iraq's supergun two years before parts for it
were seized by UK customs officers.
Evidence will be taken tomorrow from Mr Paul Channon, the former trade
minister.
Meanwhile, officials close to the inquiry confirmed that members of the
intelligence services are continuing to give evidence in private hearings,
but that the same opportunity will not be allowed for ministers.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Tough at the top
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TEMPTING though it may be to attack the governor-elect of the Bank of
England, Mr Eddie George, for accepting what amounts to a significant pay
increase in these dark times, this reaction would be misplaced. Since Mr
George wants his pay to be frozen over his five-year term, nobody can be
quite sure what his real pay will be. True, the starting point is higher
than at any other job in the public sector. It is also substantially higher
than that of Mr George's opposite number in the Treasury, Sir Terence Burns.
But then Sir Terence can console himself with the thought that as long as
the Bank is denied independent status, it is he who has the power, if not
the pay.
If Mr George's judgment is to be questioned, it might well be on the grounds
that he has been prepared to take a bet, in his personal financial
arrangements, on the future course of a monetary policy over which he has
only limited influence. Inflation is now almost certainly close to its low
point in the present economic cycle. If the gap between the yield on fixed
interest and index-linked gilts is any guide, the market is assuming a long
run rate of inflation of around 5 per cent. In short, by the time Mr George
retires, inflation will have reduced the purchasing power of the pound in
his pocket by more than 20 per cent.
There is thus every possibility that both the chancellor and his permanent
secretary will be catching up in real terms with Mr George over the next
five years. Only when they freeze their pay - or declare the Bank
independent - will the government's inflation target of 0-4 per cent begin
to carry much credibility.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Struggle to climb above the cloud: Low morale and rising
competition are the challenges facing British Airways' new bosses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Ayling, British Airways' new managing director, was taking a
steady stream of telephone calls last week in his Mexico City hotel suite,
at the same time as completing a memo to the airline's 49,000 employees.
Back in the company's London offices, Sir Colin Marshall, BA's new chairman,
was calling in a succession of senior advisers for a series of hectic
meetings.
Though thousands of miles apart, both men were engaged in final preparations
for the most important day in the company's annual diary.
For both of them, taking over in the wake of Lord King's retirement as
chairman, today's announcement of BA's financial results will be
particularly significant. It will be the first time that the airline's new
management team will have addressed the City of London since the company's
High Court libel settlement and humiliating apology in January to Mr Richard
Branson for the 'dirty tricks' campaign against his Virgin Atlantic Airways.
The airline has continued to outperform most of its competition. Overall,
BA's scheduled traffic rose by 12.3 per cent in the financial year ending
March on a capacity increase of 11.3 per cent. BA is expected to show a drop
of about a third in pre-tax profits for the financial year that ended in
March, to a figure of between Pounds 180m and Pounds 200m compared with
Pounds 284m the previous year. However, the majority of its competitors are
continuing to report huge losses.
Europe's biggest airlines, hit by recession, overcapacity and fierce fares
wars, saw their accumulated losses increase last year to Dollars 1.35bn from
Dollars 1.1bn in 1991, according to figures published last Friday by the
Association of European Airlines. And in the last three years, the
International Air Transport Association says western carriers have lost more
than Dollars 10bn on their international scheduled routes.
'Under the circumstances, our performance is wonderful,' says Mr Ayling. But
he is also the first to acknowledge that BA is entering a new era. The
'world's favourite airline', as BA likes to call itself, faces a number of
strategic questions which will test the mettle of its new top managers.
Externally, the company must continue to expand around the world at a time
of increasing airline deregulation and competition. Internally, the new team
faces an additional task: cleaning its own stables and restoring internal
morale after the Virgin case.
Mr Branson has launched new legal proceedings against BA and shows every
intention of maintaining the pressure on his bigger UK rival. BA's board has
again renewed its confidence in all the company's directors, stating
publicly last month that board members 'do not question the integrity' of
Sir Colin and Mr Ayling.
Despite their efforts to distance themselves from the 'dirty tricks'
campaign, a cloud still hangs over BA's management. The company has decided
not to give details of its side of the story because of the threat of
further litigation. But in the absence of any facts, speculation has been
allowed to run rife, creating considerable anger and frustration inside the
company.
If internal morale has been sapped by the Virgin affair, BA's UK workers
have become even more concerned about their own circumstances. Unions
representing pilots, cabin crews and ground staff have balloted their
members about industrial action. They are increasingly unhappy with BA's
plans to become a global airline and its intensified efforts to cut costs,
including the creation of low-cost subsidiaries for UK regional services and
for the loss-making short-haul European operations based at Gatwick,
acquired last year from Dan Air.
Sir Colin insists BA is not attempting to 'export' jobs through its
international partnerships with airlines in the US, Europe and Australia.
'We are trying to ensure BA becomes the lynchpin in the future global entity
for our business,' he explains. But he admits he would have preferred to
space out over a longer period of time the flurry of acquisitions the
company has made in the last four months.
The company has spent Pounds 500m to Pounds 600m acquiring strategic stakes
in USAir, Qantas of Australia, the French TAT regional carrier and a small
German carrier, as well as taking over Dan Air and the Plymouth-based Brymon
operations in the UK. To help finance these acquisitions and reduce gearing,
which stood at 46 per cent at the end of last year, City analysts expect BA
to launch a big rights issue when it announces its results today.
In his memo from Mexico City, Mr Ayling has attempted to reassure the
airline's staff that the company will do all it can to safeguard their jobs.
But he also warned it was necessary for the company to continue improving
efficiency, introducing, among other steps, a differential pay structure as
the only alternative to closure or disposal of loss-making UK operations.
US airlines have already introduced two tier wage systems to reduce costs of
lower yielding and unprofitable short-haul operations. But the concept is
new in Europe.
'Gatwick has always been a loss maker: British Caledonian lost money on its
short-haul routes and we found it difficult to improve the performance when
we took them over,' Mr Ayling said. The collapse of Dan Air offered BA a
'one-off' opportunity to change the level of costs of the airline's
operations at Gatwick, he added.
'If Gatwick is to work, we've got to have a lower cost base than we can live
with at Heathrow. We came right up front on that,' Sir Colin explains.
Gatwick has traditionally been a loss-making operation because of its higher
proportion of leisure to business traffic compared with Heathrow.
BA successfully restructured its UK regional operations last year into a
low-cost subsidiary with lower wage levels than at Heathrow. But the
decision to set up another low cost subsidiary at Gatwick has worried unions
and staff who fear BA will seek new labour concessions at Heathrow.
Mr Ayling has gone out of his way to stress that BA had no intention of
seeking pay reductions except 'in the wholly exceptional circumstances where
this is the only alternative to closure or disposal of parts of BA which are
making unsustainable losses'. This was the case for the Gatwick short-haul
operations, which are losing about Pounds 35m a year, and the UK regional
operations, which have now become profitable under their new lower cost
structure.
BA's labour costs 10 years ago accounted for about 35 per cent of the
airline's total annual costs. Today they have fallen to around 25 per cent.
This steady improvement in productivity is largely responsible for the
airline's profits this year when revenues and yields have been under
pressure.
With the exception of Belfast and the short-haul Gatwick operations, all the
airline's operations were profitable last year although the company made
less money on its traditionally lucrative North Atlantic routes because of
intense fare competition.
Sir Colin and Mr Ayling are now trying to create a new esprit de corps to
take staff and middle management with them as the airline adapts to the
competitive pressures of an increasingly global and deregulated airline
industry.
'The company is not hell bent in cutting people's pay and conditions,' Mr
Ayling insists. 'It is not trying to reduce the number of people employed -
quite the opposite. We are enlarging the company and trying to use the
benefits of globalisation to everyone's advantage.'
In the past 10 years BA's employment in the UK has grown from 37,000 to
49,000. The airline has been significantly more successful in lowering its
costs than its big European competitors. It must continue these efforts,
however. The UK government has actively encouraged new entrants and opened
up Heathrow to more competition.
'John King gave BA a new sense of commercialism. He brought that with Colin
who brought the necessary customer service and disciplines of management to
the company,' Mr Ayling says.
'My challenge is to take that on to the next stage,' he says, hoping to
achieve 'as much participation and sense of belonging as possible.'
Some in the company felt that the King-Marshall era created such a
competitive - and at times ruthless - atmosphere that staff may have felt
encouraged to overstep the boundaries of acceptable behaviour.
Now, with the Virgin dispute hanging over it, BA will have to be seen to be
whiter than white in an industry notorious for sharp practice. Pacing his
Mexico suite, Mr Ayling had no doubt of the task he faces. 'The challenge,'
he says, 'is to create a climate of enthusiasm and competitiveness within
the bounds of the acceptable.'

Surely something wrong with the City of London's sense of values? Of the 293
Square Mile banking jobs listed by Day Associates' latest pay survey, only
three carry average salaries of less than Pounds 10,000 whereas 13 are above
the Pounds 100,000 mark.
There's no prize for guessing that the best rewarded is the big branch
general manager, averaging Pounds 161,506 in salary which is typically
boosted by bonuses to Pounds 192,518. But who, apart from newly recruited
school leavers, d'you suppose is at the other end of the scale?
The tea lady with an average salary of Pounds 9,450 plus a measly bonus of
Pounds 160.65. That rates a general manager as worth more than 20 tea ladies
whereas, measured by their respective effects on staff morale, the ratio is
more probably the other way round.

Labour's 'vested interests' campaign highlighting links between the
Conservative party and business has hit a snag. The voters to whom the
campaign is supposed to speak apparently talk in a rather different language
than shadow chancellor Gordon Brown.
For starters, 'privatised utilities' is reckoned to be a pretty mind-bending
formulation, giving rise to 101 differing interpretations. The party's
research has also belatedly indicated that the public ain't too clear on the
meaning of a vested interest.
While the utilities have simply been banished from the lexicon, officials
are still puzzling over how to divest the vested interest of its linguistic
obfuscatory powers . . .

The government's handling of its own insolvency statistics becomes more and
more bizarre. It has already contracted out publication of the embarrassing
figures on corporate and personal failures to the British Chambers of
Commerce. Now it seems to have severed all links with the data by not even
issuing a release that they are available. First warning that the latest
figures were out came via a press release offering reaction from the
ever-more responsive body of the UK's remaining growth industry: the Society
of Practitioners of Insolvency.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Still on the subject of Earls, Observer doffs his hat to Peter Earl, the
38-year-old merchant banker who helped put Rebecca Stephens on top of the
world yesterday. Until now Earl has been better known for organising some of
the City's more memorable takeover jaunts than for his extramural
activities.
However, as joint leader of the 40th anniversary Everest expedition he has
set an example which other gung ho corporate finance types might want to
ponder. His assistant tells me that Earl will be back at work at the
headquarters of his Sloane Corporate Finance boutique first thing on Monday
morning.

Will Sir Terence Conran's upmarket eaterie, Quaglino's, be knocked out of
its highly successful orbit by the upstart Planet Hollywood?
Robert Earl, the 41-year-old burger-master behind the star-studded new
arrival, cites Quaglino's estimated Pounds 12m annual turnover as a target
he plans to beat by at least Pounds 3m. But 61-year-old Sir Terence remains
relaxed: 'Judging by this week's bookings, the stars who have come to open
Planet Hollywood will come to sit down and eat at Quaglino's' . . . if they
can get a table that is.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Observer: Morgan's upgrade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The reshuffle at the top of the M&amp;G Group has not resolved the long-term
management succession issue at one of Britain's biggest independent fund
managers. David Morgan, who will take over from Paddy Linaker as group
managing director in the summer of 1994, is of a similar age to Linaker.
Morgan, 59, does not view himself as a caretaker chief executive. But it
still looks like a relatively temporary appointment whilst the next
generation of M&amp;G's management is tested out. On present form finance
director Tony Shearer, 44, seems most likely to end up running the show,
especially since he has been upgraded to chief operating officer. But if he
does, then M&amp;G may have to ditch its rather out-dated prejudice that only
fund managers can manage fund management firms.

When tipping political stars, as opposed to the stock market, Kleinwort
Benson's record is better than most. Hence the appointment of David
Willetts, ex-director of the Centre for Political Studies, as its political
consultant has caught the eye.
Judging by the careers of most of Willetts' predecessors, such as John
Biffen, Chris Patten and Michael Portillo, the 37-year-old MP may be bound
for ministerial office. Certainly Judith Chaplin had been marked out before
her untimely death.
But it seems odd that KB did not reappoint Nigel Forman, Chaplin's
predecessor and Nigel Lawson's former PPS, as its consultant. After all, he
has just replaced Chaplin as parliamentary adviser to the Institute of
Chartered Accountants, and only gave up his KB post a year ago to become a
junior Education minister.
Could KB's psephologists have decided that Forman is no longer marked out
for high office? For what it's worth, Observer's view is that the ICA's gain
is KB's loss.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Drugs prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRUG industry's fat profit margins have made it an easy target for the
Clinton administration in its struggles to find a way to bring US health
care costs under control. Allegations of profiteering, combined with threats
of price curbs, have taken their toll on pharmaceutical company share
prices. And, though mandatory price controls now seem less likely than a few
months ago, the industry has felt a need to respond by proposing a voluntary
price cap.
Price controls, whether of a mandatory or voluntary kind, are not the way to
bring prices down. They would probably prevent drugs bills from falling as
quickly as they could. They would also endanger research into new drugs.
Instead, as Mrs Hillary Clinton's health task force puts the final touches
to its blueprint for reform, it should rely on competitive market forces to
deliver better value for money.
In industries characterised by monopoly - such as gas, telecommunications,
electricity and water - price regulation is unavoidable if consumers'
interests are to be protected. The pharmaceutical industry is not such an
industry. Patent protection gives companies a limited monopoly. But, when
drugs come off patent, generic competitors are usually available at a
fraction of the price. Even while patent protection continues, most drugs
have rivals which, although not exact copies, are equally effective.
The problem is not one of a lack of competing products but of the failure of
purchasers to shop around. Prescription decisions too rarely take account of
prices, because doctors consider it their job to cure patients rather than
control costs, leaving insurers and taxpayers to pick up the tab. Such
limited price sensitivity has allowed drug companies to get away with what
have sometimes been sharp price hikes. Introducing price controls in such a
market would be damaging.
On the one hand, there would be a danger of imposing controls which were too
harsh. This would have the effect of disrupting research into drugs to
tackle illnesses such as Aids, Alzheimer's and cancer. But controls could be
too lax, with the result that patients' interests were sold short.
Even if controls were miraculously just right, they would have the effect of
stifling the development of a more competitive market and the dynamic
efficiency gains that would flow from it. There is scope for cost savings in
all the drug companies' activities, but introducing price caps could very
easily turn the industry into a government-licensed cartel.
A better way to control costs is to encourage purchasers to shop more
diligently. This is already happening among health maintenance organisations
and other 'managed care' providers, which take an active interest in whether
the drugs their doctors prescribe are good value. Since they are only
prepared to pay for drugs that meet that test, they are able to pick and
choose between rival companies' products and often receive substantial
discounts.
The Clinton administration is well aware of these benefits and is keen to
extend them to the whole population through an overall approach to health
care, dubbed managed competition. Such an approach would not only deliver
better value for money in the short run. It would also give the industry a
spur to greater efficiency, so holding out the prospect of better value in
the future, while maintaining the incentive to develop new drugs.
Combining this policy with price caps would be unnecessary. It would also
undermine the idea of a competitive market.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Leading Article: New agenda in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT FOR the first time in the saga of German unity, a compromise has been
reached - this time over the pay dispute in the east German metal industry -
which brings relief, but no joy. An accord at the end of last week provides
a formula for ending a fortnight-old strike, the first prolonged stoppage in
eastern Germany for more than 60 years. It postpones equal wages in the east
and west German engineering industry for two years until 1996. But it does
little to head off the risk that the region east of the Elbe will become
permanently dependent on funding and favours from the west.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the leader of the IG Metall trade union, is right to
say the accord has implications for the whole of Germany. The agreement may
not however live up to Mr Steinkuhler's claim that it will 'strengthen
confidence in (German) unity'. Unless his country can adjust quickly and
decisively to the economic consequences, the deal carries the risk of
further undermining the chances of making German unification a success.
The bitterness of the dispute has been increased by government promises in
1990 to bring easterners speedily to west German living standards.
Politically, an agreement was necessary to avoid perpetuating east Germans'
status as second class citizens. From an economic point of view, however,
the accord is not justifiable.
Employers have secured the conditional right to 'opt-out' clauses for
enterprises which cannot afford officially-sanctioned pay increases. The
effective east German unemployment rate is already, however, about 30 per
cent. Struggling with burdens inherited both from communist central planning
and (in milder form) from mistakes in Bonn's unity policies, east German
enterprises are grossly uncompetitive at present pay and productivity
levels. By winning a 1993 pay increase of about 15 per cent - compared with
the employers' offer of 9 per cent and the 26 per cent due under a flawed
1991 agreement - many east German workers know they are pricing themselves
out of jobs.
The west must pay a price, too. Partly because of the desire to prevent
large westward migration, west Germans have, in effect, undertaken to
underwrite large financial transfers to their eastern brethren at least
until the end of the century. The cost of financing these transfers will be
bearable only if west Germans rise to the challenge of increasing the
dynamism and efficiency of their own economic arrangements.
To help job creation, west German employees will have to accept cuts in real
earnings both this year and next. Further cuts in social spending, already
presaged by latest news of recession-induced shortfalls in tax receipts, are
badly needed. By promoting the 'opt-out' possibilities now agreed in eastern
collective bargaining, the government should push employers and trade unions
towards much greater wage flexibility in the west as well. Additionally, the
country badly needs longer working hours - both per week and over the whole
of an individual's life - to tackle acute financing problems in the health
and pensions systems.
Germany's deep recession is probably not the best time to push through
much-needed reforms. But at least now there are no illusions about quick or
easy solutions. The agenda has been made lengthier, and more difficult, by
the errors in dealing with German reunification. The penalty for inaction is
considerable; but so will be the reward for eventual success.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Men's room only: John Authers on moves by women to breach
the 'glass ceiling' at Oxford University
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women stormed Oxford University's 'walls of Jericho' a century ago, when the
first women's colleges were established.
This afternoon, at a meeting in the Sheldonian Theatre of Congregation, the
university's governing body, they will attempt to breach the 'glass
ceiling'.
The rest of Britain's academic community will be watching with keen
interest. In universities across the country, women have succeeded in
gaining access to the student body on almost equal terms at the lower
levels, but the opportunities for promotion remain limited.
Only six out of 178 Oxford professors, and four of the 69 readers - the next
academic rank down - are women. This cannot be explained by low numbers of
applicants because female representation in the lower echelons is much
healthier - 12.5 per cent of university lecturers, 27.1 per cent of college
lecturers, and 42 per cent of undergraduates are women.
These figures are only slightly worse than the national averages. A survey
by the Association of University Teachers shows that only 5 per cent of
professors at 'old' universities (excluding former polytechnics which have
recently gained university status) are women, up from 3 per cent in 1989-90.
Two-thirds of current female professors have been appointed within the past
five years.
Critics say UK universities suffer from the phenomenon, noted in other
professions, of an invisible ceiling to promotion - women can enter, but
then find it very difficult to break through a layer of 'glass' to upper
tiers.
The experience of one female professor at a northern university sums up the
argument: 'Benevolent sponsorship is what a lot of us have up to a certain
level, and then the green-eyed monster comes in. Once you become a threat
unreasonable criticism is levelled at your work. It's very hard to
identify.'
Now, a group of 79 Oxford academics believes it has spotted systematic
discrimination, on top of the cultural barriers. The academics have forced a
vote in Congregation, which this afternoon will decide whether Oxford's
current system for apportioning funds and promotions is discriminatory.
The move follows a decision by Oxford to use the Pounds 100,000 available
for promotions this year to create new professorships, rather than
readerships for which the money had originally been intended.
The university did so because it felt that Oxford academics would enjoy more
clout nationally and internationally if they carried the title of
'professor'.
But an article in a university journal, Oxford Gazette, by two Oxford
lawyers, Sandra Fredman and John Gardner suggests that the decision to
create more professorships discriminates against women, because few women
are senior enough realistically to challenge for a professorship.
The article adds that the decision could fall foul of the Sex Discrimination
Act, and 'offers a splendid opportunity for a test case'. It claims that the
disproportionate number of men gaining promotion 'might be accepted by the
courts as sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination'.
In its defence, a spokesman for Oxford said four women have been appointed
to established chairs in the past two years, and that Oxford has started
from 'a very low base' - until 1979, two-thirds of its colleges admitted
only men.
The lawyers have won support from outside Oxford. Mr David Triesman, AUT
general secretary, describes the Oxford statistics as 'more like the dark
ages than the dark blues', but points out that the picture is hardly
brighter elsewhere in the UK. He adds, for example, that female professors
are paid less on average than their male counterparts, according to an AUT
survey.
Mr Triesman says government funding councils should take account of
universities' success in promoting women when distributing grants.
Yet woman academics appear more concerned by issues of culture than by pay
disparities. Many seem to agree that positive discrimination and quotas are
not the answer. Rather, their focus seems to be on reversing the culture of
British universities which many finding intimidating, as reflected by their
academic underperformance - Oxford women are only half as likely to get a
first as Oxford men, while nationally the proportion rises to two-thirds.
At higher academic levels women often fall victim to unconscious prejudice
from professorial committees, which are also male-dominated. Both professor
Joan Busfield, pro-vice-chancellor of Essex University, and Professor Ruth
Lister, of Bradford University, use the same word to describe the problem:
gravitas. Senior men are more likely to see this quality in other senior men
than in women.
Professor Lister says: 'It often comes down to man's judgment of gravitas.
You can see how sometimes women may not fit the implicit criteria, and which
may push male selectors towards male candidates.' Ms Emma Westcott, a
student at Oxford, expresses this more passionately: 'The problem is that
the system has been built around men for 750 years. Are we prepared to
change ourselves to reflect the diversity we now have?'

FT  18 MAY 93 / Letter: UK farmers would do better without CAP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY ROSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Every concerned taxpayer should support MEP Terry Wynn's protest about
the short-sighted increase of Pounds 800m in Common Agricultural Policy
funding (Letters, May 10).
Contrary to popular thought almost all efficient British farmers would agree
with him, for fraud and incompetence have made the CAP an anachronistic and
fraudulent nonsense.
The recent EC report on the subject of CAP fraud lists corruption to the
extent of Pounds 198m. But the newly appointed president of the EC's Court
of Auditors estimates CAP fraud in 1992 to have been not less than Pounds
6bn.
Quite apart from fraud, the majority of the Pounds 26bn annual spending on
the CAP is not achieving its objectives. Research by Professor David Harvey
of Newcastle University suggests that less than 20 per cent of the CAP's
spending actually helps farmers.
The majority of British farmers would be far better off were there to be a
rapid termination of the CAP and if they were to be allowed to compete on a
fair trading basis.
New Zealand has eradicated all agricultural subsidies and their agriculture
is now booming. Is there not a lesson to be learned here?

FT  18 MAY 93 / Letter: Mission in need of more than written message
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PERNILLE AHLSTROM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is wisdom in the old saying 'a picture speaks a thousand words'.
With reference to Lucy Kellaway's article on mission statements (Management:
'Man with a mission', May 10), it is clear that the written word is not
enough to give meaning to an organisation in the eyes of its employees - or,
indeed, its management. A company can spend a great deal of time
soul-searching and consulting to come up with the right statement only to
see it instantly emasculated by the confused messages of a hodge-podge of
signs, brochures, variations of a logo and an often inconsistent quality of
writing.
So the message of the mission statement must be seen to be acted upon, which
means it must permeate everything the organisation says and does. Marks and
Spencer, for example, communicates its message so well that a mission
statement blazoned on the corporate walls would actually be superfluous and
would be seen to indicate a lack of confidence. M and S, however, has a
physical presence and operates in a highly visual world with tangible,
packaged products.
The City operates in a world of invisible services dependent upon the spoken
and written word where reassurance is vital to success because no one can
actually see what it does. Here the approach and attitude towards employees
and clients/customers become the main channel for a mission statement
message.
For a City organisation, the most tangible and effective means of being seen
to be acting upon that message is through a clear and consistent corporate
identity. In other words, the company must not only sound as if it knows
what it is doing and where it is going, it must also look it.
Doing otherwise is a waste of effort, time and money.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Bicycle ride to a revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long relative decline of Britain will continue until there is a
revolution. What kind of revolution? One answer is given by Professor
Stephen Haseler in a new book entitled The End of the House of Windsor -
Birth of a British Republic*. Our author is professor of government at
Guildhall University, London. 'The dawning truth about Britain in the
post-war period,' he writes, 'is that the country seems to be running out of
options. We have tried virtually every strategy for survival.'
Yes, yes, but what kind of revolution? Well, actually, a cultural
revolution. Back to the professor. ' . . . Our culture - the way we think,
the way we talk, the values we live by, indeed 'the British way of life' -
no longer allows us to compete effectively in the modern commercial world.'
As he sees it, the way to change the culture is by reform of our governing
institutions and indeed the constitution itself. Turning our monarchy into a
republic would certainly achieve that. 'My argument here', writes Professor
Haseler, 'is that, over time, new attitudes and aspirations would follow.'
Ordinarily, none of this would matter. It could be dismissed as academic
pub-talk. Maybe it still can. But it is possible that the professor is
pulling at a loose thread of indeterminate length. His book appears at a
moment when the competence of the government is more deeply in doubt than at
any time since 1945. That would be bad enough, but the opposition is divided
and its largest component, the Labour party, presently inspires little
confidence. We are heading towards a mid-1990s election in which the choice
before us may be between competing B-teams. This is frustrating. It has not
led to marches behind republican banners, but the political atmosphere is
becoming more hospitable to those who propound systemic reforms.
So is the social climate. The behaviour of some of the royal children has
eroded loyalties that once seemed beyond question. The Queen herself remains
popular. Her position is, deservedly, secure. What comes after her is,
however, unpredictable. Visitors to Britain do not have to move very far
from the airport to discover that the House of Windsor faces an uncertain
future. Just pick up any newspaper, or look out for a clutch of books - some
published, some about to be - that seek to catch the tide built up by the
tittle-tattle of the tabloids. Professor Haseler does not shrink from
exploiting this phenomenon. 'It is fitting,' he writes, 'that the travails
of Diana and Charles's marriage should be the catalyst for major change.'
The same series of events has encouraged The Times, once a rock of
allegiance to the throne, to associate itself with the reformist Charter 88
movement in a forthcoming conference on 'The Monarchy, the Constitution and
the People'. This gathering, due on Saturday, will be addressed by staunch
monarchists, moderate reformers, and Professor Haseler. We should not
conclude that Mr Rupert Murdoch, a suspect republican, is using his posh
London newspaper for nefarious purposes. I wouldn't know anything about
that. The pertinent point is that a journal that carries the court circular
every day is facilitating a debate on the monarchy that 20 or 30 years ago
might have been deemed treasonable. That is how far public opinion has
moved.
It still has a mighty long way to go before there is a republican movement
in Britain. In spite of my dreams of a federal republic in these islands I
would stop well before that, and settle for a Dutch, Belgian or Scandinavian
form of dis-established throne. Professor Haseler dismisses such a solution
as certain to fail. But consider the essence of the argument, his and mine,
in favour of constructing a new British constitution by removing the crown,
the keystone, from the arch of the present antiquated structure.
It is the crown that supports, and is supported by, the anachronistic House
of Lords; the crown in whose name ministers feel able to sign treaties, such
as the one concluded at Maastricht, in the absence of parliamentary
approval; the crown that legitimises the thousand and one decisions made in
the dark corridors of Whitehall every day. Replace its authority with that
of a written constitution, dismiss the House of Lords and elect a senate,
and you have quite enough revolution for the average English family to
stomach.
Europe's little northern monarchies have solved the problem. They do not
have hereditary upper houses of parliament, and their constitutions specify
exactly what their kings and queens may do. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark
has 'supreme authority in all the affairs of the realm', but, as with the
conclusion of treaties, only with the consent of the Folketing. Likewise
Queen Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard of the Netherlands. She may appoint her
prime ministers by decree, but does so on the report of a 'formateur' to the
effect that he or she commands a majority.
No such sliver of ambiguity prevails in Sweden, whose constitution provides
for the speaker of the Riksdag to propose a new prime minister. Government
decisions do not require King Karl XVI Gustaf's signature. King Baudouin of
Belgium has far greater nominal powers (he is the supreme head of the
executive). But in practice he does not exercise them.
British subjects who see the need for reform but insist that the person of a
respected monarch is a focus for national loyalties may thus have their cake
and eat it, simply by learning from the Low Countries and the Scandinavians.
These are in essence republics, in which authority is derived from the
people. For reasons of their own they retain their cycling monarchs. We may
have to do the same. Perhaps the Union Jack is not an adequate substitute
for a crowned head, as the stars and stripes are in the US, or the abstract
notion of the state is in France. Perhaps our revolution, when it comes, has
to stop short.
The chances of this happening are becoming real. The Labour party's
proposals for constitutional reform say little about the monarchy, but if
the other parts are enacted, the rest will surely follow. We may be in for
permanent Conservative government, but this seems doubtful. One day an
electable, reforming, alternative will be on offer. With any luck, the
British polity will then become like that of Italy a year or so ago:
pregnant with sudden change.

<TEXT>
Sir, Following further devaluations of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese
escudo the exchange rate mechanism has been totally discredited as an
instrument of policy.
It should now be clear that attempts to impose linked, or semi-fixed
exchange rates on groups of currencies within a global market of floating
exchange rates is a perilous interference with market forces.
The exchange rate mechanism is unable to cope with differential economic
growth rates among its monetary constituencies. European governments must
now decide whether to adopt fixed or floating exchange rates. Governments
may wish to adopt exchange rate target bands to finesse policy objectives
but these must be confidential or the speculators will have their day.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Buck stops at De Benedetti: How the Olivetti case will
affect Italy's corruption scandals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The direct involvement of Olivetti, Italy's fifth largest private industrial
group, in the country's ever-widening corruption scandals has removed any
lingering doubt that it was possible to do business with the Italian public
sector without paying bribes to the political establishment.
At the weekend, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the head of the computer and office
equipment manufacturer, provided Milan magistrates with details of how over
the past decade it had been obliged to pay bribes to be considered for
government contracts. Olivetti joins a long list of Italian groups, topped
by Fiat, who have admitted - either forcibly or voluntarily - to providing
illicit funds to the politicians in return for obtaining favourable
treatment.
The impact of Olivetti's disclosure is likely to be profound, hastening the
process whereby other business leaders come forward to declare their own
illicit payments. The news also emphasises the need for a new ethical code
for both Italian businesses and international companies operating in the
country.
The headline on one of yesterday's Italian newspapers summed up the
sentiment: 'Even Olivetti has paid'. Until now Mr De Benedetti has
consistantly denied his group was tainted by the system of corruption which
has been uncovered over the past 15 months. This was his message to
shareholders as late as last month. But on Sunday he decided to hand over to
the magistrates a dossier of Olivetti's behind-the-scenes dealings with the
politicians over the past decade.
Five episodes are detailed, the most important of which concerns L10.4bn
paid to a 'collector' on behalf of the political parties for contracts with
the Ministry of Posts. In all Olivetti has paid out close to L20bn to
politicians since Mr De Benedetti took control of the group in 1978.
'I personally have never paid any money myself but I accept full
responsibility for the actions of my group,' he told the FT yesterday. He
said he had no intention of passing the blame lower down the management
ladder.
Mr De Benedetti's behaviour contrasts sharply with that of Fiat. The
Turin-based automotive group, headed by Mr Giovanni Agnelli, pretended for
almost a year to be above paying to obtain contracts. Even when its
executives were arrested, they spent long periods in jail refusing to admit
to any wrong-doing. But last month Fiat changed tactics. Mr Cesari Romiti,
the chief executive, admitted the group had been involved in paying bribes
and gave details to the magistrates.
Nevertheless, blame for Fiat's past behaviour has not been placed on the
shoulders of the company's two most senior figures. Thus the most senior
people implicated remain Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, the chief operating officer,
and Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, the chief financial officer - respectively
number three and four in the organisation.
Although Mr De Benedetti said he may not have known about the mechanics of
Olivetti's dealings with the political establishment, he accepted full
blame.
Yet his statement to the magistrates in fact goes further than admitting
guilt. Instead, he has cast the Italian business executive in the role of
victim - the corrupted not the corruptor. 'The emissaries of the political
parties (in government) imposed a general condition which could be summed up
as 'if you don't pay, you can't work with us',' he told the magistrates. The
threats, he said, were little short of those of racketeers and extortioners.
Mr De Benedetti told the FT that the Ministry of Posts had threatened to
withdraw business from Olivetti if it did not pay bribes. In 1987 purchases
by this ministry were only L2.1bn. The following year - after the group had
agreed to pay 2 per cent of the value of orders by the ministry - purchases
jumped to L204bn.
Politicians involved in the scandals have testified that the business
leaders were often ready accomplices. They obtained not just contracts but a
whole 'political cover'. Benefits included cheap state credits, government
help in covering unemployment benefit and a series of invisible barriers
operated by the Italian administration to exclude foreign competition.
Mr De Benedetti insisted, however, he had been obliged to pay to maintain
Olivetti's 60,000-strong workforce, and he resisted the system of corruption
as much as he could. As a result, less than 5 per cent of his group's
turnover was with the public administration - while international
competitors such as France's Bull and Germany's Siemens had a far greater
share of their turnover linked to government sales in their home countries.
Asked why he did not publicly denounce such pressures, Mr De Benedetti said:
'1993 is not 1987. Then there was a regime running the country.'
This is a reference to the way in which the Christian Democrats and
Socialists, the main partners in government, had carved up control of the
public administration and needed vast sums of money to pay for their party
bureaucracies and the luxurious lifestyles of their members. Mr De Benedetti
told Milan magistrates these parties had exacted a sort of company
protection tax.
Mr De Benedetti claimed his attitude had been consistent throughout. Last
June, when he discovered that one company in the group, Sasib, had been
involved in paying bribes for the Milan metro contract, the manager was
instructed to co-operate with magistrates immediately.
He said he did not take the initiative in going to the magistrates himself
until after Olivetti's name was directly questioned. This happened in the
past 10 days with the arrest of two figures connected with the Ministry of
Posts and Asst, the state telephone service company. 'I kept quiet for the
simple reason that I wanted to protect both the company and the
shareholders.'
The group is already in a delicate financial position which reflects the
downturn in the international computer market. Preliminary estimates of 1992
losses are in the region of L650bn; losses are also expected at CIR and
Cofide, Olivetti's listed holding companies.
Mr De Benedetti appeared sanguine on the possibility of shareholders'
raising the issue of falsifying accounts to hide bribes. Olivetti accounts,
he pointed out, contained a heading of 'non-itemised expenditure' under
which illicit political payments had been made. By so declaring the
payments, he says, 'we have even paid taxes on these monies'.
Nevertheless these revelations have badly tarnished Mr De Benedetti's image,
which he has fought hard to recoup since his brief involvement in the 1982
collapse of Banco Ambrosiano. Mr De Benedetti is still waiting for Italian
justice to run its slow course in that case, in which he is appealing
against the decision of a court of first instance in April 1992 to sentence
him to six years in prison on charges of fraudulent bankruptcy.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Letter: Accountability in local government funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN SQUIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read your editorial headed 'Local Finance' (May
13). Certainly the report from the Audit Commission on Standard Spending
Assessments (SSAs) is a timely contribution to our current review. We
welcome its finding that SSAs are a more sophisticated system for equalising
needs than any overseas system it examined, as well as an improvement on its
predecessor.
You and the report rehearse separately the familiar argument that council
tax should bear a greater proportion of local government expenditure. As the
new tax settles in, this is clearly something that will be carefully
considered each year.
Your suggestion that local accountability (which we both agree is important)
would be enhanced by returning the business rate to local authorities is
more questionable.
Where is the increased accountability to the local electorate in such a
move? Moreover, how can you suggest such a power would require 'capping'
while you appear to endorse criticism of identical powers in respect of
council tax?

Sir, The next time readers rebuke Edward Mortimer for 'going on about
Bosnia', to the relative exclusion of other areas of communal conflict such
as Armenia and Tajikstan ('Twin track to Bosnia peace', May 12), he should
respond by pointing out that Bosnia actually lies closer to the 'heart of
Europe' than Britain does. So, even if one sets aside all moral
considerations, the notion that the area can be neatly quarantined and then
conveniently ignored is ridiculous.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Letter: Argentina active in meeting loan terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S SHAHID HUSAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article recounting the pressures on the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank to lend quickly to the former Soviet Union quoted an
unnamed G7 official as questioning how much conditionality there was in the
bank's recent lending to Argentina ('Much ado about lending', May 12).
The answer is, plenty. Since 1990, the Argentine government has undertaken a
major reform programme, and we have made four large adjustment loans to
support it. Compliance so far has been excellent; two of the loans are fully
disbursed. The government negotiated with the bank actions in three key
areas: the downsizing and improvement of a bloated and poorly-paid public
administration; reform of an inflation-prone financial sector; and sale or
closure of grossly inefficient public enterprises.
Some of the actions we jointly agreed on in public administrative reform
were the reduction of the national government workforce by 130,000, far
better pay for the rest, and a virtual ending of tax loopholes. The latter
helped Argentina raise its tax revenue from 13 per cent of gross domestic
product in 1989 to more than 22 per cent last year.
Financial reforms included a new charter for the Central Bank, the closure
of a large industrial bank, and sale of the country's largest savings bank.
The public enterprise reforms have been even more impressive. They include a
new charter for the national oil company permitting its sale to private
owners, privatisation of the national railway system (after reducing its
workforce by 30,000), national telephone company, Buenos Aires electricity
system, national gas complex, a series of major and minor oil fields, the
largest steel mill and petrochemical complex in the country, and sale or
closure of more than 20 enterprises owned by the defence ministry. The
programme, now approaching completion, is one of the most ambitious in the
hemisphere.
Your unnamed G7 official should have known better.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Arts: Schnittke for south-coast sophisticates - Music at the
Brighton Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday, as part of a lightning European tour, the Saint Paul Chamber
Orchestra under Hugh Wolff came briefly to rest in the Dome at Brighton. No
signs at all of travel-tiredness: the prestigious ensemble from Minnesota
gave an excellent concert. They opened with a Tombeau de Couperin Suite as
crisp and crystalline as one could wish - just enough lemon-juice for
Ravel's exquisitely on-the-edge harmonies. James Galway, the soloist in
Mozart's G major Flute Concerto, made the (by Mozartian standards) garrulous
piece seem more rewarding than usual. For the playing's sake, one forgave
Edwin Roxburgh's over-elaborate cadenza.
At this point in the programme while Londoners on the following evening were
offered Barber's Adagio for String, we south-coast sophisticates were
treated to Schnittke's Mozart a la Haydn, in which a group of string players
assemble in darkness to faint harmonics and fainter pluckings. When the
lights come up, standing in a semi-circle, they exchange and play with
Mozartian references until the process is reversed into darkness again. More
than a good Festival diversion; a late descendant, surely, of Tchaikovsky's
Mozartiana, and nobody can say he didn't love Mozart. And Haydn? Well, he
made more musical jokes than most composers.
On Wednesday in Hove Town Hall two very distinguished senior artists to whom
music-lovers owe an enormous amount, Victoria de los Angeles and Nicolai
Gedda, gave a joint recital. A solo group each and two helpings of duets.
For some reason vocal duets designed mainly for domestic performance sound a
little sad in public. In their Schumann group one admired the style in spite
of some wavering intonation. Musically there is little in the duets that
Schumann did not do better elsewhere. A French group included two delightful
examples by Saint-Saens, whose endless output continually discloses
unexpected good things, also a rarely-heard humorous item by Berlioz - 'Le
Trebuchet'.
Gedda's solos, all Tchaikovsky, included 'At the ball' which he does so well
and a dashing 'Don Juan's serenade'. Plenty of metal left in the tone when
required. For her part Mme de los Angeles gave us Falla's Seven popular
Spanish songs. Lovely phrases, artfully shaped and shaded, in the quieter
songs ('Cancion' especially) but no longer the ferocity for, say, the final
'Polo'. With respect, the choice of Falla was not entirely wise. There are
so many other Spanish songs requiring a less vivid contrast and pointing of
moods. Geoffrey Parsons' accompaniments were admirable.
A footnote to what has already been written about the City of Birmingham
Touring Opera's hearteningly enterprising staging of Rameau's Les Boreades,
which I caught at the first of two end-of-tour appearances at the
Goldsmiths' Leisure Centre at Crowborough. This is the kind of
non-theatrical space (but modern, not picturesquely dilapidated) that may
make an opera producer's heart leap for joy but denies a larger proportion
of his audience a good view of the stage than the least democratically
planned conventional opera house with side boxes and all that. The place was
boomingly reverberant yet three singers, Peter Jeffes, Peter Snipp and
Jonathan Best, took trouble and got their words across. It may be
coincidental that they also produced more agreeable tone than any of their
colleagues.
The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra concert was sponsored by American Express.
The recital in Hove Town Hall was given in association with the National
Arts Collection Fund

FT  18 MAY 93 / Arts: On the figurative art carousel - William Packer
wonders why Tony Bevan appears to be Britain's only artist celebrated abroad
for this particular skill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Bevan is now 42, a product of the Goldsmiths' College and the Slade of
the early 1970s. He is also that comparatively rare creature in his
generation, a figurative painter who has been much supported by our
principal cultural agencies such as the British Council, and has shown
abroad with considerable success, most notably in Germany and California.
And good luck to him, of course. It is only his very rarity as an artist
working ostensibly from the figure, and shown as such on our behalf abroad
in the company of other, more conceptual and abstract favourites, that
should give us pause.
There he stands, by inference the sole worthy British representative of his
kind in the eyes of our cultural officers and selectors. 'What do you mean',
we hear them cry, 'we never push our younger figurative painters? But we put
Tony Bevan into the Aperto of the Venice Biennale of 1988.'
It is a self-fulfilling ploy, at once justification and excuse. We have only
to wait until 1989 to find Carla Schulz-Hoffmann, in her introductory essay
to Bevan's show at the Staatsgalerie Moderner Kunst at Munich, having cited
Auerbach, Bacon, Freud, Moore and Hockney in general terms, going on to say:
'Other than these well-established big names, each of whom has developed his
own form of figurative art, it is only seldom that promising younger artists
emerge, and one rarely encounters British names among the riders on the
international artistic carousel.' Quite so.
And so why should Bevan be the brave exception? His canvases vary in size
but the format is uniformly simple, a head or figure presented directly
against an intense colour or tonal field. The images are decidedly more
graphic than painterly in their realisation, for all the dense impasto of
the pigment on the surface. These are self-consciously dramatic, iconic
presences, that strike powerfully upon the viewer's eye and imagination, at
least at first. And they are worked not directly from reality but at a
certain remove, from photographs.
The theme of Bevan's current exhibition at Whitechapel is The Meeting, which
turns out to be a meeting, who knows whether for performance or rehearsal,
of a small, nameless, male-voice choir. Surrounded by studies and single
heads, the centrepiece is a polyptych that brings the group together in
three ranks, mouths agape, gazing intently out at us, the unseen audience.
The only thing is that, immediately impressive as this new work is in the
old way of strong graphic silhouette, dense surface and bright colour, any
longer and closer scrutiny reveals it to be very poorly done, all of it.
The drawing is weak and the painting worse than weak, for it is clear that
Bevan has no understanding of form, and no technique at all for modelling
and realising it convincingly within the limitations of pictorial
convention. It is only fair to say that, working as he always has from the
photograph, his inadequacy is understandable, for the photograph, that
seductive, monocular cheat, has always left out or hidden at least as much
as ever it revealed. To look at these boneless heads, soggy cheeks, cloth
ears and absent noses, is to take the point. What is a little harder to take
is the thought of Bevan as a significant upholder of a continuing figurative
tradition.
Such disappointment casts doubt, of course, on the earlier work, but at
least he got by so long as he stuck to his simple graphic method. It is only
this present naive attempt to take on one of the greatest tests in all of
painting - which is the proper understanding and description of the human
head - and to do so as it were without looking, that has let him down.
So how do his apologists defend him? Not so much by moving the goalposts as
by choosing to play on an entirely different pitch. 'We can survey the
paintings as painted surface and as metaphors for painting - a painterly
approach. We can look at the paintings as expressions and examinations of
states of mind - a psychological approach. And we can consider the
collective aspect of the character types and of their relation to their
viewers - a sociological approach': thus Michael Cullingworth in his
introduction to the ICA retrospective in 1988.
Dr Schulz-Hoffmann, for her part, entitled the essay already quoted:
'Representational Paintings as a Conceptual Method'. She went on to say that
'As with all other representational painters whom one can take seriously (a
nice side-swipe that), so too for Bevan the ambivalence between abstract
cipher and contentual (sic) meaning plays a decisive role.' Oh, we see, pace
le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, he has been a conceptual artist all along.
And what is his method? Peter Wollen tells us in his Whitechapel catalogue.
'Tony Bevan makes his paintings on the floor, working on hands and knees . .
. He likes the downward pressure of the charcoal stick or the paint-laden
brush pressed down onto the canvas. The charcoal crumbles or the dense paint
moves under pressure in ways that fascinate him . . . Because he is so close
to the canvas during the actual process of painting, it is hard to predict
what will happen when the painting is hung vertically on the wall and looked
at from a distance . . .'
Anything, I suppose, is better than confronting reality, and testing the
mark that is achieved against the one that was intended, in the way of
Rembrandt, Chardin, Goya. The true debate is not about the death of
painting, nor of the futility of modernism. Rather it is, or should be,
simply about the quality of what is done, of whatever kind, if only our
curators and cultural chiefs had the eyes and unfashionable courage to look
properly about them.
It a mistake perhaps, but not a scandal that Bevan should be so celebrated
at home and abroad. The scandal only is that he should be alone.
Tony Bevan: Whitechapel Art Gallery, Whitechapel High St, E1, until July 11.

Television really can damage health. I feel unwell after sampling the
surrealistically bad chat show This Morning (ITV, 10.35am weekdays).
Presented by an apparently live married couple, This Morning is television's
equivalent of anthrax; insidious and incurable.
Things improve later. One of today's oddest items is the last of the
erratically absorbing series Without Walls (Channel 4, 9pm). Tonight's
programme features amateur film-footage of a weekend in 1939, rare colour
film of Adolf Hitler and his repellant cronies enjoying a Munich arts
festival.
40 Minutes (BBC2, 9.50pm) is regularly strong. Tonight it deals with the
horrendous subject of rape in a high-risk manner, by bringing face-to-face a
victim and a convicted rapist. Probably compulsive viewing, but one wonders
why.
The evening's laurels go to the classic SF movie The Day The Earth Stood
Still (Channel 4, 10pm). The alien Michael Rennie visits Washington DC with
a message of peace. He discovers humanity is rather unpleasant. A cynical
view induced, no doubt, by watching This Morning.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Arts: Siobhan Davies premieres at Brighton - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Part of the fascination of dance is that it always hovers between being
figurative and abstract. Though people talk of 'abstract ballets,' dance -
as several choreographers have remarked - cannot be truly abstract, because
it deals with bodies. Yet we keep seeing human beings, as they dance, become
changing shapes of ideal geometry, or impersonal embodiments of pure rhythm.
And this is only the beginning of the mystery, for the greatest choreography
plunges us into the drama of forms. 'An abstract ballet,' a critic once
said, 'is a ballet with more plot than a narrative ballet.'
All the great choreographers, and many of the good ones, have been fully
aware of this ambiguity. The British modern-dance choreographer Siobhan
Davies has several times made it the conscious theme of her work - has made
dances that hover between communicative drama and sheer dancing-about dance
purity. I recall in particular Something to Tell, which she made in 1980 for
London Contemporary Dance Theatre and which made a poetic dilemma out of the
ambiguity of its dances.
And, as the title of the new work she has made for her own company, Wanting
to Tell Stories, tells you, she is back at this theme again. The six dancers
maintain an almost constant flow of motion, with a wide dynamic range from
phrase to phrase. The main emphasis is men and women alone or in pairs, and
the main drama - as often in Davies's work - is about people's need to
depend on another and at the same time to be independent of them. The piece
(part of a double-bill, with last year's White Bird Featherless), derives
much of its essence from its score by Kevin Volans: brisk, changeful,
suggestive.
The pendulum nature of Davies's dance style is itself emotionally
suggestive. The dancers fall away from balance, decelerating as they do, and
then scoop back up to recover balance. There are shades of retrospection and
surrender in the fall, shades of aspiration and endeavour in the ascent.
Motionless equilibrium is never achieved, and on the rare occasions that
dancers hold a still pose they seem switched off - the pose is not charged
with energy.
There are, however, stories behind the dance's stories. The decor for the
piece - two highly mobile fence-screens suspended from above - has been
provided by David Buckland, who has designed for most of Davies's
choreography and who is her partner in private life. As on many previous
occasions, Buckland's decor keeps busily interrupting Davies's dances,
helping them out intrusively, drawing attention to how beautifully it means
to assist in dramatising the choreography, and frequently drawing attention
away from the dance. Too bad the two screens couldn't have been given
curtain-calls; they did wonderfully - but at the expense of everything else.
Another problem is the different manners within the Davies dance company. In
some ways the company's virtuoso is Gill Clarke. She has the most striking
dynamic range, the most striking legato fluency. But she exists in a cocoon;
she only knows how to make her own inner world real onstage. And there is a
hark-at-me self-consciousness about her dancing that distracts from the
dance. The other dancers have a kind of innocent attack and an absorption in
a larger stage world that makes Davies's choreography more interesting. In
this respect, Paul Douglas is outstanding here. His behaviour is completely
modest, and yet he makes the dance, and his role in it, adult, affecting,
poignant.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Arts: Gyorgy Ligeti turns 70 - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Friday week is actually Ligeti's birthday; but the London Sinfonietta's
homage-concert at the Barbican last Saturday came near enough. Ligeti's long
career has been a perpetual tonic for contemporary music (though interrupted
for a while some dozen years ago by ill health), and it continues
apace. His opera after Lewis Carroll's Alice books is eagerly awaited.
This Sinfonietta programme, nicely devised, revisited signal achievements of
that career: the Chamber Concerto and Melodien of 1971, the recent Piano
Concerto, and some tantalising reminiscences of his mid-1970s opera Le Grand
Macabre (for which an ENO revival is surely due). Those last provided the
only echoes of his early Dadaist phase, now remembered chiefly for the
mock-operas Aventures and Nouvelles Aventures, which play rather like
Ionesco but are really in-jokes about the earnest contemporary-music scene.
Early Ligeti pieces were always sophisticated jokes or calculated
experiments, or most often both at once. In his evergreen Ten
Pieces for wind quintet, the comic 'Fragment' for groaning bass-instruments
(promised for this concert, but withdrawn by the composer because the joke
no longer strikes him as good enough) or indeed the Chamber Concerto for 13
players, each movement exploits some narrowly specific musical language-game
to the hilt. Somehow the
intricate workings-out generate their own pungent flavours and suggestions.
For bigger ensembles
Ligeti's experiments with 'micro-polyphony' (dense contrapuntal knitting for
many little voices, adding up to much broader effects), which began
with Apparitions and Atmospheres, led to Melodien, tangled skeins of
half-heard tunes. By now the Sinfonietta players must know their Melodien
parts virtually
by heart, and under the
meticulous direction of young Markus Stenz the performance sounded luminous.
Every fragmentary voice contributed poignantly to the sense of the whole.
Like his Polish contemporary Lutoslawski, Ligeti conjures ghosts of old
feeling from arcane new mechanisms.
The five movements of the Piano Concerto, delivered here by Pierre-Laurent
Aimard with the utmost finesse, showed a new Ligeti. The first three were
completed in 1986, two racing studies in multi-rhythms flanking a 'Lento,
deserto' of extraordinary stark power. By 1988, however, the composer had
added two more movements, exciting and seemingly transparent, but of such
expressive density as to leave the listener quite wrung out. Nothing merely
'experimental' there: this is music with a formidable grip.
After that, Mysteries of the Macabre offered what was almost light relief.
Drawn from the
opera, it is Elgar Howarth's arrangement of the Secret Police Chief's
coloratura arias for C-trumpet and ensemble. It retains the neo-Dada effects
of the original setting - rattles and police-whistles, spoken interjections
by the players, which lose much of their point out of context. Hakan
Hardenberger's soaring trumpet, however, was its own justification and more.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Business and the Law: Lords to probe Community competition
rules - Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities has launched
an inquiry into the enforcement of EC competition rules. A sub-committee
chaired by Lord Slynn, Britain's former judge at the European Court of
Justice, will concentrate its inquiries on the procedures of the European
Commission and levels of decision-making.
Following concern expressed by the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg,
the committee will examine:
whether Commission procedures are flawed;
whether staff shortages and budgetary constraints within the competition
directorate are delaying decision-making;
and it will look into the Commission's publicly-expressed wish that more
enforcement of competition rules should take place at national level.
The committee's previous examination of competition practice - in 1982  -
resulted in improvements in procedures. The sub-committee will also examine
procedural operations and possible revision of the thresholds of the Merger
Regulation.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Business and the Law: Going global - The coming players in
the market for international services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When international accountancy firm Arthur Andersen let it be known recently
that it was behind Garrett &amp; Co, a new London law firm to be headed by the
former senior legal adviser to Investors in Industry (3i), Britain's largest
venture capital company, lawyers in the City of London blanched.
The link between Andersen and Garrett &amp; Co could pave the way towards the
creation of the first multi-disciplinary partnership between accountants and
lawyers. Although Garrett will be independent of Andersen in the short term,
it will be based in the accountants' London offices and will expect much of
its work to come through referrals from Andersen's network.
For the top City law firms, concern about the Big Six accountants moving
into legal services stems from the fear of competition not in domestic
markets but in those for international legal services. As much as 40 per
cent of their work now has an international element and any move into the
international legal markets by an organisation with an established presence
in every corner of the globe poses a considerable threat.
Some accountancy firms have already flagged their intentions. KPMG, for
example, has strong links with the French law firm Fidal, arguably the
largest in continental Europe. But Andersen is forcing the pace. It has
established a number of associations with law firms in other European
countries including SG Archibald of France and Friehalter, Kruger &amp; Co of
Germany.
It has some way to go before it is in a position to challenge the big
English and American law firms in the provision of high-value global legal
services but it can build on a network of 318 offices employing 62,000
professional staff in 72 countries around the world.
No law firm can match that spread - except perhaps Baker &amp; McKenzie, which
operates on a scaled-down level more appropriate to the size of the global
marketplace for legal services. B&amp;M has 53 offices in 32 countries. Its
1,640 lawyers represent 45 nationalities and speak 60 languages. No other
law firm comes close to that.
B&amp;M is used to being derided by its competitors for its unusual structure.
It knits local lawyers in different countries into its international
network, whereas the traditional method for providing legal services for
multinational clients involves a few overseas branch offices controlled from
the centre and staffed by lawyers on assignment from headquarters for two or
three years at a time.
As competition for international legal services hots up, the number of
detractors is dwindling. Some firms now appear to accept that the Baker &amp;
McKenzie approach may have been the right one after all.
Many of those who expanded rapidly overseas in the late 1980s now realise
that the cost of establishing, staffing and running more than a handful of
overseas branch offices to serve multinational clients may be prohibitive.
Some even appear to have changed tack. New York's Skadden Arps Slate Meagher
&amp; Flom, which quickly established seven offices in Europe in the late 1980s,
has recently entered into affiliations with local law firms in Frankfurt and
Vienna.
This is a development not lost on John McGuigan, the recently appointed
chairman of B&amp;M's executive committee. The 43-year-old Australian accountant
turned lawyer believes that when the regulatory barriers to
cross-jurisdictional legal practice come down only a very few firms will be
in a position to operate on a truly international basis.
One of the main limitations they will face is money, he says. B&amp;M has 53
offices around the world because that is the way the firm evolved. When
Russell Baker and John McKenzie set up the firm in Chicago in 1949 they hit
on the simple idea that as US multinationals sought to expand their market
and bases of production they were going to need sophisticated legal advice.
It seemed sensible for companies to have access to someone in those markets
who could provide that advice but who also had an understanding of the US
legal system.
'But,' says McGuigan, 'I wouldn't like to be seeking to establish 53 offices
now. The fact is we have them in the balance sheet, they're capitalised and
they're all profitable.'
The other main impediment will be cultural, he says. If firms are going to
operate on a truly international basis and offer as broad a range of
services as B&amp;M does, they need a flexible management style and a certain
degree of local independence and respect for local solutions. The
traditional head office/branch office structure is too rigid.
Critics of the B&amp;M approach point out, however, that the evolution of the
firm with its reliance on national lawyers in the various locations
inevitably means that the quality of its work is inconsistent.
Standards in Bangkok or Bogota may not be up to those of London or New York.
As competition in the international market place intensifies, critics argue,
and as clients bring an increasingly sophisticated approach to buying legal
services, companies which in the past have used B&amp;M around the world will
become more selective about where they use its lawyers in future.
Equally, a poor piece of work for a multinational client done in Manila
could damage relationships in more important markets such as Europe or north
America.
Eventually, these factors could begin to hurt the bottom line. Critics note
that while B&amp;M has the second highest gross revenues of America's
international law firms that is largely because it has so many lawyers.
Judged by profits per partner the firm is ranked 40th.
John McGuigan believes the quality problems are over-emphasised, but he is
far from complacent. 'We're only as strong as our weakest link,' he
concedes. Improving quality is a priority. The firm has doubled its training
budget over the last three years and its budget for professional development
has increased from Dollars 350,000 to Dollars 1.2m.
But many of the criticisms miss the point of B&amp;M's ethos, McGuigan says.
Imposing the way business is done in a location is wrong because it fails to
recognise that there are different degrees of sophistication in the various
legal systems of the world, that local lawyers' qualifications may not be up
to the standards of America and Europe and that different issues are
relevant in ensuring clients get the right service.
'Some US banking lawyers believe that what they need to do in Jakarta is
produce the same pile of closing documents as they would in New York.
They're wrong.' he says.
Given that B&amp;M's structure and approach most closely resembles that of the
Big Six, it might be thought more at risk than other international law firms
if accountants move into global legal services.
McGuigan disagrees. Accountants will undoubtedly move into the legal field
and will present a challenge in some of the more routine areas of legal
work. They could also increase pressures on pricing at the lower end of the
market.
But for the foreseeable future they are likely to have significant
difficulty in attracting the number of lawyers of real quality and
experience they will need to mount a serious challenge to the big law firms.

Court

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spanish restrictions which prevent foreign language films from being
subtitled in the official Spanish languages unless the film distributor
agrees to distribute a Spanish language film in return have been struck down
by the European Court of Justice.
The court ruled the restrictions were contrary to Rome Treaty provisions on
the freedom to provide services. These prohibit the discriminatory treatment
of a service provider by reason of nationality or because the provider is in
a different member state from that in which the service is performed.
The court said the Spanish rules clearly gave Spanish film producers an
advantage over other EC producers. The effect was to protect Spanish film
production.
The Court rejected the Spanish argument that the measures pursued a cultural
objective and therefore should be allowed. The rules advantaged the
distribution of domestic films, regardless of their content or quality. They
pursued a commercial objective and there was no reason why Spain should be
allowed to derogate from the basic Treaty provisions.
C-17/92: Federacion de Distribuidores Cinematograficos v Estado Espanol and
Union de Productores de Cine y Television, ECJ 5CH, 4 May 1993.
Commission's immunity from debt orders
The European Court has rejected an action by a third party creditor against
the European Commission for failure to give effect to a debt order. The
Court said goods of the Community institutions could not be the object of an
administrative or judicial measure without its prior authorisation. It also
rejected a claim for non-contractual damages.
The case concerned money paid from the European Development Fund by the
Commission to the government of Burkina Faso for development projects. Some
of the project was sub-contracted to the applicant, who carried out the work
but only received 10 per cent of the money due.
The sub-contractor wrote to the Commission asking for its position to be
taken into account when the Commission authorised payments to Burkina Faso
for the projects. Six months later the sub-contractor sent the Commission a
debt order to protect its rights to the money owed.
The Commission refused to be bound by the order on the grounds its immunity
from such an order could only be lifted by the European Court. The
sub-contractor sought to annul that decision.
The Court said the Community institutions had an immunity which could only
be lifted by the agreement of an institution or by express authority of the
court. The sub-contractor had not applied to the court for such an
authorisation so the Commission's immunity remained. The application for
non-contractual damages was rejected on the ground the Commission had not
acted unlawfully.
C-182/91: Forafrique Burkinabe SA v Commission, ECJ 5CH, 29 April 1993.
Application for interim measures fails
The President of the Court of First Instance rejected an application by
Compagnie Maritime Belge, the Belgian shipping company, for interim measures
in the form of a suspension of part of the European Commission's decision of
23 December 1992 about the activities of shipping conferences involved in
providing transport services between Europe and West Africa.
The Commission decision found the conferences and their members had
infringed EC competition rules. Fines were imposed and the conferences were
ordered to stop the infringements. The applicant challenged the order to
stop infringements in so far as they related to participation in the
implementation of a co-operation agreement with Zaire.
The President found CMB had not demonstrated that it could not wait until
the outcome of the main hearing without suffering serious and irreparable
harm.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Robert Clarke, chairman of United Biscuits, will take over as part-time
chairman of Thames Water, Britain's largest quoted water company, from March
of next year. The appointment follows the sudden death of Sir Roy Watts at
the end of April.
David Luffrum, group finance director, says the board was 'of the unanimous
view that if we could find a strong candidate from among the existing
directors, that would be the ideal solution'. Sir Robert has been a
non-executive director since 1988 and the run-up to flotation. Although he
will be 65 when he takes up the chairmanship, Luffrum says he is in
'remarkably good health. There is every expectation he will be chairman for
a good few years.'
However, Clarke is unable to start until he reduces his role to that of
non-executive chairman at United Biscuits, a company of similar size to
Thames, next year. In the meantime Sir Christopher Leaver, currently deputy
chairman, takes on the role. Leaver is a former Lord Mayor of London
(1981-1982) and was chairman of the London Tourist Board between 1983 and
1989.
Whereas Sir Roy spent 'four to four and a half days a week' at Thames,
according to Luffrum, Clarke is expected to devote 'not more than two days'
to the assignment. Luffrum explains that chief executive Mike Hoffman had
been in control of day-to-day management issues and he had been also
increasingly involved in matters of strategy.
Hoffman takes on the additional title of deputy chairman until next March;
thereafter there are likely to be two deputy chairmen when Clarke takes over
from Leaver.
The succession question was already well advanced before Sir Roy's death;
Watts had been planning to announce his retirement at the AGM in July.

<TEXT>
The government been taking its time finding a replacement for William Davis,
whose term as chairman of the British Tourist Authority and of the English
Tourist Board ended in March. Although Davis's departure was announced in
January, no successor has yet emerged.
Davis, by contrast, has been quick to find something to fill those moments
when he is not running his company Premier Magazines, which publishes titles
for British Airways, Rolls Royce and Savoy Hotels.
Yesterday, Allied Leisure announced that Davis would become its
non-executive chairman - freeing Richard Carr to concentrate on being chief
executive. Davis is also a non-executive director of Thomas Cook.
While arguably part of the same sector, the Allied Leisure post represents
something of a change from the task of persuading foreigners to take their
holidays in Britain and the UK tourist industry to improve its offerings.
The company's specialities are nightclubs and ten-pin bowling.
In 1991-2, the sharp downturn in UK consumer spending forced Allied
Leisure's pre-tax profits down 29 per cent to Pounds 2.21m. Its shares,
which comfortably outperformed the market in 1990 and 1991, have since
languished.
Davis had been looking forward to life in the private sector. A former
editor of Punch, he was not altogether happy at the BTA, saying he realised
he was not cut out for the slow-moving world of the public sector - a view
shared by colleagues and by government.

FT  18 MAY 93 / People: Briton's pivotal Brussels job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Responsibility for making the five-month-old single European market work has
fallen to a 49-year-old Briton, John Mogg.
He has just taken over as head of the European Commission's
directorate-general for the internal market and financial services, working
under the new Italian commissioner Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi.
Mogg replaces Geoffrey Fitchew, another Briton, who had been the man behind
the investment services and capital adequacy directives. While Mogg is
expected to continue implementing these measures, the responsibilities of
the so-called DG15, which used solely to look after financial services, have
been extended.
The arrival of a new set of Commissioners, together with a reshuffle of the
permanent departments, means that the barrier-free single market, which came
into effect on January 1, also comes under Mogg's wing. However, he is no
stranger to that sector, having spent the last three years as deputy
director-general of the old internal market and industry department.
Mogg had been tipped to take over the DG15 post since the beginning of the
year, but the political complexities of senior Commission appointments meant
he could only be confirmed in the position two weeks ago. The UK government,
which places great importance on the implementation of the single market and
the liberalisation of the financial services sector, had lobbied hard to put
a British national in the job.
Mogg is a relative newcomer to the Commission. Until 1990, he had been a
senior national civil servant in the Department of Trade and Industry and
the Cabinet Office, although he served as First Secretary at the UK's
permanent representation to the EC in Brussels between 1979 and 1982.
Fitchew, meanwhile, has returned to London to head the European secretariat
of the Cabinet Office. Mogg was deputy head of the same unit before joining
the Commission.

high-tech - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies which want to adopt innovative but risky new processes and
high-technology companies which have developed new techniques but are
encountering resistance from prospective clients may benefit from a new
European Commission programme.
Under the Technology Performance Financing scheme (part of the Sprint
programme) the commission underwrites up to 50 per cent of the risk attached
to bank funding for a project (up to a maximum of Ecu 75,000, or Pounds
58,000 per project). Companies borrowing funds make performance-related
repayments.
They must apply to one of the participating banks, which will provide about
80 per cent of the funds needed, typically Ecu40,000 to Ecu200,000. Banks in
the scheme include National Westminster, Allied Irish, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,
Generale de Banque and Finlombarda.

Very small businesses, employing one or two people, should not be made
subject to every regulation, Lord Sainsbury, the government's deregulation
adviser, told last week's annual conference of the Association of British
Chambers of Commerce.
The law already provides general protection against malpractice to
neighbours or customers, he said.
As a general principle detailed legislation should be replaced by a greater
use of guidelines, education and codes of good practice, Lord Sainsbury
said.
Regulations should be concerned with general requirements and less with
specifics. He contrasted the Food Safety Act, which imposes a basic
requirement to sell safe food, with the proposed Quick Frozen Foods
regulation, which lays down exact temperatures and the frequency of checks.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Back from the brink / A
look at entrepreneurs who have survived and learned from early setbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took a Christmas Eve telephone call from Jayne Murray's bank manager for
her to realise that her business was in trouble. The call came eight months
after Murray had bought the Tulip Tree coffee shop in Gosforth,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The manager warned that Tulip Tree had exceeded its
agreed overdraft limit by Pounds 3,000.
'Up to then I had been going through the motions,' recalls Murray. 'I didn't
understand what it was all about. When the bank manager phoned everything
just fell apart.'
Murray had taken an enterprise training course on leaving university, but
acknowledges she did not maintain financial controls in the early months.
She also now feels that she paid too much for the company in the first
place.
Faced with the prospect of the business going under, Murray called a staff
meeting to explain the situation and to seek her employees' support and held
emergency discussions with her parents, who were directors in the business,
to analyse the problems.
Two and a half years later, wage cuts, closer attention to costs and prices
and tight controls on the business's finances have turned a Pounds 70,000
loss into a small monthly profit. The Tulip Tree employs seven people, has
monthly sales of Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 9,000 (excluding VAT) and Murray,
now 25, is working on plans to expand the catering side.
Murray's experiences are not untypical of many small business owners.
Inexperience or an external shock such as a recession or the loss of a large
customer poses an early challenge to the business's survival. With
determination and luck the business survives; without them it goes under.
Recognition of this common scenario prompted Durham University Business
School (Dubs)*, which works intensively with small firms in the northeast,
to launch its Great Escape Business Development Award. The award goes to the
business owner who has learned most from his or her experience of
near-disaster.
Murray was one of six business owners to be short-listed for this year's
award.
Entrepreneurs are judged on four criteria: the scale of the threat relative
to the size of their business; the effectiveness of their response; the
level of insight demonstrated; and the extent to which they subsequently
apply what they have learned to running their business.
Only one of the participants went out of business. Martin Jones was forced
to close his record production company after running out of funds, but has
since relaunched himself as MBR Productions, providing business training to
the music industry.
All of the others survived though some came very close to failing. The
Questions Answered Consultancy, a York-based research and marketing agency,
was burgled nine months after it was set up and its computer equipment with
its business records were stolen. Back-up records had not been properly kept
and contracts were lost. Peter Harrington, QAC's founder, considered looking
for a job but after the initial despair he rallied and got the business
going again. The computer equipment was replaced and back-up discs are now
kept up to date.
More importantly, says 27-year-old Harrington, the shock of near-disaster
focused his thinking and made him realise careful planning would be needed
if the business was to go anywhere. A decision was taken to concentrate on
the regional market and a successful guidebook for teachers bringing school
parties to York was produced. Harrington has taken on two more staff and he
expects a near-threefold increase in turnover this year to Pounds 100,000. A
move to larger premises is planned.
QAC's recovery depended on Harrington re-assembling his business records and
buying new computers, but Harsh (Ultimate Hydraulics), a supplier of
hydraulic tipping systems, faced an even more serious threat. Established in
1987 to market a device to improve the safety of conventional lorry tipping
systems, Harsh had just invested for expansion when its markets collapsed.
Grant Faulkner, the founder and managing director of the Full Sutton,
Yorkshire-based company, responded by cutting costs and putting suppliers
under pressure for discounts. He also signed up a leading distributor,
believing this would open new markets and guarantee the company's future.
It was only after the deal was signed that Faulkner, now 28, realised this
was only the start of the process. 'You don't sell to distributors but
through them,' he says. 'A sale is not made until the product moves on to
the end user.'
Yet more effort and cash had to be invested in training programmes for the
distributor's staff, in brochures, packaging and new product development.
These actions paid off. Harsh managed to maintain sales in a much-reduced
market and it expects to be profitable this year on sales of Pounds 950,000.
It employs 10 people.
Dealing with distributors is a common problem for the young business, to
judge by the experiences of the Great Escape participants. John Owens, now
29, founder of Newcastle-based Robot Simulations, recalls how two of his
main distributors failed to make any sales for a five-month period and his
company's income dried up.
'In the end I went out on the road and sales turned right round in two
months,' he says. 'We solved the problem just in time because we were about
to hit our overdraft limit. The dealers were a wall between us and our
customers.'
Owens called in a business counsellor, Roger Verrall, to help him with these
problems and realised he was far happier concentrating on the technical side
of the business, creating software programs which allow the users of
industrial robots to simulate their operation.
He stepped down as managing director and sold 51 per cent of the company,
which employs six people and has sales of Pounds 90,000, to Verrall.
Owens was not the only entrepreneur to relinquish majority control of his
business among the Great Escape participants. Peter Wild, founder of Wild
Vision, a Boldon Colliery-based manufacturer of circuit boards for Acorn
computers, also brought in an outside shareholder when problems arose.
Wild Vision grew steadily over its first five years, but was hit by the
recession in the early 1990s. Schools, important buyers of Acorn computers,
cut spending when they became responsible for their own budgets and rumours
that Acorn was planning to launch a new computer further reduced sales. The
company faced the prospect of exceeding its borrowing limits.
Wild, now 31, realised that sales would always be limited by the fact that
he had no capacity for software development, without which the boards could
not be used. There was no time to develop this expertise in-house, but at
the suggestion of Acorn he teamed up with Computer Concepts, which had
software skills but no hardware expertise.
Computer Concepts took a 74 per cent stake in Wild Vision leaving Wild with
the rest. 'For the first three months I waited for them to come and tell me
what to do but they didn't,' says Wild. 'They have an arm's-length
management style.'
The link-up with Computer Concepts put Wild Vision's finances on a sounder
footing and it expects sales of Pounds 400,000 this year. It recently took
on two design engineers, taking its workforce to 15.
The judging team decided Murray had learned the most from her experience of
saving the Tulip Tree and awarded her the Pounds 1,000 prize. She and the
other five shortlisted candidates are also eligible for a session to assess
their personal and business goals provided by CPCR, a Gosforth-based
consultancy and sponsor of the Great Escape.
Judging a conventional small business competition is difficult enough
because of the diverse nature of the businesses which take part, says Dubs'
David Mullen. Judging an award which attempts to measure the management of
potential disaster rather than the achievement of success is even trickier.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Figuring out failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When countries go into recession, few economic statistics are followed with
greater interest than the data for business failures. When they recover, a
decline in insolvencies is usually seen as proof that the worst is over.
But how much do we know about business failure? How comprehensive or
accurate are the figures? Despite considerable academic research, we have
only a limited understanding.
This was one of the key conclusions of a Review of Research on the Factors
Influencing the Death of Small Firms*, presented at a seminar last Friday by
David Storey, director of research at the Warwick University Small Business
Centre.
While 'failure' is often taken to mean disaster and financial loss, many
businesses appear in the statistics when they have simply been sold or the
owner has retired.
None of the statistics commonly used - VAT deregistrations, business
insolvencies, personal bankruptcies - tells the whole story and, worse
still, they frequently show conflicting trends.
Researchers generally agree that small, young companies are particularly
vulnerable and that companies which do not grow are less likely to survive.
But even such apparently obvious measures as profit do not automatically
link to success or failure. Nor is the sector in which a business operates a
significant factor in whether or not it survives (despite the fondness of
bankers for red-lining specific sectors).
It has also proved difficult to relate personal characteristics to success
or failure, while the impact of external economic shocks, such as changes in
interest rates, is not clear-cut.
It may be of some consolation to business owners battling with the
uncertainties of the 1990s that conditions in the 19th century, often
depicted as the golden age of the established family firm, were very much
the same. Relatively few companies grew to a ripe old age, even then.
*Researched as part of a small firms study financed by the Economic and
Social Research Council to be published later.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Technology: A hearing aid for ultrasound - A technique to
improve image quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first photographs in the albums compiled by proud new parents are often
taken before the birth. They are images of the foetus in the womb, obtained
using non-invasive ultrasonic diagnostic equipment.
Yet it usually takes the expert eye of an obstetrician to pick out the tiny
human form from these murky grey images. Medical ultrasonic images, which
are also used to diagnose abdominal, urological, vascular and heart
problems, can be made significantly clearer by a new technique developed by
Acuson, the leading US manufacturer of medical ultrasonic equipment.
The use of ultrasonic systems in medicine has grown rapidly over the past
five years with 50.3m ultrasonic examinations performed in the US last year,
up from 29.6m in 1988.
Since medical ultrasonic imaging was introduced in the mid-1970s, there have
been several incremental improvements in the performance of the systems.
Acuson claims, however, to have achieved a 'breakthrough' with the
introduction of its 'acoustic response technology'.
ART 'will open up new vistas of what we are able to investigate with
ultrasound', predicts Barry Mahony, director of ultrasound diagnostics at
the Swedish Hospital in Seattle, Washington.
'I have been able to see structures that were not visible, especially in
obese patients,' says Mahony, who has tested the Acuson technology alongside
existing state-of-the-art equipment. Using ART, the doctor was able to see
the four quadrants of the heart and the internal structure of the brain of a
foetus in the womb, detail of the layers of the bowel and even the layers of
skin on a foetus.
ART is a computer-controlled method of refining the images obtained from a
medical ultrasonic diagnosis system. It involves shaping the frequency
spectrum of the ultrasonic signal to minimise distortions as it passes
through the human body.
The principle of ultrasonic imaging is simple. High frequency sound waves
are transmitted by a transducer placed on the patient's skin. Some of the
sound waves bounce off the soft tissues of the body as 'echoes'. The echo is
picked up by a detector and transformed into electrical signals that are
used to form an image of the internal structure of the body on a computer
screen.
However, ultrasonic signals are also attenuated as they pass through body
tissues. Lower frequency signals penetrate further than high frequencies,
just as drum beats can be heard from a further distance than the sound of a
bell ringing.
Thus ultrasonic imaging systems have to compensate for the distortion of the
signal as it passes through the body. This decreases the resolution of
images making it more difficult for a doctor to see structures deep inside
the body.
'We have known for years what the body does to ultrasonic echoes and it was
an effect we thought we'd always have to live with,' says Samuel Maslak,
Acuson president and chief executive. By applying computer control to all
parts of the imaging system, including the transducer, the signal and the
detector, ART improves image quality.
'These are not just aesthetic effects we are bringing to the diagnostic
image. There is a significant increase in information content that will be
extremely helpful in making difficult diagnoses,' says John Freund, Acuson
executive vice-president.
Sales of diagnostic imaging equipment in the US totalled about Dollars 4.2bn
(Pounds 2.7bn) in the US in 1991, the latest figures available. This was,
however, less that 0.6 per cent of total healthcare spending of Dollars
738.2bn.
In an era of rising health care costs, improved diagnostic techniques will
help to save money, Acuson maintains. 'At least five times as much is spent
on treatment as on diagnosis in the US today,' says Maslak. 'Yet every
dollar spent on early, correct diagnosis saves dollars downstream.'

FT  18 MAY 93 / Technology: Generating a new alliance - Westinghouse and
Rolls-Royce are both benefiting from a wide-ranging partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past year, not everyone on the crowded flights from the UK to
Orlando, Florida has been heading for Disneyworld, Cape Kennedy or the
sunshine state's other big attractions.
For executives from Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power
group, the journey ends in a somewhat confusing ride down Ingenuity Drive
and Strategy Boulevard.
In an empty scrubland that will one day be a high-powered industrial area -
hence the names - their destination is the headquarters of Westinghouse
Electric's power generation business.
Westinghouse officials have been travelling in the other direction, to
London and Newcastle, as the two companies develop a relationship that began
in the earliest days of the modern power equipment industry but took on new
meaning last June. That was when Westinghouse and Rolls-Royce announced a
15-year agreement aimed at strengthening both companies in the highly
competitive worldwide power generation equipment business. The deal was one
of the most important recent tie-ups in the power equipment industry and
covers technology transfer, joint development of combustion turbine
technology and marketing of combustion turbines and combined-cycle power
plants.
It is early days yet, but the new co-operation looks to have made a good
start, even if the tangible results so far are just one contract. Last
autumn, the Tennessee Valley Authority gave the partnership an order for two
replacement generators to be built by Westinghouse and four steam turbine
rotors to be built by Rolls-Royce, with Westinghouse installing and
servicing the equipment.
This may sound prosaic, but it was the kind of order that the UK company
would have found hard to share in had it been bidding without a US partner.
A large retrofit such as this also opens the way to other business in the
replacement market in the US, says Richard Maudslay, managing director of
Rolls-Royce's industrial power group.
But the agreement is nothing if not wide-ranging and, behind the scenes,
cross-border activity has been intensified since June, with a clutch of
inter-company groups set up to push the co-operation forward. Common
purchasing of components has already begun and in both companies there has
been a big management effort to spread involvement in the tie-up into
middle-management and the manufacturing workforce.
As executives in several disciplines work out how to make the tie-up
effective, its rationale is becoming increasingly clear. As with all good
industrial link-ups, both companies need each other - for technology and
market presence.
'No one company is going to be able to do everything to stay competitive in
this business. Because we had totally different portfolios, we realised we
could work together,' says Frank Bakos, vice-president and general manager
of the Westinghouse power generation business unit.
'There are some very positive benefits from the agreement,' says Maudslay.
'With our different products we can balance out each other's weaknesses.'
Technology transfer via licensing or other agreements has long been an
integral part of the power equipment industry; Westinghouse's early steam
turbines, for example, were based on designs by Sir Charles Parsons, the
19th century inventor of steam turbines.
Westinghouse has had a series of agreements with Mitsubishi companies in
Japan stretching back to a 1923 generators deal with Mitsubishi Electric. In
combustion turbines, it has co-operated with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
since 1961, and has a similar co-operation with FiatAvio of Italy which
dates from 1954.
In their early days, the deals with the Japanese were 'somewhat tutorial',
according to Bakos, but have lately taken on a more balanced look as the
Japanese expertise in the design and production of turbines developed.
The trilateral alliance between the US, Japan and Italian companies has now
become a fully-fledged network. MHI is producing the largest turbines within
the group, the 701F model which can produce up to 220MW for 50 Hz markets
such as Japan. But Westinghouse recognised in the late 1980s that its single
biggest liability was lack of access to the aero-engine technology that its
big rival General Electric has used with some success in developing its
land-based gas turbines.
The Orlando company searched for the aero-technology it needed, although,
says Bakos, it was a period when it was being wooed as well as wooing. Apart
from GE, the only other leading aero-engine producers are Pratt &amp; Whitney,
which is working with Siemens on a new heavy-duty gas turbine for the end of
next year, and Rolls-Royce.
The key to the successful transfer of aero-engine technology to large-scale
electric power generation is to incorporate those elements which can help
improve efficiency and output without jeopardising reliability or adding
excessively to costs.
So one of the most important tasks for the teams from Orlando and Newcastle
is to work out what can be used in the next generation of Westinghouse gas
turbines, which could be launched in the second half of the 1990s.
John Kessinger, a Westinghouse power generation executive with
responsibility for strategic alliance products, points out that new
materials or designs that make aero-engines lighter may not be relevant.
Alternatively, some aero-derivative technology will be relevant but would
only be cost-effective if produced in very large numbers.
However, some of the work done on designs of aero-turbines and compressors
will be very valuable, he says. Designs for turbine blades, vanes and
transmission pieces, some of the aero-derived cooling technologies, new
materials and design techniques such as computational fluid dynamics could
all be useful. 'We're still in the middle of trying to figure out what makes
sense for us,' says Kessinger.
For Rolls-Royce, a clear advantage of this development is that it gains
access not only to Westinghouse's existing heavy duty gas turbines, but to a
new generation enhanced by its aero-derived technology. Coupled with
Westinghouse's technology in combined cycle power (the increasingly popular
gas turbine/steam generator/steam turbine combination), this strengthens the
UK company in markets where it has a stronger presence than its US partner.
But the deal is also important for both companies at the smaller end of the
combustion turbine market. Rolls-Royce already has the industrial version of
its RB211 engine, which generates about 28MW of power, but is committed to
developing a 50MW industrial version of its forthcoming Trent engine. This
version should be ready at the beginning of 1996, says Maudslay.
Maudslay wants both these engines to be strongly marketed in North America,
and it is better to do that with a US link, he says. At Westinghouse, Reg
McIntyre, general manager for combustion turbines, says: 'We keep pressing
them on the Trent engine.' With Westinghouse's help, it could become the
centrepiece of a highly-efficient 70-75MW combined cycle plant.
The two companies are also working on developing steam turbine technology, a
more mature and more crowded market than that for gas turbines. 'It did not
make sense for each to develop its own products independently,' says
Maudslay.
As a result of the tie-up, the Westinghouse power generation business is
emerging as the focal point for a technology interchange involving, on the
one hand, Rolls-Royce and, on the other, the US company's alliances in
Japan, Italy and 10 other countries.
For Bakos, that is tantamount to having access to 9,000 engineers worldwide
working on steam or combustion turbines. Getting this 'great global
engineering department' to work is worth the effort, he says. It has a
combined annual research and development budget in excess of 30 per cent of
the company's power generation sales - and no one in engineering could
afford that amount of spending alone.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unknown quantity on the party line
 -The rise of an MP with a business background
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Tory MPs urging the promotion of 'exciting new faces' in the next
reshuffle in order to regain the political initiative, Mr Roger Freeman is
an unlikely prospect for the cabinet.
Among the growing number who would settle for competence, however, there is
less surprise that his name has been appearing third or fourth on the
shortlists of those tipped for the cabinet. The Commons debate on rail
privatisation next week will determine whether it stays there.
So far, Mr Freeman and the bill he has piloted through the detailed 100-plus
hours of committee discussion have survived the process almost unscathed.
In January last year, however, he underwent some days of public apologies
for remarks that post-privatisation franchise holders might want to run
'cheap and cheerful' services for typists and different services at other
times. That apart, he has attracted favourable reviews from backbenchers for
his courtesy and diligence.
Some rightwingers suggest Mr Freeman as the next Treasury chief secretary
because of his numeracy and mastery of detail - he qualified as an
accountant. But to many of his colleagues, he remains an unknown quantity.
Since becoming an MP in 1983, he has had little opportunity to express
personal views rather than departmental policy. Seven of his 10 years as the
first Tory MP for Kettering since John Profumo have been spent as a
minister: first at the Ministry of Defence, then at the Department of Health
and, since 1990, at transport.
He says the reason he went into politics was that he is 'fascinated' with
the process of government and of parliament. 'I don't think I'd make a very
good backbencher - I like the challenge of translating a policy into
results.'
While a backbench MP, he was on the influential cross-party Treasury
committee, and in October 1985 was one of the Tories who voted -
unsuccessfully - for the committee to recommend a decision in principle to
enter the European exchange rate mechanism, instead of concluding that there
should be no change in the status quo over the short to medium term.
Having spent almost 20 years before entering parliament as a partner at
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, in charge of the international
office, he opposes political union and says he is 'a European for business
reasons'.
Overall, Mr Freeman gives the impression that he is a Conservative largely
for business, rather than political, reasons.
He strongly believes in enterprise, innovation and effort; in bringing the
private sector into government affairs; and in a low rate of direct
taxation, together with moves towards ending tax perks and allowances.
He takes an austere view of the politician's role - though supporting the
education reforms and having worked on the health service reforms, for
example, he has not campaigned in his constituency for individual schools to
become grant-maintained or for GPs to become fund-holding practices.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government firm on rail
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS insisted yesterday that they would press ahead with the
government's rail privatisation plans, despite calls from some Tory
backbenchers for a change in approach to allow British Rail to bid in open
competition for the franchises.
Along with that proposal, Tory MPs also intend to table today amendments to
the bill which are designed to ensure the survival of pensioners' railcards
and of London Travelcards for commuters; and to prevent excessive fare
increases, line closures and cuts to services.
Sir Keith Speed, Tory MP for Ashford and one of the leading rebels, said he
believed up to 10 Conservatives would put their names to the amendments, and
that a further 20 to 30 were sympathetic. The government's overall Commons
majority is just 18.
Although only a handful of Tories abstained when the bill first came before
the Commons in February, the rebels say unease in Conservative ranks has
intensified, particularly since this month's disastrous local election
results.
Mr David Nicholson, the MP for Taunton, and Mr Peter Bottomley, a former
transport minister, are among the Tories expressing anxiety about the future
of railway services and levels of investment.
Ministers are still confident that they can answer backbenchers' concerns
before MPs debate the details of the bill at the beginning of next week.
Towards the end of the week, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary,
will publish a detailed response to the report from the cross-party
transport committee last month, and will also announce their conclusions on
arrangements for BR pensioners and current employees.
A group of backbenchers is expected to meet Mr MacGregor and Mr Roger
Freeman, the transport minister, later this week, and Sir Keith is
optimistic that the government will move some way on their points. The
rebels say that their proposals would not wreck the bill but would make it
more workable, consumer-friendly, and politically popular. Mr MacGregor,
however, was clear that the government would not accept the suggested
amendment to allow BR to compete for the franchises.
He said yesterday that there had been 30 expressions of interest from teams
of BR employees, which meant that there would be 'a very substantial
opportunity for people in the railways to bid'.
The prime minister's office underlined that the government would make every
effort to assist management teams. The government is making Pounds 100,000
available to each team to help prepare bids.
While it is clear that ministers do not want to accept the other amendments
either, they are less central to the structure of the privatisation, and
there may be a little more room for manoeuvre.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Euro-sceptics plan their tactics
after Danish poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY EURO-SCEPTICS were last night putting on a brave face ahead of today's
Danish referendum on Maastricht while acknowledging that the poll will
probably result in a Yes vote.
If the Danes do vote Yes, the Maastricht bill will return to the Commons for
its third reading on Thursday before moving on to the Lords. The government
is assured of a large majority in Thursday's vote largely because Labour has
decided to abstain.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to give an initial response
to the referendum in a speech tonight at a Confederation of British Industry
dinner. It is widely expected that a No vote would result in Thursday's
business being changed.
Some Euro-sceptics were yesterday keeping their spirits up by looking
forward to obstacles that the government still has to cross.
These include the bill's passage through the Lords and the possible judicial
review of the assertion by ministers that failing to incorporate the
protocol containing Britain's social chapter opt-out into UK law had no
effect on their ability to ratify the treaty.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay, forecast difficulties in store
for the government if a motion on a Maastricht referendum was selected for
debate at the Conservative party conference this autumn.
'If conference votes yes for a referendum, the government would have a hell
of a problem,' she said.
Others drew encouragement from the way the hard core of 26 Euro-sceptics has
held together for almost a year since the bill's second reading.
In Thursday's vote, Euro-sceptic leaders will be aiming to beat their
'high-water mark' of 38 rebels who defied the government last month by
supporting a Maastricht referendum. They say some waverers may be tempted
into their ranks by the virtual certainty of a government victory.
They plan to meet tomorrow to discuss the way forward.

MR DAVID HUNT, Welsh secretary, angered the Labour benches in the Commons
yesterday by confirming the existence of a written agreement between the

UNION leaders were warned yesterday that they risked damaging the Labour
party's reputation by opposing reforms of their links with the party urged
by Mr John Smith, its leader, Ralph Atkins writes.
As leaders of six of Britain's biggest unions prepared to meet later this
week to discuss alternatives to Mr Smith's proposals, Mr Roy Hattersley,
former deputy leader, warned that Labour would be 'cruelly handicapped' if
it continued to be regarded as being dominated by trade unions.
Labour party officials say Mr Smith is braced for a showdown with unions
over his plans to introduce one-member-one-vote for the selection and
re-selection of Labour parliamentary candidates.
Opposing him are likely to be the Transport and General Workers' union, the
GMB general union, the MSF technicians' union, the UCW communications union
and the RMT, the rail and seamen's union.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster acquires prosperity without
economic strength - Why the 'green shoots' are growing so vigorously in the
province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW British politicians would ever be desperate or brazen enough to point to
Northern Ireland as proof that the nation's economic policy is working as
planned.
But with local elections there later this week and the government trying to
put its by-election and local election defeats behind it, the point could
well be made in the days ahead.
Not only has the province weathered the 1990s economic recession better than
any other region of the UK, but those elusive green shoots of recovery are
also appearing there in more profusion and with greater vigour than anywhere
on the mainland.
The latest batch of economic data and forecasts indicate that not only is
unemployment falling steadily in Northern Ireland, but according to the
London economic consultancy Business Strategies, 'in 1993 every sector of
the province's economy is set to outperform the UK'.
Any attempt to extrapolate this cheery outlook to the mainland economy must,
however, take account of two crucial factors that have helped cushion the
severity of this recession in Northern Ireland, and are influencing its
recovery.
According to Mr Graham Gudgin, director of the Northern Ireland Economic
Research Centre, 'unlike the recession in the early 1980s, which was driven
by a high exchange rate, this recession has been driven by high interest
rates and mortgage debt'.
House prices and mortgage debt are much lower in Northern Ireland than in
the UK generally, so disposable incomes have been less severely hit, and
neither has there been the 'negative equity' problem which is continuing to
hold back consumer spending on the mainland.
The second factor has been the role played by public-sector spending in the
province. Forty per cent of the workforce in Northern Ireland is employed in
the public sector, including the security forces, compared to 20 per cent
nationally.
The higher unemployment levels and higher dependency ratios in Northern
Ireland have created the need for a relatively larger Civil Service in the
province to deal with the greater demands placed on it for social welfare,
education and health services.
This is also reflected in the fact that Northern Ireland is a net receiver
of Exchequer funds to the tune of Pounds 3.5bn, and is perhaps a warning to
anyone wishing to draw a lesson from Northern Ireland's economic
performance.
As Mr Gudgin said: 'Northern Ireland has done well through the recession,
but not for having an inherently stronger economy than other parts of the
UK.'
Mr Michael Smyth of the department of Applied Economics at the University of
Ulster says: 'Northern Ireland has the highest regional population of
two-income families, partly due to the large public sector here. So the drop
in consumer demand during the recession has been nothing like as severe as
on the mainland.' To underline this point, he called up a graph on his
computer screen showing how bank lending has continued to grow steadily
throughout the recession. 'The latest figures on hire-purchase credit also
show that we have definitely turned the corner,' he said. There had been a
particularly strong upturn in credit for car purchases during the first
quarter of 1993.
He was cautious on the longer-term prospects. 'The economy here is
demand-driven by public spending and by demand from the mainland. Any real
growth will be determined by GB demand and therefore will depend upon
recovery there.'
Weaker competitiveness will also act as a brake. According to Mr Gudgin:
'One question for Northern Ireland is whether productivity is now out of
line with the rest of the UK due to the lower level of redundancies here.
There could be a period of very slow growth in employment as the rest of the
country recovers.'
This view is echoed by Mr David Hitchens of the economics department at
Queen's University in Belfast, who specialises in long-range forecasting.
'Competitiveness here is poor compared to Great Britain and the republic (of
Ireland), and the basic weaknesses of the economy are likely to remain into
the foreseeable future,' he says.
Lower levels of management skills and higher levels of long-term
unemployment, also due to a shortage of shop-floor skills, are widely
considered to be behind lower productivity in the province and which have
only recently begun to be addressed by the Northern Ireland Office with
additional funds for training.
Mr Gudgin points out that of the province's 105,000 unemployed - 14.1 per
cent of the workforce - '40 per cent have been without work for more than
four years'.
The promising signals of recovery in Northern Ireland, recorded in the
statistics and surveys of business confidence, thus tell only part of the
story. Anyone wishing to draw comfort from them can have little cause for
complacency.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour speech may come when Commons
debates Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH may make the main Labour speech when the Commons debates the
principle of the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, probably later this
year.
Labour party strategists are considering the move as part of an effort to
increase the number of high-profile Commons appearances made by the Labour
leader.
Strategists feel the set-piece Commons speech remains Mr Smith's forte
rather than the thrust and counter-thrust of prime minister's question time.
Another possibility would be for Mr Smith to open a debate chosen by Labour
on one of its allotted quota of opposition days. Mr Neil Kinnock, the former
Labour leader, did this once during the last parliament.
The government consented last month to a separate vote on the principle of
the social chapter which could take place before the bill enacting the
treaty in UK law took effect.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister tells Tories to reject
free-market dogma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the rising stars of Mr John Major's government last night called on
the Conservative party to abandon the 'slavish adherence' to the economic
dogma which characterised the politics of the 1980s.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said the
collapse of Eastern bloc socialism gave the Conservatives the opportunity to
shed their polarised image as a party content simply 'to leave things to the
market'.
His comments came as Mr Major prepared to underline to the Confederation of
British Industry his commitment to industrial revival by calling for a
partnership between government and industry across all Whitehall policy
areas.
He will reaffirm his determination to encourage the joint financing of
infrastructure projects by the public and private sectors.
The prime minister will also tell the CBI annual dinner tonight that the
white paper on science policy being drawn up by Mr William Waldegrave,
public service minister, will be geared towards improving British industrial
competitiveness.
In his lecture to the Tory Reform Group last night, Mr Dorrell underlined
the break with Thatcherite 'ideology' by arguing that dogmatic attachment to
market economics had represented a 'profound misrepresentation of the true
Tory position'.
Mr Dorrell, who is tipped for membership of the cabinet in the next
reshuffle, said that the party should instead recognise that market
economics was no more than a means of delivering political objectives.
Central to those objectives were higher living standards, but they included
also such concepts of social stability, evolutionary change, individual
responsibility and the rule of law. 'Economic policies must, therefore, be
shaped by our commitment to those wider political objectives, not simply the
arid dictates of academic economics.'
Mr Dorrell stressed that this did not imply any weakening of the
government's resolve to deliver price stability. The relative experiences of
Britain and Germany in the post-war period underlined the damage - economic,
social and industrial - wrought by failure to control inflation.
Admitting candidly the government's past mistakes he added: 'There is no
secret why the recession in Britain was longer than elsewhere - we had a
higher rate of inflation than our competitors in the 1980s. Recession
follows inflation as night follows day.'
Mr Dorrell also emphasised that the disciplines of the marketplace provided
the essential basis for wealth creation by matching the output of producers
with the changing needs of consumers.
But adopting a rhetoric calculated to dismay those on the right of the Tory
party who cling to the free market doctrines expounded by Baroness Thatcher,
he added: 'Market disciplines are not the Holy Grail.'
Governments would also want to define the parameters in which market
conclusions were acceptable, he said.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Friction over ERM strains cabinet
unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME MINISTER'S office yesterday distanced itself from remarks by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, that Britain was unlikely to rejoin the
European exchange rate mechanism before the next general election.
Mr Clarke's weekend comments annoyed Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who
has been careful to avoid specifying a timescale for Britain's return to the
ERM. They also added to speculation that Mr Clarke is eager to succeed Mr
Lamont in a summer cabinet reshuffle.
In words believed also to reflect Mr Major's frustration at Mr Clarke's
intervention, a Downing Street spokesman said the home secretary had offered
'a personal view'.
Although most cabinet ministers agree privately with Mr Clarke that British
ERM re-entry is a long way off, the obligations of the Maastricht treaty
have restricted public comment on the likely timing. Downing Street made
clear yesterday that it did not believe the second stage of European
monetary union, due from January 1994, would run according to the Maastricht
timetable.
A spokesman said Britain was 'most unlikely' to be in the narrow bands of
the European exchange rate mechanism, as envisaged under stage two, by then.
Mr Clarke, among the most pro-European of cabinet ministers, has annoyed the
Treasury by straying into its policy areas - although the home secretary's
colleagues believed he was stating the obvious.
UK government policy remains that re-entry depends on the conditions set out
by Mr Lamont: principally on UK and German monetary policy being closer in
line, and on a fundamental review of how 'fault lines' in the ERM can be
overcome.
The friction between Mr Clarke and Mr Lamont added yesterday to the
continuing tension and nervousness within Tory ranks.
Amid rows over British Rail privatisation, the government is also preparing
for a confrontation tomorrow with its own backbenchers over the threat to
rural Post Offices of moves towards the automatic transfer to bank accounts
of state benefits.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, will use a Commons debate to try
to calm Tory MPs' fears that manifesto commitments to a nationwide network
of Post Offices could be broken in the quest for cost savings.
Yesterday Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, said the
government should withdraw any leaflets given to pensioners which do not
make clear that decisions on the method of payment will lie with the
customer.
Rightwing Tory MPs last night increased pressure on Mr Major for a cabinet
reshuffle after their own inquest into the Tories' recent disastrous local
and by-election performances.
A meeting of about 35 members of the 92 Group heard concerns about Mr
Lamont's unpopularity.
Afterwards a senior MP in the group said the prime minister had to heal the
wounds inflicted on the party by the Maastricht treaty by 'mutual respect'
for its pro-Europe and Euro-sceptic wings.
The 92 is to make a presentation, urging greater emphasis on law and order
and deregulation, to Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, later this week.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: EC move to protect consumers
opposed
</HEADLINE>

THE GOVERNMENT is to continue to resist attempts by the European Commission
to include financial services in a new EC directive on distance selling,
Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, told the House of Lords last
night.
She maintained that financial services would not fit well in the framework
of the regulation. It was designed to provide greater protection for
consumers as the single European market and developments in
telecommunications led to more products being sold across national borders.
Lord Peston, from the Labour front bench, and Lord Thomson of Monifieth, for
the Liberal Democrats, both argued for the inclusion of financial services
in the scope of the new directive, but Lady Denton stressed that the sector
was already subject to detailed regulation at both national and EC level.
She accepted that there might well be a case for providing further
protection for consumers, but insisted that this could best be achieved by
building on measures already in force or being developed.
Lady Denton also warned against plans to give consumers an automatic refund
on any disputed credit card sale where proper electronic identification of
the card itself had not been made.
The EC draft directive would mean that a telephone sale by credit card
should be void if challenged by the cardholder.
Baroness Denton said: 'The government understands the need for safeguards
against abuse of credit cards, but everyone is concerned that the current
provisions in the proposal are too heavily loaded in favour of the
consumer.'
The draft directive also addresses the question of unsolicited advertising
by fax, stressing the need for privacy, but with no firm proposals.
