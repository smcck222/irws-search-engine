FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Court services switch considered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Taylor, spokesman in the Commons for Lord Mackay, the Lord
Chancellor, confirmed yesterday that consideration was being given to
switching responsibility for the provision of court services away from the
public sector.
He said the initial use of an agency under the so-called 'next steps'
arrangements was being deliberated upon with very great care.
Mr Paul Boateng, a Labour front bench spokesman, underlined the concern
aroused by the 'disastrous impact of privatisation on other aspects of the
justice system'.
He called for an assurance that the best interests of the consumers of legal
services were properly safeguarded.
Mr Taylor agreed that 'it is the consumers and users whose interests must be
considered the most important'.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Norway attacked over whaling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY was condemned from both sides of the Commons yesterday for announcing
its intention to resume commercial whaling while seeking membership of the
European Community, which bans the practice.
Urging the Norwegian government to reconsider its position, Mr John Gummer,
agriculture minister, stressed that if the membership application succeeded
the rules of the EC would have to be accepted.
Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, protested: 'Surely it cannot
be right for a country to seek to join the EC if it intends to flout one of
its regulations?'
But Mr Gummer agreed with Mr John Bowis (C Battersea) that, far from having
the whaling issue used as a barrier, Norway should be encouraged to become a
member of the EC so that its regulations could be strictly enforced.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unions warned on Labour links row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION leaders were warned yesterday that they risked damaging the Labour
party's reputation by opposing reforms of their links with the party urged
by Mr John Smith, its leader, Ralph Atkins writes.
As leaders of six of Britain's biggest unions prepared to meet later this
week to discuss tactics for opposing the move, Mr Roy Hattersley, former
deputy leader, warned that Labour would be 'cruelly handicapped' if it
continued to be regarded as being dominated by trade unions.
Labour party officials say Mr Smith is braced for a showdown with unions
over his plans to introduce one-member-one-vote for the selection and
re-selection of Labour parliamentary candidates. The row is expected to come
to a head at Labour's conference in October.
Ranged against Mr Smith are likely to be the Transport and General Workers'
union, the GMB general union, the MSF technicians' union, the UCW
communications union and RMT, the rail and seamen's union.
Mr Smith may also make the main Labour speech when the Commons debates the
principle of the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, probably later this
year.
Labour party strategists are considering the move as part of an effort to
increase the number of high-profile Commons appearances made by the Labour
leader.
Strategists feel the set-piece Commons speech remains Mr Smith's forte
rather than the thrust and counter-thrust of prime minister's questions.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welsh deal angers Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, Welsh secretary, angered the Labour benches in the Commons
yesterday by confirming the existence of a written agreement between the
government and Welsh nationalist MPs over the membership of the European
Community's proposed committee of the regions.
Mr Ron Davies, the shadow Welsh secretary, said membership of the committee
 -to be established under the terms of the Maastricht treaty  - should be
determined at local government level.
To cheers, he told the minister: 'Any veto, any trickery or any
gerrymandering from you will be completely unacceptable'.
Challenging the Labour leadership to say in turn whether they supported the
Maastricht treaty, Mr Hunt stressed that without it there would be no
committee of the regions - 'and that would be a great shame for Wales'.
Mr Hunt also announced investment in Wales worth Pounds 15m, which he said
would create 425 jobs and safeguard a further 156.
He told MPs that the projects by eight companies setting up, modernising or
expanding operations in the principality were being backed by Pounds 2.6m in
Regional Selective Assistance from the Welsh Office.
Mr Hunt said the new investment was further proof that Wales was leading the
rest of Britain out of recession.
'It is the Welsh Dragon which is breathing fire into the UK recovery,' he
said.
But Labour's Mr Paul Flynn (Newport W) protested there had been no recovery
in Wales.
'What has happened is that a reasonably-paid, highly-skilled workforce has
been turned into a full-scale sweatshop,' he said.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory Euro-sceptics plan tactics
after Danish poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY EURO-SCEPTICS were last night putting on a brave face ahead of today's
Danish referendum on Maastricht while acknowledging that the poll will
probably result in a Yes vote.
If the Danes do vote Yes, the Maastricht bill will return to the Commons for
its third reading on Thursday before moving on to the Lords. The government
is assured of a large majority in Thursday's vote largely because Labour has
decided to abstain.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to give an initial response
to the referendum in a speech tonight at a Confederation of British Industry
dinner. It is widely expected that a No vote would result in Thursday's
business being changed.
Some Euro-sceptics were yesterday keeping their spirits up by looking
forward to obstacles that the government still has to cross.
These include the bill's passage through the Lords and the possible judicial
review of the assertion by ministers that failing to incorporate the
protocol containing Britain's social chapter opt-out into UK law had no
effect on their ability to ratify the treaty.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay, forecast difficulties in store
for the government if a motion on a Maastricht referendum was selected for
debate at the Conservative party conference this autumn.
'If conference votes yes for a referendum, the government would have a hell
of a problem,' she said.
The Maastricht issue was 'by no means dead', Mrs Gorman added. 'We are not
talking about the vicarage tea party, after all, but the way this country is
governed.'
Others drew encouragement from the way the hard core of 26 Euro-sceptics has
held together for almost a year since the bill's second reading.
Still others were buoyed by a sense of having performed a valuable public
service with their opposition over Maastricht.
'There is a feeling among the group that we can say 'we told you not to
believe Neville Chamberlain,'' said one MP, en route to a prayer meeting
outside the Danish embassy.
Another prominent Euro-sceptic referred to the remarks made this weekend by
Sir Edward Heath and said he regarded it as the 'pinnacle' of his political
career to be told that he would be hated by the former prime minister.
In Thursday's vote, Euro-sceptic leaders will be aiming to beat their
'high-water mark' of 38 Tory rebels who defied the government last month by
supporting a Maastricht referendum. They say that some waverers may well be
tempted into their ranks by the virtual certainty of a government victory.
They plan to meet tomorrow to discuss the way forward. They are expected to
tell government whips not to count on their support on Europe-related issues
even after Maastricht has completed its Commons passage.
The government, meanwhile, is expected to take pains to minimise the
rebellion on Thursday.
One MP who supported a referendum but is not among the Euro-sceptic
hard-core said yesterday that he would vote with the government on the third
reading.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Swan Hunter fightback launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to save the Swan Hunter shipyard was launched yesterday amid
fears that the government's proposed enterprise zone for Tyneside could be
conditional on an end to shipbuilding on the river.
Labour MP Mr Steve Byers, in whose Wallsend constituency Swan Hunter is
based, said there was growing concern that the European Commission might
impose similar conditions on a Tyneside enterprise zone as on Sunderland in
1989.
Under the EC deal - part of a Pounds 45m rescue package to cushion the blow
of closure of the River Wear's last two shipyards - resumption of
shipbuilding was barred on the sites for at least five years. One of the
sites, at Southwick, has since been cleared for new industrial development.
An enterprise zone was part of the Tyneside aid package proposed last
Wednesday by Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, if there are
substantial job losses at Swan Hunter. He said the zone would have to be
agreed by the EC.
Swan Hunter, the last shipbuilder on the Tyne, last week failed to win a
helicopter carrier order from the MoD and went into receivership on
Thursday.
The 'Life for Swans' campaign, which involves local authorities, trade
unions, MPs and MEPs, will also press the government to seek EC intervention
funding for the company. That would give Swan Hunter a 9 per cent subsidy on
merchant shipbuilding work.
When the company was privatised in a management buyout in 1986, it was sold
as a warship yard, debarring it from Intervention Funding. This hindered its
attempts to diversify out of warship building.
Talks between receivers Price Waterhouse and the MoD continued all day
yesterday over whether outfitting of three Type 23 frigates can continue at
Swans. The work offers the company's best hope of finding a buyer.
Last night, sources said the MoD had said work could continue on the
frigates at Swans until May 28, but it is understood agreement was not
reached on when payment would be made.
Mr Byers said: 'The conduct of the Ministry of Defence in their dealings
with the receivers has been nothing short of scandalous. The MoD should stop
playing cat-and-mouse with the livelihoods of the thousands of workers.'

FT  18 MAY 93 / Truck sales show signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of new commercial vehicles declined in April by 1.7 per cent, but
there are growing signs that demand is recovering in key segments such as
trucks and panel vans.
While total commercial vehicle sales have been lower than a year ago in
three of the past four months, new truck registrations have been staging a
modest recovery since mid-1992.
New truck registrations have been higher than a year before in nine of the
past 10 months. The market remains fragile, but sales in April increased by
11.8 per cent year-on-year while truck registrations in the first four
months were 2 per cent higher than a year before.
Leyland Daf, the former UK truck market leader, has suffered heavily from
its financial collapse in February, with its van sales more than halved in
the first four months of the year.
Leyland Daf truck sales have also fallen by 19 per cent in an overall market
segment that has risen by 2 per cent.
The former UK truck market leader has been pushed into third place in the
overall truck market behind the Iveco group of Italy, which includes Iveco
Ford and Seddon Atkinson, and behind Mercedes-Benz of Germany.
In the heavy truck market (above 15 tonnes gross vehicle weight) Volvo and
Scania, the Swedish producers, have benefited most from the demise of
Leyland Daf. Volvo has taken over for the first time as UK market leader in
this segment, while Iveco has also overtaken Leyland Daf.
The former Leyland Daf vans operation in Birmingham was rescued from
receivership by a management buy-out late last month, while negotiations are
also at an advanced stage for a management buy-out of the truck assembly
operations in Leyland, Lancashire.
Overall UK new commercial vehicle sales in April fell by 1.7 per cent to
16,927 from 17,220 in the same month a year before according to figures from
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
In the first four months of the year registrations were 4.5 per cent lower
than a year before at 67,171.
The main weaknesses in sales last month were in the light van, bus and
coach, and light four-wheel-drive utility vehicle segments.
Registrations of medium and heavy duty vans, which had been hit hard by the
demise of Leyland Daf in the early months of the year, began to recover in
April with a year-on-year increase of 7.6 per cent.
In the light van sector imports have jumped by 76 per cent as a result of
General Motors' decision to supply most of its car-derived vans from
Portugal.
Overall imports captured 40.3 per cent of UK new commercial vehicle sales in
the first four months compared with 35.7 per cent a year ago.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Spending 'set to rise sharply'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER SPENDING is set to rise sharply over the next few months following
a run-down of interest-bearing savings accounts, according to a 'weighted'
measure of the broad money supply.
The 'divisia' measure is being considered by the Bank of England as an
alternative indicator of future inflat-ion.
This measure of the money supply weights its components - cash, bank and
building society deposits - according to the extent to which they represent
money for spending rather than saving.
Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, says such an index
shows that people have depleted bank and building society deposit accounts
accumulated during the late 1980s when interest rates were high.
Some of the money has been channeled into government bonds and equities, but
much of it, says Mr Spencer, is going into current accounts and cash.
'Such a switch would normally be seen as a prelude to spending,' says Mr
Spencer.
The sharp growth in the divisia measure of money has worrying implications
for inflation. The story it tells stands in sharp contrast to that of M4,
the conventional measure of broad money, which has registered only sluggish
growth in recent months.
M4 simply adds cash and the different types of deposits together, treating
them as perfect substitutes for one another. It thus fails to capture the
movement between different types of accounts and what this might mean for
output and inflation.
Conventional measures of the money supply have been criticised for failing
to provide a reliable indicator of the relationship between the level of
money in the economy and future inflation.
Mr Spencer says in a recent paper: 'Because they do not earn interest, cash
and sight bank deposits are more likely to be held for making transactions
rather than as a home for savings and investment funds. So their behaviour
reflects spending plans and the pace of economic activity as well as
fluctuations in interest rates'.
Mr Spencer's divisia index, which he has been running since 1986, shows that
in the first quarter, compared with the fourth quarter, money supply grew at
an annualised rate of 12.2 per cent. On the same basis, M4 grew by 5.3 per
cent.
The discrepancy between divisia and M4 occurs not only because a shift from
high-interest to lower interest accounts has no impact on M4, but also
because part of the funds until recently held in high-interest bearing
accounts are being shifted into gilts and equities, which removes them from
the M4 measure of the money supply altogether. This has a more depressing
effect on M4 than on the divisia measure.
The Bank's divisia index did not grow as strongly as Mr Spencer's in the
first quarter. The Bank pointed out that this was because of differences in
the construction of the indices.
Some independent economists have urged the government to adopt divisia as a
target for controlling inflation. In the Bank's quarterly bulletin,
published today, economists say that treating cash in the same way as
interest-bearing deposits is 'probably misleading'.
It concludes that a divisia index, with weighted components, might have a
closer relationship with total expenditure in the economy than conventional
monetary aggregates.

epileptic seizures will be conducted with Pounds 19,000 from the Department
of Trade and Industry.
The aim is to discover how many children with no previous history of
epilepsy are having seizures triggered by computer games.
'We all hear anecdotal case reports of this happening, but we do not know
how much of a problem it really is,' said Dr David Fish of the National
Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, the study's co-ordinator.
About 30,000 cases of epilepsy are diagnosed annually in the UK. Four per
cent - 1,200 new patients a year - have 'photosensitive epilepsy,' which
could be triggered by flickering light or flashing patterns of the sort
generated by computer and video games. It can be identified only by an EEG
(electro-encephalogram) test.
Specialists in charge of hospital EEG departments - there are about 120 in
the UK - will analyse all new patients with photosensitive epilepsy this
summer and again during the winter and report in detail on cases involving
computer games.
The findings will provide a basis for public guidelines and possible
regulatory action by the DTI, which has given the National Society for
Epilepsy a Pounds 19,000 grant to conduct the study.
Dr Fish said computer and video games could not cause epilepsy in children
who were not already photosensitive, but they could in theory trigger a
seizure in someone who might otherwise go through life without realising he
or she had a latent problem.
Leading game manufacturers include epilepsy warnings with their products.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Bank staff attack chief's earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER WOOD, the direc-tor of Royal Bank of Scotland who is expected to
earn at least Pounds 10m this year, was accused by employees yesterday of
accepting money that could have preserved some of the 3,500 jobs being shed
by the bank.
Criticism of Mr Wood's pay as chief executive of Royal Bank's Direct Line
insurance subsidiary coincided yesterday with attacks at the annual
conference of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union in Llandudno on the
jobs policies of banks and building societies.
Mr Ian Williams, a member of the union's national executive, accused Mr Wood
of betraying Royal Bank employees who face job losses over the next five
years as part of the bank's branch restructuring project, called Columbus.
'It may be that some of the jobs are going in order to pay Mr Wood's bonus,'
Mr Williams said. 'If that is so, then the going rate for the job seems a
bit high. Even Judas was only paid 30 pieces of silver to betray one man.'
Delegates expressed worry about large job losses in the finance industry.
The union estimates that 70,000 jobs have gone in the past three years and
that 30,000 more are at at risk.
Royal Bank was singled out for criticism because of its refusal to rule out
compulsory redundancies. The union has just reached an agreement with
National Westminster Bank which it believes will reduce compulsory
redundancies. Mr Leif Mills, the union's general secretary, said employment
in financial services had been 'hit savagely' by the recession, and that
banks were reducing branch networks to pay for losses on 'reckless' lending
in the 1980s.
The conference passed motions calling on Royal Bank to give guarantees that
there would be no compulsory redundancies, and for the union to insist that
all redundancies are agreed within job security agreements with banks.
Bifu said yesterday it expected the Co-operative Bank to breach an agreement
on job security by making up to 20 managers compulsorily redundant after
meetings this week. The union said a further 130 clerical staff risked
losing their jobs after being designated 'surplus staff', although the bank
had given a commitment they would not be made compulsorily redundant this
year.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Second building society backs PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRADFORD and Bingley, the UK's seventh largest building society, has
welcomed plans to form the Personal Investment Authority, the controversial
self-regulatory body for retail financial services, Norma Cohen writes.
The endorsement by Bradford and Bingley, the only big building society to
remain a dispenser of independent financial advice, follows a similar
decision by Halifax, the market leader. Earlier this month it became the
first society to back the authority.
The authority is intended to bring all retail financial services providers,
including banks and building societies, under the umbrella of a single
self-regulatory body.
But in the authority's planning stages, banks and building societies had
baulked at joining, and life insurance companies had said they would not
join unless the banks did as well.
Mr Geoffrey Lister, Bradford and Bingley chairman, said: 'The PIA would
bring consistent rules and standards of supervision to the whole industry.'

FT  18 MAY 93 / Nadir free to run businesses in Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, former head of Polly Peck International, has not been made
bankrupt in Turkey and so is legally free to own and run businesses in the
country, it emerged yesterday.
While a Pounds 378m writ brought against him in October 1991 by the
administrators to Polly Peck drove him into bankruptcy in the UK, no similar
action has been taken through the Turkish courts.
His legal status may cause difficulties for administrators after he fled his
bail conditions in the UK two weeks ago for northern Cyprus and declared his
intention to reclaim parts of his business empire.
Mr Neil Cooper, Mr Nadir's court-appointed trustee in bankruptcy, confirmed
that he had not sought to file for bankruptcy in the Turkish courts, but
said this would have little effect on attempts to recover and control
assets.
He said there was little chance that if the Turkish courts did not recognise
English bankruptcy they would accept evidence from foreign creditors for
bankruptcy under local law.
Turkish lawyers say the fraud charges Mr Nadir faces in the UK may dissuade
him from entering Turkey, where he could be apprehended by Interpol and face
possible extradition.
Turkish banking law states that no one who has suffered bankruptcy can found
a bank, although again it is unclear whether this applies to bankruptcy
outside Turkey.
Polly Peck International's local companies, although owned by foreign
parties, are subject to Turkish bankruptcy proceedings.
Of the Turkish companies connected with Mr Nadir, only Noble Air, the
airline owned by his sister Mrs Bilge Nevzat, has been declared insolvent by
the Turkish courts.
A number of Turkish creditors including Imar Bank, the Turkish bank owned by
the Uzan family, failed in their pursuit of claims against Mr Nadir's
personal assets.
Mr Nadir's newspaper Gunes, together with his magazine titles, have already
been pledged to the UK creditors.
In addition, Iktisat Bank has won control over an island he owned. Lawyers
say it has now be sold to the Uzan family.
Of the PPI assets, the Antalya Sheraton has been sold to the Dogus group for
an undisclosed sum, believed to be around Dollars 42m. MediaPrint, the print
works in Istanbul, has been bought by the Uzan group for Dollars 9.5m.
Polly Peck's shares in Pizza Gida, the local Pizza Hut franchise, have been
taken over by Pepsi Cola for an undisclosed sum.

FT  18 MAY 93 / City divided on how to plug tide of price-sensitive leaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange's public censure last Friday of London International
Group, the condoms to photo processing company, for leaking information was
well-timed. In Saturday's papers, alongside news of the censure, were
detailed reports that British Airways will today launch a rights issue.
The BA leak, if true, will embarrass the company because of its timing. But
it also suggests that the selective passing of price-sensitive information
from companies or their advisers to the market remains widespread.
LIG was censured after it separately told 13 analysts and four institutions
that profits forecasts for the company were too high. The exchange said this
type of information should have been released simultaneously to all
investors via an official announcement.
Most in the City would probably agree with the exchange in this case, and
concur that LIG's profit warning overstepped the rules. There is, however,
little agreement about how to deal with leaks generally.
Mr David Barclay, deputy head of corporate finance at County NatWest, said:
'We would welcome a tightening up of the application of equality of
information principle. But it is a grey area - this has always been a
difficult area.'
Another merchant banker, who did not want to be identified, said: 'It
happens all the time. You need to feed out little titbits, because if you
don't then you have a false market.'
The LIG case has focused attention on when leaks are price-sensitive and
therefore only disclosable through an official announcement. With the
government proposing tighter laws against insider trading it also raises the
question of whether companies should review the way they release information
to analysts and the press.
The exchange is reluctant to lay down guidelines for what is and is not
price-sensitive, saying it believes companies and their financial advisers
are better placed to judge. A decision by J Sainsbury to open two new stores
is less significant than a similar move by a much smaller company.
Equally, J Sainsbury's decision to expand is more significant than a similar
move by a company in an industry with long lead times, in process
engineering for example.
Companies and advisers talk of a 'grey area' of disclosure, which may have
been built up over years of practice. For example, hotel companies often
reveal publicly and privately their occupancy levels even though, especially
with smaller companies, these figures can be very price-sensitive.
In general, the exchange points to the 'Yellow Book' of listing rules,
requiring the immediate release of information which 'might reasonably be
expected to have a material effect' on a share price or trading volume. If
in doubt, according to the exchange, consult your financial adviser. The
relationship between companies and analysts is also likely to be reviewed
after the LIG ruling. In the past some companies have 'steered' analysts to
profit or loss figures. Some analysts admit that without this help, profit
forecasts soon become little better than guesswork.
The exchange said it agreed companies needed to have close relations with
analysts. But at private briefings no new material information should be
released, nor should precise profit or loss figures be revealed. Information
should not be sufficiently precise for analysts to work out exact figures.
Companies had probably already started tightening up in this area after the
conviction earlier this year of an Edinburgh fund manager for insider
dealing after he had been given a profits warning by a company in advance of
its publication.
According to the finance director of a FT-SE 100 company: 'These are
important developments and we need to make sure we are up with best
practice. We will have to be a little more careful.' With pressure on
companies and their advisers to stop leaking, official announcements are
likely to become more frequent and, perhaps, more thorough. Many companies
use announcements to communicate the outline of a development or change in
strategy. Detailed questions from analysts and journalists are then dealt
with at meetings or by telephone.
When the news is bad, companies have been reluctant to issue official
announcements, mainly because the market can overreact. As with LIG, many
have preferred to use leaking.
Mr John Makinson, of investor relations company Makinson Cowell, said that
if companies made more routine announcements through the exchange, there
would be less of a stigma attached to releasing bad news.

FT  18 MAY 93 / RMT workers vote narrowly for rail peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of further industrial action on the railways receded last night
as members of RMT, the main rail union, rejected the advice of their union
leaders and voted narrowly in a ballot to support British Rail's peace
formula.
The conflict over the use of contract labour and union demands for a
guarantee that there would be no compulsory redundancies led to two damaging
one-day strikes last month. They cost British Rail about Pounds 20m in lost
business.
The railway workers voted 18,544 in favour of British Rail's package and
18,361 against, but on only a 62.5 per cent turnout. The union's executive
committee had recommended rejection.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said this meant there would be
no more disruption on the railway network. But he said the ballot result
showed 'there is a deeply discontented and disaffected workforce out there'.
During long negotiations with the union, British Rail made a number of
important concessions.
It said it saw no reason why any railway workers should have to leave the
industry against their will over the next couple of years and did not
foresee expanding the use of contract work during the same period.
The backing for British Rail was more decisive among its engineering workers
and technicians in British Rail's workshops, where the vote was 1,613 for
acceptance and 532 for rejection. This followed British Rail's promise of no
compulsory redundancies in the workshops for at least the next 12 months.
Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail, said he was delighted at the
outcome. 'It is a victory for common sense', he said. 'I am pleased that
railway workers have told the RMT that they want an end to this dispute.
He added: 'The union must now do what its members have demanded.'
Sir Bob went on to say that British Rail hoped to continue its relationship
with the RMT 'in the way we always have done with good sense and sympathy'.
But British Rail said last night that it had not changed its decision to end
the check-off system with the RMT under which British Rail paid members'
union subscriptions into the union's coffers from their wage packets.
British Rail made the decision after the RMT went ahead with a second
damaging one-day strike.
Mr Knapp admitted last night that the peace proposals made by the British
Rail board - 'though falling short of the union's objectives' - did have
'positive aspects'.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Accountancy ex-investigator to face probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER head of the investigations committee of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales has been called to appear before its
disciplinary committee.
The institute said yesterday that its disciplinary committee will study the
'supervisory responsibilities' carried out by Mr Brian Worth when he was in
charge of the investigations committee. He was also chairman of Clark
Kenneth Leventhal (CKL), an international association of accountancy firms.
The inquiry follows the conviction for forgery and deception at the Old
Bailey three years ago of Mr Nick Young, a former executive director of CKL
based in London.
The case has been referred to the disciplinary committee by the institute's
investigations committee, which has judged that there is a case to answer.
Mr Worth resigned from the investigations committee in late 1991 when it
began examining the case.
Mr Young, who was not an accountant, used CKL's address and its stationery
as part of a scheme which attracted more than Pounds 7m from more than 70
investors over 10 years.
While claiming to invest money in offshore trusts offering high rates of
return, Mr Young was actually spending it on a system of horserace betting
which he believed he had perfected while attending Cambridge University in
the 1960s.
Mr Richard Hornsby, the chairman of the CKL victims' group - which
represents those who gave money to Mr Young - said that he drew comfort from
the referral decision.
Five writs claiming Pounds 7m plus interest have already been issued. A
further writ for about Pounds 1m is expected shortly.
Mr Worth said yesterday that he also welcomed the proceedings as a chance to
clear his name.
He said that the CKL committee was spread around the world and that Mr Young
was the association's only employee in the UK. He said that he had only met
Mr Young once or twice each month.
More than 60 CKL investors are pressing ahead with legal action for
compensation against CKL and Clark Whitehill, its British associate member.
A hearing for the action is scheduled for the end of the year.
The institute's disciplinary committee is expected to meet to hear Mr
Worth's case in September.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Midlands tram contract awarded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAM, a company formed by construction group Taylor Woodrow and rail
equipment maker Ansaldo Trasporti of Naples, was yesterday chosen by the
West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority to build and operate the first
line of a local tram system, Paul Cheeseright writes.
Centram will pay Pounds 10m towards the building costs and will receive a
franchise to operate the regional light rail rapid transit system without
subsidy for 20 years.
The capital cost of the project at April prices is Pounds 112m, leaving
Centram and Centro, the operating arm of the passenger transport authority,
to find Pounds 102m before construction starts.
The total cost, including land purchase and an allowance for inflation
during the projected three-year construction period, is Pounds 135m.
Midland Metro will run 20km from central Birmingham, via West Bromwich and
Bilston, to Wolverhampton, using mainly existing railway trackbeds. Only in
Wolverhampton will the line run along the street.
Centro hopes construction will start in 1994-95. 'The only impediment to it
going forward is finding a slot in government spending plans,' said Mr Bob
Tarr, its director- general.
By selecting a private sector partner, Centro hopes to take advantage of the
government's readiness, expressed in the Autumn Statement, to look
favourably on private-sector or public-sector plans for infrastructure
developments. It needs Pounds 50m from the Department of Transport.
At present the government's budget of about Pounds 50m a year for regional
light rail projects is being spent in Sheffield. The west Midlands project
is said to be the next in line.
The balance would come from local authority borrowing, once the government
is prepared to give credit approvals, and from the EC.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Lloyd's deputy to quit syndicate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Stephen Merrett, deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, is to stand down
as the active underwriter of syndicate 418, one of the insurance market's
largest syndicates, at the start of next year.
Mr Merrett, 53, will spend more time on the development of activities of
Merrett Holdings and will be especially concerned with attracting
incorporated capital to the group.
As deputy chairman of Lloyd's he will also form a reinsurance company to
isolate liabilities from old US asbestosis and pollution claims.
Mr Merrett will be replaced at syndicate 418 by his current deputy, Mr
Barnabas Hurst-Bannister. A statement by Merrett Holdings said: 'The matter
of Mr Stephen Merrett's succession and role within the group has been under
consideration for some time.'
Meanwhile, an out-of-court settlement of some of the legal actions troubling
the Lloyd's of London insurance market appeared to be still a possibility
yesterday following a meeting between Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive,
and leaders of four groups of loss-making Names - the individuals whose
assets back the insurance market.
'We are at the foothills of a Mount Everest of negotiations,' said Mr
Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, one of four action
group leaders at the meeting. He said Mr Middleton was 'making a determined
and serious effort, but a deal will be difficult to achieve'.
Also at the two-hour meeting were Mr Colin Hook, Mr Alan Porter and Sir
David Berriman, chairmen respectively of the representatives of Feltrim
Names Association, the Devonshire Names Action Group and the Rose Thomson
Young Action Group.
The groups represent a majority of Names who sustained heavy losses from
spiral reinsurance, in which syndicates and companies reinsured each others'
exposure to high-level catastrophe loss.
Insurance companies which sell policies directly to the public by telephone
are poised to double their share of the Pounds 6.1bn UK motor insurance
market over the next five years, according to a survey by the London-based
GSR group.
It estimates that 'direct writers' will sell two in every five motor
insurance policies by 1998. In 1992 the three biggest direct writers -
Direct Line, Churchill and The Insurance Service - spent Pounds 5.6m on
advertising, just under 25 per cent of the industry's total.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Nuclear industry cautioned on safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE nuclear industry has not paid enough attention to the role of human
error when setting safety standards, the Health and Safety Commission, the
government advisory body, says.
In two reports published yesterday the commission urged the industry to
'maintain safety standards in the face of competing pressures' - such as the
pursuit of profit. Human error was responsible for the incidents at
Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, the world's worst nuclear accidents, as
well as the Clapham rail disaster and the Piper Alpha oil explosion, the
commission argued.
Professor Terry Lee, a member of the commission's advisory committee on the
safety of nuclear installations, which wrote the reports, said that a 'step
change' would be needed to bring about a 'culture of safety' in the nuclear
industry, although technological standards were already extremely high.
Nuclear site operators felt that they had 'got as far as they can with
introduction of technological fixes and now are on a plateau', he added. He
recommended that the emphasis shift to people.
He said that even small details such as employees' 'age and being maritally
contented' may be relevant to safety.
Professor John Hockney, chairman of the commission's advisory committee,
expressed concern at the growing amount of nuclear waste stored at nuclear
sites. 'We are not saying it is unsafe, but we would rather have it in one
place,' he added. The committee is anxious because plans for an underground
store for nuclear waste to be built by UK Nirex, the nuclear industry's
waste disposal company, are progressing so slowly.
The Pollution Inspectorate's report on the public consultation about Thorp,
British Nuclear Fuels' controversial nuclear reprocessing plant at
Sellafield, now appears unlikely to reach Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, before the end of the month.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Call to scrap eight councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT councils in Derbyshire should be abolished by 1995-96, the Local
Government Commission for England said yesterday.
The commission suggested in Alfreton that the current county council and
nine district councils should be replaced by two councils - one for the city
of Derby and the other for the rest of Derbyshire - with administrative
savings estimated at Pounds 16m a year, or 9 per cent of the average council
tax bill.
The commission is examining ways of replacing the two-tier system of local
government with unitary authorities. It has made recommendations for
reorganisation in the Isle of Wight and Cleveland-Durham.
Reorganisation in Derbyshire has a particular significance because the
Labour-controlled county council was a political bete noire of the Thatcher
government.
Under the proposals, the authorities in Amber Valley, Bolsover, North East
Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Derbyshire Dales, High Peak, Erewash and South
Derbyshire would cease to exist. Derby City Council would retain its current
boundaries.
Although the proposals had been widely predicted, there were protests from
authorities with an uncertain future. Derbyshire Dales said: 'The worst
possible scenario for all the people of Derbyshire.'
South Derbyshire said: 'People in South Derbyshire will not stand by to
watch their district fall into oblivion.'
The commission will now test Derbyshire public opinion, 'to tailor local
government to the wishes of the people,' said Sir John Banham, chairman of
the commission.
It will present its final recommendation to the Department of Environment in
September.

FT  18 MAY 93 / EC aid to industry questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY governments should be more strictly controlled in their
use of aid for industry, the Commons Trade and Industry Committee said
yesterday.
In a report on trade with Europe, the cross-party committee of MPs attacked
the slowness of European Commission investigations into alleged illegal
state aid, calling for aid to be frozen during any such inquiry.
The UK is, with Germany and Denmark, one of the lowest users of state aid,
in part because of the dwindling role of publicly-owned companies in
manufacturing.
The report highlights concern that UK companies may be disadvantaged in
competition against companies elsewhere in Europe - in particular in Italy,
Portugal and Ireland - where government aid to industry is comparatively
high. It notes that even though absolute levels of aid are declining, 'what
matters is how seriously state aids are distorting competition in the single
market, and how seriously they are damaging UK companies.'
Of particular concern is the opaque relationship that frequently exists
between public authorities and public companies, the report says. A total of
Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.95bn) of state aid to public sector companies was not
notified to the EC between 1985 and 1990, it said.
Opaque relationships are also of concern in the area of public procurement,
accounting for 15 per cent of the EC's gross domestic product.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Second building society backs PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRADFORD and Bingley, the UK's seventh largest building society, has
welcomed plans to form the Personal Investment Authority, the controversial
self-regulatory body for retail financial services.
The endorsement by Bradford and Bingley, the only big building society to
remain a dispenser of independent financial advice, follows a similar
decision by Halifax, the market leader. Earlier this month it became the
first society to back the authority.
The authority is intended to bring all retail financial services providers,
including banks and building societies, under the umbrella of a single
self-regulatory body.
But in the authority's planning stages, banks and building societies had
baulked at joining, and life insurance companies had said they would not
join unless the banks did as well.
Mr Geoffrey Lister, Bradford and Bingley chairman, said: 'The PIA would
bring consistent rules and standards of supervision to the whole industry.'
He also backed the decision by Halifax, which is a 'tied' agent so is
allowed to sell only the products of one insurance provider.
Tied agents do not need to belong to any self-regulatory body, but building
society tied agents would find it easier within the authority than outside
it to change rules that prevent them selling the products of more than one
provider.

The Saudi Monetary Agency, Saudi Arabia's central bank, said yesterday that
gross national product grew by an average of more than 10 per cent during
the two years of the Gulf crisis and would grow more than 5 per cent in both
1992 and 1993, Reuter reports from Dubai.
The figures were published in a report handed to King Fahd yesterday. It

FT  18 MAY 93 / Saudis defend clampdown on group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA yesterday sought to justify its clampdown on a self-proclaimed
human rights group, arguing that the basic law of government enshrined full
freedoms for the kingdom's citizens.
Dr Ghazi Algosaibi, the Saudi ambassador in London, said if the group was
interested in human rights 'the logical step would have been to refer to the
basic law and work within its framework'.
The seven members of the group, which described itself as the committee for
the defence of legitimate rights, have all been dismissed from their
official posts.
In a statement issued on May 3, the seven, who described themselves as
Islamic scholars, said their objective was 'to contribute in whatever way to
the elimination of injustice, to offer support to the oppressed and to
defend the rights of man'. They asked Saudis to contact them about any
individual grievances.
The announcement of the group's formation was seen as a direct challenge to
the authority of the Council of Senior Ulema, which oversees religious
affairs in the kingdom. The council said that the group was illegitimate and
was to be condemned because no one in Saudi Arabia was barred from
expressing grievances before the courts.
The swift official response underlines the sensitivity of the regime to
accusations from radical Islamic groups that it is failing to govern
according to the tenets of the Koran.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Chinese put money where their Mao is: Traders quick to cash
in on 100th anniversary of the leader's birth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THIS 100th anniversary year of his birth Mao Zedong might turn in his
grave at such displays of raw commercialism.
Mao badges, buttons, little red books, portraits, busts, memorial coins,
stamps, kitsch cigarette lighters and dozens of other trinkets of China's
revolutionary past are being sold in a dusty Shanghai park by traders
seemingly more interested in the capitalist road than they are in the
glorious history of the revolution.
Old Mr Lin, a peasant farmer from Jiangsu province, reckons he has
accumulated 8,000 Mao items, dozens of which he drags, cascading from sacks,
satchels and the deep pockets of his patched jacket.
'Of course, Mao would be very happy seeing me selling his badges; he
believed that we should make revolution first, and then get down to
business,' said Mr Lin with a commercial glint in his eye, lifting up his
pullover to display a selection of badges pinned to a grubby vest.
The brisk trade in Mao memorabilia in Shanghai and at dozens of other
locations throughout China probably also represents yearning for the past
among older-generation Chinese who are having enormous difficulty coming to
terms with what they regard as a 'money-grubbing' present.
Mao, for all his enormous faults, for all the heartbreak and misery his
vainglorious theories about perpetual class struggle brought to millions,
still represents a degree of certainty in a world that is undergoing
revolutionary change.
Thus, one old man in the Shanghai market said that whatever mistakes Mao
might have committed in his later life he should be revered for flattening
China's 'three big mountains': feudalism, colonialism and imperialism.
Mao as a talisman is also undergoing something of resurgence among young
Chinese: those who were perhaps too young to be directly exposed to the
madness of the Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976, when life was
turned upside down, often tragically, for millions of families.
Mao portraits, like an enigmatic oriental St Christopher, dangle from the
rear-view mirrors of thousands of vehicles throughout China. Somehow, in
death, the 'great helmsman' has become the patron saint of Chinese drivers;
and superstitious stories abound of cars displaying his portrait avoiding
accident in a country where 100,000 people died on the roads last year.
In this anniversary year of the birth of a man whose legacy to China is
extremely complicated - official judgment holds that he was 70 per cent
'good' and 30 per cent 'bad' - the authorities seem undecided about how to
mark the occasion. This is partly, one suspects, because the leadership
understands that Mao would not approve the course they have adopted, which
is to embrace capitalism in all but name.
Indeed, drawing undue attention to Mao and his thoughts might highlight the
contrast between past certainty, however austere, and present uncertainty. A
deeply flawed Mao remains, nevertheless, an important symbol of Communist
party legitimacy at a time of rapid change and weakening ideology when his
heirs clearly wish to preserve a link, however tenuous, with a revolutionary
past.
Preparations are going ahead to mark anniversary this December 26, albeit on
a fairly modest scale at this stage. Much activity centres on Shaoshan
village near Hunan's capital, Changsha, where Mao was born, the son of a
relatively well-to-do peasant and grain merchant.
At Shaoshan, set in green and pleasant hills, additional memorials - as if
there were not enough already - are being erected. A Mao library is under
construction along with a new building housing Mao relics.
Elsewhere in China, artists, writers and film makers are also doing their
bit to mark the anniversary. An album of calligraphic works is to be
published to note the occasion, and three feature films and five TV dramas
are in production.
At the Mao mausoleum on Tiananmen Square, where Mao has lain in state for
most of the time since his death in 1976, no special arrangements have yet
been initiated to mark the anniversary, although a small flurry occurred in
the Chinese press recently when a Marxist scholar complained to the China
Youth Daily that Mao's tomb was being defiled by undue commercial activity
in its precincts, such as the sale of tourist items.
Mr Liu Mingyuan of the People's University wrote that the 'practice of doing
business inside Chairman Mao's mausoleum is unconscionable'.
Mao's corpse in this anniversary year has not been immune from scare
stories. China was recently obliged to deny rumours that the embalmed body
was rotting away in its glass sarcophagus.
Back at the Shanghai Cultural Revolution relics market it is doubtful that
concerns about the state of Mao's corpse, or the well-being of the Communist
party, were much in mind as traders haggled and bargained.
Old Mr Lin certainly exhibited no ideological qualms: 'This business I'm
doing now', he said, dragging more Mao kitschery from the recesses of his
satchels, 'is a celebration of his anniversary.'

SURGING retail sales and accelerating cost of living increases have
underscored the need for China to take urgent steps to cool an overheated
economy.
Economic data released yesterday, two days after China raised interest rates
in an effort to calm activity, show that in April urban inflation touched 17
per cent on an annualised basis and retail sales leapt by 25.4 per cent
compared with 1992.
The April cost of living figures, which confirm that inflation has entered a
strong upward spiral, are certain to strengthen the hands of those in the
Chinese leadership arguing for tougher measures to bring the economy under
control.
This week's ominous news for China's leaders also coincides with the release
at the weekend of trade figures for the four months to April which show
imports up 24.7 per cent, while exports rose just 7.7 per cent.
China's trade deficit swelled in the first four months to Dollars 1.77bn,
reversing an almost unbroken sequence of monthly surpluses since 1990 in the
wake of the 1988 tough import curbs.
The 17 per cent inflation figure recorded in China's 35 larger cities to
April compares with 15.7 per cent in the first quarter. Western economists
in Beijing say that the leadership cannot afford to ignore dangers posed by
the strengthening inflationary trend.
Some officials are sceptical about measures adopted thus far, including the
less than 1 percentage point increase in bank lending rates announced on
Friday.

Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
In a ceremony laden with pomp from the colonial era which ends with the
territory's 1997 return to China, the Navy withdrew from the land base -
known as HMS Tamar - so it can become a high-rise office development.
Last month a Chinese spokesman attacked Britain for making what it said was

The ruling United National Party controls all seven councils but faced a

THE NEW head of the United Nations Environment Programme complained
yesterday that its budget had been cut despite pledges of more support at
last year's Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Ms Elizabeth Dowdeswell of Canada, in her first address since taking over at
Unep four months ago, told its annual governing council that lack of cash
undermined the credibility of the 20-year-old agency.
'The question being asked by many is this: What happened to the agenda
agreed at Rio, which called for Unep's role to be enhanced, for its
resources to be expanded? And yet its budget has been shrunk,' she said.
'Governments are ready to put only a quarter of the Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds
840m) (they pledged) into the environment fund. Is it any wonder that our
critics view with scepticism the real commitment?' she said in Nairobi.
She gave no figures for a budget cut worked out by a council meeting last
week.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Bankruptcies in Japan rise by 3.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE corporate bankruptcies in April rose 3.9 per cent year-on-year, but
the amount of outstanding debt was 55.9 per cent lower than a year earlier
and property- related bankruptcies fell sharply.
Bankruptcies linked to the downturn in the Japanese economy, as distinct
from speculative failures, accounted for 61 per cent of the 1,154 cases last
month, according to Teikoku Data Bank, a private research agency.
Another sign of the continuing downturn was a 10.3 per cent fall last month
in Tokyo department store sales, with weakening demand for most lines and,
in particular, for luxury goods and more expensive household products.
The Japan Department Stores Association said the sales fall in April was the
14th consecutive month of year-on-year decline, and reflects the lack of
confidence of Japanese consumers, whose spending has fallen as overtime
hours have been reduced and job security threatened.
Bankruptcies of retailers were also 23.7 per cent higher than in the same
month last year, and a fall in sales was identified as the cause of 47.7 per
cent of last month's failures, which left liabilities of Y337.67bn (Pounds
1.99bn) down 55.9 per cent.
Property company bankruptcies, at 56 cases, were at their lowest level since
January 1991 and, by value at Y54.7bn, the lowest since November 1990, when
the collapse in property prices began to take a toll on the country's more
aggressive developers.
Teikoku Data Bank suggested that the recent appreciation of the yen was
likely to lead to increasing bankruptcies in currency-sensitive industries,
such as suppliers of parts to exporters, while there was no sign that the
slump in consumer confidence is nearing an end.
In Japan's latest influence-peddling scandal, the Tokyo District Court
sentenced a businessman yesterday to five years and six months in prison for
giving Y90m in bribes to a former cabinet minister, AP adds.
Mr Goro Moriguchi, a former vice-president of Kyowa, a steel-frame maker,
admitted that he gave the cash bribes to Mr Fumio Abe, a former senior
political ally of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister.
Mr Masaru Suda, the presiding judge, told the court Mr Moriguchi handed over
the bribes in return for favours while Mr Abe headed the Hokkaido
Development Agency in 1990.
Mr Suda also accused Mr Moriguchi of swindling trading companies out of
Y6.9bn by tricking them into making advance payments for transactions
involving Kyowa.
The company is now bankrupt.

The German Finance Ministry has confirmed a newspaper report that the
government was forced to cover DM2.2bn (Pounds 890m) in defaulted payments
on export credits made to the former Soviet Union, Iraq and Brazil in 1992,
Reuter reports from Bonn.
A spokesman said the Commonwealth of Independent States defaulted on credits
totalling DM955m. He added that Brazil also defaulted on Hermes export
credits totalling DM747m and Iraq defaulted on DM312m. The figures were
contained in a Finance Ministry report to parliament's budget committee.
Because of the high rate of defaulted loans and uncertainty about future
solvency, Bonn has warned German companies against conducting business in
the former Soviet Union.

FT  18 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Britain suspends export credit cover for
Tehran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S Export Credits Guarantee Department has effectively suspended
medium- and long-term export credit cover for Iran because of concerns over
the country's shortage of foreign exchange.
The move is part of a stand by leading export credit agencies unwilling to
accept Bank Markazi as the Iranian government's choice as guarantor of
export deals. British exporters were notified of the decision in a letter on
April 19, the ECGD said yesterday.
Japan's trading houses are believed to have arrears of up to Dollars 700m,
according to the specialist publication International Trade Finance. About
Dollars 300m of this was covered by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
In 1992 Britain's exports to Iran grew by about 10 per cent to Pounds 568m,
giving a trade surplus of Pounds 404m. Iranian imports from Britain totalled
Pounds 127m in the first quarter of this year.
The country's total imports in the year ending in March 1993 were Dollars
20.8bn (Pounds 13.5bn), down from Dollars 25bn the previous year as balance
of paymentsproblems grew more acute.
The suspension of cover is expected to have marginal impact on British
exporters. The ECGD resumed cover in December 1991 after having kept it off
cover for 10 years. An unresolved dispute over repayment of debts dating
back to the Shah's regime has prevented export deals being given backing
since then.
Other governments have had similar disputes, but some resumed medium-term
credits.
German, Japanese and Italian banks are thought to have the greatest
exposure, although none is forthcoming on the extent of exposure.
Payment problems appear to have been of greatest concern in the a forfait
market, where German, Japanese and Italian banks are thought to be holding
several billion dollars worth of Iranian letters of credit.

PERUVIANS struggled to work yesterday as many public transport drivers

rebels to mark the 13th anniversary of the start of their war on the state,
AP reports from Lima.
The rebels stepped up their campaign of violence in advance of the strike.
On Sunday the rebels bombed a bank and a bridge on the third day of an
offensive that has killed seven people and wounded eight.
President Alberto Fujimori urged Peruvians to ignore the strike and promised
the armed forces would tighten security in the capital.
The offensive was apparently aimed at intimidating Peruvians into staying at
home during the armed strike, ending tomorrow. During armed strikes, the
rebels ban transport and commercial activity and kill those who disobey.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Salinas moves to make bank independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico has sent Congress a constitutional
amendment to make the central bank independent and give it a mandate to
preserve price stability.
The move to make the central bank independent follows similar steps by Chile
in 1989 and more recently by Venezuela, and to a lesser extent by Colombia
and Argentina.
The amendment, sure to be passed by Congress, is intended to
institutionalise a commitment to low inflation after Mr Salinas's term of
office ends next year. While inflation is now down to 10.4 per cent, it
peaked in the mid-1980s at an annual 157 per cent.
'This is a way of anchoring the current monetary policies that have worked
so well in reducing inflation and ensuring the central bank is not subject
to changes in the political mood,' said a government official.
The head and other board members of the central bank would be chosen for a
fixed term by the president and approved by the Senate. They could be
removed only for a serious breach of duty, and would be selected on a
staggered basis, ensuring one president could not pack the bank with his
nominees.
The bank will be mandated to 'preserve the purchasing power of the national
currency' and given full control over management of its credit.
In a country where the president is used to exercising untrammelled power,
it is unclear how much effective independence the central bank will be
allowed to enjoy, if conflict arises with the government. While the central
bank alone will decide the discount rate at which it lends money to the
financial sector, other interest rates and exchange rate policy will be
decided between the federal government and the central bank, says Mr
Guillermo Ortiz, under-minister of finance.
The president's office said central bank independence would act as a
counterweight to government agencies intent on pursuing policies that cause
inflation. It would also persuade the private sector that increases in costs
or prices will not be accommodated by a loose monetary policy.
The amendment parallels other initiatives by Mr Salinas to lock in economic
reforms beyond the life of his administration. It may strengthen the
argument that current market-oriented policies are 'irreversible' and lessen
uncertainty stemming from the North American Free Trade Agreement with the
US and Canada, and from the Mexican presidential succession next year.

A 25-YEAR contract for Norway to supply Germany with hydro-electric power
has been signed by Statkraft, the Norwegian electricity utility, and
PreussenElektra, one of the big three German power companies, writes Quentin
Peel in Bonn. The deal, for an initial 2bn kW/hrs to be supplied to the
German grid, will have to be approved by both the Norwegian government and
German parliament.
It is the first long-term foreign electricity supply contract to be signed
by PreussenElektra, and suggests a departure by the company in turning to
foreign sources for competitive power supplies.
It also marks a further move away from dependence on nuclear and coal-fired
power stations, which provide 95 per cent of the company's electricity
supplies.
The deal - welcomed by the Green party as 'a step towards abandoning nuclear
energy,' although the company denied this was intended - also provides for a
cable linking Norway and Germany, either direct or via Denmark.
However, the power should initially be carried along existing power links
via Denmark, and possibly Sweden. PreussenElektra is involved in laying a
cable link to Sweden for a future exchange of power.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Perez waits for court to settle his future: Impeachment
looms for Venezuela's leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez, who survived two attempted coups
last year, could be forced out of office by legal proceedings before his
five-year term expires in February 1994.
The Venezuelan supreme court is expected to decide this week whether there
is sufficient cause to impeach the president for alleged mishandling of
Dollars 17m (Pounds 11m) in government funds appropriated for security and
defence purposes in 1989.
The charges - the first to be lodged against a sitting president in
Venezuela's 35 years of democracy - were filed with the court in March this
year by Mr Ramon Escovar Salom, the attorney-general.
The case, and the president's erratic reactions to the threat of
impeachment, have caused a political crisis, confusing domestic and
international capital markets and sparking fears of a new coup.
Venezuelan authorities have increased police and national guard patrols
throughout the capital in anticipation of anti-government protests this
week. Officials are particularly concerned that if the supreme court should
decide in favour of the beleaguered president, the ruling could unleash
violent demonstrations.
If the court decides that there is sufficient cause to proceed against Mr
Perez, the Venezuelan constitution says the Senate must then decide, by a
majority vote, whether to confirm the decision.
If the senate does decide that the president should be tried - and Mr Perez
lacks a majority in the upper house - he will be suspended from office and
then tried by the supreme court.
During the suspension, the chairman of the senate, Mr Octavio Lepage of the
ruling Democratic Action (AD) party, is supposed to take over as acting
president.
However, there is confusion over the legal situation. While the constitution
stipulates a succession procedure, it does not clearly cover all
eventualities.
Mr Perez, for example, earlier this month said he would resign if the
supreme court voted to impeach him or if it delayed a decision.
Now, however, he says he will appoint an acting president from his cabinet
and devote up to 90 days to his legal defence; he denies all wrongdoing. The
president originally told friends and associates on May 5 that he would
resign, after the Venezuelan media revealed that the chief justice of the
supreme court had issued a supposedly secret opinion favouring impeachment.
The president's apparent decision to hold on to office has occasioned
intense legal and political debates over whether he legally can, or morally
should, appoint a substitute in an attempt to avoid suspension by the
senate.
Such a move could lead to a direct confrontation between the executive and
legislative branches at a time when the country's political stability is
very much in doubt.
Currently, a majority in congress favours the president's resignation, or at
least his acceptance of a suspension from duties during the course of a
possible trial. Lawyers say that if the president is found guilty by the
supreme court, he would be removed from office and could go to jail. If he
is found innocent, he would be reinstated for the remainder of his term.
Over the last few days, pressure has become more intense on Mr Perez to
quit. The chairman of his own political party called for his resignation and
warned that a refusal to step down could cause violence, or leave Venzuela
with two presidents - one appointed by Mr Perez and the other by congress.
Other important political figures, including Mr Lepage (who stands to take
over as acting president), and three presidential candidates from the
opposition, also said Mr Perez should leave office.
Supporters of the president say the charges do not prove any criminal
activity and only indicate a series of administrative irregularities in
handling money from a 'secret account' in the Interior Ministry.
They say that the attacks on Mr Perez have turned into a political
witch-hunt and that the president may be forced to resign because of
ill-founded allegations.
Ironically, Mr Perez has added to his own difficulties with the supreme
court. In the past, members of the court were closely linked to the ruling
party and could be expected to rule favourably on any case where the
government was involved.
However, last year Mr Perez tried to depoliticise the supreme court, which
now has five new members who are politically independent.

THE EC has fixed definitive anti-dumping duties of up to 21.7 per cent on
seamless iron and steel tubes imported from Hungary, Poland and Croatia,
writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
But officials said yesterday the duties were 'theoretical' as almost all
steel producers in the countries had given price undertakings, exempting
them from duties.
The Commission fixed provisional duties in November after EC producers
complained the industry was being undermined by cheap imports. The duties
have now been fixed, with immediate effect, at 21.7 per cent for imports
from Hungary, 17.4 per cent from Croatia and 10.8 per cent from Poland.
The EC has also decided to set tariff-quotas on a wider range of Czech and
Slovak steel products as part of measures aimed at protecting EC industry
from the cheap imports.

FT  18 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC to push Japan over tariff cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE would seek further tariff cuts, especially in processed food, from
Japan which in talks in Toronto last week offered a 55 per cent reduction in
about 770 industrial products, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said
yesterday.
In an attempt to allay persistent suspicions in Brussels that the Commission
is signing deals behind the back of France and other EC governments, Sir
Leon said the aim of last Friday's meeting in Toronto with US, Japanese and
Canadian negotiators had been 'to try to commit Japan, to a certain extent,
to a market access agreement' before the Group of Seven's July summit in
Tokyo.
Japan's tariff offer on industrial products is 'a step in the right
direction', he said, but it did not go far enough, particularly for
processed foods.
Speaking before meetings with French ministers yesterday, Sir Leon praised
last week's French government memorandum on Gatt as setting out 'clearly and
in detail' its position, though he was sceptical about the call for new
forms of protection against unfair trade. 'I think we have enough
instruments; the question is whether the Community wants to use them.'
The French memorandum urges the EC to revive its so-called new community
instrument. This 1984 provision allows the Community to retaliate
unilaterally against unfair trade practices, but has rarely been used for
lack of a consensus within the EC council of ministers.
Sir Leon said he was counting on a definitive settlement of the US-EC
oilseeds dispute next month. Future farm disputes with the US could be
avoided, he told the Institute of Political Science in Paris on Sunday
night, if the EC reached an overall agricultural agreement with the US and
other Gatt partners. Such an agreement would also 'give for the first time
explicit recognition' to the EC's form of farmer support, while restricting
US as well as EC export subsidies in cereals.

<TEXT>
THE opposition in Belize has accused the government of having no alternative
plans for the country's defence after British troops leave. Local economists
are also expressing concern about the impact of the pull-out, announced by
the British government last week.
The garrison of 1,400 troops was stationed in the central American country
to deter neighbouring Guatemala, which threatened many times to invade the
former British colony in pursuit of a 130-year-old territorial claim. The
overall responsibility for defence will pass to the 600-strong Belize
Defence Force.
Britain said it was closing the garrison, but would leave 150 soldiers in
Belize and use the facilities for training. The move follows agreements
between Belize and Guatemala in the past two years which have cleared the
way for a diplomatic end to the dispute.
The contingent is a significant contributor to the Belize economy.
Maintaining the garrison in Belize costs the British government about
Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) a year. Economists say the country earns Dollars
35m a year (about a fifth of the country's gross domestic product) from the
presence of the garrison.
The government denied it was unprepared for the British decision.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian government yesterday moved to repeal export quotas and slash
export taxes in an attempt to boost falling trade revenues.
Foreign businessmen have been scathing about the system of export quotas and
taxes introduced in Ukraine at the start of the year. Many western
economists blame the arbitrarily administered and restrictive system for
this year's sharp drop in the country's exports outside the former Soviet
Union.
Government officials said the cabinet of ministers approved a decree
yesterday which promised to cut by 80 per cent taxes on the export of a
number of ferrous metals, cast iron, cement, chemicals and other
commodities. The decree also calls for the removal of export quotas on
several categories of goods.
If the decree is implemented it will bring the rules governing Ukrainian
exports outside the former Soviet Union closer into line with the more
liberal regulations on exports to other member countries of the Commonwealth
of Independent States.
Mr Serhii Teriokhin, deputy minister of the economy, said the attempt to
liberalise trade with countries beyond the former Soviet Union was aimed at
compensating for the republic's deteriorating economic relationship with
Russia.
Over the past year Russia has incrementally raised prices for the oil and
gas which it supplies to Ukraine. Experts estimate that Ukraine, which
traditionally received Russian fuel at a fraction of the world price, now
pays 70 per cent of world rates for the oil.
The government decree is likely to meet guarded approval by businesses,
still smarting from export restrictions imposed at the beginning of the
year.

FT  18 MAY 93 / World Trade News: A consuming interest in trade - Veteran
activist Nader turns on 'free trade'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ORDINARY consumer activist might be expected to applaud agreements which
are designed to usher in freer trade - and, in theory, lower prices. But
there is nothing ordinary about Ralph Nader, and never has been.
The ageing white knight of US consumer activism is as angry as when he first
burst on the national scene in 1968 to fight for car safety. He has long
identified the 'imperialists' of multinational corporations as the enemy.
And it is their influence with the US trade negotiating team that makes the
Uruguay Round and the North American Free Trade Agreement suspect to him.
Mr Nader has for three decades has been battling everything from diseased
fish to higher car prices or dental X-rays and defective tyres.
Since his heyday, he has suffered some loss of stature - critics portray him
as a vengeful, thoroughly paranoid zealot - but he still ranks on the lists
of Most Admired Americans, and there are still fans who, every four years,
urge him to run for president.
Mr Nader has trained his attention to an ever-expanding list of government
and corporate evils. And so it is that he is sharpening his lance and
forming alliances for a crusade against the talks under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Nafta.
What drew Mr Nader's attention to the Uruguay Round was the decision, pushed
by the US, to devise global rules to stem the use of health and safety
standards as trade barriers.
'Trade agreements are becoming more and more blatantly over-reaching,' Mr
Nader said, in a recent interview. 'They are going way beyond tariffs and
traditional commercial issues into overriding what they call 'technical
barriers to trade'.'
The great fear of Mr Nader and his allies in the environmental movement is
that a Gatt or Nafta dispute settlement commission would find US standards
actionable because they are more stringent than those of the rest of the
world. Citizen groups have no influence with these international panels;
they cannot bring cases, nor are they party to the closed-door discussions
that lead to decisions.
Mr Nader is convinced that the multinationals will use these panels to
weaken worker safety and food and health regulations.
The current Gatt should be abandoned, Mr Nader said. The US should
restructure its relations to give the greatest trade advantages to
democracies which uphold worker and human rights. Democracies should only
give up some of their sovereignty if it is to a democratic trading
organisation which allows petitioning by citizens and local governments as
well as national governments.
Mr Nader slammed a foot-high stack of documents on his desk. 'This is the
Nafta,' he said. 'Fewer people have read this than have read and understood
Einstein's theory of relativity. I'll guarantee you that 99 per cent of the
so-called liberal free traders have never read this or have never read
detailed summaries of this and are simply thinking this is nothing more than
a late 20th century version of Portuguese wine trading for British
textiles.'
It is not possible to have a trade alliance with Mexico, which has
'fundamental police state characteristics', he said. Besides its cheap
labour, it has as a 'comparative advantage' its failure to enforce its child
labour law. No trade agreement with the US can compel the Mexicans to
enforce their worker, health or safety laws.
'Mexico is the land of the ultimate no-law law. Non-enforcement of laws is a
way of life.'
Although he generally favours lowering or eliminating tariffs, the effort
should not begin until there are 'alternative employment opportunities', he
said. In Mexico, for example, the planned phase-out of tariffs on maize over
the next 15 years could dispossess 7m-8m peasant farmers.
'In the crime-ridden slums of Mexico City they can't even breathe fresh air
or drink water. In the maquiladoras (border factories), they live in shacks.
There is no community, no schools, no social life.' Prostitution and drugs,
he said, accounted for a high labour turnover although wages there are
nearly the highest in the country.
The Nafta is expected to go to Congress this summer. It is already
unpopular, and if Mr Nader has his way, he and his allies in the environment
and labour movements will make it more so.

FT  18 MAY 93 / US court delays Barclays tax ruling: Justice Department
asked for opinion on bank's challenge to Californian unitary tax system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court has asked the Justice Department for its opinion on
Barclays Bank's suit against California's worldwide unitary tax system,
forcing the Clinton administration to take sides on the issue. However, the
court's decision also delays indefinitely any final decision on the 10-year
legal wrangle.
Barclays has asked the Supreme Court to outlaw the unitary tax system, under
which companies may be taxed not just on the profits they make in California
but on a proportion of their worldwide profits calculated in line with the
size of their payroll, property and sales in the state.
Previous US administrations have sided with Barclays in the case, arguing
that the unitary tax method could unravel the system of bilateral treaties
under which international taxation is regulated.
But President Bill Clinton promised influential California backers last June
that 'a Clinton administration will be pro-California in this matter'.
Although his administration has not gone so far as to file a brief with the
Supreme Court on California's behalf, it reversed previous administration
policy by not filing for Barclays. While the Justice Department could file a
neutral brief, the Supreme Court's request for an opinion will make it more
difficult for the administration to sit on the fence between its California
supporters, who have been at pains to remind the president of his pledge,
and angry foreign governments, who have been vociferous on Barclays' behalf.
Mr Jerome Libin, of the Washington tax law firm of Sutherland, Asbill &amp;
Brennan, said that if the Solicitor General filed his views over the summer
the court should announce whether it would hear the Barclays case on the
first Monday in October.
However, there is no time limit on the Solicitor General, and Mr Drew Days,
Mr Clinton's nominee for the office, has not yet been confirmed by the
Senate.
'As a practical matter, and assuming that the Supreme Court were to agree to
hear the case, a decision would be close to a year away,' said Mr Jim
O'Hara, worldwide head of tax with the Cleveland-based law firm of Jones Day
Reavis &amp; Pogue.
The UK government, however, has threatened retaliation that could cost
California-based companies with British subsidiaries an estimated Dollars
50m (Pounds 32.4m) a year if the matter is not resolved by the end of
December. Inland Revenue officials are travelling to Washington this week
for talks with the US Treasury.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Spanish Elections: Spain's right quits Franco's shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Spain's ruling Socialists, from prime minister Felipe Gonzalez down,
are out on the election campaign trail, they never mention General Francisco
Franco by name. But they assume everyone knows who they are talking about
when they refer to their conservative opponents in the Partido Popular (PP)
as la Derecha - the Right.
'The Right have never trusted Spain,' Mr Gonzalez shouted to an appreciative
audience recently. 'They ruled for a century and now they can wait awhile.'
Reference to la Derecha is supposed to send shivers down the spines. The
clear threat is that if la Derecha won the general election on June 6, there
would be a taking of account, as there was after the Spanish civil war.
People who have run with the Left would be marked and suffer discrimination.
Who, after all, could forget the nearly 40 dark years of dictatorship under
Franco?
So far, the scare tactic has worked. In three successive elections since
1982 Spaniards have returned the Socialists with overall majorities.
This time it may not work. The Partido Popular is neck and neck with the
Socialists in the polls and is doing well among young voters and students
who, the Socialists have begun to realise only recently, have no memory of
Franco and see nothing shameful in supporting a conservative party.
The devaluation last Thursday of the peseta and a big rise in unemployment
may also strengthen the view that a business-oriented party might be able to
run the country better than the Socialists.
Mr Rodrigo Rato, a leading PP MP and a possible finance minister should the
party win on June 6, says: 'We ignore it now. We are another generation and
the public just don't buy it. If the Socialists go on playing this game they
are making a big mistake. We have become a mix of liberal and Christian
Democrat.'
The PP is a curious animal. It is a recent mutation of the former Alianza
Popular, founded by one of General Franco's most famous ministers, Manuel
Fraga. He created the AP in 1977 after refusing to serve under prime
minister Adolfo Suarez, whom he considered too progressive.
When Mr Suarez's centrist UCD government collapsed in 1982 and the
Socialists won their first election, the AP became the standard bearer to
the right of the government.
While Mr Fraga was a visible presence in the AP, he was a convenient demon
for the Socialists. It was widely assumed that, in a country with a natural
majority to the left of centre, the conservatives could never progress far.
But in 1989 the old man shuffled off to be elected president of his native
Galicia and the AP began vigorously to shed itself of its Francoist
heritage.
It is a job not yet quite done but it would be foolish to question the PP's
attachment to democracy. 'When Franco died (in 1975) the leadership of this
party was 18 or 20 years old, for goodness' sake,' says Francisco Alvarez
Cascos, 45, the PP secretary general. 'It is ridiculous to burden us with a
memory that has nothing to do with us.'
The patient re-positioning of the PP, bringing it closer to the vital centre
of Spanish politics, is paying off. Largely because of the Socialists'
inability to fight off recession and their unconvincing denials of corrupt
party financing, young conservatives such as Mr Rato, Mr Cascos and the PP
leader, Jose Maria Aznar - who were brought into politics by Mr Fraga but
have made themselves independent of him - suddenly find themselves
tantalisingly close to power.
'Nowadays,' says Mr Cascos, 'the only leader young people are able to use as
a reference when they think about their problems is Felipe Gonzalez. He has
no credibility when he invokes the memory of Franco in front of these
people.'
The prospect of power seems to have softened them. 'The Socialists are not
the devil and we are not going to throw everything out of the window when we
take power,' says Mr Rato.
Not everyone believes that, but the PP and the Socialists agree more on
policy than either would like to admit. Both claim they will freeze taxes
after the election and then try to cut them. Both want a 'social pact' with
the unions and employers to help wrestle the country out of recession. Both
want to keep the peseta in the exchange rate mechanism of the the European
Monetary System. Both would actively use public spending to create jobs.
There are differences of style - the PP would privatise quicker and try to
cut taxes deeper than the Socialists, but where the PP scores now is that it
is a more united party than the Socialists. 'I'm saying what all of my party
is saying,' says Mr Rato, 'but Mr (finance minister Carlos) Solchaga cannot
get his policies past his party.'
That division lies behind the Socialists' likely electoral disaster. While
the government has been chasing its vision of a modern, vibrant state
rubbing shoulders with the rich and powerful, the party has had to struggle
to hold its core vote in the forgotten and poverty-stricken countryside. The
government and the party have different agenda and it has begun to show.
The conservatives have no such problem. They have an enthusiastic
constituency and are rapidly building support among women and students.
Nevertheless, the PP knows it cannot win an overall majority and it is by no
means certain that it will even win as many seats as the Socialists.
But the election will almost certainly result in a hung parliament and, in
order to govern, the PP would have to do deals with the leading parties from
the two regions of Spain most brutalised by Franco - the Basque Country and
Catalonia. 'Perhaps,' ventures Mr Rato, 'we might even do deals with the
Socialists.'
Any of those combinations would put Socialist demonology to the test and if
even one of them worked, Spain might at last be able to get on with being a
democracy without constantly being reminded about when it was not.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOSE MARIA AZNAR, the 40-year-old leader of the Partido Popular, is intense
and serious. At election meetings he speaks in grave, clipped sentences
while his right arm pumps up and down. His neat black hair and moustache can
make this image a little uncomfortable at times. But there is little doubt
that Spain's conservatives, liberals and Christian Democrats owe him a huge
debt for making them real contenders to govern again after nearly two
decades in the political wilderness.
He was made PP leader in 1989 and he has since succeeded in dragging the
party from the right towards the centre, attracting young voters in the
process. Mr Aznar would try to form a government of professional politicians
and businessmen if the party let him.

FT  18 MAY 93 / OECD sees two more years of Icelandic gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE outlook for Iceland's economy in 1993 and 1994 is 'distinctly
unfavourable', the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) said yesterday .
It forecasts a 1.8 per cent fall in the country's output this year, mainly
because of problems in the fishing industry, which accounts for 75 per cent
of exports. Weaker prices and sharply reduced cod supplies 'have produced a
financial and social crisis in the fisheries sector', it noted.
The report said Iceland was also being hit by poor demand for its two other
big export products, aluminium and ferrosilicon. A third factor was the
impact of rising unemployment and a tight government macroeconomic strategy
on domestic demand.
The report makes gloomy reading coming after last year's 3.25 per cent fall
in GDP and 5 per cent drop in domestic demand. The OECD expects
unemployment, which last year reached nearly 5 per cent, to rise to 5.3 per
cent this year and 6.1 per cent in 1994.
But it believes the country's prospects will begin to brighten next year
thanks to the impact of lower taxes, the depreciation of the Icelandic
krona, wage moderation, and the benefits of membership in the European
Economic Area.
'1994 will probably be a transition year, possibly benefiting from a
recovery in export markets and early gains from European integration,' it
said, predicting GDP growth of 1 per cent. The organisation says Iceland
should benefit further if it goes ahead with the planned construction of an
aluminium smelter. Estimates show the project will add 1.75 percentage
points to GDP growth over the first three years of construction.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S beleaguered and unpopular conservative government has defied
conventional political logic by unveiling an austerity budget plan just a
year before elections.
Mr Ivan Szabo, the finance minister, yesterday steeled the public and his
own fractious MPs for painful tax increases and spending cuts to restrain a
surging budget deficit.
'We have reached a point where we face a huge rock and we have to decide
whether we climb it or not,' the minister said.
Mr Szabo's parliamentary preview of a supplementary budget prepared the way
for deep cuts in real public sector pay and an increase in value-added tax.
The finance minister said tough measures were necessary to bring the public
sector deficit, which climbed to 7.3 per cent in 1992, down to 6.8 per cent
of GDP this year and 5.6 per cent in 1994.
Only by reducing the shortfall can Hungary realise a draft 18-month credit
agreement with the International Monetary Fund which would return the
country to financial respectability.
In proposals submitted to the IMF, the government has outlined an increase
in the lower rate of VAT from 6 to 10 per cent and the abolition of
zero-rating, to raise an extra Ft40bn (Pounds 296m), or 1 per cent of GDP,
for next year's budget.
The increase will hit Hungary's poor the hardest and is bound to enrage a
public whose anger at this January's VAT increase - which led dozens of
people to mount hunger strikes - is only now dying down.
The government also envisages a narrowing of tax exemptions, a clawback of
income-tax exemptions on higher earners, and the imposition of additional
fees for a wide range of public services.
To restrain expenditure the authorities have put forward deep real cuts in
public sector pay, subsidies and transfers to local authorities.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Olivetti says threats forced it to pay bribes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS in the Italian Posts Ministry allegedly threatened to stop buying
from Olivetti, the computer and office equipment manufacturer, unless the
group paid bribes.
According to evidence provided to Milan magistrates by Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, the group's chairman, this was just one of several instances of
extortion against Olivetti during the 1980s by civil servants and their
political masters.
The allegation is contained in an 11-page statement to the magistrates by Mr
De Benedetti, clarifying the group's role in illicit financing to the tune
of nearly L20bn (Pounds 8.5m) of the main political parties - but
principally the Christian Democrats and Socialists.
Having agreed in 1988 to a 2 per cent 'commission' on purchases by the
ministry, payable to the political parties, Olivetti's revenue jumped from
L2.1bn in 1987 to L204.3bn that year.
Mr De Benedetti told the magistrates he divided dealing with the political
parties into two periods: from 1978-82 (when he was chief executive) and
1983 onwards (when he was also chairman).
During the first, Olivetti experienced limited, though occasionally 'strong
pressures'. The threats could be summed up as: 'If you don't pay you don't
work with us', and they came from representatives of the Christian Democrat
and Socialist parties. 'We replied rejecting specific requests. . . .
limiting ourselves to generic donations to the party treasurers.'
At one stage during this period Olivetti was 'on the black books of the
state railways' and excluded even from bids. This made it difficult for the
company, which had two thirds of its sales outside Italy, to seek contracts
with the Swiss railways or the Dutch postal service who were puzzled that it
had no such local contracts.
This bribe threat was only dropped, Mr De Benedetti said, after he
intervened several times with Posts Ministry, pointing out that Olivetti
risked losing jobs if it lost the contract to foreign competition when in
France and Germany such sectors were still closed to foreign competition.
'During the second period, the pressure from the parties and their
representatives in the state entities reached an impressive crescendo . . .
of menaces and extortion to become in the last few years nothing short of
racketeering. . . The demands from the representatives of the parties were
systematic and unavoidable on everything they controlled without exception.'
Olivetti was thus obliged to adopt a case-by-case approach, in particular
with the Posts Ministry, handled through the group's Rome representative.
'Thus we arrived at an agreement whereby Olivetti had to pay like the other
suppliers to the ministry.'
'The result . . . was dramatic moving from L2.196bn in 1987 to L204.305bn in
1988. At the same time the payments began totalling L10.025bn between 1988
and 91.
'Towards the end of 1991 I decided to object to this system and stopped
every type of payment. And since then we have scarcely received a new order,
while there began to appear a series of strange news items in the papers
about supposed malfunctioning of Olivetti equipment as well, in synthesis, a
repetition of the attitude 'if you don't pay no work'.'
Mr De Benedetti said the Christian Democrat treasurer was timid compared to
the late Mr Vincenzo Balzamo, his Socialist counterpart (who died of a heart
attack last autumn while under investigation).
'The Socialists were much more aggressive in that Balzamo told Cherubini
(Olivetti's Rome representative) that it was only possible to overcome the
great aversion of the Socialist party and its secretary (Mr Bettino Craxi)
towards me by handing over money.'

FT  18 MAY 93 / US and Russia in Bosnian initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Russia are taking new initiatives to try to breathe life into the
peace process in Bosnia, spurred on by the Bosnian Serbs' expected rejection
of the international peace plan in their referendum last weekend.
Croats and Moslems, meanwhile, fought savage street battles yesterday in the
Bosnian town of Mostar, which was rocked by a big explosion, possibly an
ammunition dump.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the way had been cleared
for a new round of discussions between the US and its allies, 'some of whom
have been wanting to hold up until after the referendum'. Consultations with
US allies would be held by phone over the next few days.
But he said he had no plans to go to New York on Friday for a UN Security
Council foreign ministers' meeting, being sought by Russia. The meeting, if
held, would discuss UN peacekeeping projects, but the US fears it would
underline the world's failure to agree on what to do next about Bosnia.
Though the Bosnian Serb referendum results are not expected until tomorrow,
Mr Christopher appeared to assume overwhelming rejection of the Vance-Owen
peace plan.
The US consultations about Bosnia coincide with a peace mission by Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister. He went to Berlin yesterday for talks
with Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart, and is due to meet Croatian,
Bosnian and Serbian leaders in Split and Belgrade, starting today.
Mr Kozyrev said last night: 'We won't let a few militants and warlords stop
the international community from extinguishing the war in Bosnia.'
The international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, will
also fly to the former Yugoslavia today for talks with the Croatian and
Bosnian presidents.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the peace talks, was much more
optimistic than his western counterparts about the Bosnian situation, when
announcing Mr Kozyrev's mission in Moscow yesterday.
'It is our view that there are not so many hardliners among the Bosnian
Serbs and they will be further isolated,' he told journalists. Serbia's
'very clear stand' for a peaceful settlement, and its blockade of supplies
to the Bosnian Serbs, except food and medicine, would change their minds
about the peace plan.
Mr Churkin reiterated Moscow's proposal that the Vance-Owen plan should be
implemented by the international community by stages.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday apologised for his
army chief, General Ratko Mladic, who threatened bomb attacks in western
cities, particularly London, if the west intervened in Bosnia. 'That was an
irresponsible and emotional reaction,' Mr Karadzic said.
Britain dismissed Gen Mladic's remarks as 'bombast and bluster'.
Croatian radio claimed that the big explosion in Mostar yesterday was caused
by a Moslem ammunition dump, which went up 'with tragic consequences'.
Moslem-controlled radio reported the historic centre was in flames after the
explosion. It accused Croat artillery of levelling the city centre. 'Several
ancient objects have been utterly destroyed. The medieval bridge, listed as
a world heritage by Unesco, was severely damaged.'

FT  18 MAY 93 / EC prescribes Russian bank fraud cure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CENTRAL bank of Russia must simplify its bureaucracy in order to combat
banking fraud and supervise more effectively the country's commercial banks,
according to a report financed by the European Commission.
The study on 'restructuring needs of the banking system in Russia' to be
published later this month, covers everything from banking legislation to
the ailing payments system.
Drawn up by French bank Union Europeenne de CIC and auditors Arthur
Andersen, it says 'current legislation and regulations do not provide any
rules . . . to prevent or suppress the potential malfunction of the Russian
banking system'. It says there are too many small under-capitalised banks
which 'exist only to borrow funds on the interbank market or from private
depositors' to finance unprofitable enterprises which are the banks'
shareholders.
It notes the lack of rules limiting bank ownership by industrial or
commercial enterprises. A rule forbidding single shareholders owning more
than 35 per cent of a bank, does not specify whether this includes indirect
stakes.
At present most commercial banks admit there is virtually no supervision
from the central bank. The report suggests that, in the short term, the
central bank should reduce the substantial amount of data it collects from
commercial banks to focus on a few key indicators.
It suggests a rating system to reward banks which comply with central bank
requirements, and calls for central bank guidelines on suspect transactions
and money laundering.
Bankruptcy procedures should be better defined, as should a deposit
protection scheme provided for by Russian law but which is so vaguely
defined that insurance funds remain open to misuse.
Apart from supervision, the central bank's other persistent headache is
overhauling a payments system which can take weeks to transfer money, loses
documents and is vulnerable to fraud.
While five western central banks have begun concerted efforts to help the
Russian central bank with this task, the report recommends standardising
payment documents and using serial numbers to boost the system's 'low'
security level.
A few small reforms are already being implemented with foreign assistance.
The central bank which today launches Russia's first treasury bill issue,
also plans to begin auctioning off central bank credits, according to Mr
Alexander Khandruyev, a deputy governor of the bank.
The credit auctions, prepared with the help of the International Monetary
Fund, are designed to ensure more effective distribution of central bank
resources.
However, critics say the fact that the central bank will decide which banks
can take part allows for possible corruption. It is also not clear how an
auction based on the highest bidder will ensure that the money goes to
worthy causes.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Moscow pledge on reforms to win IMF loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government and central bank will make a joint statement on
Thursday pledging to push forward economic reforms in order to qualify for a
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund, the
country's finance minister said yesterday, writes Leyla Boulton.
Mr Boris Fyodorov said the declaration would be followed by an application
by the IMF to its board of directors for the release of Dollars 3bn under a
new systemic transformation facility designed to help countries switch to a
market economy.
But rather than being an official IMF procedure, the statement appears to be
an attempt by Mr Fyodorov to make reform promises as binding as possible on
the rest of the government.
He hoped the government, which includes a number of conservatives who are
senior to him, would for instance pledge to abstain from new spending
decisions for the rest of the year.
Mr Fyodorov and the IMF fear a repetition of last year's scenario in which
Russian authorities, including the present central bank governor, signed a
statement of intent in order to receive a first Dollars 1bn loan from the
IMF but never fulfilled its contents.
Asked why the IMF should release the money this time, Mr Fyodorov, who only
two weeks ago complained the Russian president was not pressing ahead with
radical reform, said at least Russia was not moving backwards.
'Maybe there is no rapid movement, but there is a movement forward which
deserves trust,' he said. For example, he said, he was successfully cutting
budget expenditure in spite of a deputy central bank governor's statement to
the contrary.

FT  18 MAY 93 / IG Metall predicts acceptance of steel deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STEEL, metal and engineering workers throughout east Germany will soon
accept the Saxony compromise agreed last Friday between IG Metall, Germany's
powerful engineering union, and the employers, union officials predict.
Mr Jorg Barczynski, IG Metall's federal spokesman, was confident yesterday
of acceptance despite the initial rejection of the deal in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Berlin-Brandenburg.
However, strikes in the steel industry could continue 'for a bit longer'
because it would not receive the same pay increases as the metal and
electrical workers.
Last week's agreement between Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical
employers' association, and IG Metall delays the equalisation of east and
west German wages by two years to mid-1996. Pay increases, designed to bring
eastern wages up to 80 per cent of western German levels last April, will be
postponed until next December.
Mr Barczynski said these pay rises, although short of the 26 per cent for
the metal and electrical sector agreed in the March 1991 contract between
the union and employers, still represented a victory.
'In practice, the pay increase is about 21.7 per cent if we take into
account other gains, such as two days longer holidays and Christmas money.'
Yesterday, union officials in Berlin-Brandenburg said they wanted equal
wages among the steel and metal industries.
Talks are due to resume today with the metal and electrical employers, but
the union said strikes in the steel sector would continue until the steel
employers drew up a separate agreement.
Mr Michael Bohm, IG Metall's spokesman in Berlin-Brandenburg, said: 'The
Saxony agreement makes the road to income parity too long, and the wage
increase this year too small.'
The union yesterday started holding ballots in Saxony to end the strike. If
25 per cent of its members vote Yes, the strikes could be called off in that
state tomorrow. Ballots are expected to take place today in Saxony-Anhalt
and Thuringia.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Legal challenges bog down EC treaty: No German court ruling
on Maastricht is likely before end of July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German constitutional court in Karlsruhe is considering 18 separate
challenges to the Maastricht treaty, and no decision is expected before the
end of July.
The challenges go to the heart of the issue of whether the German
government, and the parliament, can legally transfer to EC institutions the
sort of sovereign powers contained in the treaty.
In spite of an outward appearance of calm, there is clearly some nervousness
in Bonn that constitutional court judges could call the ratification of the
treaty into question, or at least delay final confirmation of the decision.
That could make Germany, in spite of its large parliamentary majority in
favour of the treaty, the last EC member state to deposit its ratification
decision in Rome - home of the Treaty of Rome.
Senior officials in the government are confident the court will not question
the ratification itself, but it may call for more restrictive accompanying
legislation, requiring even greater democratic control over EC
decision-making.
The complainants, however, led by Mr Manfred Brunner, former chef de cabinet
to Mr Martin Bangemann, the senior German EC commissioner, believe they have
an outside chance of upsetting the process, and even of forcing the
government to hold a referendum on the issue.
The challengers include four Green Party members of the European parliament,
who charge that the Maastricht treaty provides for inadequate democratic
control of EC decisions; an independent member of the Bundestag, the lower
house of parliament in Bonn, who claims his democratic rights as an MP have
been restricted; and the two main extreme right-wing parties, the Deutsche
Volksunion (DVU) and the Republicans, as well as a dozen more or less
distinguished individuals.
The core of their challenges concerns the fact that the treaty will affect
fundamental constitutional rights safeguarded in the country's Basic Law,
and which cannot be amended even with a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The articles in question are Article 1, on the protection of human dignity,
and Article 20, which sets out the basic principles of Germany as a
democratic and social federal state. The latter goes on to state that 'all
state authority emanates from the people. It shall be exercised by the
people by means of elections and voting, and by specific legislative,
executive and judicial organs.'
Mr Brunner and his fellow plaintiffs claim the transfer of sovereignty to
Brussels and EC institutions, in areas such as economic and monetary policy,
foreign policy and the like, offends against those articles. They also
maintain that the EC is not democratically controlled because the European
parliament lacks adequate powers, and therefore properly controlled German
powers will be exercised by inadequately controlled EC institutions.
In spite of urgent efforts by Bonn to speed the processes of the
constitutional court, the judges in the second chamber, who are hearing the
case, are overwhelmed by at least two other important issues: liberalising
the abortion law, and allowing German troops to serve outside the Nato area.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR minister Mr Michel Giraud yesterday warned that France's unemployment
rate of 10.7 per cent would rise much further by the end of the year, Reuter
reports from Paris.
He said estimates by Unedic, the French unemployment fund, that the number
of unemployed would rise by 340,000 this year were realistic. In the first
quarter of the year, the number of unemployed grew by 88,000 to 3,066,400,
or 10.7 per cent of the workforce.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who last week unveiled a
mini-budget aimed at reviving growth, has already said he does not expect
unemployment to peak before late 1993 or early 1994. The National Statistics
Institute, in a report confirming that France had sunk into recession,
forecast last week that the jobless rate would climb to 11.2 per cent as
early as June.
The economic downturn was yesterday underscored by reports from union
officials that Elf-Atochem, the chemical group, and Shell France, the oil
company, planned to cut a total of 1,350 jobs.
Faced with the deterioration in the job market, Mr Giraud said the
government must continue with measures to ease unemployment and companies
must limit lay-offs.
A five-year employment plan being drawn up in consultation with employers
and unions would aim to promote job creation by easing payroll taxes on
low-paid workers, rethink the way part-time work is organised and improve
vocational training.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Danish Referendum: Danish Yes is no panacea for EC's
fundamental ailments / Lowering expectations for today's vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is always an element of Russian roulette in a referendum, and the
Danes have always liked to live dangerously. But if the opinion polls are to
be believed, the Danes will today approve the Maastricht treaty which they
narrowly rejected almost a year ago.
A Danish Yes, however grudging, would allow the EC to resume its halting
progress toward political and monetary union. It would give a fillip to Mr
John Major, British prime minister, as he pushes the Maastricht bill through
final ratification in parliament. Barring an upset in the UK courts (and the
German constitutional court), Maastricht seems set for the greatest comeback
since Lazarus.
Yet a positive vote in Denmark will not have any impact on the fundamental
problems facing the EC: rising unemployment, low investment, a public
spending crisis in most member states, and continuing monetary instability.
Nor will it resolve the central Maastricht dilemma: how to bridge the gap
between what the Twelve were able to agree in December 1991 and what
European public opinion has since been willing to accept.
This holds true not only for 'semi-detached' EC member states such as
Denmark and Britain, but also for the traditionally integrationist countries
such as France and Germany, where today a majority of Germans would probably
vote against giving up the D-Mark in return for a single European currency.
Nor will Danish approval of Maastricht dispel the impression of
double-dealing which has permeated the treaty ratification process ever
since the Danes first threw it out. As one of the European Commission's
senior legal advisers inadvertently confirmed recently, the Danes are voting
on the same treaty, whatever the extravagant claims made about the legally
binding opt-outs obtained by the Danish government at last December's
Edinburgh summit.
Those opt-outs detail Danish exemptions from the third phase of monetary
union, when the Twelve are supposed to move to fixed exchange rates by 1999
at the latest; a common EC defence policy; common citizenship; and
co-operation on justice and immigration matters at a Community rather than
an inter-governmental level.
The Danes won these exemptions in the original treaty negotiations; but they
have since undertaken to bind themselves, not just now but in the future, to
withdraw from these parts of the European union foreseen under Maastricht.
The Danish deal which was deemed necessary to salvage the treaty looks very
much like turning the EC Community into a Community a la carte. Yet there is
a precedent: 18 months ago, the UK rejected the Maastricht social chapter
and reserved its right to take part in a single currency or European
monetary union. The question is whether countries wishing to join the EC
club will now demand similar preferential treatment, creating a new,
multi-speed Community.
The official line in Brussels is that Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden
cannot expect the Danish treatment; privately, senior EC officials say none
of these applicant countries has the muscle to secure such exemptions.
Indeed, some predict that at least one, possibly two applicant countries
will prove unable to persuade their public to support the Maastricht terms.
Norway, which rejected EC membership in 1972, is put in the riskiest
category; but officials say the slow pace of enlargement talks with Austria
reflects the weakness of the coalition government and concern about how EC
membership may affect next year's general election. One senior Commission
official offered the blunt assessment that a partial failure of the
enlargement talks could be useful in that it would deflate the aspirations
of eastern Europe's emerging democracies.
Such views underline how Maastricht has failed to resolve the tensions
between those in the Commission and the federalist-minded EC states such as
Belgium and the Netherlands who want to 'deepen' EC institutions at the
expense of national sovereignty, and countries like Britain and Denmark who
wish to 'widen' membership and focus more on its economic aspects, notably
its ability to expand eastwards as a free trade area.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC Commissioner for external economic relations, argues
that it is time the Community focused on pressing matters at hand, such as
concluding the Uruguay Round in the Gatt trade talks and meeting the
historic challenge of integrating eastern Europe into the west, both
politically and economically. On institutional change, he says: 'I don't
think it's the right time. This is not Maoist China, I don't believe in
perpetual revolution.'
A Danish No would challenge these assumptions, if only because it would
force member states to re-examine the limits of their co-operation, perhaps
encouraging some to venture beyond what was agreed at Maastricht.
The most obvious parallel is 1963, when President Charles de Gaulle vetoed
British membership (encouraging Denmark to stay out, too). Within weeks, de
Gaulle and Chancellor Adnenauer signed the Elysee treaty, the foundation of
Franco-German co-operation which has underpinned the EC in the 30 years
since, with the UK all too often left on the sidelines.

lags well behind on eve of today's referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR POUL NYRUP Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, issued a last-minute
appeal to Danes yesterday to vote for the Maastricht treaty in today's
referendum, as opinion polls showed the Yes campaign holding a substantial
lead.
A final Gallup survey, to be published today, indicated 58 per cent support
for the treaty and 42 per cent against. But the survey allowed participants
only a Yes or No choice, disregarding the large numbers claiming to be
undecided or planning to abstain.
An earlier opinion poll showed the Yes camp with 50 per cent, against 32 per
cent for No, as well as 14 per cent undecided and 4 per cent abstaining.
Gallup incorrectly forecast the result of Denmark's previous referendum last
June, which rejected Maastricht by 50.7 per cent to 49.3 per cent, throwing
European Community strategy into confusion and forcing the EC to grant
Denmark opt-outs from the treaty's provisions on closer political and
economic union.
But yesterday's polling showed 75 per cent of those questioned expected a
Yes this time, including 63 per cent of No voters.
In his appeal for a Yes vote, Mr Rasmussen was supported by Mr Carl Bildt,
Sweden's prime minister, who regards the vote as a test for the EC's policy
of enlargement to include Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway by the
mid-1990s.
'A Danish Yes would be a green light for the conclusion of the enlargement
negotiations,' Mr Bildt told the Financial Times. 'We have an obvious
interest in a Danish Yes.'
He said: 'The period of doubt and hesitation in Europe between the Danish No
on June 2 last year and the expected Yes on May 18 is now coming to an end.
Although the cost has been high - notably on the financial markets - I
believe that Europe has benefited from the doubts and the debates of this
year.'
Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, also expressed confidence.
Commenting on Denmark's success in winning 'opt-out' arrangements at the EC
summit in December, Mr Kinkel said: 'In Edinburgh we took full consideration
of Danish arguments and embedded these in the overall context of the treaty.
I am confident that the Danish population, like their Scandinavian
neighbours, will react positively to this process.'
Brussels officials remained wary of predicting a favourable result. 'We're
all on tenterhooks here,' a Commission official said.
Mr Rasmussen said the EC, currently under the Danish presidency, must set
aside its more visionary projects. 'A Yes vote . . .will be a Yes to a new
period of pragmatic decisions positive for ordinary European citizens in
their daily life,' he argued.
The No lobby complained that the political establishment, overwhelmingly in
favour of a Yes vote, was conducting a scare campaign.
The Commission confirmed yesterday it had sharply reduced its forecast for
economic growth in the EC this year. EC officials denied there was a
decision to delay releasing the forecasts until after the referendum.

FT  18 MAY 93 / De Benedetti under investigation over Olivetti bribes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CARLO De Benedetti, chair-man of Olivetti, was yesterday formally placed
under investigation by Milan magistrates.
The move follows his voluntary statement to the authorities on Sunday
outlining illicit payments by Olivetti, the computers and office equipment
group, to Italian politicians totalling nearly L20bn (Pounds 8.5m) during
the past decade.
His statement spoke of threats to obtain money which amounted to
'racketeering'. It is the most outspoken attack so far by a leading
industrialist on Italy's political establishment and the climate in which
business was obliged to work during the late 1980s.
Mr De Benedetti is one of most prominent businessman among about 700
politicians, officials and entrepreneurs caught up in Italy's ever-widening
corruption scandal. However, Mr Marco De Luca, the Olivetti chief's lawyer,
said no charges had been laid against him.
In volunteering the deposition, Mr De Benedetti said he assumed
responsibility for all actions by the company, whether or not he was
personally involved.
In a statement to the Financial Times yesterday, he repeated that he,
personally, had 'never paid over any money to politicians or officials'.
In his 11-page deposition, Mr De Benedetti said that at one stage Olivetti
had rejected requests for money and had been put 'on the black books of the
state railways' and excluded even from bids.
Later, the pressure from the parties and their representatives in the state
entities 'reached an impressive crescendo . . . of menaces and extortion to
become in the last few years nothing short of racketeering . . . The demands
from the representatives of the parties were systematic and unavoidable on
everything they controlled without exception'.
Mr Giovanni Cherubini, former head of Olivetti's Rome operations, who is
understood to have acted as an intermediary with treasurers of main Italian
parties and with ministry officials, appeared voluntarily before Milan
magistrates yesterday.
It is believed that, through him, Olivetti agreed to begin making payments
in 1988 to a Rome 'collector' for the Christian Democrat and Socialist
parties. This was in return for a purchase agreement with the Ministry of
Posts, Mr De Benedetti's deposition said. The payments represented 2 per
cent of the value of the ministry's purchases. Between 1988-91 Olivetti paid
more than L10bn this way.
No details of other Olivetti payments have been released but Mr De Benedetti
said there had been five separate episodes since 1978.
He gave two other examples to underline the climate of hostility - the
blocking of a takeover of the publisher Mondadori in 1981 and the
intervention of the former Socialist prime minister, Mr Bettino Craxi, on
the sale of SME, the state foodstuffs and distribution group in 1985. 'The
strong reaction of . . . Mr Craxi blocked and subsequently annulled the
latter operation.'
Yesterday ordinary shares in Olivetti rose 2.8 per cent before falling back
marginally.

FT  18 MAY 93 / Clashes at Timex factory lead to 38 arrests: Company now
entitled to rehire dismissed workers selectively
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY EIGHT people were arrested yesterday in clashes outside the Timex
electronics plant in Dundee after 3,000 demonstrators from all over Britain
gathered to blockade the factory to mark the 90th day of the dispute.
The clashes came as the dispute, one of the most acrimonious since the
1980s, entered a crucial phase. From today, the US multinational can legally
begin to rehire, on a selective basis, some of the original 343 workers who
were sacked and replaced by 271 new recruits.
Mr Peter Hall, the company's UK chief executive, said he would issue a
statement today explaining what Timex intended to do. The company is
unlikely to rehire all the sacked workers - a decision that could provoke
further anger on the picket line.
Mr Hall said Timex was already seeking to employ a further 230 workers.
Applications had been arriving at the plant in response to advertisements in
local newspapers.
Mr Hall has refused to enter into negotiations with the AEEU engineering
union or to seek a compromise through the Advisory Conciliation and
Arbitration Service. The replacement workers have been bussed through the
picket line.
Mr Hall is now in a position to rehire some of the original workforce
without fearing charges of unfair dismissal from workers who are not
re-employed.
Local union leaders who had called for a peaceful demonstration said
yesterday's incidents came from a minority of troublemakers. The violence
flared when a section of the crowd briefly broke through police lines. At
least two of the more than 500 police were injured.
Mr Arthur Scargill, the National Union of Mineworkers' president, who
participated in the rally, urged unions to call a 24-hour strike in support
of the Timex strikers. He was joined on a march past the plant by Mr Alex
Salmond MP, leader of the Scottish National party.
AEEU leaders condemned yesterday's trouble. 'Such scenes of violence and
stupidity are in no way organised or condoned by the AEEU,' Mr Jimmy Airlie,
the union's executive member for Scotland, said. 'It will in my opinion
damage the cause of the Timex workers and could prolong the dispute.'
Mr Bill Jordan, the AEEU's president, condemned what he called the 'naive
political posturing' of those who turned up on the picket line. 'We are
still looking for a negotiated settlement, not a confrontation.'

FT  18 MAY 93 / Bank governor to accept salary freeze for five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE GEORGE, the new governor of the Bank of England and a man wedded to
low inflation, has agreed to freeze his salary of more than Pounds 200,000
for his five-year period of office.
The Bank said yesterday that it knew of no one else in Britain who had shown
similar restraint over pay. 'We hope Mr George will start a new trend,' it
said.
Mr George, the present deputy governor who takes over the top job on July 1,
is known within Threadneedle Street as 'the last Stalinist' because of his
tough, autocratic management style.
He is convinced Britain must curb price and wage pressures if it is to
create a sound economy in the 1990s, a message to be rammed home today in
the Bank's new quarterly report on inflation.
The five-year freeze indicates that Mr George is anxious to avoid a repeat
of the row two years ago when news emerged of a 17 per cent pay rise agreed
by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the current governor. At that time, he was
urging low wage increases as part of the battle against inflation.
Mr George, who has been at the Bank for 31 years, is thought to have agreed
on a salary of between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 220,000 from the start of
his time in office.
The salary - the same as the amount paid to Mr Leigh-Pemberton last year -
is considerably more than that earned by other public servants, but well
below the pay of many top names in the City.
Mr George, aged 54, earned Pounds 164,910 in the year to February last year.
The Bank refuses to say how much Mr George is earning. He is reputed,
however, to have turned down in recent years a number of Pounds 1m
annual-salary jobs from big financial services companies.
The news about Mr George failed to impress the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union, which called yesterday for the Bank to open pay talks for its
4,500 members there. It also rejected the government's public-sector pay
norm of 1.5 per cent.
Mr Jim Lowe, the union's assistant secretary for the Bank, said staff
deserved 'a decent pay rise' as much as the governor. 'A pay freeze is
easier to bear when your salary is over Pounds 200,000,' said Mr Lowe.
He said Bank of England staff had not achieved the scale of increases
received in recent years by the present governor.
In the year to February 1992, Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who is retiring after 10
years as governor, earned Pounds 164,311. He waived a further Pounds 34,135.
In the previous year he was paid Pounds 155,019 and in the 12 months to
February 1990 he earned Pounds 132,558.

FT  17 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Heron sales should raise Pounds 90m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON International expects to raise Pounds 90m in two property disposals to
be formally announced next month.
It is understood the vehicle for Mr Gerald Ronson's property and trading
activities has agreed the deals, one in Britain and one in continental
Europe, but is not yet ready to make a formal announcement. Sales are
thought to be at much higher yields than the current norm.
The company may find the deals a useful response to the controversy over Mr
Ronson's salary package revealed in documents setting out the planned Pounds
1.4bn restructuring. They will go some way to improving the pro forma net
asset value shown at Pounds 12m.
Mr Ronson's Pounds 500,000 a year index-linked salary and five-year contract
raised eyebrows when it was revealed in documents covering the restructuring
which is due to be completed by July 1, subject to creditors' approval next
month.
Without inflation the total package is worth Pounds 4.38m over five years.
It represents a pay cut from Mr Ronson's current salary of Pounds 1.4m.
The business plan underlying the refinancing of Heron's Pounds 1.7bn debts
as at November - when sterling's weakness increased the value of foreign
currency borrowings - depends on a recovery in the property market.
Heron says its property portfolio is worth Pounds 900m, making the two
deals, one set for the middle and the other for the end of June, worth just
10 per cent of the total. Its disposal plans include housebuilder Heron
Homes.
It argues that the only alternative to the bank-backed restructuring would
be lengthy and less rewarding insolvency proceedings.
One bond holder representative has conceded that the restructuring must go
ahead although it is 'flawed', because any suggestion that the restructuring
plan had to be renegotiated could lead to the banks withdrawing support.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Sugar unrepentant in Spurs stand-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE between the two key shareholders at Tottenham Hotspur hotted up
over the weekend with details emerging of why Mr Alan Sugar, the chairman,
wants to sack Mr Terry Venables, the chief executive.
Mr Venables, who owns 22 per cent of the company, is fighting the attempt to
dismiss him. On Friday, just hours after being sacked, he obtained a High
Court injunction reinstating him as chief executive until a hearing on May
25.
Reasons for the attempted dismissal, according to the Sugar camp, included
Mr Venables' commercial activities at the club - which he was described as
pursuing 'almost relentlessly', sometimes without reference to Mr Sugar.
It also emerged that Mr Sugar, the electronics millionaire who owns 48 per
cent of Tottenham, had offered to buy Mr Venables' stake at the price he
paid for it. 'My offer was fair, even generous,' Mr Sugar said yesterday.
Mr Venables, who has invested about Pounds 3m in the club, buying most of
his shares at 75p, has described the offer as derisory. If he received only
Pounds 3m, that would be less than the Pounds 3.2m market value of the stake
at Friday's closing price of 89p and it would also mean a loss on his
financing costs. He borrowed most of the Pounds 3m he invested.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Rome police suspect Mafia of blast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE in Rome yesterday continued investigations into a car bomb that
exploded on Friday night in a wealthy residential area of the capital,
injuring 23 people, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The police said members of the Mafia were the most likely instigators. Italy
will be marking this week the anniversary of the Mafia killing of Mr Giovane
Falcone, the anti-Mafia magistrate, and the authorities have warned that the
group is preparing to act against the state.
One theory is that the bomb was aimed at Mr Mauricio Constanzio, one of the
country's most popular chat show hosts who has been an outspoken opponent of
Mafia tactics. His car passed by seconds before the bomb exploded and only a
wall saved him from serious injury.
However, the explosion did not bear the familiar signs of Mafia action and
would be an unusual departure from the organisation's practice of
concentrating terrorist action in its home base of Sicily.
Firemen were yesterday still clearing up debris in the street in the Parioli
district of Rome where the explosion occurred. Some 80 apartment owners have
been forced to leave their homes temporarily following the blast, which
gouged a small hole in the road and devasted the facades of buildings for
nearly 100m.
Police said the explosion was unlikely to be the work of any foreign
organisation or a local subversive group.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S government is rushing through reform of its criminal justice and
prison systems following a series of blunders, culminating in the suicide
last week of the country's most notorious prisoner.
Patrick Haemers was found hanged in his cell on Friday morning. He had been
accused of masterminding a series of hold-ups and the kidnapping of former
Belgian prime minister Mr Paul Vanden Boeynants.
Haemers' trial had already been delayed once for lack of a jury and was
undermined a fortnight ago by the armed break-out from a Brussels jail of
two of the eight people accused alongside him. Haemers' lawyers claim he
killed himself because he was demoralised by the delay in setting up the
trial.
But the escape has raised fears in Belgium that violent armed gangs may be
linking up to support one another. When one of Haemers' associates was
recaptured 10 days ago, his supporters machine-gunned the facade of the
police station where he was being held overnight and threw grenades through
the windows.

implicating the chairman of UBS in Italy's political corruption scandals.
Mr Fiorini has told Geneva prosecutors Mr Nikolaus Senn, UBS chairman,
assisted in the transfer of funds from Eni, state-owned Italian energy
group, through a UBS account in Lugano to the Italian Socialist party in the
late 1970s. Mr Fiorini was finance director of Eni at the time.
Mr Senn, who was then UBS chief executive, initially denied the charge,
published in the Swiss financial newspaper Cash two weeks ago.
He then admitted to Cash that Mr Fiorini had met him in 1981 and asked that
information on the account - which had been closed - be treated with the
utmost discretion.
In an interview with another newspaper published yesterday, Mr Senn said he
could not rule out that Mr Fiorini had said the funds were destined for the
Italian Socialist party.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Clinton to cut ship subsidies

<TEXT>
US MERCHANT shipping lines are expected to start reflagging their ships in
countries that offer lower crew and tax costs after a decision by the
Clinton administration not to extend operating subsidies to ships working
under the US flag.
According to the Washington Post, the White House overruled a proposal by Mr
Federico Pena, transportation secretary, to continue operating subsidies to
US shipping companies when current contracts expire in 1997 because they
could not be accommodated in the budget plan.
Without subsidies the US merchant fleet is expected to dwindle to about 30
vessels plying cabotage routes to US destinations such as Alaska and Hawaii,
where US flag vessels are required by law.
US flag shipping costs are substantially higher than the world market;
recently the Agriculture Department had to find about Dollars 385m in order
to get Russia to accept the Dollars 700m of food aid promised by President
Bill Clinton.
Russia initially had declined the aid because of the cost of shipping three
quarters of it on US flag vessels, as required by American aid law.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Monday Interview: Centrist at a golden crossroad - Huang Ju,
mayor of Shanghai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Huang Ju, the mayor of Shanghai, is a man with a mission. His aim is to
set his city on course to become a finance and trade powerhouse in Asia and
the Pacific by 2010.
Twelve months ago, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo and Seoul may have scoffed at Mr
Huang's presumption, but it is unlikely today that financiers in any of
these centres would doubt Shanghai's capacity to assert itself regionally by
early next century.
The 'city state' is already proving a strong magnet for new investment,
sucking in billions of dollars of foreign funds - Dollars 3.5bn last year
alone, equivalent to almost the entire amount over the past decade. In the
process, Shanghai is becoming more closely attached to the economies of
Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers such as
Singapore and Thailand.
'Between 2000 and 2010 we want to turn Shanghai into a financial and trading
centre of the Asian and Pacific region. Our objective is to achieve
complementarity with other regional financial and trade centres,' Mr Huang
said.
The 55-year-old engineer who became mayor of China's most populous city in
1991 speaks the language of a salesman when extolling Shanghai's advantages
as the 'dragon head' of his country's economic development.
The city sits, for example, at the point where China's 'golden highway', the
Yangtze, runs into the sea; it is also located mid-way between north and
south on China's coastline. 'We are at the cross-roads of the golden highway
and golden coastline. We stand at the gateway to the world outside,' Mr
Huang said of the Yangtze river delta and Yangtze valley whose cities and
towns account for half China's industrial output.
His dream of Shanghai's golden future will depend on sustained
revitalisation of the city's crumbling infrastructure and industrial base.
It will also require a revolution in China's state-dominated financial
sector whose old-fashioned ways are incompatible with Mr Huang's aspirations
for Shanghai as a modern financial services sector.
The mayor fits the mould of the modern Chinese technocrat-cum-official. He
dresses neatly in conservative western suit and tie and tasselled black
shoes; and he is cautious in his political observations, as befits someone
with a reputation as a centrist with links to the two broad factions of the
communist elite. Among his mentors is said to be the 88-year-old Chen Yun,
patron of the central planners and a conservative counterweight to the
reformists led by senior leader, 88-year-old Deng Xiaoping.
Mr Huang deflects questions about the relevance of Marxism in modern China.
He would rather quote statistics than Marx; the thoughts of Deng Xiaoping
than those of Chairman Mao.
China's turbulent past, its adherence to class struggle, its Soviet-style
central planning, and the disruption caused by mass political campaigns are
'part of history', he said. What was important was to look forward. Mr Huang
joined the Communist party in 1966, three years after he graduated from
Qinghua university, one of China's most prestigious, and a few months before
the Cultural Revolution brought years of chaos to China.
Looking forward provides the Chinese official with an opportunity to sketch
in some grand plans for Shanghai. These involve three stages of development:
from 1991-95; 1996-2000; and 2000-2010.
Shanghai would continue to invest heavily in infrastructure at a rate of
about Dollars 1.75bn annually to the end of the century, creating the right
environment for the city to achieve its broader ambitions; municipal
planners, through tax incentives and other measures, would shift the balance
of industry from heavy to light manufacturing, preferably high-tech; and
services would be given every encouragement to grow from their present 30
per cent share of the city's GNP to 45 per cent.
Shanghai has a lot of catching up to do. Its share of national industrial
output is down from 18 per cent in the 1950s to about 7 per cent today. In
1985 it yielded to Guangdong province in the south the mantle of number one
exporter.
It is this latter development that the proud Shanghainese find particularly
irksome. And although Mr Huang is too shrewd a politician to make negative
remarks about the southern province - he almost certainly harbours national
ambitions - it would be surprising if he did not share in a general desire
to put Guangdong and the energetic Cantonese in their place. 'We want
Shanghai to lead in economic development in China,' is about as close as he
is prepared to go in throwing down the gauntlet.
Mr Huang is also careful not to criticise Beijing for keeping Shanghai on a
tight leash longer than was perhaps necessary until recently. Shanghai
businessmen chafed for years at what they saw as unfair restrictions on
their activities, while their Guangdong counterparts were permitted to
engage in an entrepreneurial free-for-all.
Shanghai has also been obliged to contribute a bigger share of its revenues
into national coffers, leaving itself short of funds to deal with manifest
infrastructural problems - housing, roads and sewage systems all need urgent
attention - in one of the world's most overcrowded cities. Loyally, Mr Huang
ascribed Beijing's restrictions to Shanghai's importance as a stabilising
factor during the politically risky early reform process of the 1980s.
'Shanghai has been obliged to play a role like a big brother,' he said
diplomatically. 'As the source of one-seventh of state revenues in the 1980s
it had to bear its duties and responsibilities. It was too risky to
experiment.'
Mr Huang compared Shanghai's role in the 1980s to that of a defensive player
in soccer. But in the 1990s it was moving onto the offensive as a 'pioneer
for reform'.
Among privileges now being ceded by the central government to Shanghai is
the right to borrow internationally. Mr Huang estimates that Shanghai raised
about RMB10bn last year for infrastructure projects, of which about 80 per
cent had been borrowed abroad, most from international lenders such as the
World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
Shanghai is now also allowed to buy construction materials from the cheapest
international source without first obtaining permission from Beijing, a
process that could often take three months or more.
Mr Huang expects the city to continue to grow at rates well above the
national average. Shanghai's economy last year expanded by 14.8 per cent,
compared with national growth 12.8 per cent. The city's target is 10 per
cent annually until 2000, but the mayor is confident it will exceed that
target without provoking crippling cost-of-living increases.
Western concern about China's economy overheating was exaggerated, he
declared, and some inflation was, in the present circumstances, unavoidable.
The Chinese had, in any case, learned to cope with price rises. 'You look at
China from the point of view of a foreigner. I look at it as a Chinese,' he
said.
Mr Huang, whose full name means 'yellow Chrysanthemum', would probably
describe himself as a pragmatist in the tradition of Mr Deng. Indeed, he
spurned any suggestion that accepting the failure of rigid central planning
was painful for someone whose political views were nurtured during the
Mao-dominated 1950s and 1960s. 'We've got to seek truth from facts,' he
said, using a well-worn Deng slogan. 'We must explore ways for development
with actual conditions in mind to recognise what is right and correct and
what is mistaken.
'We realise it is impossible to have a perfect market economy,' he added.
'But we are learning from the European and the Americans and from our own
experience.' Mr Deng, one of whose most famous slogans is 'practice is the
sole criterion of truth', would approve.

FT  17 MAY 93 / The real obstacles to free trade: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When critics say the Clinton administration's trade policy is confused, what
they mean is that they disagree with it. As in the early days of any new
administration, policymakers clash on occasion. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
treasury secretary, may sound more committed to classical free trade
principles than, say, Mr Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, or Ms
Laura Tyson, the White House chief economist. But these are nuances: there
is a great deal of agreement on fundamental principles.
Nobody in the Clinton team - from the president down - believes much can be
gained from new protectionist barriers to imports. They want more rather
than less trade. On the other hand, they think the US's relative economic
decline in recent decades partly reflects an asymmetrical trading structure.
American markets, especially for high-tech goods, have been more open and
less subsidised than those of most other industrialised countries, putting
US companies at a disadvantage.
This can be put right, the US believes, only by policies that emphasise
'equal access' to markets. Purely reciprocal trade concessions are not
enough because, given the starting point, they would still leave US markets
more exposed than those of trading partners such as Japan.
These arguments have force. No country any longer advocates the kind of
unilateral free trade embraced by Victorian Britain. In the immediate
postwar decades the US was willing to have more open markets than its
trading partners for two reasons: it was an economic superpower and trade
concessions were a useful way of winning support for its 'containment of
communism' strategy. Now that communism is dead and the US's economic
strength is much reduced, it is understandably seeking a genuinely level
playing field in trade.
If there is a ground for complaint, it concerns tactics. Taking its lead
from Republican administrations, the Clinton team is preparing unilaterally
to impose sanctions on Japan and other countries it deems unfair traders. It
appears determined to use the 1986 semiconductor accord, which set a
quantitative target for foreign penetration of the Japanese market, as a
model for other sectoral agreements.
So far this kind of 'managed trade' seems to be attracting surprisingly
little opposition. At a recent Washington lunch, Mr Jean Claude Paye,
secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, pointedly refused to condemn quantitative targets. 'If the US
policy leads to a non-discriminatory opening of closed markets, it will be
good,' he said. In other words, US bully-boy tactics are fine so long as a
piece of Japanese action is reserved for Europe.
This is too complacent a view. Why should bureaucratic measures that reserve
a chunk of Japanese markets for foreign (mainly US) companies encourage the
Japanese to adopt more market-oriented policies? The history of interference
in market mechanisms in trade suggests that such an intervention will be
neither temporary nor regionally contained. Such 'voluntary import
expansion' orders would probably spread like wildfire, just as voluntary
export restrictions did in the 1980s. If this is what the Clinton people
really want, they are short-sighted.
On the other hand, economists enraged by such policies should recognise that
the US plans, in part, are a legitimate reaction to the shortcomings of the
multilateral rules underwritten by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. The structural and cultural impediments that hamper foreign access to
Japanese markets are frequently not covered by the Gatt rules. But, rather
than wrecking relations with Tokyo by insisting on what amounts to disguised
import quotas for US companies, the US should be thinking more strategically
about trade policy.
The bilateral deficit with Japan is much less important than overall US
trade deficit which can only be reduced by macroeconomic means. The tensions
with Japan reflect a general problem: the fact that the ability of companies
to compete globally is affected by a whole range of domestic policies, not
just the level of protection at the border.
As production becomes increasingly globalised, the challenge is not just to
create a level playing field in trade but a level playing field generally.
This means ensuring that the overall level of government support for
industries is roughly equalised. The US thus ought to be pushing hard for
agreement on the terms of reference for a post-Uruguay Round of trade talks
to address the domestic obstacles to truly cosmopolitan capitalism, such as
differences in national industrial, technology and competition policies.
Unilateral threats sound tough but they can never properly address the
worldwide interests of US companies. Companies that operate globally need
globally-valid trade rules. The only forum in which the US can hope to forge
a global trade regime good for both the US and its partners is the Gatt. Mr
Clinton says he supports the Gatt process. But like so many American
policymakers, he appears unable to grasp the overriding importance of
multilateral rules and institutions as economies grow ever more
interdependent. It is a curious shortcoming given his sensitivity to such
institutions in military and diplomatic policy.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Bosnia's moment of truth: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row which boiled over last week between the US and Europe over the war
in Bosnia seems to have subsided. But the reasons for the row have not been
resolved, and the recent torrent of transatlantic abuse and recrimination
may be a foretaste of much worse to come. The reason for the row is that the
war is reaching the moment of truth.
The row was over a twin-track plan which the US thought would help stop the
fighting - air strikes against the Serbs, and arms for the Moslems. Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, toured Europe to sell the plan,
but the Europeans turned it down flat.
The anger of some of the anti-European remarks coming out of Washington when
Mr Christopher got home seemed way over the top. Senator Joseph Biden's
denunciation of the Europeans for 'indifference, timidity, self-delusion and
hypocrisy' was not just gratuitously insulting; it came from a country which
until now has done its best to stay out of the mess.
Mr Biden's intemperate outburst probably concealed a deeper meaning. It was
a revealing give-away, not just of the intensity of political feeling
building up over the conflict, but even more of a premonition that it is
driving the world community inexorably towards a grave crisis.
Governments on both sides of the Atlantic know that the conflict is coming
to a head. When it does, they will have to answer the most basic question,
which they have so far evaded: are they prepared to stop the Serbs and
impose a settlement, by force if necessary?
International leaders would prefer not to have to answer this question. They
have believed, correctly, that the best kind of peace comes through
negotiation; and they have wanted, if at all possible, to stay out of a
murderous war in the Yugoslav mountains. As a result they have followed a
cautious policy: diplomatic pressure for a negotiation, on the Vance-Owen
plan; and international sanctions to force the parties to negotiate.
Officially, they continue to hope that these weak pressures will induce the
Bosnians to make peace.
European governments have an extra reason for caution. From the beginning,
President George Bush made clear he would have nothing to do with
Yugoslavia. The US sent large numbers of troops to Somalia, with spectacular
success; but Yugoslavia was Europe's problem, and Europe's failure.
Bill Clinton campaigned against Mr Bush for a stronger line on Bosnia. Four
months into his presidency, he is still telling us that he is going to have
a stronger policy on Bosnia; but he still does not have one. The plan for
bombing the Serbs and arming the Moslems has now apparently been put on
hold. This might have briefly satisfied Mr Clinton's need to be seen to be
'doing something', without endangering US soldiers. But it could not have
improved the chances of peace, and might have made them much worse.
The UN could not possibly endorse a policy of intervening militarily on the
side of the Moslems; that would end all UN peace-keeping for a generation.
In any case, such a policy would be vetoed by Russia.
If the US intervened militarily on the side of the Moslems, there would be
two immediate consequences. First, all international peace-keeping and most
humanitarian operations would immediately stop. Second, others would
probably intervene on the side of the Serbs. As a result, the war would
reach new peaks of ethnic cleansing and territorial aggression.
A bombing policy would, in any case, quickly have to be halted, in the face
of international revulsion at its unintended but inevitable results. During
week one of such an assault, Clinton's hero-rating would soar as the
American electorate admired spectacular TV footage of air strikes. In week
two, his rating would collapse, in the face of gruesome TV footage of dead
and dying civilians. Such a policy makes sense only if you are sure that the
Serbs would abandon their war aims during week one.
Finally, the US plan is ambivalent about its true strategic objectives. Does
it hope to bomb the Serbs into submitting to the Vance-Owen plan? Or does it
just want a more equal war, so that the Moslems could fight for more
territory? There is a big difference between the two.
If the Americans just want a fight to the finish, they have no reason to put
any troops in on the ground. In that case they should openly dissociate
themselves from the Vance-Owen plan, and stop sneering at the Europeans. If,
on the contrary, they hope to implement the Vance-Owen plan, they must be
prepared to send troops; but sending troops means fighting Serbs, because
that is the only way to make them give up 30 per cent of the territory of
Bosnia.
In the end we are forced back to the fundamental question: is the
international community ready to stop the Serbs, and impose a settlement, by
force if necessary? The steps taken so far by Europe and the UN are intended
to put off that question for as long as possible. First we had sanctions;
then we had a no-fly zone; now we have safe havens, in theory; soon we may
have an internationally monitored blockade on the Serbian-Bosnian frontier.
But now we have virtually exhausted the repertoire of peaceful pressure to
drag the combatants to a negotiated solution, because the gap between the
principles of the Vance-Owen plan and the facts on the ground is turning
into an unbridgeable abyss.
At best we have a few more weeks for procrastination and hope. Then we shall
have to answer the big question. And that will be the signal for a serious
transatlantic row.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on the Danes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW'S Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty will be the principal
focus in foreign exchange and money markets this week, writes James Blitz.
In recent days, it has looked increasingly likely that Denmark will vote Yes
to the treaty.
A Gallup opinion poll which was published on Friday in a leading Danish
daily newspaper showed that support for the Yes camp had widened to 50 per
cent with 32 per cent of people opposed.
This compared to a 49-33 per cent lead published in a Gallup survey the
previous day.
There are even suggestions that a No vote would not immediately threaten the
Danish krone's position in the European exchange rate mechanism's grid.
Mr Mads Jacobsen, a vice director at Den Danske Bank, said on Friday that
the important factors in Denmark were the country's strong macro-economic
fundamentals, the Danish loyalty to the ERM and the fact that implementation
of European Monetary Union has become rather hypothetical.
However, there are grounds for thinking that, even if the ERM is unaffected
by this week's strains, tensions could return at the end of the year if
France's fundamental economic performance has not improved.
France is unlikely to cut its short-term rates at a more aggressive pace
than Germany, because this would put the franc under pressure in the ERM.
However, French inflation is lower than Germany's. France's real interest
rates are likely to remain comparatively high by the end of the year.
Sterling's short-term future should be strongly influenced by a host of
economic data this week, of which the most important are probably the April
unemployment figures due out on Thursday.

FT  17 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Danish vote may prove watershed for Ecu
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S second referendum on the Maastricht treaty is likely to prove a
watershed for the Ecu bond market.
Late last week, dealers reported a spurt of buying activity ahead of the May
18 referendum, as positive sentiment grew on the chances for a Yes vote. In
the run-up to the election, the level of decided Yes voters has consistently
run at about 60 per cent. In addition, a wave of enthusiasm was generated by
the devaluations of the peseta and the escudo on Thursday.
According to dealers, a Yes vote is now largely discounted in the market.
But it seems clear that, while a Yes vote would help restore confidence in
the sector, the market is not about to recover all the ground lost in the
last year.
A year ago the Ecu bond market was riding high. Ecu bonds had become a
component of many large international bond portfolios, and were traded as an
additional European government bond market.
On the back of the so-called 'convergence' theory - that European interest
rates would converge on the path to European monetary union - Ecu bond
yields fell rapidly.
Before the first Danish referendum on June 2 1992, actual Ecu bond yields
were 60 basis points below the theoretical yield curve (calculated according
to the proportionate bond yields of the Ecu's component currencies).
The only rationale for the premium level of Ecu bonds was that they were set
to form the single European bond market.
In the wake of the June referendum, when that assumption was severely
tested, the heavy supply of new issues was cut off overnight and liquidity
disappeared. Then, pressures on the European exchange rate mechanism further
crushed confidence in the sector, and by September actual yields were 50
basis points higher than the theoretical curve.
However, the market has staged something of a recovery this year, and with
actual yields now about 10 basis points through the theoretical curve,
dealers believe it to be more rationally based.
There are some reasons to argue that the market could rally sharply in the
event of a Yes vote.
The market is flat to slightly long ahead of the referendum. Last year, the
market's collapse was exacerbated because traders had very long positions
ahead of the vote, either for speculative purposes or because they had
substantial inventory left over from new issues. This year, retail investors
and asset swappers have taken excess paper out of the market. This means
that the risk of a structural collapse has been removed, according to Mr
Steve Major, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities.
He believes that yields could fall to 30 basis points through the
theoretical yield curve on a Yes vote, or rise to 20-30 basis points above
the theoretical curve on a No vote. However, he cautions that the
ratification delay in the UK and constitutional questions over German
ratification mean that the uncertainty is not over.
A Yes vote should help pave the way for a revival of activity in the primary
market. According to IFR Securities Data, only 14 new issues have been
launched in the Ecu market since the last Danish vote, though both the
French and UK governments have restored their Ecu programmes.
A number of key borrowers are expected to tap the market if conditions
improve.
The European Community and the European Investment Bank have both maintained
their presence in the market and are expected to return.
In addition, Finland, Sweden and Spain are all said to be looking at the
market. Finland launched an Ecu500m issue in February.
There are also hopes that Belgium will revive its plans to develop its own
Ecu government bond programme, shelved after the market collapsed.
However, even if the market rallies, dealers believe that its status as a
quasi-government bond market will not return.
Many institutional investors still have not returned to the market, and not
all of them will be persuaded to change their minds by a Yes vote.
'The Ecu has returned to trading as a basket currency,' said Mr Michael
Burke, an economist at Citibank.
'Only the most die-hard enthusiast' can expect a return to its previous
status, he added.
The Shenzhen stock exchange plans to take a series of measures aimed at
lifting overseas interest in its flagging market for B-shares, Reuter
reports from Beijing. It will unify its listing and currency clearing, give
seats to overseas securities dealers and reduce the time lapse between
issuing and marketing of B-shares.
The exchange says it will work to ensure more information on B-share
transactions.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Risk and Reward: Employers question the pooled approach to
pension provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THE UK government sufficiently imaginative in devising debt securities
that investors really want? For an increasing portion of the pensions
industry, the answer is no.
Pension fund investment is aimed at meeting specific requirements far off
into the future. Ideally, investments should grow in line with average
earnings during an individual's lifetime and thereafter, broadly in line
with inflation. Sadly, investment professionals note, there is nothing to
provide the former, and the vehicle which provides the latter, in the form
of index-linked gilts, still has many shortcomings.
Individual ownership of one's pension appears to be the ideological
underpinning of government policy.
The old-fashioned pooled approach to pension provision, which guaranteed a
percentage of final salary upon retirement, is increasingly being questioned
by employers who say it is too costly. Moreover, the government is taking
the line that such pools are open to abuse by employers and receive
too-generous tax breaks.
Thus, the UK appears headed in the direction of personal pensions and
so-called money purchase pensions at the expense of final salary schemes.
But even the most ardent supporters of these schemes will concede their
greatest shortcoming: volatility. These vehicles simply do not provide the
certainty of benefit which final salary schemes guarantee. The pooled
approach of defined benefit schemes allows investment managers to spread
risks and rewards over many people and across several generations.
Money purchase and personal pensions simply build up at a rate roughly in
line with stock markets. 'Consider two people whose retirement is separated
by Black Monday of 1987,' said Mr Ron Spill, director of pensions at Legal
and General. 'The difference in the value of their pensions is 20 per cent.'
Moreover, because of the volatility in gilt yields, the monthly benefits
which can be purchased for the same lump-sum annuity vary sharply even over
relatively short periods. Mr Spill says that in January 1992, Pounds 1,000
would have purchased a benefit of Pounds 129 a month for a 65-year old. But
by January of this year, the same Pounds 1,000 would only have bought Pounds
118 a month.
Increasingly, the issue for life insurance companies which offer such
products is how to devise an investment structure which limits volatility.
Moreover, the Labour party has suggested it would like to require those who
offer personal pensions to guarantee a minimum level of retirement benefit,
regardless of investment performance. How can investment managers build in
such a guarantee?
Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions director at Scottish Equitable, argues that
perhaps the problem is that the appropriate investment vehicles have not yet
been designed for such schemes. 'The basic problem is the structure of the
cash flow,' says Mr Ritchie. He says that perhaps the UK government needs to
consider a new type of gilt. The sort he has in mind would effectively be a
deep discount zero-coupon security purchased with a lump sum at say, a 40th
birthday. This would accrue, say, at a spread above retail prices, up until
the individual's 65th birthday. Only then would it begin paying cash, and at
a rate roughly equal to RPI.
The Institute for Policy Studies, the left-of-centre think-tank, in a paper
to be issued later this week, will urge the government to consider a new
type of investment security whose capital value would be linked to an index
of national average earnings.
Barring the advent of imaginative government bonds, investment managers try
to limit the volatility in the value of a personal pension in the years
immediately prior to retirement by gradually shifting out of higher-yielding
equities and into fixed interest and cash. But Gartmore has tailored a
product which begins making the switch some time before then. Its Lifeplan
product invests 90 per cent of an individual's cash in equities up until the
40th birthday. Then over the next 25 years, moves progressively out of them
and into fixed interest, with the switching process accelerating between the
ages of 60 and 65.

FT  17 MAY 93 / UK Gilts: Prices stalled by concerns over next auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILT prices moved sideways in volatile trading as the market found little
stimulus to higher prices. A dominant concern was that the next gilt
auction, scheduled for May 26, will force up yields.
With a rush of figures this week about the UK economy, many investors were
chary of doing much buying and selling of gilts. The Danish referendum
tomorrow on Maastricht and the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday -
which some believe will decide on another cut in interest rates - added to
the sense of nervousness.
This month's auction is likely to be of a further Pounds 3bn or so of stock,
in the 10-15 year maturity range, with further details being announced
tomorrow.
At the same time, the Bank will publish its latest quarterly report on
inflation, which is expected to comment in detail on monetary developments
of recent months and the fact that pressures on prices may be starting to
re-appear on fragile signs of recovery.
In recent weeks, the Bank's regional agents - a network of people around
Britain who report once a month to Bank officials in London about economic
trends - have indicated that more companies are keen to pass on to customers
rising costs arising from wages and materials.
This trend is seen in the Bank as worrying and underlining the need for
caution in handling any possible adjustments in interest rates in the coming
months.
There has been some satisfaction at the Bank at the relatively good
reception among small, retail investors for gilts in recent weeks.
Even so, a great deal of optimism is needed to believe that the Pounds 50bn
or so of gilts which the Bank will probably need to sell during the current
financial year will find ready buyers. The chances are that prices will come
down, particularly at the long end of the market where it is thought yields
might rise in anticipation.
The auction next week could be as high as Pounds 3.5bn, according to some
theories, in which case a new bout of anxiety may be triggered among
investors thinking that the Pounds 50bn guestimate for official gilt sales
is on the low side.
With auctions arriving at the rate of one a month, some in the gilt market
have been trying to make the case that the Bank should have decided on a
policy of having one auction every two months, in which case there would
have been longer periods in which the market could have traded free from
auction jitters.
That option has been considered by the Bank but ruled out on the grounds
that the large volume of stock - up to Pounds 7bn or Pounds 8bn a time -
would have been far too much stock for the gilt market to absorb with
comfort.
Attention this week will focus on the latest UK unemployment data, which is
due to be released on Thursday. The consensus forecast for a rise of 15,000
last month reflects the widespread scepticism that unemployment has turned
the corner so early in a recession, with many dismissing the seasonally
adjusted falls in February and March as freak results.
The consensus is that the year-on-year rise in the retail prices index last
month will turn out to be 1.5 per cent or, excluding mortgage interest
payments, up 3.1 per cent on the year. These details are due to be announced
on Friday.
The economic data this week follow the generally encouraging inflation
figures from last week, which showed that prices of raw materials and fuel
purchased by UK manufacturing industry rose by 7.2 per cent in the 12 months
to April, compared with a rise of 8.4 per cent in the year to March.
The output prices index - the prices of manufactured products as they leave
the factory gates - rose by 3.8 per cent in the year to April, compared with
3.7 per cent in the year to March.
This trend continues to give the impression that rising prices are not a
pressing problem.
Although the figures added some life to the gilt market, prices fell back
later in the week, partly because worse than expected inflation data from
the US unsettled bond markets on Wall Street.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Spanish Government Bonds: Corset is stripped off and
abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYTHING the Spanish bond market had been piously taught to expect for as
long as anybody cares to remember has to be unlearnt. Restrictive monetary
policy has been turned on its head and what bond traders had come to call
the corset has been stripped off and abandoned.
The 8 per cent devaluation of the peseta last Thursday, followed by a 1.5
point cut in the official intervention rate at the end of the week, prompted
long bond yields to fall by about 40 basis points and left everybody
wondering what would happen next.
Guessing games on this scale have not been part of the domestic fixed income
scenario for a long time.
Devaluation was not a surprise. The peseta had been realigned downwards in
the European Monetary System by 5 per cent last September and by a further 6
per cent in November. It was not a question of whether the currency would be
devalued for a third time, but of when it would be again forced to take the
plunge.
What was new this time was the interest rate cut. This had not occured on
the previous occasions as the authorities continued to preach strict
orthodoxy in the face of the twin demons of inflationary temptations and
immoderate wage rises.
At the end of last week, the Bank of Spain appeared to be throwing caution
to the wind. It lowered rates on the back of a month-on-month consumer price
index rise of 0.4 per cent, the biggest April inflation rise for four years,
at a time when the wage agreements were running at about 6 per cent.
Market watchers had to look no further than the June 6 date for general
elections to find an explanation for such uncharacteristic behaviour. Faced
with a strong challenge at the polls, the government seems determined to cut
and run - which is exactly what it had previously insisted it would not do.
The about-turn raises all sorts of questions that bond investors in Spain
have virtually forgotten how to ask. For a start, it is possible that given
the current official mood, short-term interest rates will be allowed to fall
very quickly.
It is anybody's guess how much the rates will be brought down by an outgoing
government that is rightly appalled by a recession that has wiped out more
than 500,000 jobs in the past six months and which continues to destroy them
at the rate of some 3,000 a day.
Yet how far can monetary indiscipline go when there is the looming threat of
imported inflation?
The April inflation figure would have been worse had food prices not
remained static. Rise in service prices were sharply up from 7.3 per cent to
7.8 per cent, and underlying inflation remains menacing at 5.8 per cent
year-on-year.
There is the sort of uncertainty in the air which makes the climate fit only
for gamblers.
'We are not advising clients to buy strongly in the short because there are
too many political factors,' says Ms Claudine Innes of brokers Maxwell
Espinosa.
When the votes have been counted after the June 6 election, one of two
things will happen.
The first is that discipline will return under the aegis of a centre-right
coalition government commited to a strong and salutary retrenchment. The
second is that, in spite of the collapse of its economic policies last week,
the socialist party will manage to scramble back into power, shorn of its
majority and bereft of ideas.
Under the first scenario there could be a strong rally. Under the second,
the currency speculators are likely to have a field day with the peseta.

FT  17 MAY 93 / US Money and Credit: Long bonds bear brunt of further
inflation jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH bout of inflation jitters is running through the US credit markets -
just ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open
Market Committee.
The worries were sparked off by two sets of statistics last week.
The producer price index, released on Wednesday, showed a rise of 0.6 per
cent in April, well above analysts' expectations and the largest gain in 2
1/2 years. That sent long bond prices down more than half a point on the
day.
Thursday's consumer price index had an even greater impact on the market. It
showed an unexpected 0.4 per cent rise last month and, when coupled with the
release of figures showing a 1.2 per cent rise in April retail sales,
knocked nearly 1 1/4 points off the long bond.
The bad inflation news was particularly poorly timed from the US Treasury's
viewpoint, for it came only a few hours before the government's sale of
Dollars 8.25bn of 30-year bonds, the last stage in its large quarterly
refunding programme.
The worries persisted to the end of the week, with the yield on the long
bond standing around 6.94 per cent on Friday night, compared with 6.84 a
week earlier.
All this has killed off the market's faint hopes that tomorrow's Fed meeting
might ease monetary policy in view of the succession of other recent figures
showing the disappointingly slow growth in the economy.
Instead, it has again posed the question of whether inflation is a
significant threat, and how soon the Fed's current policy, targeting a 3 per
cent rate on Federal funds, might turn tighter.
The consensus among many Wall Street economists is that the latest inflation
figures are probably an aberration - the latest in a series of scares which
are likely to continue as the economy moves slowly and erratically forward.
This view suggests that it is hard for inflation to take off when the
economy may grow by between only 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent in the second
quarter, and when unit labour costs are rising by less than 2 per cent in
the non-farm sector.
Some bond bears argue that inflation has tended historically to accelerate
in the third year of an economic recovery, and since the US is now in this
stage it is bound to suffer accordingly.
However, as Mr Mitchell Held, of securities house Smith Barney, points out,
the current recovery is different from past ones, with the rate of
utilisation of excess capacity falling far short of previous rebounds.
He adds: 'The normal rise in the capacity utilisation rate will not come to
pass and commodity prices need not rise. Therefore, the normal rise in
inflation or inflation fears that often characterises the second, third
and/or fourth years of an economic recovery need not materialise.'
While bond bears have read dire warnings into the recent sharp rise in the
price of gold - which historically has been a measure of inflation fears -
many analysts attribute this partly to special factors at work in the
precious metals market, including strong demand and worries about supply
constraints in the Asia-Pacific region.
Against this background, and with lingering doubts over the sustainability
of the economic recovery, a Fed tightening of monetary policy still seems
many months down the road, and the current 3 per cent target for Fed Funds
could even stay in place for the remainder of this year.
However, at the same time, inflation fears seem likely to stall the rally at
the long end of the market around its current trading range - particularly
given Wall Street's growing doubts about President Clinton's capacity to
push strong, deficit-cutting legislation through Congress.

FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Singapore Airlines slips 14.8%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA), consistently one of the world's most profitable
airlines, has finally succumbed to the effects of the recession in much of
the industrialised world.
For the year ended March, the airline saw pre-tax profits slide by 14.8 per
cent to SDollars 945m (USDollars 591m), compared with 1991-92. Turnover was
4.2 per cent higher at SDollars 5.65bn.
Lower tax provisions due to the availability of high capital allowances help
limit the damage lower down the profit and loss account, with net earnings
slipping 8.4 per cent to SDollars 850m.
SIA blamed recession in the industrialised world, intense competition and
the strong Singapore dollar. There were no aircraft disposal profits,
against SDollars 88m last time.
The airline, excluding cargo, engineering and other group subsidiaries, made
pre-tax profits of SDollars 794m - down 26.8 per cent - on revenues 2.4 per
cent higher at SDollars 5.135bn.
SIA said the transfer of the airline company's engineering activities to a
separate engineering subsidiary partially contributed to the fall in company
profits.
Last year, SIA increased its capacity by nearly 18 per cent. Four new
destinations - New York, Durban, Madrid and Hanoi - were added during the
year.
Passenger and cargo failed to keep pace with this increase in capacity. The
load factor dropped more than 2 per cent to 67.8 per cent, with the
passenger seat factor down 2.2 per cent and cargo down 1 per cent. The yield
 -the revenue earned per passenger or tonne of freight - dropped by more
than 10 per cent.
Analysts said that in spite of the fall in profits, SIA continued to
outperform most of the world's airlines. They pointed out that SIA's
performance improved slightly in the second half of 1992-93, and that the
airline was sitting on a comfortable cash cushion.

FT  17 MAY 93 / De Benedetti says Olivetti paid bribes to win contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CARLO De Benedetti, the head of Olivetti, the Italian electronics group,
last night voluntarily presented himself to Milan magistrates and is
understood to have provided a detailed account of how the group had been
obliged to pay bribes to politicians in Italy over the past decade.
The disclosure came after a new chief, Professor Romano Prodi, was named at
the weekend for IRI, the big state holding company, which has been caught in
the country's widening political and business scandals. He replaces Mr
Franco Nobili, who was arrested on Wednesday on charges of corruption.
The quick replacement of Mr Nobili bore the stamp of decisiveness of prime
minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, former governor of the Bank of Italy, who
last month was called in under crisis conditions to head the government.
Over the past week there has been increasing speculation that Olivetti would
be obliged to make a deal with Milan magistrates investigating instances of
business paying kickbacks to politicians - as Fiat had done last month.
However, Olivetti constantly denied any such deal was in the making.
Mr De Benedetti is understood to have said that his group had paid some
L10bn (Pounds 4m) to a politician 'collecting' on behalf of the ruling
parties. This was in connection with contracts with the ministry of posts
and telecommunications.
Olivetti is one of the most prestigious names in Italian business and Mr De
Benedetti's move - preceded by that of Fiat's chief executive Mr Cesari
Romiti - underlines the extent to which Italian companies are now being
caught up in the corruption scandal.
Milan magistrates had begun to focus on Olivetti in recent days following
the arrest of Mr Giuseppe Parrella, former chief executive of the state
telephone service company Asft.
This has led to a major new line of inquiry into kickbacks paid to obtain
telecommunications contracts believed to be in the order of L40bn in total.
Last week the chief executives of the Italian telecommunications
subsidiaries of Ericsson and GEC were arrested in connection with this
investigation and other foreign companies are expected to become involved
this week.

FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Siderca seeks control of Tamsa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIDERCA, the Argentine steel tube maker, is set to take effective control of
Tubos de Acero de Mexico (Tamsa), Mexico's only manufacturer of steel tubes.
This follows agreement by important Tamsa shareholders to set up a trust of
20m shares in which the Argentine company will have majority interest.
Tamsa's shareholders voted to let Siderca's international division buy
shares not taken up in a Dollars 75m Tamsa rights issue.
The two moves should enable Siderca to take operating control of Tamsa,
although the Mexican steel tube company will continue to maintain its
separate identity.
The deal underscores Siderca's ambitions to consolidate its share of the
international steel tube market.
Siderca recently reached agreement with Confab of Sao Paulo, Brazil to swap
30 per cent of each other's shares.
Siderca is Argentina's largest private exporter, with annual production of
seamless steel tubing of about 750,000 tonnes a year, most of which is
exported to more than 50 countries.
Tamsa, which had sales last year of 919m new pesos (Dollars 296m), has
suffered recently from strong international competition. It has also been
affected by the restructuring of Petoleos Mexicanos, its main client.
The Tamsa rights issue is 6-for-25 at Dollars 5.54 per share. Tamsa is
listed on the New York stock exchange.
Siderca will have the right to buy up those shares not subscribed to.
The issue had been opposed by the State of Wisconsin investment board, which
has a 7 per cent holding in Tamsa.
Alfa, the Mexican industrial conglomerate, is set to launch an initial
public offering of 15 per cent of the capital of its steel subsidiary
Hyslamex.
The offering is expected to raise Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m.

FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Spanish credits fuel Dollars 5bn
loan speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Spanish government-backed credits are being brought to the international
loans market, adding to speculation that the Kingdom is about to borrow up
to Dollars 5bn directly from international banks.
In a transaction expected to be announced this week, Ajesa, a company set up
as a refinancing vehicle for the Expo '92, is to seek the equivalent of
Pta70bn (Dollars 603m).
The loan will be denominated in another European currency, probably Ecu,
according to one of the banks leading the transaction. Last Thursday's
devaluation of the peseta has effectively decreased the size of the loan, in
Ecu terms, by 8 per cent.
Ajesa, which carries a guarantee from the Kingdom of Spain, has taken over
the assets and liabilities from the Expo in Seville. The spread on the
seven-year loan, of just 25 basis points over Libor, was described by one
banker as very aggressive. The loan is being led by Argentaria, ABN Amro and
Deutsche Bank.
The loan will look tightly priced when set against a DM300m (Dollars 188m),
five-year loan for RTVE, the Spanish state-owned television company, which
was launched on Friday by Chemical Bank. The margin on that facility, which
according to Chemical has been accorded a zero-weighting for capital
adequacy purposes by the Bank of England, is wider at 35 basis points.
Speculation continued last week that the Kingdom was planning a standby
credit facility, as a back-up for its commercial paper programme. However,
no terms are believed to have been agreed.
Repsol, the Spanish oil and chemicals group, reported a slight improvement
in first-quarter profits. Operating profits rose to Pta39.4bn from Pta34.4bn
in the opening three months of 1992. Net earnings totalled Pta23.6bn, up
from Pta21.4bn.

FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Alps Electric plunges to Y1.95bn

<TEXT>
ALPS Electric, which supplies parts to consumer and other electronics
manufacturers, saw pre-tax profits fall to Y1.95bn (Dollars 17.5m) for the
year to March 1993.
This compared with Y7.02bn in the previous year, and was due to the fall in
both corporate and consumer spending.
The company expected difficult conditions to continue and forecast that it
would only break even at the pre-tax level and fall into net loss in the
current year.
The decline came largely as a result of the weakness in the Japanese and
European markets, Alps said. In Japan, production in the electronics
industry fell by 12 per cent, according to industry estimates.
Alps' sales fell 14 per cent to Y292bn from Y339bn while net profits are
expected to fall 78 per cent to Y600m.
Sales of electronic parts to colour TV and VTR manufacturers were
particularly weak, falling 25 per cent, followed by a 21 per cent fall in
sales to audio manufacturers.
Sales to the information and telecommunications industries were depressed at
home but it was helped by increased sales to the US and saw overall sales
decline just 1.7 per cent.
Alps said that while the electronics industry's inventory adjustments had
been more or less completed, full-scale recovery was not likely in the near
future as consumer spending was still at a low level.
The pressures of the yen's appreciation were also expected to impact
negatively on this year's earnings.
The company is forecasting a 4 per cent decline in sales to Y280bn and a net
loss of Y1.5bn in the current year.
Taiyo Fishery, the large fishing company, forecast an increase in pre-tax
profits for the year to Y1bn against a Y1.8bn loss in the previous year.

FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Parmalat package to raise L427bn

<TEXT>
PARMALAT, the acquisitive Italian dairy products group, is raising L427bn
(Dollars 290m) through a rights issue to buy out the controlling Tanzi
family's minority stake in its main operating subsidiary and create funds
for growth.
The rights issue will be preceded by a share split which will reduce nominal
value to L1,000 and raise the number of ordinary shares to 712m. Parmalat
will then make a one-for-10 rights issue at L1,000 a share.
Shareholders taking up their rights will be offered two free warrants for
every six new shares subscribed. Each warrant will give holders the right to
buy one new ordinary share at L1,000 between 1997 and 1999.
About half the funds from the rights issue will be used to buy out the 22
per cent outstanding stake in the Parmalat operating company not held by
Parmalat Finanziaria, the stock market-listed holding company.
This stake is almost all held by members of the Tanzi family, which used to
be the group's sole owner.
Parmalat adopted a holding company structure in 1990, when it was
restructured in its present form.
The Tanzis gave up control of the parent company, but took a 51 per cent
stake in Parmalat Finanziaria through the family's Coloniale holding
company.
The pricing formula for the acquisition of their stake is complex. However,
the purchase will cost Parmalat Finanziaria an estimated L240bn. Meanwhile,
the Tanzis will subscribe to the rights issue, with Coloniale buying just
over 50 per cent of the shares on offer at a cost of L213.7bn.
The remaining funds from the rights issue will be used to finance expansion.
Parmalat has grown rapidly in recent years and this year expects sales to
rise to about L2,800bn from L1,636bn in 1992.
Although it has given no indication of imminent takeover targets, it is
known to be bidding for the milk and tinned vegetable interests of the
state-owned SME foods group currently being privatised.

<TEXT>
THAI Airways International reported a decline in second-quarter earnings to
Bt449.6m (Dollars 18m) from Bt521.1m in the same period a year earlier.
The results represent a substantial improvement on the first quarter, when
net profits tumbled to Bt120m from Bt792.2m.
Profits for the first six months were Bt568.4m compared with Bt1.31bn in
1992.
The company had predicted that a stronger performance from domestic services
and cost cutting would help patch up earnings in the second quarter.
The airline has been hit by increased costs, falling demand and fierce
competition. Gross revenues in the first quarter were little changed but
operating revenues dipped by almost 2 per cent.
Analysts in Bangkok said the airline was still likely to miss substantially
its forecast of profits of Bt6.1bn for this year as a whole.
Barclays De Zoete Wedd downgraded its earnings forecast for the full year to
Bt2.2bn from Bt4bn after the first-quarter results.
The airline included aircraft sales in its figures, which partly explained
the big swings in profits.

SWISS Bank Corporation will reorganise its North American operations and cut
200 jobs this year, AP-DJ reports from Zurich.
The bank said the objective was to create a powerful capital markets and
treasury and corporate finance franchise, complemented by a funds management
and private banking strategy.
While it was eliminating existing duplication, the bank said it expected a
'substantial potential for head-count expansion in the years to come'.
SBC has combined its former corporate and merchant banking units to form a
single North American merchant banking group. It is integrating its support
and staff functions to create single units across business lines wherever
possible.
It will concentrate its West Coast client coverage in its San Francisco
office and close its Houston office by the end of the third quarter.
The bank said the realignment was driven by its continued strategy to build
an integrated merchant and investment bank.
Areas most affected by the job reductions were merchant banking, support,
logistic and staff units, the bank said.
In the merchant banking group, SBC aims to strengthen its position in credit
portfolio management and 'to focus on obtaining advisory based mandates in
the US, Canada and Latin America.'

FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: AIOC acquires metals unit from
Axel Johnson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIOC CORPORATION, a privately-owned New York-based company, is being
catapulted into the ranks of the world's leading metals trading groups by
acquiring Axel Johnson's raw materials trading subsidiary from the Swedish
conglomerate.
Mr Alan Clingman, 33, chairman of AIOC and one of its main shareholders,
would not give details of the cost of the acquisition, but said both AIOC
and Axel Johnson Resources (AJR) had annual sales of more than Dollars 1bn.
The merger would make AIOC the biggest independent US-based physical metals
trading group, he said. It would give AIOC the chance to 'fill a void' in
its international operations because AJR would provide a strong business in
Europe.
Mr Clingman, who with his partner Mr Alexander Krasner has rapidly expanded
AIOC since taking over six years ago, said: 'It is a very logical fit for
us. They are strong where we are weak and vice versa.'
AIOC has substantial international operations which are strong in the
Commonwealth of Independent States and other parts of the former Soviet
Union, where it now has eight offices. The group handles the full range of
ferrous products from iron ore through speciality steel, including ores,
ferro alloys, speciality alloys, pig iron and steel in all its forms, as
well as aluminium and its raw materials, bauxite and alumina.
AJR will add copper to the list for the first time and substantially
increase AIOC's nickel business because the Swedish company has a contract
to import nickel, copper and cobalt to Europe from Norilsk in Russia, the
world's biggest nickel producer.
AIOC employs about 200 people and AJR about 100. Mr Dag Bjurstrom, AJR's
managing director, will join the AIOC board. Mr Clingman said there would be
opportunities to rationalise where both companies had offices in the same
city.

FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: R Dutch/Shell planning to
rationalise shipping side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL DUTCH/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, plans to rationalise its
shipping operations in an effort to cut costs and reduce exposure to
increasing environmental liabilities of the oil tanker trade.
Mr Ian McGrath, managing director of Shell International Marine, said the
company will reduce the number of large oil carriers currently held in its
four deep sea fleets from 42 to 30 by 1997.
At the same time it will merge its four fleets in the UK, the Netherlands,
Germany and France and its separate freight trading organisation into one
company based in London. The move will entail losing some jobs among Shell
Marine's 350 shore-based staff.
Mr McGrath said under 100 jobs will be cut in an effort to make savings in
the order of 'several millions of dollars.' Shell's marine operations
currently employ 2,600 people altogether and the plan was put to the
company's staff on Friday. Mr McGrath expects the new company to be formed
at the beginning of next year.
Shell had begun to examine its marine strategy in the wake of the Exxon
Valdez disaster in 1989, Mr McGrath said. In an effort to reduce its
exposure to the risks of liability for environmental damage, the company was
trying to carry as much of its own oil in its own ships as was economic. In
addition, it had stepped up its inspections of ships chartered.
Shell owns 2 per cent of the world's tanker fleet, but the company said it
will lease most of its carriers in future. Freight rates for tankers are
extremely low and the world's fleet is getting older. Mr McGrath said rates
need to rise before the tanker fleet will be renewed, but he said that 80
per cent of accidents were caused by human error.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BREAK FOR the Border Group, whose business is that of restaurateur, live
music venue and nightclub from two sites in the West End, is offering 4.81m
shares in a placing at 48p.
That values the whole of the company at Pounds 4.73m. A listing will be
sought and dealings are expected to start on Wednesday.
Fiske &amp; Co is organising the placing which will raise Pounds 1.67m for the
company. Of that Pounds 547,000 will repay shareholders' loans and Pounds
328,000 bank indebtedness; the balance will finance expansion and working
capital requirements.
Break for the Border cafes have been established as Western style saloon
bars and restaurants with live rock music. The food available is Tex-Mex, a
mixture of Texan and Mexican dishes.
The company's eventual goal is the operation of units using the Break for
the Border and Borderline theme in a number of principal cities across the
world.
Negotiations are in hand for an opening in New York, giving new musical acts
the chance to play in a top city venue where they can be seen by promoters
and record company executives, as well as the public.
In the year ended March 31 1993 turnover came to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4m) and
operating profit to Pounds 566,000 (Pounds 470,000, giving a margin up from
11.7 to 13.8 per cent. The pre-tax outcome worked through at Pounds 477,000
(Pounds 261,000).
The placing comprises the issue of 4.1m shares by the company and the sale
of 706,000 by existing shareholders.

FT  17 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Prospect of 25% payout for Payroll
creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF London's leading financial institutions stand to retrieve a quarter
of the Pounds 25.3m they lost last year when Payroll Services went into
liquidation, having failed to forward their clients tax and national
insurance contributions to the Inland Revenue.
The first instalment follows a novel agreement between 388 of the 390
creditor banks and agreed in the High Court.
Clifford Chance, the law firm, and Touche Ross, the joint liquidators,
believe they have established new precedent in the way that liquidations are
carried out.
Touche Ross estimates the voluntary agreement has saved up to three quarters
of a million pounds in professional and liquidation costs. The agreement
will give creditors a much earlier sight of their share of the claim than
would have been possible under a normal liquidation, which would usually
involve legal procedures against the insolvent company.
Lord Justice Parker, ruling on May 10, gave the two financial institutions
which have not supported the agreement 28 days in which to object.
The SFO is investigating Payroll Services and allegations of
misappropriation of client funds.
Payroll Services was supposed not only to pay its clients' employees - which
failure to do so would have led to early detection - it was also supposed to
forward PAYE and national insurance contributions to the Inland Revenue.
It is believed some of the missing money went into property investments.
The financial institutions leading the liquidation committee and among the
more significant creditors are;- Credit Agricole, Creditanstalt, Yamaiichi
Sakura Finance and Cantor Fitzgerald.
Touche Ross said it could not say at this stage how much of the balance of
the missing funds will be retrieved for creditors and when.

HEWLETT-PACKARD, the California-based electronics company, has agreed in
principle to buy BT&amp;D, a joint venture between BT and DuPont. Terms were not
disclosed, but sources suggested the price was in the low millions of
pounds.
BT&amp;D employs 455 people at its Ipswich facility and another 35 in the US and
Japan developing and making fibre optic components. It was founded in 1986
to exploit emerging markets for fibre optics in communications.
It is understood that BT and DuPont were prepared to sell the company as
part of BT's strategy of getting out of hardware manufacture.
Hewlett-Packard, on the other hand, is increasingly focusing on
communications as it gears up to become a supplier of 'information
superhighways' for companies networking their operations globally.

FT  17 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fund managers dropping US stocks in favour
of Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING UK institutional fund managers strongly prefer Japanese equities to
US stock, according to the May survey by Gallup for stockbrokers Smith New
Court.
Some 24 per cent of fund managers said they would increase their holdings in
Japanese equities compared with 1 per cent in the December survey.
A balance of 23 per cent claimed they would decrease holdings in US equities
against 16 per cent intending to raise holdings in December.
Mr Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New Court, said the Japanese
equity market was significantly outperforming the US.
'That disparity suggests there may be a belated shift by UK fund managers
toward Japanese equities and away from US equities.'
The survey also shows managers moving away from gilts with 14 per cent
intending to decrease holdings compared with 9 per cent in March. Smith New
Court said this was prompted by fears about UK inflation which they believe
are unfounded.
Managers are more optimistic about the 12-month outlook for UK equities than
any other main market; 79 per cent said they were bullish about the UK
equity market compared with 62 per cent in January.
The survey suggests confidence about the UK economy continues to increase
with 35 per cent of very optimistic, more than twice as many as the January
survey. They have improved their earnings forecasts for 1993 from 13.8 per
cent 14.7 per cent.
The managers expect inflation to pick up in 1993 and 1994, but by less than
was expected in the early surveys carried out after sterling's exit from the
ERM.
The survey was backed by 89 institutions, handling funds worth Pounds 629bn

FT  17 MAY 93 / Economics Notebook: Shifting private sector funds to more
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL markets tend to give to those who already have.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the relationship between providers of
capital and developing nations. One of the challenges facing economic policy
makers is to increase the flow of private investment capital to many
promising developing countries that are currently attracting too little.
The problem is of more than academic interest. Italy or Spain are only a few
hours fast boat ride from the southern shore of the Mediterranean while the
collapse of communism has made a western standard of living seem
tantalisingly close to many in former Iron Curtain countries. If countries
like Egypt, Morocco or some of the former communist countries of eastern
Europe are not helped to grow faster, the pressures of immigration into
economically mature western countries will exceed manageable bounds.
In fact, the revival of private sector flows to the developing world so far
this decade is one of the economic success stories of the 1990s.
World Bank studies estimate that net foreign direct investment in developing
countries rose to about Dollars 37bn (Pounds 24bn) in 1992, a 75 per cent
increase compared with 1990. Joint research by the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank suggests the flow of portfolio investments into
developing countries through bond issues in international markets or
international equity placements by developing country companies was Dollars
30bn in 1992 compared with less than Dollars 6bn a year between 1982 and
1988.
However, these funds have been very unevenly distributed. Four Latin
American countries - Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela - accounted for
more than half the recorded portfolio flows in 1991-92 with China, Hungary,
South Korea and Turkey accounting for much of the rest. A similar group of
countries, plus the Czech republic, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand has
attracted most of the foreign direct investment recently. In 1991 just 10
developing nations received more than 70 per cent of total foreign direct
investment.
Private investment is steering clear of sub-Saharan Africa, the poorer
countries of south Asia and many former communist countries in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.
It is no surprise that some countries find it difficult to attract foreign
investment. But there is a 'second tier' of countries, mainly in the middle
income category, that should offer good opportunities for private
investment. Some, like India, have made big efforts to strengthen their
overall economic performance and received scant private sector capital from
abroad.
It was with these countries in mind that the joint IMF-World Bank
Development Committee met in Washington earlier this month to see what, if
anything, could be done to spread private sector investment to more
countries.
The committee's regular half-yearly meetings, which bring together finance
and development ministers from the industrialised, developing and former
communist countries with IMF and World Bank officials, rarely attract much
notice. But this time, there was a attempt to stimulate debate by Mr Ricardo
Hausmann of Venezuela, the committee's new chairman. He had asked
governments and outside consultants to put forward ideas on action to
encourage private capital flows.
The result was a flood of detailed, mainly micro-economic suggestions,
highlighting many complex difficulties. There were 21 proposals for action
to be undertaken by developing countries, 23 suggestions directed at
industrialised countries and 18 addressed to international financial
institutions.
Many papers covered familiar ground, underlining, for example, that host
countries should provide political and macro-economic stability. Some
reflected a recognition that developing countries which remove barriers to
the outflow of capital stand a better chance of luring back flight capital
and attracting new private sector flows.
Detailed taxation issues emerged as a big problem, with investors worried
about future tax liabilities in developing countries. Regulatory systems in
the industrial countries were cited as placing barriers to private
investment in some countries. The World Bank was called upon to work with
developing countries to make their projects more understandable to rating
agencies such as Moody's.
The World Bank said it must give more thought to so-called 'second
generation' development measures to improve the environment in which
companies operate. These would build on 'first generation' policies aimed at
creating a stable macroeconomic framework and realistic prices.
Unfortunately, the discussion was summed up in a bland and unmemorable
communique. The committee concluded that the responsibility for improving
investment prospects mainly lies with the host country. But industrial
countries have much to do, not least through the lowering of trade barriers.
Indeed the gap in quality between the papers put before the Development
Committee and the published account of its deliberations raises the question
as to whether it should continue in its present form. The IMF's policy
making Interim Committee gives directions to the Fund and, through its
communiques, sometimes provides the IMF's member countries with an important
checklist of macroeconomic goals.
There is a good argument for the ministers using the Development Committee
to give more pointed guidance to the World Bank and its member countries.
International financial institutions (IFIs) such as the World Bank are
coming under increased scrutiny to determine whether they are providing a
useful service and value for money.
The Development Committee could play a bigger role in making the World
Bank's work more accountable and transparent for its members and the
taxpayers who fund the bank. But accountability must be part of a two-way
process in which the countries that own the IFIs give them clear directions.

FT  17 MAY 93 / SBC in scrip deal for BICC and Redland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Bank Corporation has reached an agreement with Barclays de Zoete Wedd
under which SBC will pay shareholders in BICC and Redland a higher cash
alternative for the enhanced scrip dividends announced by both companies.
BZW, which devised the scrip dividend scheme, had planned to buy shares from
investors at a 5 per cent discount.
SBC's offer is similar to one it made for the additional scrip dividends
issued by BAT, in which it offered to pay shareholders 2 per cent less than
the market price. The higher price offered for the shares increases the
likelihood that investors who opt for the scrip option - and 91 per cent of
BAT's shareholders have done so - will choose to sell their extra shares.
Some 21 per cent of BAT shareholders have sold their extra shares, compared
with 18 per cent of shareholders in the mining group RTZ, for which there
was no additional cash offer. RTZ announced its enhanced scrip dividend in
April.
SBC, which made its offer after the less attractive one from BZW had been
announced, has agreed to make some compensatory payments to its competitor
to cover marketing, promotion and printing costs. No compensatory payments
are to be made in the Redland or BICC deals.
In the case of BICC, SBC is offering to pay 19.47p per ordinary share
compared with the 18.87p offered by BZW. In the case of Redland, SBC is
offering 24.62p per share against the 23.87p offered by BZW.
So far, six UK corporations have issued enhanced scrip dividends, offering
shares worth 50 per cent more than the alternative cash dividend, to
minimise the amount of unrecoverable Advance Corporation Tax they must pay.
Scrip dividends do not incur tax charges and several issuers have saved
substantial amounts by making the offering.
Mr Brian Keelan, executive director of corporate finance at SBC, said the
offer followed an analysis of documents issued by BZW in connection with the
BAT deal. SBC concluded that the underwriters exposed themselves to three
days of market risk in their offer to repurchase the shares, and a discount
of 5 per cent was excessive. In typical rights offerings, underwriters
expose themselves to market risk for longer for a discount of 2 per cent.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Lloyd's acts to ensure a fresh supply of capital: A look at
the prospects of a new wave of investors for the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Hiscox, deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, waxes lyrical about
the prospects of a new wave of investors at the insurance market. 'The US
investment banks are beating a path to my door,' he says.
Lloyd's moved to revamp its capital structure last year. But the publication
last month of a business plan outlining the basic terms on which new
incorporated capital can participate, has unleashed frenetic activity among
the market's 100 or so insurance agencies.
While Mr Hiscox has been crossing the Atlantic with bewildering frequency,
other agents and brokers are working on plans ranging from the incorporation
of existing Names, to the establishment of ambitious new investment funds.
'People are running around on corporate capital all over the place,' says Mr
Cliff Hampton, of Phoenix Securities, a specialist securities house which is
also working on its own schemes.
Almost universally at Lloyd's, an influx of incorporated capital - which
would have limited liability - is seen as essential for halting the decline
in the market's capacity to compete in international commercial insurance
and reinsurance markets. The market's traditional capital supply -
individual Names trading on the basis of unlimited liability - is drying up
in the wake of losses of some Pounds 6bn in the past five years. Capital
supplied by Names is expected to fall to less than Pounds 8bn in 1994,
compared with Pounds 11.1bn in 1991.
Corporate capital could come from several sources:
Existing wealthy Names: can now form companies - with limited liability. To
do this though they would need assets of at least Pounds 1 1/2 m - compared
with the Pounds 250,000 required by existing Names. Existing less wealthy
Names: Members' agencies are also working on schemes which would allow Names
to form groups trading on a limited liability basis.
Insurance companies: Two Lloyd's agencies have set up 'consortium'
arrangements, in which the insurance company underwrites business alongside
the Lloyd's syndicate. Japanese insurance companies are understood to be
expressing tentative interest.
Venture capital: A number of investment banks - mainly from the US - are
looking to venture capitalists to back new funds, through private
placements. These would trade at the Lloyd's of London market as corporate
Names. They will be encouraged by the backing offered by private US
investors - such as Texas-based financier Mr Richard Rainwater and
Vermont-based Mr Jack Byrne - to a number of new Bermudan reinsurance
companies over the past year.
Institutions: A number of agents hope to establish funds, backed by
institutional investors or directly by individuals who would buy shares in
investment trusts sold on the retail market. 'It would be the nearest thing
to buying shares in Lloyd's,' says Mr Michael Wade, a broker who has teamed
up with Sedgwick Group, the Lloyd's agency and broker, to examine the
possibilities here. There are hopes that some of these new funds and new
companies could be listed on the New York or London stock exchanges, making
the investments more liquid and providing capital with an exit route.
US investment banks like JP Morgan and Salomon Brothers, and international
insurance brokers like Marsh McLennan and Johnson &amp; Higgins, are most active
in exploring these new ventures.
The banks believe that sharply increased insurance rates create attractive
opportunities for profit, while the brokers are keen to find new sources of
capacity to allow them to place clients' business more easily.
Morgan and Marsh have already teamed up a number of new Bermuda-based
ventures - including one which will supply reinsurance exclusively to
Lloyd's syndicates.
'We've taken a lot of interest in Lloyd's over the last six months,' said Mr
David Jarvis of Salomon Brothers.
'We have not made a final conclusion but we are looking at a number of
possibilities. The insurance market is going through a period of very
considerable change and all these things are very interesting to us.'
Matters should become clearer when Lloyd's publishes a rulebook in the
summer, providing more details on legal and accounting arrangements, as well
as on the regulatory and tax implications for incorporated Names. Lloyd's
plans to control the amount of capital which comes into the market to avoid
the growth of capacity, which led to disastrous rate competition in the late
1980s. This will possibly be achieved through a a bidding system, although
the rules as to how this will work have still to be spelled out.
Some agents fear that the new rules will be too late to allow any corporate
Name to participate in 1994.
Lloyd's must surmount a number of obstacles if its plans are to be
successful. It still has to convince the markets that billions of dollars of
old liabilities from US asbestosis and pollution claims can be isolated in a
new reinsurance company, whose formation is a centrepiece of the new
business plan. Many investors will also want to see evidence that a
settlement of the litigation dogging the market is on the horizon before
they commit themselves.
Moreover, many agents and syndicates may still have ground to make up before
they can meet the much tougher standards of professionalism and disclosure
that corporate investors will demand.
'Attracting corporate capital is not like falling off a log,' says one
senior industry analyst in London. 'The businesses at Lloyd's will have to
develop presentations that have real arithmetic substance. It won't be
enough simply to say we think we can make 50 per cent underwriting margins.'
Mr Hiscox admits it will be hard work. 'There are a lot of horses out there
and a lot of water to drink. But there is also a lot of barbed wire in
between.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LENDERS to Olympia &amp; York's US properties are becoming increasingly
assertive in backing efforts by the developer's US subsidiary to distance
itself from its crippled Canadian parent.
Citibank applied to a New York court late on Friday for an order giving
special powers to Mr John Zuccotti, president of the US subsidiary. The
extra powers would enable Mr Zuccotti, a former deputy mayor of New York, to
complete transactions relating to O&amp;Y's US buildings without the assent of
the administrator of Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York Developments (OYDL).
The application reflects tensions which have been building since O&amp;Y filed
for bankruptcy protection for its Canadian and UK operations a year ago. The
80 per cent-owned US unit, whose properties include the World Financial
Centre in lower Manhattan, has remained afloat while Mr Zuccotti attempts to
stitch together a restructuring.
Citibank and Sanwa Bank, which are among the largest US creditors, dropped
legal action against O&amp;Y last March after the Canadian creditors agreed to
name a board with a majority of directors who have no financial stake in the
outcome of debt-restructuring negotiations.
Among the transactions Mr Zuccotti is anxious to complete are an agreement
to defer payment of New York taxes and a plan to transfer control of a
building at 60 Broad Street to Mr Li Ka Shing, the Hong Kong magnate.

FT  17 MAY 93 / DTB suspends three traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE second revelation of trading manipulation on a European futures exchange
in less than a month has shaken futures traders and their clients.
The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German futures and options exchange,
announced late on Friday that it had uncovered trading 'irregularities'
which could lead to criminal charges.
Three weeks ago, BZW Futures, the futures broking arm of Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, suspended four of its floor traders pending disciplinary hearings by
the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe).
The DTB has suspended three traders. It is believed that at least one member
firm and one firm outside the exchange are involved in the irregularities.
A DTB spokesman declined to reveal the nature of the irregularities, or the
contracts involved, saying that he 'wants to keep the black sheep insecure'
while the investigation, which began two months ago, is pursued.
The DTB went public on the investigation after one of the suspended traders
admitted his involvement, according to sources close to the affair.
While the alleged rule violations on Liffe involved profits on improper
trades of only around Pounds 5,000 and would not form the basis of any
criminal charges, the DTB spokesman suggested that the irregularities
detected on the DTB could be on a large scale. 'The black sheep have tried
to cover the manipulation in a professional way,' he said. He added that, to
the exchange's knowledge, there had been no damage to clients.
Although dubious practices in the futures markets have become less common,
such cases do not help improve the image of the futures business, which is
still seeking to recover from a case of illegal trading in the US which
culminated in a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in 1989. Indictments were brought against 48 traders,
alleged to have illegally benefited from trades done on their personal
accounts. As a result, 46 have been convicted at trial or through plea
agreements.
DTB rules have legal force and the exchange can pursue the traders involved
through the prosecutor's office.

THE German government will be forced to negotiate a second solidarity pact,
designed to finance the cost of subsidies for east Germany, with employers
and unions in the coming months. It will for the first time involve
substantial cuts in social spending, because of a drastic shortfall in its
expected tax revenues, according to senior officials.
The grim prospect of new budget cuts in the current year, followed by tough
curbs on spending for at least three more years, has been prompted by the
forecast of a tax shortfall of DM104.5bn (Pounds 42.4bn) for the public
sector up to 1996.
The longer-term fear of government advisers is that the recession-induced
central government budget deficit, expected to reach DM70bn this year and at
least as much in 1994, might become a structural deficit from 1995, in spite
of economic recovery.
The revenue estimate comes just two months after the first solidarity pact
was painfully negotiated between the government coalition, the opposition
Social Democrats and the 16 federal states, as well as employers and trade
unions.
Now the government must persuade the opposition and trade unions that social
welfare programmes, exempted from cuts in the first round, as part of the
compromise, will have to be included in a solidarity pact mark two.
'The first solidarity pact cut expenses too little and raised taxes too
much,' according to one top government adviser. 'This has to be
reconsidered. It is not possible to find a solution only through tax rises
and higher budget deficits.'
The new tax revenue estimates produced by a working group of finance
ministry officials, Bundesbank experts and outside advisers suggest a
shortfall of DM5.3bn this year, DM25.8bn in 1994, DM32.7bn in 1995 and
DM40.7bn in 1996.
Actual tax revenues for 1992 are put at DM732bn, estimated to rise by a
nominal 2.2 per cent to DM748bn this year, and by 5.1 per cent to DM786bn in
1994.
One factor behind the shortfall is sharply rising unemployment, which
reduces disposable incomes and tax revenues while increasing the burden on
social welfare programmes.
Finance ministry officials expect the economy to contract by 2 per cent this
year compared with initial forecasts of a 1.5 per cent fall, while they fear
unemployment will rise by 500,000 to 3.5m in 1993, and by a further 200,000
to 300,000 in 1994, in spite of gradual economic recovery.
The concern in government ministries is that in spite of the urgent need to
make further cuts in government spending, current upheavals in the main
political parties mean that no action will be taken for several months.

FT  17 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Shell/BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The marked divergence between investors' attitudes to Royal Dutch/Shell and
BP must leave the Anglo-Dutch giant feeling a little aggrieved. BP has
slashed its dividend, cut capital expenditure and still has over 90 per cent
gearing. It has also rallied to within an ace of the ill-fated 1987 rights
issue price and yields only 3.25 per cent. Shell is expanding, has 3 per
cent gearing yet languishes on 4.5 per cent yield.
US buyers have sucked BP's shares out of the UK for its lower cash flow
rating. UK fund managers may now be tempted to chase the performance they
have missed in BP's rally. There is also concern that the normally smooth
Shell machine has fumbled the ball at Showa Shell in Japan. BP's dividend
cover may approach two times by this year end, though any increase will
probably have to wait until the end of next year. And there is still the
threat of a rights issue in 1995-96.
Shell's dividend cover is low, though it will build to over 1.5 times in
1994 as the world economy recovers. Even if conditions remain poor, Shell's
rock-solid balance sheet means there is no threat of a dividend cut. Its
first-quarter figures also suggest that the haemorrhaging in the chemicals
business may be slowing. That reflects the upturn in the US and capacity
cuts in Europe. Signs that Shell was moving aggressively on cost cutting
might draw attention back to the huge yield gap between the two companies.

FT  17 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Something is certainly making a difference to Lonrho. Last week's rush of
buying took its shares above the 115p price paid by Mr Dieter Bock for the
stake he bought from Mr Tiny Rowland. There are three reasons for this
change of sentiment. Metals prices, especially gold, are stronger; Gencor's
restructuring has revived hopes of it buying a chunk of Lonrho's 73 per cent
stake in Western Platinum; the decision to sell the Observer shows Mr Bock
is exerting a strong and positive influence.
All these factors, though, are flawed as the basis for a sustained recovery
in Lonrho's price. While gold is currently firm, the price of rhodium, on
which Lonrho arguably depends more heavily, remains depressed. Gencor's
primary focus is on Shell's mining assets. It seems in no hurry to increase
its Western Platinum stake.
As for the Bock factor, the case is not yet proven. Since his arrival Lonrho
has moved quickly to sell German real estate as well as the Observer. But
even allowing for these disposals, gearing is probably still close to 60 per
cent once minorities are excluded. That is not a comfortable starting point
for expansion. The time to judge Mr Bock will be when he has revealed what
he is going to do with the company and how it will be financed.

FT  17 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With equities drifting sideways and the gilts market in danger of flooding,
fund managers are looking for alternative investments. Such is their dilemma
that some even seem prepared to curb their historical aversion to bricks and
mortar. Property has been widely viewed as a lumpy illiquid class of asset
with a hopeless investment history. But with yields in excess of 9 per cent
currently making acquisitions self-financing, property looks enticing.
German investors have spotted the opportunity, buying Pounds 687m of UK
property last year. Recovery prospects and a gut feel that the bottom of the
market must soon be reached may tempt their UK counterparts to follow.
Investors, though, want secure retail and industrial sites or high yielding
long-lease modern office buildings occupied by blue-chip tenants. The
trouble is such properties are scarce; few owners want to sell them. Prices
at the top of the market may therefore rebound sharply. The weight of money
will then lower yields on prime space stimulating interest in secondary
markets. With a strengthening economy and falling unemployment, investors
will eventually look to buy for growth rather than yield. Cheaper
second-tier assets will then become even more attractive.
The theory is fine; the market's practical complexities, though, may still
deter. A more flexible means of gaining exposure is buying shares of quoted
property companies. But prices have already rallied and few companies seem
capable of increasing dividends quickly. Those that are, such as Land
Securities, are already trading at a premium to net assets. That, though,
may simply prove another prompt to buy the real thing.

FT  17 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: The cost of clean water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week Anglian drinkers apparently voted to pay more for better quality
water out of the tap. Such an improbable result probably owes something to
concern about the level of agricultural nitrates sluicing through local
rivers. Similar consultation exercises by other water companies have shown
more scepticism from consumers about the costs of environmental
improvements. The companies have used this market research as a sighting
shot for the 1994 review of water charges.
Those shots - some aiming for 15 per cent real price rises - are certainly
too high. Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, may think that real
increases much above 2 per cent are excessive. Capital programmes are thus
unlikely to be the gold-plated versions which are at the optimistic end of
the water companies' suggestions. Post-1995 price caps will vary with each
company's need for capital expenditure. Those with looser caps like Anglian
will see turnover grow and, if costs are controlled, profits will also rise.
But the higher capital expenditure will also push up interest costs
substantially. Anglian estimates that on its central assumptions gearing
will peak at 80 per cent in 1998, with interest cover down to three times.
It also has dividend cover of 2.7 times earnings against the sector average
of 3.2 times.
At the other end of the rainbow Welsh Water may well have its price rises
limited to the rate of inflation. That implies low turnover growth, but
interest charges will be correspondingly modest and dividend cover is 4.4
times. The other problem for the high-spending companies is that Mr Byatt
may be concerned about the divergence in bills between different areas of
the country. Increasing pressure on capital intensive companies make rights
issues for the most stretched a distinct cloud on the horizon.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Serb mayor confident in Bosnian town where mosques are
rubble: Voters go to polls in referendum on peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRANKO GRUJIC, the Serb mayor of Zvornik, just laughed. He had been asked
about the mosques in this once Moslem-dominated eastern Bosnian town on the
frontier with Serbia.
The mosques are rubble now, reduced to nothing by the Serb forces that
seized the town 13 months ago when Mr Grujic re-placed his Moslem
predecessor. There is no need for any trace of that Moslem heritage in
Zvornik today.
Most of the Moslems have fled Zvornik. It was one of the first towns to fall
to Serb forces who last spring expelled hundreds of thousands of Moslems
from eastern Bosnia, killing tens of thousands more in the process. Mayor
Grujic called it a 'normal population exchange'.
At polling station number two not far from from Mayor Grujic's office, a
Serb fighter in camouflage cast his No vote in the Bosnian Serbs'
'referendum' on the international peace plan: 'We will fight to the last
Serb.'
A wizened old man deposited three voting slips - one for himself, the others
for members of his family. Weary refugees who showed identity cards were
added to the lists. Voter registration was always going to be a last-minute
affair in this hastily convened referendum.
Mayor Grujic had no doubts that Bosnia's Serbs would vote against the
Vance-Owen plan. After all, it would force them to give back nearly half the
territory seized since the war began, including his town.
The plan, he said, and threats of military intervention were evidence of a
world conspiracy against the Serbs. 'We know the plan was copied from a
secret Vatican document.'
It proposes to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines. If
implemented it would put an end to Greater Serbia by cutting off links
between Belgrade and Serb-held territories in Bosnia and Croatia.
'We are ready to be hungry, thirsty, and naked, but at the end of the war we
will have our Srpska Republika,' said Mayor Grujic. Srpska Republika is the
self-styled Serb state which covers about two-thirds of Bosnia.
A second question in the referendum asks voters whether they are 'for' or
'against' an independent state with the right to unite with other peoples
and states. There should be little difficulty getting a Yes vote for that
one.
Two teenage Serb refugees on their way to Janja, a mostly Moslem village 30
miles north of Zvornik, stopped off to vote. They accused Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic of betraying Bosnian Serbs by supporting the peace plan.
The voting lists in the local fire station revealed some Moslem voters had
cast ballots. An official said everyone was being allowed to vote,
regardless of nationality.
But Munir, a Moslem, nervously admitted he did not vote. 'They did not tell
us to,' he said.
In nearby Bijelina, most voters were opposed to the plan even though it
designates that rich north-eastern town to be a Serbian province. Mr Pero
Simic, a local journalist, said voters were divided because of appeals by
their Belgrade patrons to back the plan.
'We share more with Belgrade than with our brothers in Banja Luka,' he said.
Banja Luka is the bastion of Serb radicalism in north-western Bosnia.
The only 'yes' voter encountered anywhere by this correspondent was a Moslem
woman. 'We all want the war to end. I am voting for peace.' she said and
hurried away.

FT  17 MAY 93 / BT unveils plans to sell BSkyB satellite TV dishes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom plans to make its first move into the fast-growing home
entertainment market later this year, by selling dishes to receive BSkyB
broadcasts from the Astra television satellite.
Entertainment is potentially the biggest avenue of diversification for BT,
under increasing pressure from competitors such as cable TV companies, in
its traditional telephone and business communication markets. However, the
terms of its licence bar BT from providing entertainment channels on its
network.
BT is in the final stages of negotiation with two electronics companies to
manufacture satellite dishes and associated equipment in the UK. They will
go on sale in BT's shops and 'selected high street outlets' this autumn.
The move will throw BT's marketing muscle behind BSkyB, in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. BT and BSkyB are
believed to be discussing a deal that would give each access to the other's
customers.
The move would also provide powerful new competition for Amstrad, Mr Alan
Sugar's company, which so far has been the largest UK supplier of satellite
dishes and receivers. BT is unlikely to undercut Amstrad's prices
significantly but it is expected to compete on what it believes is a
superior record for product and service reliability.
According to the FT Satellite Monitor about 3.2m homes in the UK can now
receive satellite TV - at least 2m through their own dish and the remainder
by cable or community aerial.
UK sales of dishes and associated equipment are worth about Pounds 120m a
year, not a large target for a company of BT's size. But BT wants to use it
as a way into the huge new market emerging through the three-way
'convergence' of entertainment, telecommunications and computing.
Other signs of BT's ambitions are its home videophone, launched last month,
and recent agreements with US and European electronics companies to develop
personal computers with 'multimedia' facilities.
The experience gained from selling and servicing satellite dishes and any
associated marketing agreement with BSkyB would be useful preparation for
the time when BT is permitted to use its fast-expanding fibre optic network
for television.
Recent discoveries in optical electronics make it possible to send millions
of telephone calls down a single glass strand as a thin as a hair. As a
result, the network is likely to have a vast excess capacity  - and some BT
executives would like to use it for new forms of entertainment.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Observer: Spanish U-turn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, introduces Jose
Maria Aznar, leader of Spain's centre right Partido Popular, at London's
Queen Elizabeth II conference centre this morning, even hard-headed fund
managers may spot the poignancy of the occasion.
Portillo's father, Luis Gabriel, a mild-mannered law professor at Salamanca
University, had to flee Spain when the Republican government he supported
was crushed by General Franco's uprising. Aznar's grandfather, Manuel, who
made his name as a first world war correspondent, wrote the official
Francoist account of the 1936-39 fratricidal struggle.
A refugee in London, Portillo senior, penned elegant and nostalgic sonnets
about his lost homeland and worked as a translator for Reuters and the BBC.
Manuel Aznar went on to be chairman of Spain's state-owned news agency EFE
after serving as Spanish ambassador to the UN.
Grandson Jose Maria is being wined and dined in London by James Capel, the
securities house, which appears to have placed a firm bet on Spain's
neck-and-neck elections. With Spain's centre-right promising a sweeping
privatisation programme, such hospitality could be a sound investment.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Observer: Clingman's coup
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even in the fast-moving world of the international trader, Alan Clingman,
33, has come a long way in a short time. Having started broking oil in his
native South Africa, Clingman did not move to New York until 1987, and it
was not until a year later that he and his partner, Alexander Krasner,
reversed their operations into AIOC.
Over the last year Clingman's name has been associated with ventures ranging
from financing a South African vanadium mine to setting up a joint venture
bank in the Ukraine.
Now he appears to have been offerred one of those one-in-a-lifetime
opportunities to break into the cliquey European metals business - by Axel
Johnson, the Swedish conglomerate, which is selling its 127-year-old metals
trading subsidiary to AIOC.
Clingman's insistence that Axel Johnson was more interested in securing a
good home for its metal trading business, rather than the highest price,
sounds like self-serving marketing hype. Even so the deal more than doubles
AIOC's size, and while Clingman is still not in Marc Rich's league, clearly
he is a man to watch, especially if he can continue to grow his private
empire rapidly without tripping up.

It helps if aspiring Tory grandees can win at the ballot box, but it is not
a prerequisite. Take Sir Michael Hirst, a 47-year-old accountant, who is
taking over from Lord Sanderson of Bowden as chairman of the Scottish
Conservative party.
Hirst was elected in 1983 as MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden on the
prosperous outskirts of Glasgow. But a ministerial career was denied him
when he lost his seat in the 1987 massacre of the Scottish Tories. However,
he was rewarded with the vice-chair-manship of the Scottish party, and in
1989 he was elected president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist
Association, one of the two wings of the party in Scotland. Last year he
failed to get back into parliament but did manage to pick up his knighthood.
Hirst, a former partner in Glasgow with KPMG Peat Marwick, has a soothing
manner on television. But he doesn't have the same sort of business clout as
Lord Sanderson, a shrewd political organiser who is given much of the credit
for the Tories' recent revival in Scotland.

What's the betting that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will appoint a
woman to replace its outgoing chairman, Gerald Corrigan, who departs in
August?
In normal times, the front-runners would all be men, people like William
McDonough, Corrigan's number two, David Mullins, the respected vice-chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington DC, or regional Fed presidents
like Richard Syron of Boston and Gary Stern of Minneapolis.
These are not normal times, however, and the rumour mill suggests that the
New York Fed may choose to shake things up a bit by picking Karen Horn, 49,
the former president of the Cleveland Fed and current chairman of Bank One
in Cleveland. Horn, who sits on the boards of BP, Eli Lilly and TRW, has
experience of both public and commercial banking. She also won plaudits for
resolving the Ohio savings and loan crisis when at the Cleveland Fed.
She faces tough competition in McDonough and Mullins. The former was once
vice-chairman of First Chicago, has advised the World Bank, and in his
present position is responsible for the Fed's activities in the bond market
and its implementation of monetary policy. As for Mullins, he is believed to
be closest to Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan, which should
count for something. He is also a native of Arkansas, President Clinton's
home state - which may, or may not, help.
However, Horn has a couple of things going for her. Consuela Washington's
failure to get the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission
means that the Clinton administration is under even greater pressure to give
a top job in the financial sector to a woman. It's also worth noting that
the New York Fed's search committee is, for the first time, headed by a
woman - Barnard College president Ellen Futter.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Saving the whale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Whaling Commission was right not to lift its moratorium on
commercial whaling at its 45th annual meeting in Kyoto last week. But the
way in which it came to that verdict did itself - and the whales - few
favours.
The IWC was set up after the second world war to protect whale numbers,
which were plummeting after decades of slaughter. There were 250,000 huge
blue whales early this century but only several hundred by the 1970s. The
number of humpbacks, right whales and sei whales has also fallen sharply.
But the IWC also recognised a responsibility to the whaling nations and in
the 1980s set itself the task of working out how many minke whales - the
smallest and most plentiful kind - could be caught without endangering the
species.
It has, however, increasingly departed from that second responsibility as
more anti-whaling nations have joined. At Kyoto, environmentalists stalled
scientific debate on how to calculate sustainable quotas; the UK switched
its main objections to commercial whaling from concern about sustainability
to the cruelty of the killing; and the US said for the first time that it
was opposed to any whaling at all.
The debate thus gave support to the claims of Japan, Norway and Iceland, the
three main whaling nations, that IWC concern about saving the whale has been
replaced by the romantic 'green' desire to save every single whale. The
result of the anti-whalers' filibustering is a short-term victory, but it
may prove counterproductive for protecting whales.
In protest, Norway has said that it will restart commercial whaling and is
expected to announce quotas this week of up to 800 minke whales. Japan has
separately hinted that it may leave the IWC.
Despite their frustration, both countries have acted prematurely. IWC
scientists still have legitimate misgivings about how many whales can
'sustainably' be caught. They now believe, after years of research, that
they have reliable estimates of minke whale numbers: about 87,000 in the
Barents sea north of Norway, and some 760,000 in the southern oceans. But
many feel the IWC still needs more research on breeding rates and the
different geographical distributions of males, females and young whales
before setting quotas.
There is good reason too for non-whaling IWC members to mistrust the ability
or willingness of whaling countries to observe quotas once commercial
whaling starts again. Much of the collapse in the numbers of the great
whales occured after the IWC's creation, and IWC members have not yet agreed
an adequate system of policing.
The IWC is currently the only forum for settling these issues. If it is to
regain credibility and save whales, its non-whaling members need to address
openly the question of its role and accept the principle of sustainable
whaling.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Personal View: The brave way to banish inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEINER FLASSBECK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices in Russia are currently rising at an annual rate of more than 1,000
per cent. Such hyperinflation is destroying the monetary system, which has
just begun to operate on market principles. Indeed, it also dashes hopes of
reaping all the other benefits of the market economy. No one is willing to
invest, domestic trade has degenerated to mere barter, and the country finds
itself unable to exploit the advantages of international specialisation.
Time horizons have shrunk to days if not hours.
All are agreed that the hyperinflation must be stopped - but 'at all costs',
in the words of Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International
Monetary Fund? Is there only one way to bring inflation under control, and
must it be pursued even if it runs counter to the goal of establishing a
functioning market economy?
Money must be scarce, say the economics textbooks; the IMF's recommendation
is for a 'strong, restrictive, market-oriented monetary policy'. But what
does the scarcity of money mean, when the aim is not to finance the creation
of an effective, western-style market economy, but rather to curb a
hyperinflation which has become entrenched in both the actions and
expectations of the entire population.
Two hundred years of monetary macroeconomics have taught us that the success
of restrictive monetary policies, and the price which must be paid for that
success, depend on the flexibility of prices. This flexibility is, in turn,
heavily contingent on wage flexibility: if wages react quickly to a rise in
unemployment, the price which must be paid for a restrictive monetary policy
is low, and vice versa.
The reality of western market economies is that prices are highly
inflexible. Contemporary experience shows that even in the country which has
been shown to have the most flexible wages in the world, West Germany, it
has taken three years to push the inflation rate down from 4 per cent to 2
per cent; and even this has been at the cost of a deep recession and a sharp
rise in unemployment. How long will it take to free Russia from inflation in
excess of 1,000 per cent, and what will be the cost? During the entire
transition period the scarcity of money will prevent the market economy from
performing its most important function - to induce investment and
entrepreneurial activity. Even in western countries investment declines in
such phases. It is both absurd and irresponsible for the west to recommend a
cure for the struggling east European countries which would certainly be the
death of far healthier patients.
The great majority of western economists seem unable or unwilling to
understand that restrictive monetary policy can only ever be the exception
to the rule of a relatively expansionary monetary policy coupled with
moderate wage growth. Even in the west, a scarce-money policy can never be
the leitmotif of economic policy in the longer term, without threatening the
market economy itself. Those western countries which have enjoyed greatest
success have been able to maintain expansionary monetary policies and low
interest rates over long periods because trade unions have refrained from
making income distribution a matter for day-to-day bargaining.
In Russia, restrictive monetary policies would merely serve to complete the
destruction begun by runaway inflation.
There is only one way to banish hyperinflation without doing irreversible
damage: Russia must gather its political strength in order to break
inflationary expectations at a stroke. This will require a reform of the
currency. Of course, it is clear that currency reform itself - the mere
exchange of bank notes - will not solve the underlying problems. Currency
reform can, however, be the cornerstone of a successful approach where it is
embedded in a far-reaching reform of economic policy, one which effectively
stabilises prices and wages, preventing new inflationary expectations
arising.
This, of course, is conditional on at least a minimal social consensus - and
on scarce money. But it is not until price stability can be entrusted more
to social consensus than to the scarcity of money that Russia will fulfil a
necessary condition for the creation of a successful market economy. Even if
this path is taken, the chances of success appear far from rosy. Restrictive
monetary policies, however, in an attempt to impose social discipline
through rising unemployment and to break inflationary expectations step by
step, offer no hope whatsoever given the conditions prevailing in Russia.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Swan song
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPOINTMENT of receivers at Swan Hunter is not only a cruel blow to the
warship builder's 2,200 workforce. The downfall of such a proud company and,
despite last night's announcement of short-term arrangements for work on
three frigates to continue, the probable end of shipbuilding on Tyneside is
a sad event in the annals of British industry.
Swan's demise was unavoidable. The unpalatable truth is that Britain has too
many naval shipyards chasing too few orders. There is not enough Royal Navy
business to keep VSEL, Yarrow, Vosper Thornycroft and Swan Hunter working.
For some time, Swan has looked the weakest.
What was true before the end of the Cold War - although somewhat masked by
the flood of orders after the Falklands conflict - is doubly so since its
passing. The UK no longer needs a vast warship industry.
It is theoretically possible that these shipyards could have found more
orders overseas or diversified into commercial shipbuilding. But in what are
anyway extremely competitive markets - there is excess capacity throughout
the world - the British have done poorly, as the industry was nationalised
and denationalised within the space of two decades.
While government thus bears some responsibility for Swan's plight, it was
right not to ply the company with subsidies or waive commercial
considerations in the award of contracts as some suggest. The Ministry of
Defence had no option but to choose a Pounds 160m tender for a helicopter
carrier from VSEL over a bid from Swan said to have been Pounds 50m higher.
The government's error was not to have faced up to reality earlier.
Its failure to do so results from allowing political considerations to
influence the handing out of contracts. Fearful of the fall-out if a yard
closed, it has in the past often divided work up so that all get a share.
This policy has been reinforced by the mistaken belief that keeping all the
yards in work and playing one off against the other would provide greater
value for money. The result is that margins have been pared to a bare
minimum, while the industry has lost out on any economies of scale available
from concentrating production in fewer yards.
Such a policy has not only prolonged the agony of a necessary slimming down
of the industry, but may in the process have enfeebled the whole industry
financially. Moreover, the industry's excess dependence on meeting the Royal
Navy's exacting specifications may have counted against its chances of
succeeding in export markets, where demand is for the cheaper, less
sophisticated warships which the Germans and others have been better at
supplying.
May-have-beens, though, will be little comfort to Swan's workers who now
face the probable loss of their jobs. The least the government can now do is
to support a determined effort to help them find new ones.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Mood swing in the public sector: A look at the pressures
behind increased union militancy and the prospects for industrial action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A summer of sporadic discontent threatens Britain's public services after
firefighters voted last week to organise strike ballots in defence of jobs
and pay, and the teachers' unions united in opposition to the government's
national curriculum tests.
But they are not the only groups among the 5.8m public-sector workers whose
mood has gone from submissive to combative in the past few weeks.
Several civil service unions appear to be edging towards a one-day stoppage
in protest at the government's plans for commercial market testing, under
which their members must compete for their jobs with private-sector workers.
On May 26, ambulance workers and nurses are expected to join firefighters in
a demonstration in London against what they see as a deterioration in the
quality of public services because of government imposed financial
constraints. Local council unions are considering taking industrial action
after refusing last week to accept a final 1.5 per cent wage rise for their
500,000 members in line with the government's 12-month public sector pay
limit policy introduced last November.
Yet only a few weeks ago union leaders doubted whether a mounting sense of
disquiet in the public sector would lead to industrial trouble. While saying
publicly that the government's 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit was
inadequate they were in no mood to launch an offensive.
It is not difficult to understand why. Last year Britain experienced the
lowest number of working days lost through strikes since records began 100
years ago. The prolonged recession has meant public-sector workers were more
concerned about security than about fighting for higher wages or better
conditions and did not want to put their jobs at risk by going on strike.
'The feeling was that the government's 1.5 per cent public sector wage limit
meant a strong trade-off between pay and jobs,' says Professor Philip
Beaumont, an expert on the public sector at Glasgow University. 'Ministers
were saying to public-sector workers, 'you can have more than 1.5 per cent
but at a direct cost in fewer jobs'. It was that fear to their job security
that suggested most public-sector workers would keep their heads down.'
However, recent political setbacks - notably the Tory disasters in the
Newbury by-election and the county council elections in England and Wales
two weeks ago - have weakened the government.
Some public sector union leaders now believe that if they adopt a more
confrontational strategy, ministers will back away from rigidly imposing the
1.5 per cent pay limit or slow down plans to contract out public services to
the private sector.
Several public sector union leaders have been surprised by the depths of
hostility now on display among some of their members, particularly to
government policies on privatisation and market testing. Unions which feel
most aggrieved include the Civil and Public Services Association, which
covers clerical staff, and the Inland Revenue Staff Federation.
But while such unions are restive, they have little industrial muscle with
which to force the government to back down. Other public sector unions are
in a stronger position to exert pressure because they have the ability to
disrupt basic services. Because of this distinction, Mr Chris Trinder, of
the independent Public Finance Foundation, points out a 'two-tier pay
system' has evolved in the public sector. Weaker groups, such as local
government manual workers, have been unable to secure the kinds of special
pay deals covering members of some more powerful unions.
For instance, some public sector groups enjoy guaranteed pay formulas linked
to the private sector, such as firefighters and the police. Doctors,
dentists and the armed services enjoy the benefit of pay review bodies which
recommend salary increases based on comparable private sector wages.
Under the 1.5 per cent public pay limit such arrangements have been
suspended for at least 12 months from last November. But the government is
going to find it hard to hold the line in the next wage round if it tries to
reform them or scrap them altogether.
The angry mood among delegates at last week's Fire Brigades Union conference
suggests that some among the top tier of the public sector are preparing for
conflict. The unanimous decision of the conference to authorise strike
ballots in defence of a 14-year-old wage formula that links firefighters'
pay to the increases enjoyed by the top 25 per cent of male manual workers
and against any proposal for compulsory redundancies reflects a
disillusioned and determined mood.
Another of the privileged public service groups that could pose problems for
the government is the police. Like the firefighters, they have benefited
from a remarkably generous pay formula over the past 15 years. The inquiry
by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, into police pay is due to
report next month and this could well propose ending the formula.
The Police Federation, the police union, which starts its annual conference
today, is not likely to give up the pay formula without a fight even if it
is prepared to accept a 1.5 per cent pay rise this year. With the battle
against crime one of the government's priorities, ministers may want to
avoid any conflict over pay with the police, and may thus be inclined to
back down from abolishing the formula.
Such expensive pay deals are just one aspect of public sector industrial
relations that ministers would like to see changed in a radical reform of
pay structure. They would also like to scrap centralised collective
agreements which provide uniform pay levels across the public sector in
favour of linking pay rises more directly to productivity improvements.
It is a view shared by the Confederation of British Industry, which is
preparing proposals that will call for an end to rigid overall pay limits
like the current 1.5 per cent and replace them it with a system that makes
all wage rises for public-sector workers conditional on achieving stringent
performance targets.
Over the past eight years, the Tories have not tried to impose such reforms
on the public service sector and have adopted a pragmatic approach that has
bought industrial peace at a price.
Ministers have been keen to work with the unions as long as the cost of
financing public sector pay was not having a serious effect on spending. But
now, the government's current borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn has
forced it to try to maintain a tighter control on public sector pay. The
main casualty of this short-term need to rein in spending could be the
introduction of plans to reform the entire public sector pay bargaining
system.
During this summer's public spending negotiations, which culminate in
November's unified Budget, the government will have to decide whether to
extend this year's formal pay norm into 1994-95.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insists it will not be extended. Last year
he resisted pressure from colleagues for a two-year norm and in recent weeks
has told them he is unwilling to re-open the debate.
Instead he wants a series of informal pay ceilings, low but varying from
department to department, to be enshrined in each of the Whitehall budgets
agreed in the spending round. The implication is that nurses, for example,
might negotiate a better pay deal than local authority manual workers.
Many of Mr Lamont's colleagues are unconvinced that an informal system will
work. If the chancellor is moved in a cabinet reshuffle some of the senior
ministers in charge of the big spending departments will push for this
year's publicly-stated norm to be carried forward.
The spending ministers argue that this pay squeeze has only held this year
because the 1.5 per cent ceiling has provided for 'equality of misery', in
turn providing an argument that it is basically fair. Their concern is that
the return of less constrained bargaining will bring with it the traditional
'leapfrogging' by different groups of public-sector workers.
Not for the first time in recent years, the government may have to contain
its long-term plans to align public sector pay on more market-oriented
lines. Instead, it is likely to seek a credible response to growing signs of
discontent among the public sector unions. Failure to resolve the problem
this year will only build up a head of steam for greater industrial conflict
next summer.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Yes please, Denmark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS IN the interest of Denmark, of Britain, and of the European Community
as a whole, that Denmark should vote Yes tomorrow in the country's second
referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
Those who desire the opposite outcome hope that a second Danish No might
kill the treaty. In a narrowly legal sense, that may be so, but all that can
be said with certainty is that even after a No vote, the EC's future would
have to be negotiated. It is unlikely that other member states, especially
the original Six, would acquiesce in a Danish veto. Rather, some or all of
them would seek to bypass the obstacle by replacing the Maastricht treaty
with a new arrangement. The legal difficulties might be considerable, but
one way or another a No vote would mark a parting of the ways between
Denmark and the core countries. It would be a step backwards in a world
which cannot avoid the struggle to construct effective international
political institutions.
A Danish Yes vote is firmly in Britain's interest, because it would increase
the pressure to get the Maastricht treaty through parliament. There have
been hints that should the the Danes say No, ratification might be abandoned
on the grounds that the treaty would then be 'dead'. This would be a serious
error. If Mr John Major were to abandon Maastricht, his influence on a
successor to the treaty would be severely weakened. It cannot be excluded
that Britain, too, might manoeuvre itself into an outer circle of the EC.
None of this is to make exaggerated claims for the treaty. As soon as it is
ratified, the EC must face the task of making the new union larger, more
accountable, more transparent and more efficient. It will also, as Mr
Jacques Delors has recently recognised, have to turn again to the dangers of
Eurosclerosis in an ever more competitive global economy.
Maastricht's most detailed element, the programme for Economic and Monetary
Union, has been shaken by upheavals in the currency markets. It is likely
that it will either be revised or confined to an inner core of countries.
The treaty's second most important objective, a common foreign and security
policy, has been shown by the Yugoslav crisis to be more urgent but more
difficult than previously appeared.
Yet nothing has happened in the months spent ratifying Maastricht to alter
the fact that Europe must have a dynamic, outward-looking economy and a
self-confident polity capable of influence beyond its borders, especially to
the east.
As recession grips Europe's heart and its political leaders stumble, it is
tempting to blame the EC and Maastricht for all that is wrong. But the
Community's ability to evolve through negotiation between democratically
elected governments remains its most creative characteristic. That process
will be most effective with Maastricht unanimously ratified.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Letter: Ukraine's nuclear weapons stance correct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BOHDAN HAWRYLYSHYN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Nuclear rift over Ukraine' (May 5) is excellent. It is
the first serious attempt to look at the issue of nuclear disarmament from
the Ukrainian side as well. Any newly-independent country is bound to be
somewhat sensitive about its independence. This applies particularly to
Ukraine, which has waited for independence for more than 300 years and is
now being told, rather unceremoniously, 'you hand over your nuclear weapons
to the neighbouring country which has deprived you of your independence for
a few centuries'.
Ukraine did move its tactical nuclear weapons to the Russian Federation last
year, the first such gesture that any country has made. Nobody seemed to say
thank you. Now it is simply being beaten into handing over its strategic
nuclear weapons. The reservations about this and signing the Start
agreements and nuclear non-proliferation treaties should be understandable.
First, the cost of moving these nuclear weapons, as you state yourself, is
enormous and beyond the current financial capacity of Ukraine.
Second, handing them over to a country which is politically fragile, which
has had an imperialist past, and where many of the present leaders keep
threatening Ukraine does not look overly appealing.
Third, there seems to be no provision for allowing Ukraine a share of the
proceeds from the sale of the materials.
Finally, none of the nuclear powers seems to be willing to give a strong
enough guarantee to Ukraine about the inviolability of its borders once the
nuclear weapons are removed.
Crude political pressure from abroad will merely increase the rank of those
in Ukraine who advocate its holding on to nuclear weapons, at least for a
while. This would be a pity, both for Ukraine and the rest of the world.

FT  17 MAY 93 / In the eye of a gathering storm: A look at the political and
economic challenges facing the new Turkish president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until yesterday, when he was elected president of the Turkish republic,
Suleyman Demirel was head of a coalition government formed by his own True
Path party (DYP) and the Social-Democratic People's party (SHP), led by
deputy prime minister Erdal Inonu. The immediate questions now facing Turkey
are whether that coalition will continue, and who will replace Mr Demirel as
prime minister.
But behind those questions lie others of much greater importance, not only
for Turkey but for Europe, the western alliance, the Middle East and much of
the former Soviet Union. The mere enumeration of those regions shows how the
end of the cold war, far from robbing Turkey of its strategic importance as
once seemed likely, has promoted it to the very eye of the storm. Some
American strategists even argue that Turkey has replaced Germany as the US's
most important ally. That is an exaggeration, no doubt, but Turkey has
replaced Germany as Nato's most exposed member. It finds itself surrounded
by, and involved in, three zones of conflict - the Balkans, the Caucasus and
Iraq - while a fourth neighbour, Iran, is seen as threatening both by the
Turkish elite and by Turkey's Nato allies.
The kind of role Turkey can play in these multiple crises will depend mainly
on how, over the next year or two, it handles its domestic problems.
For it is not only the external environment that has changed. In what will
probably be known as the Ozal years (after President Turgut Ozal who died
last month), the country has experienced significant internal change as
well. Its economy has been largely deregulated and opened up to foreign
investment. The growth rate last year was the highest in the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (5.9 per cent), but inflation is
running at about 60 per cent and population, now nearly 60m, is growing at
some 2 per cent a year.
The birth rate is falling, though, and projections of 120m Turks by the year
2025 are certainly too high. But even more spectacular, and socially more
destabilising, is the process of urbanisation. In just five years, between
1985 and 1990, the proportion of people living in cities jumped from 53 to
59 per cent. It could well be 80 per cent by 2000. The flow of both capital
and population has been from east to west, accentuating the sharp gap in
income and living standards between different parts of the country.
To see that as an ethnic division is too simple. The mainly Turkish
north-east is as poor as the Kurdish south-east, and Kurds as much as Turks
have joined in the westward migration. But the insurgency in the
south-eastern part of the country since 1984 has forced the issue of Kurdish
identity on to the Turkish political agenda, after six decades of denial and
repression.
This has happened while Turks in the rest of the country have been feeling
their way back to democracy after the military coup of 1980 (the third in 20
years). Constitutional provisions banning politically-affiliated trade
unions and political parties based on class or religious ideologies have
been gradually lifted, and efforts have been made to improve respect for
human rights.
But the Demirel government's bill on judicial practices, passed last year
and intended to give defendants the same rights as in other western
countries, has yet to be extended to terrorist cases. Reports of human
rights violations continue to flow in from south-eastern Turkey, where a
state of emergency allows the security services a free hand in the struggle
against terrorism.
Economic freedom, Kurdish identity, political pluralism: all these mark
steps away from the legacy of the republic's founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,
at least as traditionally understood and jealously defended by the Turkish
armed forces. But the centrepiece of that legacy for most Turks is
secularism, and that too is seen by some as being under threat. Leading
secular journalists and academics have been the victims of assassination
squads, allegedly trained in Iran, while the legal but overtly Islamic
Welfare party (RP) did well in local elections last year, and appears to be
increasing its influence.
Turkey's present leaders, and most diplomatic observers, remain convinced
the RP can not win more than about 15 per cent of the national vote. Seventy
years of westernisation could not be easily reversed, and Turkey is used to
thinking of itself as a European country. Its secular middle class is
larger, more self-confident and more unashamedly western in outlook than the
corresponding group in most other Moslem countries. Only if real disaster
strikes could this class lose its hegemonic role in the country and anything
like an Islamic counter-revolution take place.
But disaster cannot be ruled out, because the political class faces more
immediate challenges than an ill-defined 'Islamic threat'. The crucial
question in the next two or three years will be the management of the
economy. Although Turkey's recent history is an economic success story, and
the income of most social groups has kept pace with inflation, few suppose
this happy state of affairs can be maintained unless the government regains
control over the public sector borrowing requirement, currently running at
about 13 per cent of gross national product a year.
It is hard to see how it can do so without closing uneconomic state
companies and causing a sharp increase in unemployment, in a country which
still lacks a social safety net.
Customs union with the European Community, promised by the end of 1995,
offers real hope to many small businesses in Turkey, especially if the
Community lives up to its promises on textile imports. But other sectors,
such as cars, are ill-prepared for foreign competition; and the phasing-out
of the 'mass housing fund', currently levied on imports, will deprive the
government of an important source of revenue.
Even more urgent is the situation in the south-east, where the ceasefire
declared by the separatist Kurdistan Workers' party in March offers a chance
to end the civil war, but only if bold decisions are taken quickly. If the
ceasefire holds, the state of emergency will probably soon be lifted, but
that will be very risky unless measures are also taken to canalise Kurdish
political aspirations into non-violent channels. Allowing the use of the
language in schools and broadcasts, and allowing political parties based
explicitly on Kurdish identity, are the most widely canvassed ways of doing
this.
Will Turkey have a government capable of taking such bold decisions? It is
far from certain. Mr Demirel himself, by nature a cautious man, will
probably favour a colourless successor as prime minister - for instance the
present interior minister, Mr Ismet Sezgin - rather than someone as radical
and novel as Mrs Tansu Ciller, the economy minister.
Nor does the party structure of Turkish politics, reflecting the legacy of
the 1980 coup, make for clear and decisive government. The present coalition
partners, DYP and SHP, were brought together by hostility to President Ozal
rather than by any ideological affinity.
A two-party system, uniting DYP with Ozal's Motherland party as the main
conservative force, and SHP with Mr Deniz Baykal's Republican People's party
on the left, would make a lot more sense following the death of Ozal and now
that a new generation is coming to the fore. But such a political shake-up,
threatening to the personal positions of most established leaders, would
take one or two years at least to come about. Those are not years that
Turkey can afford to waste.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Letter: The debilitating effect of late payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R G HORNBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on late payment ('UK's late-payment culture attacked', May
10) brings a welcome focus to an aspect of business even more debilitating
to enterprise than government policy.
It seems that late payment reflects so many aspects of our society where
transgressors are rewarded for their action, or inaction.
If only the government would act, or enable organisations such as the
chamber of commerce to act, to ensure that all businesses behave in an
honourable way towards their suppliers.
One would hope that this would also reduce the flow of mindless reminders,
requests and demands for payment which the issuer knows is no more than
feeble wolf-crying.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Letter: Restrictions on parallel imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER WIENAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The proposal being put forward to remove the restrictions on parallel
imports in UK copyright law is both inappropriate and indiscriminate
('They're picking up bad vibrations', May 13).
It is inappropriate because the restrictions are no more than a logical
extension of the copyright owner's basic right to ban unauthorised copies,
that is copies which infringe the owner's copyright on his or her work.
Lifting the restrictions implies a more wide-ranging review of copyright
principles than has been canvassed - or admitted by the critics of the
restrictions - so far.
It is also indiscriminate. Why should the music industry be deprived of a
right currently enjoyed by all UK copyright holders? It is essential to the
wealth of many of the industries that rely for their livelihood on adequate
copyright protection that unlawful imports can be restricted. Until this
inconsistency has been resolved, one must suspect that reform of copyright
law is the wrong target for those concerned by high CD prices.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Home loans and Euro-money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurosceptics who hoped that the third Spanish devaluation in less than a
year would halt the move towards European Monetary Union are likely to be
disappointed. But it does make it even more probable that Emu will start
with a small group of countries based on France, Germany and its neighbours,
which have minimised realignment within the exchange rate mechanism. A more
significant event will be tomorrow's Danish referendum, which will determine
whether the Maastricht treaty can still be used as the basis for such a
union.
In a series of gatherings in Europe I have denied that a single currency -
and still less 'fixed exchange rates' - require a single political
authority. For this is what the Eurosceptics fear most and the
Euro-enthusiasts privately hope to achieve.
The more difficult supplementary question is: 'How much co-operation or
assimilation of economic structures do fixed monetary arrangements require?'
My tentative answer has been: 'About as much as the G7 group of leading
industrial countries have aspired to on a worldwide basis, but have rarely
succeeded in achieving.'
This answer gives the right flavour, but it is short on detail. The two
conditions that the British government has most frequently given for
rejoining the ERM are cyclical convergence with Germany - by which it seems
to mean that similar short-term interest rates should be appropriate in the
two countries - and an end to the recession in the UK. Because of the
unexpectedly severe German downturn and a more vigorous than expected UK
recovery both these conditions may now be fulfilled within months rather
than years - too early to avoid a huge Tory split, if rejoining the ERM were
to be mooted.
Meanwhile, the question frequently put to me by German and French officials
is: why do the British concentrate so much on short-term interest rates and
not on long-term ones, where German levels have been quite moderate?
The answer surely lies in a structural difference. A far larger share of
British borrowing is on a short-term basis than is the case on the
continent. This applies to both business borrowing and loans for home
ownership. But it is the latter which has proved the biggest political
land-mine. A tightening of monetary policy to reduce inflationary pressure
has a catastrophic effect on UK mortgage rates. The effect is especially
severe on recent homebuyers. A comparable increase in interest rates in
Germany and France is certainly not pleasant, but it does not have the same
effect on the home loan market where borrowing is mostly on a medium or
long-term basis.
A development has however occurred in the British housing market which may
change all this: the growing vogue for fixed rate mortgages. These have
become popular with borrowers after the shock of recent high rates.
Fixed-rate mortgages have now become possible in the UK because of the rapid
growth of the sterling swap market, which has enabled building societies -
which themselves borrow short - to reduce their exposure to interest rate
fluctuations.
An estimate of what might have happened had fixed mortgage rates been
available in the past few years has been made by Morgan Grenfell and is
shown in the chart. The thick line shows what might have happened if all
existing borrowers had five-year fixed rates. The dotted line is drawn on
the more realistic assumption that only new borrowers had been on such a
basis.
The results are as expected, but still pretty dramatic. The long period of
extremely high mortgage rates, which both intensified the UK recession and
undermined ERM membership, would not have taken place. Of course mortgage
rates would not have fallen so much in recent months. But they would not
have had to, if the slump had been less bad.
With more stable mortgage rates, UK governments would not have been able to
impose quite such such sharp interest rate squeezes on homebuyers. But with
diminished volatility in both directions credit booms would have been
diminished too and the need for shock treatment correspondingly smaller.
The peculiarities of the British mortgage market may seem a long way from
European monetary politics. But the encouragement of the change towards
fixed-rate borrowing may make a more important contribution to eventual
British membership of a European monetary area than more obvious moves in
the field of financial diplomacy.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Letter: Time and cost overrun on naval contract inevitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER STODDART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unsophisticated government policy of 'beggar-my-neighbour' which
masquerades as a naval shipbuilding procurement policy, is mincing-up the
last remnants of a UK strategic industry.
The price discrepancy between the Swan Hunter bid and the VSEL/Kvaerner
Govan bid ('2,200 jobs threatened at Swan Hunter', May 12) cannot be
explained rationally by the competitive process. If we accept that Swan
Hunter is one of the most experienced surface warship builders, and that its
management team was not bent on committing suicide, then its bid must have
been close to the proper price level for the vessel.
We should also accept that Swan Hunter would be close to the bottom of the
cost and the experience curve for that type of vessel. On the other hand,
the competitive positioning of the successful bidders must be at the
opposite end of that cost and experience curve, they having had no
experience of building surface warships since the Falklands war.
Any arguments about relevant skills and expertise in other naval or complex
ship products affording advantages in relation to other types of vessels do
not, pun not intended, hold water. VSEL and Kvaener need only look across
the Irish Sea, to Belfast, to see the last demonstration of such inept
thinking. The Public Accounts Committee had a great deal to say about the
performance of Harland &amp; Wolff in building a naval vessel which was beyond
its product range experience.
If the government believes in this competitive process then it will expect
to receive the vessel, in accordance with the quality specified, on time and
to the price quoted.
I forecast that it will be disappointed on the latter aspects and that the
vessel will be a year late and will cost some Pounds 100m more than the bid.
The reason is simple, this vessel is unlikely to be built in the time-scale
and to the cost quoted by yards which lack the experience and know-how to
meet the level of performance necessary to match their tender.
I recommend that the PAC make an early start on a report, before ministers
and civil servants lose the files, or move the contract goalposts. The
loudest voices clamouring for an inquiry into this affair should be the
successful bidders' shareholders, for it is they who must meet the cost
overrun that will result.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: Tennstedt's Mahler - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although Klaus Tennstedt has already recorded one successful cycle of the
Mahler symphonies, he is gradually recording another live in the concert
hall. There are always some conductors (Bernstein, Rattle perhaps, to name
two other Mahlerians) who have found that inspiration shines most brightly
upon them when they are standing in front of an audience.
On Friday the regimented rows of microphones lined up through the orchestra
at London's Royal Festival Hall suggested that this performance will be the
latest in the new series. Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic have now
arrived at the Seventh Symphony. The concert (no filler, just the symphony)
was to be repeated the next day, which will have been useful for EMI, as it
opened with a small rash of minor bloomers.
That is the risk of recording live. But, as the evening progressed, the
rewards were also there, yielding an ever increasing dividend. Tennstedt is
not a conductor who steps on to the podium and demands instant involvement.
He works to a long-term strategy, creating an atmosphere that will last the
duration of the symphony, working towards intermediate climaxes, keeping his
eye on the final goal.
Without wanting to declare one a better Mahlerian than the other, it is
fascinating to compare Tennstedt with Bernstein. The latter used to inflect
the aching string melodies of the first movement with every hairpin dynamic
marking in the score; the music started to sound contorted, as though
parading its emotions with exaggerated self-awareness, irony, sarcasm, even
a touch of neurosis. Tennstedt lets the music sing simply. It comes from the
heart.
In a symphony that is generally regarded as Mahler's least successful, he
manages to find a lot of genuine importance to say. The three central
movements are well written anyway and this performance kept finding passages
that suggested deeper emotions than one had hitherto suspected (the dusky,
veiled tone of the strings in the second 'Nachtmusik' was particularly
affecting). The finale is empty bombast on Mahler's part, but it rose to the
occasion here, exciting, exuberant, the London Philharmonic's playing at its
most brilliant.
It is too early to say whether this performance will replace Tennstedt's
earlier recording as a permanent record of his views on the symphony. Judged
simply as a concert, it was by some way the most moving and involving
Mahler's Seventh I have heard.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: Redeeming Vices - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saki (the pen name of HH Munro) led a retiring, mundane, life before he was
shot in the head by a sniper during the Great War. All his venom, wit and
quirkiness went into his short stories, many of which are classics. Michael
Browning has trawled through the Saki anthologies, picking a character here,
a plot line there, and striking aphorisms everywhere, to assemble the play
that Saki would never have written.
It is set in classic Saki territory, a weekend house party before the War,
and populated by Saki regulars, notably Clovis, the clever, cynical, epicene
youth whose task is to undermine county gentility. It is much as if PG
Wodehouse (a gentler contemporary of Saki) had suddenly gone to the devil.
Like Wodehouse, Saki's youth was organised by aunts; and Redeeming Vices
involves totally useless young men contriving, with the help of
husband-hungry young gels, to break loose from dominating older female
relatives. It is the kind of clever, civilised, resolutely middle-class play
that perhaps delighted matinee audiences in the 1920s: it is certainly an
antidote to contemporary drama.
The plot is borrowed from Mansfield Park. The young things get up to the
most innocent of mischief while the Gorgonesque Mrs Thunderford (Richenda
Carey) is supposedly away: to pay for their over-indulgence in bubbly and
trifle they face dismissal from the house next day - before luncheon.
Unfortunately Browning, who enthusiastically takes part as the genial Uncle
Ludo, does not trust Saki's superb reticence. He makes one of the girls, Joy
(Claire Weller), a rampaging nympho and Clovis comes way out of the closet.
Still, there is mild fun to be gathered from Saki's Oscaresque witticisms;
from the bustle of the amorous pursuits, motivated by money rather than
love; from Stephanie Turner's assured performance as a merry widow-to-be
whose husband is 'between Folkestone and Heaven'; and in the marriageable
Trevor Thunderford's (Tom Wallers) stuttering diffidence.
Much depends on the pivotal Clovis. Simon Beresford's imperturbable
outrageousness seems restrained by the smallness of the venue, but as he
grows in mannered confidence, and the rest of the cast finally remember the
stage names of their fellow actors, Redeeming Vices could go with a swing.
It provides an unusually effervescent evening. Director Philip Grout manages
to move a large cast around deftly and speedily.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: Boris Godunov - Opera in Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to Kobbe, which gives a more colourful synopsis than New Grove,
'the background to the story is one of famine and plague . . . the people
have deserted the ways of law and order . . . For Russia's misfortunes Boris
is blamed - in spite of his efforts to rule wisely and well.' Boris Godunov
may not be Boris Yeltsin, but any encounter with Musorgsky's episodic music
drama today makes you wonder whether Russia has changed at all in the past
four centuries.
The new production of Boris Godunov at Geneva's Grand Theatre suggests that
the historical Tsar was a good deal more handsome, if no more politically
secure, than the present Kremlin incumbent. Geneva's Boris is Samuel Ramey,
singing the role for the first time. With his proud mane of hair and pointed
beard, he cuts a noble, patriarchal figure, whether in his rich coronation
apparel or the bare-chested, bare-footed histrionics of the finale. Nothing
is overacted - though we are left in no doubt about Boris's physical
strength, violent temper and tormented conscience. Ramey may not be the
booming, bulbous bass most often associated with the part, but he sings with
well-sculpted, muscular refinement. His Boris is commanding, but not yet
charismatic.
Geneva opts for the original 1869 version - an austere succession of seven
panels which confines music and drama to bare essentials. It makes for a
relatively short evening - but the punch seems stronger without the scenic
and instrumental cushioning of later versions. Under Edo de Waart, the
musical emphasis fell on the dark, introspective quality of Musorgsky's
instrumental writing rather than on dramatic excitement - a view justified
by the sensitive woodwinds of the Suisse Romande Orchestra and some rapt
string playing, particularly in the cavernous double-bass parts.
On stage, as in the pit, the mood was one of stark simplicity. Stein Winge's
production, designed by Goran Wassberg, unfolded on a steeply-raked wooden
ramp curling up into a huge backdrop, which disgorged guards, boyars and
coronation procession from a variety of trap doors. The presence of the Fool
in each scene, an innocent observer of endless misfortune, provided a
further unifying thread. Visual contrast came from Kari Gravklev's
richly-coloured costumes, and from the variety and concentration of Hans-Ake
Sjoqvist's lighting effects, which dissolved the traditional stage
boundaries.
The production team was Scandinavian, the cast predominantly Anglo-Saxon.
John Tomlinson, who sang Boris for Opera North, proved an equally imposing
Pimen, though he sounded stretched by the upper reaches of the part. Anthony
Rolfe Johnson, the Fool in the 1981 Geneva production, has now graduated
with honours to Shuysky. Kim Begley was the powerful Grigory, Eirian James a
credibly adolescent Fyodor. Anne Collins, Henk Smit and Doug Jones made a
lively trio in the inn scene.
Performances continue until May 24. Radio 3 will broadcast a recording of
the production on August 14

FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: A high-tech toyshop - Colin Amery enjoys the work of
architect Nicholas Grimshaw through an exhibition of mock-ups and moving
models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This newspaper is printed in one of the best modern buildings in London. The
Financial Times printing plant in East India Dock is easily the most
stylish, light and elegant structure in its neighbourhood and the sight of
the entire printing process through the great glass wall is a thrilling
vision of powerful, moving machinery.
The architects were Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, a firm which since the
early 1980s has gone consistently from strength to strength as a leading and
versatile practitioner of British High-Tech architecture.
In London at the Royal Institute of British Architects there is a remarkable
exhibition of the recent work of the Grimshaw practice entitled Structure
Space and Skin (until May 29 at 66 Portland Place, London W1). Architectural
exhibitions are difficult things to make appealing to the public, but this
one is. Going into the great hall at the top of the stairs is like entering
a wonderful high-tech toy shop.
One of the things I have always liked about Grimshaw is his endless, almost
child-like enthusiasm for things new. To see him at the Riba surrounded by
the moving models and giant mock-ups of elements from his buildings was like
meeting Dr Coppelius as he prepared to wind up his dolls.
What is intriguing about British High-Tech architecture is its Britishness.
Those architects who practise this glorification and exposure of the
engineering and building process do not particularly like it being called a
'style'. Showing the world how a building is constructed, revealing a
fascination with the joints, ducts and fixings, is somehow both child-like
and unsophisticated while wanting to appear scientific and super
technological. I sometimes wonder whether High-Tech architecture is actually
any more sophisticated than Elizabethan half-timbering that showed the world
the structural elements of a timber frame, pegs and all.
In this exhibition the most recent Grimshaw projects and built work can be
examined. Much of the early work of this practice demonstrated the
appearance of a technology that functions ever smoothly, content with its
own imagery. The later buildings - the Berlin Stock Exchange, the Western
Morning News - and some of the projects in the accompanying book suggest a
search for a visual language that means more than the exposure of building
elements. It started at the British Government Pavilion at Seville when the
wall of water cascading down the glass facade subsumed the pavilion into a
mysterious block of moving liquid that was expressing coolness and a
response to the climate of a Spanish summer. But why is the Western Morning
News a ship marooned on dry land? Why is the Berlin Stock Exchange like an
upturned boat? Why does the Channel tunnel terminal at Waterloo station show
all its joints like a knobbly finger?
The Western Morning News building I have only seen from the outside, moored
on the edge of the city of Plymouth with a boardroom set on a 'bridge'
exactly as though the whole thing were a liner or a battleship. The walls
curve and present a concave surface as they rise up. The newspaper wanted
the printing, editorial and office functions to be together in one building
so, appropriately, when everyone is all 'aboard' there is a sense of
belonging to a unified organisation.
In the book published with the exhibition there are elaborate and beautiful
drawings and models of all the elements that were specially made for the
Western Morning News, which is another irony of High-Tech. It often looks as
though it is made of simple factory-made parts and the success of the
building depends upon the way these parts are assembled; in fact, the
process is a complex, rather old-fashioned craft approach that is strictly
bespoke and often expensive.
Perhaps the most exciting and enjoyable model in the exhibition is the
display about the Waterloo Channel tunnel link terminal, which should be
seen with the video. The architect saw this project (which won in
competition with 10 other firms) as 'an heroic railway station with the same
function as a 21st-century airport'. It is a long, thin, curved addition to
Waterloo station, with a spectacular roof. The shape is intriguing, a
three-centred arch with one centre displaced to the side as a response to
five tracks and three platforms. A great deal of the passenger movement will
take place beneath the tracks, and so the light and graceful shape of the
roof is vital if passengers are to have the 'sense of wonderment' that the
architect desires. What the model at the Riba reveals is that this 'travel'
architecture is a response to the complex plan of movement. The great roof
is going to be one of the sights of London - and one that is only revealed
once you are inside it.
More spectacular still, but not as yet built, is the airport proposal that
was shown at the Venice Biennale last year. It is a solution to the airport
design problem that could, by its very simplicity, provide an uplifting
architectural experience. The model itself has sculptural qualities that
have evolved from the elegant structural proposals.
I recommend this exhibition very warmly and wonder how many visitors will
share my critical ambivalence about the architectural success of the
High-Tech movement. It is like Star Wars - an explosion of ingenuity that
can overkill the problem with its own apparent cleverness.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: Dezso Rank - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All too fallible memory suggests that Rank has not played late Beethoven
before in London. We have heard him unfailingly stylish in Mozart and
Chopin, direct and uncompromising in Bartok, a most persuasive advocate of
his Hungarian contemporaries; but his Wigmore Hall programme on Saturday was
devoted to the last three Beethoven piano sonatas, Op. 109, 110 and 111,
played in strict chronology.
It promised much; Rank is such an accomplished and fastidious artist that
his approach to these pianistic summits was inevitably going to be
considered and fascinatingly detailed. What was delivered, though, came
across as unexpectedly approximate, like a snapshot of work in progress
rather than a series of distinct, fully achieved interpretations. General
principles could just be discerned: in all three works Rank appeared to set
out to subvert the conventional aspirations of late Beethoven playing,
de-emphasising the grandeur (even in Op. 111) and demystifying the most
serene moments of lyrical intensity.
The snapshot often seemed more like a negative. Ethereal spirituality was
brought down to earthy directness, strenuous aspiration transformed into
sportive exuberance, yet what might have been bracingly different never
cohered completely and too often was disappointing on purely cosmetic
grounds. The opening of Op. 109 ought to have suited Rank's luminous tone
and limpid articulation, yet came over as almost shockingly matter-of-fact,
with an uncomfortable sprinkling of errors; in Op. 110, vital left-hand
detail in the first movement went for nothing, and the central section of
the final fugue was prosaic and underpowered. There were things to admire -
a finely spun, singing line in some of the Op. 109 variations, clean,
athletic counterpoint in the finale of Op. 111, an explosive scherzo in Op.
110 - but they were the exceptions to the rule of inconsistency. Rank must
return to London with the same programme when either his interpretations or
his own playing, perhaps both, are focused more firmly.

Tonight's viewing has plenty of fodder for aspiring criminals and voyeurs of
the cheaper sort.
Hypotheticals (BBC2, 7.50pm), the TV intelligentsia's answer to university
debating societies, returns tonight and gathers hangers, floggers and
hand-wringers to consider juvenile crime. A strange hour to schedule it, as
intellectuals of a different ilk will instead be flocking to Brookside (C4,
8pm), the one soap on British television that isn't full of suds and lather
and little else.
Very rarely is there a moral imperative to watch TV. Bad Company (BBC2,
9pm), dramatising the 1978 murder of newspaper delivery boy Carl
Bridgewater, is one example.
Crimes are also perpetrated on-screen. The first of a seven-part
documentary, Singles (ITV, 10.40pm) features 'Ruby, 24, blonde and
beautiful' and her efforts to find a partner in London. Singles may be a
ratings-winner, but perhaps for all the wrong reasons.
A much better idea: why not set the video for The Naked Truth (BBC2, 4pm),
and grab the chance to see the incomparable Peter Sellers in a
rarely-screened 1957 farce?

FT  17 MAY 93 / Management: Quick off the mark if disaster strikes - A look
at contingency planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent bomb attacks on both sides of the Atlantic gave an added twist to two
events in London last week.
One was a visit on Friday from Charles Maikish, director of New York's World
Trade Centre, who went out of his way to praise the local response to the
disaster in February.
Maikish said that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the
centre's landlord, employed stress counsellors in the lobbies, issued
bulletins to tenants about the safety standards in the building, which
included certificates of the building's structural integrity, and held daily
press conferences in an effort to keep tenants and the public informed.
The need to reassure its 350 commercial tenants was seen as paramount by the
Port Authority. 'We were very vulnerable to tenants looking for release from
their leases,' said Maikish.
In order to mitigate any economic impact on the tenants the Port Authority
organised the temporary relocation of tenants, paid their moving costs, and
suspended their rent obligations on the existing offices. The landlord was
particularly anxious to satisfy tenants about the safety of their offices.
With 40,000 employees evacuated from the building, tenants were concerned
about their employees' willingness to return to their offices.
The Port Authority, which organised its response to the bomb on the evening
of the attack, has stopped short of setting up a disaster contingency plan.
However, it has designated another site for people to report to in the case
of disaster and it has set up an alternative telecommunications system. It
is also reviewing its security systems.
The other event in London was a conference organised by the UK's Institute
of Directors, which served to remind companies that bomb damage is not the
only disaster for which organisations need to plan.
Routine maintainance work by the water board recently caused a disaster for
the Bank of Finland when a burst main flooded its basement and shut down its
computer. No sooner had the bank recovered from that disaster than a second
one struck; a few days later an unrelated electrical mishap closed the
system down again.
The Bank of Finland, along with Commercial Union which was a victim of last
year's City bomb, is now a veteran on business recovery. In common with most
other financial organisations in the City, the Bank of Finland had a
contingency plan already in place which included the transfer of all its
computing facilities to a disaster recovery centre. Its experience was a
happy one: after each upset, business was kept going with only the briefest
interruption.
According to Peter Mobsby, assistant general manager, the bank learnt the
following lessons:
The time and money involved in setting up contingency plans was well spent.
The recovery time from the second disaster was far quicker than for the
first, demonstrating the importance of a full dress rehearsal.
The bank has moved its computer out of the basement to reduce future risk of
flood, and has resolved to mount full electrical tests after any power
failure.
Beds and showers are needed at the disaster recovery site, as staff are
likely to work through the night.
The fastest way of getting documents to the recovery site may also be the
cheapest - the tube might be quicker than taxis.
Lightening may strike twice.
The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, the Computing Services
Association, and Survive, the disaster recovery group, announced last week
that they are working to provide an Emergency Help Desk for the City of
London. This will be opened in the Guildhall to offer guidance and support
to companies with IT problems in the event of a disaster such as the recent
Bishopsgate bomb.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Management: Rubbing out the dividing line - The differences
between blue- and white-collar employees are disappearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent management buyout of Leyland Daf's truck plant in Lancashire has
been accompanied by sweeping changes in its labour practices. In return,
however, shopfloor inequalities are ending with the introduction of a common
car park and replacement of the weekly wage with annualised salaries for
all.
At Imperial Chemical Industries harmonising manual and staff benefits has
proved crucial in securing workforce acceptance of radical productivity
agreements. While recent deals at Power Gen, National Grid and National
Power, as well as at the regionally based water companies, have included new
integrated pay structures, a commitment to performance-related pay and
standardised terms and conditions of employment.
Eradicating the differences in treatment between blue- and white-collar
employees has become an essential ingredient in the current wave of company
restructuring. The trend towards harmonisation has not yet become an
irresistible workplace revolution - but no comprehensive shake-up in any
large- or medium-sized industrial enterprise now seems complete without such
changes being contemplated.
Non-manual work in Britain has traditionally meant not just higher social
status than that enjoyed by manual jobs. It has also implied better job
security, longer holidays and a shorter working week, more generous pension
and sick-pay provision, incremental pay scales and greater chances of
promotion. Archaic class attitudes of 'them' and 'us' have served to
accentuate such distinctions and made them more durable than in other
countries.
Commercial pressure, changing technologies and trade union influence are all
behind the harmonisation trend. 'This development is not happening because
employers have suddenly decided it is morally wrong to treat their manual
workers as inferior to their staff,' explains Helen Murlis at Hay
Management, the consultancy group. 'It is cost driven as companies become
more competitive and need the co-operation of employees in the often drastic
changes at work which they need to make to survive.'
Argues Robert Price at the Economic and Social Research Council: 'Market
pressures are calling into question the logic of the traditional status
divisions within the enterprise based on 19th century conditions and
outdated assumptions about the nature of work.'
But other factors are at play. Harmonisation is also being encouraged by
microprocessor-based technological innovation in manufacturing. This has
heightened the demand for more flexible multi-skilling team-work and the
removal of old demarcation lines and restrictive labour practices.
While recent moves stem mainly from managerial initiatives among companies
under global competitive pressure, trade unions have been pressing hard as
well.
The Transport and General Workers Union, for example, launched a campaign at
Shell demanding 'equality of opportunity for all' with what it called the
'removal of out-dated divisions between blue- and white-collar workers'.
Fred Higgs, the TGWU's chemical industry officer, says this was 'a
pre-emptive move' to persuade the company not to individualise employment
contracts and scrap collective bargaining. It showed the union was ready to
embrace and not resist greater job flexibility.
The AEEU engineering union is enthusiastic about the greenfield single union
deals it has signed since 1988. Its electrical section - once the EETPU -
has also pressed hard for an end to workplace status divisions in its
recruitment offensive in the electronics sector.
The current batch of company restructuring agreements, however, presents a
mixed picture. In some areas there has been substantial progress, but in
others there has been much less and in some cases gaps in status may have
widened.
Price warns that harmonising may not make much advance outside large- and
medium-sized companies in manufacturing. The commitment in management time
can be expensive and may take years to show any return in performance.
Smaller companies often lack the financial resources or the will to
introduce harmonisation.
Moreover, the deregulation of the labour market with the growth in
contracting out of services is a countervailing trend. New forms of
workplace inequalities threaten to emerge between workers in the core and
those working on the margins.
The following is a summary of recent trends:
Pay. Many recent agreements have introduced integrated wage systems that
unify all employees around a common pay spine from management to office
cleaners.
Individualised arrangements. Payment by results, bonuses and merit money are
rare across the company spectrum. The government's latest commissioned
workplace relations survey, for example, found that 31 per cent of
secretarial and clerical staff and 46 per cent of middle and senior
management were receiving merit pay. But only 10 per cent of unskilled
manuals and 22 per cent of skilled manuals were offered such remuneration.
But 47 per cent of skilled manuals received some form of incentive pay
(mainly payment by results) against only 38 per cent of clerical and
secretarial staff and 28 per cent of unskilled manuals.
Method of payment. Unpublished data from the government survey reveals a
significant decline in the number of workers paid in cash each week. In 1980
only 6 per cent of blue-collars were paid monthly and a mere 21 per cent by
either a cheque, giro or bank transfer. Ten years later 23 per cent of
manual workers were paid monthly and 72 per cent did not receive their wages
in cash.
Hours of work. More companies are increasing flexibility for manuals and
replacing the standard five-day, 37- or 40-hour week, plus overtime with a
variety of seven- or six-day shift systems and annualised hours. But manual
workers still work longer hours than staff. As many as 59 per cent of
white-collars work less than 37 hours a week, against 20 per cent of
manuals. By contrast the latest Hay survey of employee benefits shows that
44 per cent of manual workers work more than 38 hours a week, against only 3
per cent of non-manuals.
Timekeeping. Traditionally manual workers have had to clock on and off at
the workplace. In some recent pay deals time measurement has been dropped or
modified. The government's workplace survey found that 80 per cent of
private manufacturing establishments insisted their manuals signed on and
off at work, the same figure in 1990 as in 1980. Over the period the number
of white-collar staff required to do so rose from 8 per cent to 13 per cent.
Holidays. The latest CBI survey in 1992 found little variation between
workers in their entitlement. In companies employing between 5,000 and
20,000 workers, 41 per cent of manual dayworkers received 25 days and under,
compared with 45 per cent of white-collar staff. Health care. The Hay survey
shows 41 per cent of manual workers in health discount schemes and 22 per
cent of manuals in deals where the company pays part or all of the cost of
health care. This contrasts with 33 per cent of white-collars who are
covered in discount plans and 47 per cent where the company pays all or part
of the cost.
Pensions. Occupational pension schemes are increasing. But the latest
General Household Survey reveals continuing disparities. While 26 per cent
of employers and managers have an occupational and personal pension, the
same applies to only 3 per cent of unskilled manuals, 19 per cent of skilled
manuals and 10 per cent of clerical staff. The Hay survey shows only 9 per
cent of manuals are covered by a non-contributory pension scheme, against 15
per cent of staff.
Sundry items. Single-status canteens and car parks are more common.
Profit-sharing and share-ownership schemes have also moved outside the ranks
of management.

FT  17 MAY 93 / People: Associating chemicals with electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Electricity Association, the trade association which represents both the
privatised and nationalised parts of Britain's electricity industry, has
switched to the chemical industry for its next leader.
Philip Daubeney, 55, who has spent 32 years climbing the ICI management
ladder, is to take over as chief executive from Roger Farrance who retires,
at 60, in November.
A history graduate of Balliol, Oxford, Daubeney has come up on the
commercial side of ICI and is currently regional chief executive of the
African and Eastern region.
The Electricity Association is one of Britain's youngest trade associations,
having been born out of the rump of the old Electricity Council which used
to oversee the nationalised industry. Only three years old, it has had some
difficulty adjusting from being master of the industry to being its servant.
Although it has a mere 20 members and four associates, it employs around 200
people. In addition to providing the traditional services of a trade body,
the association also continues to supply common services to the industry.
The decision to recruit the association's next chief executive from outside
the electricity industry is another sign of the radical changes that have
taken place since the demise of the old Electricity Council.
Daubeney says that there are some similarities between the industry he is
leaving and the one he is joining.
They are both capital intensive and he believes that the electricity
industry may soon have to confront exactly those environmental issues with
which the chemical industry has already been grappling.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more spectacular office blocks in the Midlands - Point North - is
being built at Brierley Hill, Dudley.
The Pounds 8.4m design and build contract for the building (pictured above)
has been awarded to TARMAC CONSTRUCTION by Richardson Developments.
Point North will stand at the heart of the Pounds 200m Waterfront office
complex on the 300-acre former Round Oak steelworks site, now an enterprise
zone.
The 96,000 sq ft building will cascade down through six stepped storeys to
the edge of the inland waterways marina at the heart of the Waterfront.
Point North will enclose a quiet courtyard which will open on to landscaped
terraces by the waterside.
The architecture is enhanced with tinted glazing, pitched roofs and circular
glass columns. A three-storey circular drum, highly glazed and with external
balconies, will accommodate a conference suite.

Peter Owen, a former director of operations with British Airways from
1985-90, has been appointed as the new chief executive at AER LINGUS,
Ireland's loss-making flag carrier, in a management reorganisation leading
up to the rationalisation plan expected to be announced within the next
month.
He fills the gap left by Cathal Mullan, who resigned two months ago after
Aer Lingus chairman Bernie Cahill was appointed executive chairman by the
government, with full powers to plan and implement the rationalisation plan.
Owen only joined Aer Lingus five weeks ago, as chief executive for passenger
services. Now he has responsibility for all aspects of the group's business
with the exception of finance, which continues to be handled by Sam Young.
Both will report directly to Cahill.
The appointment has streamlined Aer Lingus' management by reducing the
number of chief executives from six to two. The group's commercial holdings,
air maintenance and hotels divisions will be managed now by Larry Stanley,
who will report to Owen.
After his departure from British Airways in 1990, Owen was chief executive
of Innocan Inc, a Canadian holding company with businesses in textiles,
distribution, communications and specialist cleaning and consultancy
sectors.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ewan Marwick, ceo of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, has died in a car crash in
Moscow. He was one of the best known figures in Scottish business.
Marwick, who was 41, had run the chamber since 1982. He was a high profile
figure, and an energetic lobbyist. He spearheaded a long-running campaign to
persuade the government to remove Prestwick airport's status as the sole
gateway for transatlantic flights from Scotland. The campaign was finally
won in 1990, against considerable opposition from some Conservative
ministers, and several new air services immediately began between Glasgow
airport and the US.
Marwick was also a leading campaigner to have non-domestic rates in Scotland
reduced to English levels. The government began harmonising Scottish and
English business rates in 1989, but Scotland's disadvantage has not yet been
eliminated.
In 1990 Marwick stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative party candidate in
the Paisley North by-election, and nurtured ambitions to go into national
politics.
Graduated in economics from Edinburgh university, he began his career
advising Shetland Islands Council, before joining the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors in Scotland as assistant secretary.
He was in Russia on a mission to advise the Rostov-on-Don region on economic
development.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 170m site rationalisation
plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEERY INTERNATIONAL, a Balfour Beatty company, has been appointed project
manager for the major part of a site rationalisation plan which is being
undertaken by the Defence Research Agency, an agency of the Ministry of
Defence. The total cost of the works to be managed under this contract is
Pounds 170m.
The DRA has a total of 54 operational sites throughout the country. About 30
of these sites are permanently manned and house nearly 11,000 staff of which
almost half are employed on support services. The DRA plans to invest
significantly in eight primary sites, substantially to consolidate
activities on three others and to vacate 15 sites; the work is required to
improve efficiency.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: Motorway project in North Yorkshire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMEC has secured three new projects with a total value in excess of Pounds
100m. The largest, in joint venture with Alfred McAlpine, is a Pounds 54m
contract to build a 21km section of the A 1(M) between Walshford and
Dishforth in North Yorkshire.
The joint venture will build the new three lane carriageway to the west of
the existing A1, upgrading this stretch of the route to motorway standard.
The project represents the first milestone in the government's 1990
proposals to upgrade the entire A1 between the M25 and Tyneside.
The second is from British Gas West Midlands, which has awarded AMEC
Utilities four period contracts estimated to be worth in the region of
Pounds 33m. Running for a fixed period of three years, the work will cover
the whole of the West Midlands area and involves replacement of mains and
services and installation of services.
The last is a Pounds 20m contract for AMEC in Singapore, in joint venture
with local company MAE Engineering, for the Pontiac Marina project.
The contract involves mechanical and electrical services, air conditioning,
fire protection and pool and fountain installations.
The project is due for completion in October 1995 and consists of a
41-storey office tower, a retail podium and two car park levels. The
contract was awarded by main contractor Dragages et Travaux Publics Pte.

FT  17 MAY 93 / People: Euromarkets veteran turns to NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Sanders, a familiar figure in the Euromarkets in the mid 1980's, is to
resurface at NatWest Markets, where, with the title of managing director, he
will be responsible for client marketing and business development on the
investment banking side, reporting to chief executive Martin Owen.
Sanders, 50, agrees the job, which he starts in July, will be 'very
different' from his current assignment as chairman of Royal Bank of Canada
Europe, but he also believes he is joining 'an enormously powerful
institution in its infancy'.
NatWest recently merged its wholesale businesses - treasury, corporate and
investment banking - under the one umbrella.
He says he is looking forward to working with clients without direct
line-management responsibility.
After seven years with Royal Bank of Canada he had reached a natural parting
point, he adds.
John Howland-Jackson, who arrived three months ago from Nomura as senior
managing director in charge of investment banking, says he and Sanders will
work very closely together.
The two already know each other well, 'having both lived in the Euromarkets
for the last 20 years.' Howland-Jackson adds: 'This elevates our marketing
to a higher level. We have got more technical investment banking skills than
some people imagine, but because of our origins in retail banking, we are
not blessed with an oversupply of executives experienced in dealing at the
most senior level in investment banking matters.'.
Having run international capital markets at S G Warburg, and been the first
chairman of the International Primary Markets Association, Sanders moved to
the Royal Bank of Canada group, initially as chairman and chief executive of
Orion Royal Bank.
He then entered a phase during which, as he agrees, he 'did alot of closing
down' - notably Orion's Eurobond and gilt-edged securities business followed
later by stockbrokers Kitkat &amp; Aitken.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Economics: Markets await UK unemployment data after recent
fall in jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKETS will be on tenterhooks this week for Thursday's UK unemployment
data. A third consecutive monthly fall in the jobless total may convince
economists - unsure of how to interpret falls in February and March - that
unemployment has stopped rising.
The consensus forecast for a rise of 15,000 month-on-month reflects
widespread scepticism that unemployment has turned the corner so early in
the recovery.
Most economists dismissed the seasonally adjusted falls in February and
March as 'a freak'.
Incomes Data Services the independent pay and employment research group says
there will be a sharp drop in the actual increase in average earnings in
March. IDS's observation is based on the significant boost to earnings in
March last year when fear of an incoming Labour government's plans for
higher rates of tax prompted payment of a large amount of extra bonuses and
salaries. The consensus for the underlying rate of average earnings,
however, is for no change at 4.5 per cent.
Here are some of the week's other economic highlights. The figures in
brackets are the median of analysts forecasts from MMS International, a
financial information company.
Today: Canada, March building permits (down 1.8 per cent on month),
department store sales (down 1 per cent on year). Sweden, April unemployment
rate (7.4 per cent).

power and ships (down 16 per cent on year); April trade balance, WPI (down
0.4 per cent on month, down 2.7 per cent on year). Australia, Reserve Bank

on year), PSBR (Pounds 5bn). Germany, Bundesbank council meeting. France,

merchandise exports (down 1.3 per cent on month), merchandise imports (down
1 per cent on month), merchandise trade surplus (Dollars 1.4bn); April
advance department store sales (up 1 per cent on year). Australia, March
manufacturing prices.
Thursday: UK, final stage of Maastricht bill in House of Commons; April

FT  17 MAY 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKS AND SPENCER, the UK food and clothing retailer, is expected to
announce a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 627.2m to between Pounds 710m
and Pounds 730m.
The average forecast of about Pounds 725m represents an increase of 16 per
cent, but last year's figures were reduced by exceptional redundancy costs
of almost Pounds 50m. Stripping these out, the profits increase is likely to
be between 7 and 8 per cent, reflecting a considerable pick-up in sales in
the second half, thanks partly to M &amp; S's 'outstanding value' promotions.
Storehouse, which includes the BhS and Mothercare chains, should report
pre-tax profits on Thursday of about Pounds 13m to Pounds 15m, after
exceptional items. As these are mainly one-off costs relating to disposals
aimed at streamlining the business, analysts expect the City to pay more
attention to the pre-exceptional figure, forecast at between Pounds 40m and
Pounds 45m. That would represent a significant increase on last year's
Pounds 15.8m when there were no exceptional items.
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is expected to report tomorrow pre-tax
profits of Pounds 500m for the six months to March 31. This compares with
Pounds 488m under the old accounting rules which stripped out extraordinary
items. Half year profits have been helped by around Pounds 25m of
exceptional profits relating to disposals, the depreciation of sterling
against the dollar and a good result from Cavenham Forest Industries in the
US.
Whitbread, opening another round of brewers' results today, is expected to
report pre-tax profits little changed from last year at around Pounds 222m.
Volume growth for the group's beer brands is likely to be offset by margin
pressures and increased marketing expenditure; but improved first half
trading by the retail division has been maintained.
Full year results from Allied-Lyons today should show profits up from Pounds
610m to Pounds 618m, at the top end of market forecasts. The group's leading
spirits brands have achieved further growth and on the retailing side,
Victoria Wine and Dunkin' Donuts have had a good year.
Bass, on Wednesday, is expected to report a 5 per cent fall in interim
profits to Pounds 245m against a restated Pounds 259m. Brewing profits are
likely to show little change and retailing is still suffering from the
reduction in pub numbers. Holiday Inn profits will benefit from the upturn
in the US, but these gains will be partly offset by poor returns from the
European operation.
British Airways is expected to report tomorrow lower profits of around
Pounds 200m-Pounds 180m for its financial year ending March compared with
Pounds 284m the previous year. The airline is also expected to launch a
rights issue to raise up to Pounds 400m to strengthen its balance sheet at a
time of difficult trading conditions and a series of significant equity
investments in other international carriers.

THE LIBERAL Democrats are to embark on a membership drive in an effort to
capitalise on this month's election successes.
The party is aiming to attract an extra 10,000 members, equivalent to
lifting membership by about 10 per cent.
The meeting agreed to pursue a 'twin track' approach in the aftermath of the
elections, with the party continuing to emphasise its independence while
pursuing co-operation with other parties on matters of common interest,
particularly at the local level.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Union members back ties to Labour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST union members want to keep the link with the Labour party, a Mori poll
of 2,000 members of four large unions suggests. Members of the TGWU, GMB,
Nupe and Cohse were interviewed in April.
The poll showed that three-quarters of them want their union to maintain its
connections with Labour and to continue to sponsor MPs.
The poll brought a sceptical reaction from senior Labour party figures, who
suggested the unions had asked their members the wrong question.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said no one in his party
was challenging its links with the unions. It was strange, he added, that
the poll had not asked about support for the call by Mr John Smith for 'one
member, one vote' arrangements in the selection of MPs and the party leader.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Swan Hunter wins more time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE WATERHOUSE, receiver to Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter, said last
night that it had agreed a short-term arrangement with the Ministry of
Defence for work to continue on the three Type 23 frigates which the company
was fitting out when it went into receivership last Thursday.
The receiver said there should be normal working on the frigates this week
and the company's 2,200 employees should report for work today. Price
Waterhouse said it had not yet 'formed a view' on the extent of any
redundancies which may arise.
News that work can continue this week on the frigates, the company's main
workload, holds out a thread of hope of Swan Hunter's sur-vival.
Finishing the frigates, which are due to be handed over between the end of
this year and late 1994, would allow the company to retain some of its
workforce and skills, raising its chances of winning further contracts and
making it a more saleable prospect as a going concern.
But Mr Mark Homan, who led the Price Waterhouse team in negotiations with
the MoD, warned last night: 'This temporary respite provides a breathing
space but is not a solution to Swan Hunter's problems.'
He said any permanent solution hinged on finding a buyer for the business.
It was too early to judge the prospect of this being achieved.
Price Waterhouse will shortly be submitting proposals to the MoD for further
work on the frigates.
The short-term deal means the receiver has found a way of paying Swan
employees' wages, at least for this week. The weekly-paid workforce is due
to be paid on Wednesday for the last four weeks.
Unofficial sources say the company may have debts of Pounds 40m. It had run
out of credit and was having to pay cash for essential items before last
Tuesday's announcement that it had lost its fight for the helicopter carrier
order which would have kept it in business.
Tomorrow the Commons select committee on defence will discuss the background
to the difference of more than Pounds 50m in the bids by Swan Hunter and its
rival, the VSEL/Kvaerner consortium, for the contract.
Mr Neville Trotter, Conservative MP for Tynemouth and the committee member
who arranged the special meeting, said he would urge the committee to ask
the MoD to shed light on the 'huge difference'.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Central Office's quiet leap forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S INAUGURAL meeting of the Conservative party's new board of
management represents another important step in the quiet revolution set in
train at Smith Square by Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman.
The twin aims of this discreet but comprehensive overhaul are to solve the
pressing problem of the party's deficit and to modernise creaking structures
which in some cases date from the 1930s.
Only fleetingly - as in this spring's meeting of the party's central council
at Harrogate, where a rare grassroots rebellion derailed some of Sir
Norman's proposals - has the process featured in newspaper headlines.
But the changes are no less significant for that, having already triggered
the closure of four out of 10 English regional offices and a 40 per cent
reduction in Central Office staff. When completed, they will have
transformed the party's fundraising, accounting and internal co-ordination.
A more ruthless and efficient election-fighting machine is the intended
result.
Meeting for the first time with a whiff of crisis hanging over both party
and government following this month's election disasters, the board of
management was set up to act like a company's board of directors.
One of two key bodies the reforms will establish, it brings together senior
members of the party's professional, elected and voluntary wings. Sir Allen
Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of the food and drinks group Grand
Metropolitan, will bring an external perspective as a non-executive member.
A quota of four of the 11 members should enable Central Office to retain a
reasonably solid grip on decision-making.
The other new body is a board of treasurers, which is intended to add a new
edge to the party's fundraising. Under Mr Charles Hambro, its recently
appointed chairman, the board will consist of six or seven well-known
figures from commerce and industry whose contacts and experience will be
exploited to broaden the base of the party's donors.
The board was set up following prime minister John Major's decision to
depart from the practice of some of his predecessors by including
fundraising among the party chairman's responsibilities.
With a target of erasing its deficit by 1996, it is not surprising that the
party is trying to inject new impetus into its fundraising. But Sir Norman
recently wrote to Mr Hambro to 'make it quite clear' that fundraising must
be 'independent of any suggestion of political influence'. Donors should be
motivated by a desire to sustain a party promoting free enterprise and not
by a wish to put pressure on the government to enact certain specific
policies.
The party will insist that donors make appropriate disclosure of their
contributions when there are legal requirements to do so.
In certain circumstances, Mr Judge suggests, the party may 'even take
references'. Fuller accounts are to be published in a move to counter
criticism of the secrecy with which the party surrounds its financial
affairs. But these will not include specific details about donors.
On accepting foreign money, Mr Judge says donors usually have 'a pretty good
reason for wanting to do it and it is usually because they have business or
property interests here'. If an entity with no apparent UK assets offered
money, the party would 'certainly look at it'.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Tories poised to end secrecy on finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party, which has a Pounds 19m deficit, may publish a
balance sheet this summer for the first time.
The move follows pressure from both Labour and the 'Charter' group of Tory
activists for removal of the secrecy surrounding the party's finances.
It comes as Mr Asil Nadir's flight to Cyprus and allegations - since
categorically denied - of the existence of offshore 'slush funds' have
revived criticism of the party's fundraising.
A meeting today of the party's newly constituted board of management is
likely to approve publication of a balance-sheet to bring greater openness
to its accounting.
The current proposals stop short of advocating a breakdown of individual
donations to the party, but should result in the 1992-93 accounts being the
most complete ever. 'The report will try to give as clear a view of the
party's finance as possible,' according to Mr Paul Judge, the party's
recently installed director-general.
The proposals reflect a comprehensive overhaul of the party's internal
accounting. In the past, the party has published a limited set of annual
accounts showing income and expenditure but not full figures on assets and
liabilities.
On fundraising, Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, is keen to guard
against future embarrassment by ensuring it is stressed to donors that there
can be no direct link between policy-making and their interests.
Central Office coffers have been hit by the party's falling-out with
prominent landowner donors over leasehold reform, and the recession's effect
on many companies.
Officers also acknowledge that much of the cash going to campaigners for a
Maastricht referendum might otherwise have come to the party.
Nonetheless, Mr Judge said the party was on course to meet its financial
targets, which call for its accumulated deficit to be wiped out by 1996. It
will soon announce that this deficit rose to Pounds 19m at the end of March
1993.
Mr Judge laughed off 'slush fund' allegations as 'completely untrue', saying
the party has 'offered a 10 per cent finder's fee to anyone who can come up
with the Pounds 200m'.
The Charter group will this week publish its own version of the 1992-93
accounts which it says gives a more accurate picture of the party's
finances.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Pressure mounts for U-turn on rail sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is coming under intense pressure to follow last week's
U-turns over school-tests and fines with new climbdowns on rail
privatisation and the collection of pension payments from post offices.
With prime minister John Major attempting to reassert his authority after
this month's disastrous election results, the government is facing a
determined effort to change its rail privatisation bill, spearheaded by a
group of Tory backbenchers.
It is also under pressure to back away from proposals which might compel
some pensioners to have pension payments made by automated credit transfers.
The Treasury is thought to be keen for more benefits to be paid in this way
rather than being collected over the counter from post offices. Mr Major
said last week that the government aimed to 'encourage' bank transfers while
maintaining a 'viable' network of Post Offices.
Mr Major acknowledged in his speech to last week's Scottish Conservative
Conference that - with its Commons majority down to 18 - the government
might be forced into an occasional climbdown. 'We may have to tack a little
here, manoeuvre a little there. That's politics,' he said.
The government is also facing the difficult prospect of piloting a long and
complicated finance bill through its committee stage without having its
revenue-raising proposals diluted.
Ministers, after facing down attempts to amend its proposed reform of the
North Sea tax regime and weathering a mini-rebellion over imposing value
added tax on domestic fuel, are concerned that proposed changes to the
company-car tax system could provide another potential flashpoint.
The MPs backing changes to the government's rail privatisation plans intend
to table a series of amendments to the bill for consideration at its Commons
report stage next week.
Among the likely amendments is one that would permit British Rail to bid
against the private sector for rail franchises. Others would seek to ensure
that Travelcards and senior citizens' railcards would not be axed.
Sir Keith Speed, the Tory MP for Ashford, said yesterday that the proposals
were designed to make rail privatisation 'popular and workable.' None of
them would undermine the principle of the bill, he said. Warning that if the
government demonstrated no flexibility MPs would have to 'consider our
position', he said that his 'strong hope' was for ministers to decide they
could accommodate the changes.
Mr Tim Rathbone, the Tory MP for Lewes, said the changes were 'in no way'
wrecking amendments.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Citizen's Charter cuts BR payouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY paid to British Rail passengers whose trains are late or cancelled has
been cut by more than half since the introduction of the Passenger's
Charter.
Latest figures confirm predictions that the charter would leave passengers
no better off than they were under the previous arbitrary and unpublicised
refund scheme.
BR says it has not yet calculated how much compensation has been paid since
the charter came into operation, but estimates the figure at a little more
than Pounds 3m a year.
In 1991, the last full year before the charter, BR paid out Pounds 7m -
although that figure was boosted by disruption to services caused by what BR
dubbed the 'wrong kind of snow'.
Before the Passenger's Charter came into force in May 1992, local managers
had discretion to hand out cash or travel vouchers when passengers wrote to
complain about unpunctuality or poor service.
The charter imposed a more rigid system of compensation. For example, trains
had to be more than an hour late before refunds could be claimed, and the
entitlement consisted of a voucher worth only 20 per cent of the fare.
When the Passenger's Charter was introduced, BR estimated that compensation
would soar to Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m a year. The Consumers' Association said:
'What the latest figures show more than anything else is that the
performance targets were too soft.'
The association said it had also had reports that BR was interpreting the
charter too rigidly, taking the guidelines as maximum levels of entitlement
instead of minimum ones. It called on BR to 'go with the spirit of the
charter rather than the letter'.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Radio 1 promotion policy is defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC yesterday rejected claims from commercial stations that Radio 1 was
breaching its licence by running extensive promotions with the record
industry and other companies.
'There are strict guidelines about retaining editorial control, and we are
completely clean,' the BBC said, although it admitted that Radio 1 'pushed
to the limits of the guidelines'.
The Association of Independent Radio Companies has written to the BBC and
the Department of National Heritage claiming that outside companies have
spent Pounds 1m a year on promotions with Radio 1 in return for publicity
about their products.
Commercial stations claim the promotions are a form of cross-subsidisation,
with money earned through them being used to finance other BBC programmes.
Radio 1 said yesterday none of its promotions violated its licence and
denied the allegations of cross-subsidisation.
The BBC said on-air promotions, such as competitions to win trips to meet
bands, were 'editorially valid' and always involved popular bands which
would be receiving Radio 1 airplay in any case - although the station
admitted that the bands' records were likely to be played when a competition
was promoted.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Prescription costs rise by 87% over 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE cost of a national health service prescription rose by 87 per
cent in real terms between 1980 and 1990.
The increase in cash terms, published today in a report by the Parliamentary
Office of Science and Technology, is from Pounds 2.37 to Pounds 5.77.
The number of prescriptions over the period rose by 19 per cent in real
terms, taking the NHS drugs bill from about Pounds 855m to Pounds 2.5bn. It
has now reached about Pounds 3bn, representing about 10 per cent of the NHS
budget, and is expected to rise by between 11 per cent and 12 per cent this
year.
The growth in the bill was driven partly by new treatments, the report says.
These are relatively more expensive, but also tend to increase the number of
prescriptions as they are more effective.
The study notes that the number of prescriptions against malignant diseases
such as cancer increased during the 10 years by 834 per cent, almost
entirely because new treatments were available.
Higher levels of diagnosis, generated by an ageing population, more
widespread and more effective screening, and higher incidences of some
diseases also drove up the number of prescriptions, the report says.
Pressure from more informed consumers was also a factor. Prescriptions rose
from 361m in 1980 to 431m in 1990.
The cost per prescription of cardiovascular treatments, representing about
20 per cent of all drug costs, increased by 59 per cent, with the cash cost
rising from Pounds 3.46 to Pounds 7.13. The report says this was because
cheap anti-hypertensives were replaced by more expensive beta-blockers,
ace-inhibitors and calcium antagonists.
The report warns that the drugs bill is likely to increase as new
technologies bring more innovative compounds to market. It says that
advances in molecular biology, human genome research and neuroscience will
soon lead to many more new medicines.
It concludes that the government could attempt to control drug spending by:
Requiring companies to prove medicines are needed.
Stricter controls on drugs groups' profits, as part of the renegotiation of
the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme. This controls drugs companies'
return on capital.
Wider use of non-patented generic medicines.
Controlling doctors' prescribing habits.
The study warns, however, that there must be a balance between cost savings
and the interests of the industry, which contributes substantially to the
economy.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Citizen's Charter cuts BR payouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY paid to British Rail passengers whose trains are late or cancelled has
been cut by more than half since the introduction of the Passenger's
Charter.
Latest figures confirm predictions that the charter would leave passengers
no better off than they were under the previous arbitrary and unpublicised
refund scheme.
BR says it has not yet calculated how much compensation has been paid since
the charter came into operation, but estimates the figure at a little more
than Pounds 3m a year.
In 1991, the last full year before the charter, BR paid out Pounds 7m -
although that figure was boosted by disruption to services caused by what BR
dubbed the 'wrong kind of snow'.
Before the Passenger's Charter came into force in May 1992, local managers
had discretion to hand out cash or travel vouchers when passengers wrote to
complain about unpunctuality or poor service.
The charter imposed a more rigid system of compensation. For example, trains
had to be more than an hour late before refunds could be claimed, and the
entitlement consisted of a voucher worth only 20 per cent of the fare.
When the Passenger's Charter was introduced, BR estimated that compensation
would soar to Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m a year. The Consumers' Association said:
'What the latest figures show more than anything else is that the
performance targets were too soft.'
The association said it had also had reports that BR was interpreting the
charter too rigidly, taking the guidelines as maximum levels of entitlement
instead of minimum ones. It called on BR to 'go with the spirit of the
charter rather than the letter'.
Another factor in the low level of payouts is believed to be a reluctance
among passengers to go to the trouble of submitting claims for trifling
levels of compensation. BR says most passengers are far more concerned about
improvements in performance than about claiming refunds.
Complaints about rail punctuality from passengers travelling to and from the
west of England have risen by 80 per cent, the Western England Transport
Users Consultative Committee says.
The number of passengers complaining to the committee in 1992-93 totalled
587 - a 20 per cent rise on 1991-92.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Home Office to come under police fire over spending curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOME OFFICE is likely to come under fire today over plans to limit
government spending on the police service.
Police authorities and chief constables are to press senior Home Office
officials for further details.
The change away from the current arrangement, under which the Home Office
provides 51 per cent of local authority spending on policing, will come as
part of the reorganisation announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home
secretary, in March.
Mr Clarke will address the Police Federation conference this week. At last
year's conference he used his first big speech as home secretary to announce
a wide-ranging inquiry into the structure of the police service.
While his announcement was welcomed at the time for giving chief constables
greater authority over their budgets, the police and local authorities have
since become more cautious about the proposals.
When Mr Clarke appears at the Blackpool conference on Wednesday he will see
that the service's instinct for suspicion has heightened over the past 12
months. He will face heavy criticism for failing to involve police
representatives in advance consultations on what are likely to prove the
biggest changes in modern times.
The inquiry, chaired by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, will
report by the end of next month. It will almost certainly lead to a flatter
management structure, the abolition of some senior ranks above inspector
level, and a form of performance or task-related pay.
Mr Clarke, while awaiting Sir Patrick's report, has done his own detective
work in areas outside the inquiry's scope. As a result he has started plans
to restructure police authorities into smaller, more businesslike bodies
with national objectives and fewer local authority representatives.
Police officers of all ranks, worried that a giant programme for change will
gather pace before they have had formal opportunities to influence it, have
launched a campaign to win public support.
In an attempt to present the service's case widely, the Association of Chief
Police Officers has taken the unusual step of publishing a fact sheet
designed to 'unravel some of the mythology about the role of the police'.
The document, issued with the support of the Superintendents' Association
and the federation - which represents all other ranks - is being sent to
influential people in local communities.
The changes proposed by Mr Clarke also worry local authorities. Some senior
local government figures fear that, in practice, the move could lead to a
cash limit on all current police spending. The proportion of police spending
met by local authorities will be brought under even tighter control.
There are also concerns about how central government grant will be
allocated, now that the Home Office is abandoning the system of recommended
levels for police forces. The representatives at today's meeting with Home
Office officials are likely to seek assurances about levels of police
funding under the new arrangement. One Whitehall official described the
change as a 'Faustian' deal in which the Home Office won Treasury agreement
to its plan only because it is seen as a way of imposing a ceiling on the
Pounds 6bn-a-year police budget.
The change is not due until 1995-96 because it requires legislation which
will not be introduced until the autumn at the earliest.
A study carried out for the Sheehy inquiry last month by Ernst &amp; Young and
Towers Perrin, management consultants, showed that, while many forces have
reformed their management structures there has been little reduction in
management costs over the past two years.
Mr Clarke has kept his pledge to await the Sheehy inquiry's report rather
than charging into change; but this is just the sort of evidence he will use
when, in about a month's time, he dons his riot gear and gives himself the
signal to charge.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Assisted areas map set for EC scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected this week to submit to the European Commission
its redrawn assisted areas map, the subject of intensive lobbying by the
regions.
The map will specify areas in which companies can qualify for UK government
and EC regional aid. It is receiving its final touches from Mr Tim
Sainsbury, industry minister.
Publication was expected early this year, but last month the government said
it was being delayed until after the May local elections. As the EC may take
up to eight weeks to decide on ratification, it may not be make public until
late July.
The map is expected to provoke fierce controversy by including areas of
inner London and south-east England, at the expense of parts of Wales, the
Midlands and the north of England. It currently covers 35 per cent of
Britain's working population but Mr Sainsbury has warned that the figure may
fall.
Last week the DTI pre-empted publication by announcing continued development
area status for the Newcastle and south Tyneside travel-to-work areas,
because of likely large job losses from Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter.

FIGURES from the Finance and Leasing Association show that new lending and
leasing to the business sector rose by 7 per cent in the first quarter
compared with the same period a year ago.
Association members said the rise in lending to consumers came from a 24 per
cent increase in unsecured personal loans and a 12 per cent rise in retail
store credit products for the first quarter, against a year ago.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Discount retailers forecast to grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCOUNT retailing will remain the fastest growing sector of UK retailing
even when the recession is over, according to a report by Verdict, the
retail research company, Neil Buckley writes.
Verdict says discounting will be a significant force in food retailing and
clothing and general-purpose stores. Experience in the US and Germany
suggests the UK is ripe for expansion.
In addition to growing price sensitivity among consumers, Verdict says the
demand for price-led retailing is underpinned by the massive expansion in
retail floorspace in the 1980s, which has left excess capacity in the 1990s.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Managers find block on career progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of upwards career moves made by managers has declined by nearly
40 per cent since a peak in 1987, the Institute of Management says.
In contrast, horizontal or downwards moves have doubled since 1980, Diane
Summers writes. The institute says assumptions about 'onward and upwards'
management careers may have to be dropped and managers adapt to sideways or
even downward moves. But managers change jobs more frequently than in the
early 1980s.
The institute carried out a survey of more than 800 of its members' careers
over the past 13 years. It found about 21 per cent changed their jobs each
year from 1980 to 1982, while 29 per cent changed jobs in 1992.
The reasons behind the moves have also changed, with those voluntarily
choosing different jobs dropping sharply. Enforced moves - particularly
redundancies and changes resulting from company restructuring - are now the
main type.
The study says it is not possible to link the most recent changes in
managers' careers directly to the recession. Instead, changing patterns
might reflect longer-term changes resulting from company restructuring. The
Institute of Personnel Management today warns companies to tackle age
discrimination voluntarily 'before social pressures force legislation to
outlaw discrimination against older workers'. The institute says the
recession has made the position worse.

FT  17 MAY 93 / A firm voice in Threadneedle St: Profile of a man likely to
take a tough line in dealings with the Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU sneak into the Bank of England tomorrow afternoon you will catch in
full flight the man whose views are one of the firmest elements in a
distinctly wobbly UK economic policy.
Professor Mervyn King, the Bank's economics director, will be launching its
quarterly report on inflation, a document written largely by him. It is seen
as a vital check on government ministers over possible price pressures now
Britain is outside the European exchange rate mechanism.
The 45-year-old professor is a principal lieutenant to Mr Eddie George, who
moves from Bank deputy governor to governor in July. Both men are determined
that Threadneedle Street shall play a bigger role in advising the Treasury
on monetary policy, a goal that may be helped by the Treasury's weakened
state in the aftermath of the ERM fiasco and a run of policy errors.
Prof King, who went to the Bank only two years ago, does not lack ambition.
One theory is that if the new and untried deputy governor - Mr Rupert
Pennant-Rea, former editor of the Economist - fails to make a mark then Prof
King would be his natural replacement.
The affable but publicity-shy Prof King enjoys a high reputation among
academics. Professor James Meade, the Nobel prize-winning economist, calls
him 'first-rate'; Mr Lawrence Summers, an ex-Harvard economist who is
under-secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury, says he is one
of the 'top few European economists' of his generation.
Prof King joined the Bank from the London School of Economics. A specialist
in taxation and corporate behaviour, he made a particular impression in the
US, where he has had several spells at Harvard and at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
Prof King - educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School and King's College,
Cambridge - can be very eloquent. Professor Charles Goodhart of the LSE, a
former Bank economist, says: 'A big strength is that he can argue his case
at almost any level of academic complexity.'
But in the City he is viewed as an enigma. One City economist says:
'Meetings with Bank people are rarely a bundle of laughs but even so Mervyn
can be especially daunting; he is seen as unapproachable.'
Prof King can also be difficult to work for and, according to one Bank
economist, is 'a stickler for detail'. He once told his Bank staff to tear
up a speech the day before he was due to deliver it because he disagreed
with the fine print.
Another associate says: 'He's not the world's best diplomat; he's a bright
lad who makes it clear if he thinks people are not on his intellectual
plane.' A few weeks ago MPs on a Commons committee visibly bristled when he
suggested they might have trouble following his argument.
A certain robustness has also been evident in his dealings with the
Treasury, traditionally the senior partner in the monetary relationship.
Prof King is determined that the Bank's inflation report - the first of
which came out only in February - should be seen as the Bank's work,
untainted by Treasury influence. According to one account he told Treasury
officials to 'get stuffed' earlier this year when they tried to engineer
amendments to the first report.
Had he accepted the blandishments five years ago of former chancellor Lord
Lawson, Prof King might now be at the Treasury himself. He was offered the
job of deputy chief economic adviser - it would almost certainly have led to
being chief economist - but opted to stay in academic life.
Several people close to the professor believe academia may still reclaim
him. Harvard professor of economics John Kain says: 'Prof King did a great
job when he was here. Just about every leading US institute would bid should
he want to come back.'

FT  17 MAY 93 / London 'leads in world lending'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England says in its quarterly bulletin that London remains the
leading centre for international bank lending, ahead of Japan.
British banks accounted for a considerable share of the growth in
international bank business in London last year, but the strongest growth
was generated by other EC banks, particularly French and German. Japanese
banks' business in London continued to decline.
The Bank suggests that borrowing in international banking and capital
markets will be boosted this year by substantial refinancing needs as debt
issued in the late 1980s matures and demand for funds from the public sector
continues.
The impact of these factors is already evident this year, with international
bond issues reaching a record, it says.
The Bank says that borrowing in the international banking and capital
markets more than doubled last year after falling sharply in 1991. But
because a large part of the borrowing refinanced existing debt, net
borrowing was broadly the same as in 1991.
Political uncertainties in Europe in the second half of the year, along with
volatility on exchange and interest rates, prompted investors to shift from
the Ecu and high-yielding European currencies to 'safe havens' such as the
dollar and the D-Mark, the bulletin says.
In the first six months of last year, when Europe appeared to be heading
towards economic and monetary union, investors bought high-yield European
bonds in the belief that convergence of European inflation and interest
rates would provide capital gains.
Sentiment switched after Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty and
realignments of European exchange rate mechanism currencies showed that
'exchange rates within the ERM were not immutably fixed'.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Companies told to tackle age bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTE of Personnel Management today warns companies to tackle age
discrimination voluntarily 'before social pressures force legislation to
outlaw discrimination against older workers'.
A survey of more than 1,000 members found that 80 per cent thought age
discrimination was a problem in UK companies. The institute says that the
recession has made the position worse.
An even greater proportion of members - 86 per cent - thought there should
be either legislation or a government-sponsored voluntary code of practice
to prevent the specification of age ceilings in job advertisements.
A separate survey, conducted earlier this year by Industrial Relations
Services, the independent research group, found that almost a third of job
advertisments specified an age bar - up from a quarter four years ago. Four
out of five advertisers giving a preference wanted someone under 45.
The government has so far ruled out the kind of anti-discrimination
legislation found in North America and France. The institute itself is
opposed to introducing laws, but its code of guidance recommends companies
not to specify ages in job advertisements.
The study finds that personnel managers themselves held some stereotyped
views about older workers: 66 per cent thought they were less able to accept
new technology, 63 per cent thought they were less able to adapt to change,
and 48 per cent thought they learnt less quickly.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Bank may use new measure of money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England is considering a change to its way of measuring monetary
growth in the economy following widespread dissatisfaction with existing
measures of the money supply.
An article in the Bank's quarterly bulletin, published tomorrow, concludes
that a 'divisia' measure of money might have a closer relationship with
total expenditure in the economy than conventional monetary aggregates.
A divisia index weights each of its components - such as cash and bank and
building society deposits - according to the extent to which they represent
money for spending rather than saving. Existing money supply measures simply
add together the components without weighting.
The article points out that if the weights reflect the ease and cost with
which money - cash, low-interest deposits or high-interest deposits - can be
used for spending, the index will be more closely related to total
expenditure.
Broad money supply measures have been criticised for their failure to
provide a reliable indicator of the relationship between the level of money
in the economy and future inflation.
In spite of doubts about the accuracy of broad monetary aggregates, the
government reintroduced a monitoring range for M4 - notes and coins in
circulation plus bank and building society deposits - in October last year
as part of its strategy to control inflation following Britain's departure
from the European exchange rate mechanism. The monitor range for M4 is 3-9
per cent.
The government also watches M0, mainly notes and coins in circulation, which
has a monitor range of 0-4 per cent.
The Bank says that treating cash in the same way as interest-bearing
deposits is probably misleading. A divisia index, with weighted components,
would 'provide a measure of the total quantity of money held in the economy
for transaction purposes as opposed to savings purposes'.
The government should not hesitate to cut interest rates again if recession
in continental Europe starts to threaten the UK's recovery, according to
Oxford Economic Forecasting, the UK consultancy. Its latest assessment of
economic prospects, published today, says GDP will grow by 1.7 per cent this
year and 2.9 per cent next year.
It says fiscal policy should be tightened immediately to create room for
lower interest rates as those on the Continent come down. Tax increases set
out in the March Budget did not go far enough, OEF says.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Scottish bank's 'rollercoaster' warning on UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS at Royal Bank of Scotland claim that lack of an economic policy
framework has put the UK economy on a 'dangerous rollercoaster of boom and
bust' which could damage long-term growth, Emma Tucker writes.
Ms Marian Bell and former Treasury special adviser Mr Warwick Lightfoot say:
'With no proper framework of monetary control in place, and no appetite to
tackle public expenditure and government borrowing, policy will eventually
become unsustainable, leading to accelerating prices, and . . . could
provoke a sterling crisis and a gilt strike.'

FT  17 MAY 93 / Companies 'rethink strategy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION in Europe and the threat of protectionism world-wide are forcing
companies to reappraise strategies adopted in the 1980s, according to a
report published today by a group of European economic research institutes,
writes Peter Norman, Economics Editor.
The ERECO consortium of research institutes from Germany, France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Austria and the UK said niche market strategies designed to
position European companies in less price-competitive markets had backfired
as recession had hit demand for luxury products and forced big price cuts on
industries.
The strategy of globalisation, highlighted by a five-fold increase in
foreign direct investment between 1981 and 1991, could be imperilled if the
world economy fragmented into trading blocks centred on the EC, Japan and
the US, it added.
The report said European companies should strengthen their position in
high-quality production rather than push further upmarket. It pointed out
that Mercedes, the German car maker, has already decided to design new
models to fit pre-defined price brackets rather than aim for the highest
engineering standards.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Pollsters hope it's second time lucky: Forecasters confident
for tomorrow's Danish referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS of a Yes vote in Denmark's referendum on the Maastricht treaty
tomorrow are nervous, while opponents continue to hope, despite a clear lead
for the Yes side in the opinion polls. The reason is not hard to find.
In a poll on May 31 before last year's vote the Gallup Institute showed 55.7
for and 44.3 per cent against (after eliminating the don't knows). The
actual result was a No - by 50.7 per cent to 49.3 per cent. The difference
between the survey and the actual result was 12.8 percentage points.
Curiously, the Gallup poll a week before last year's vote gave a small No
majority, as did two of the three polls monitored by the Financial Times. It
was Gallup's surveys in the final week that got it wrong.
A comparative analysis of surveys in 1992 and this year by the three
institutes - Gallup, published in the Berlingske Tidende newspaper,
Vilstrup, published in Politiken, and Greens, published in the Boersen
business newspaper - suggests that a No this time would be more surprising
than it was last year.
This year not a single survey since the beginning of February has given a
majority for the Noes. Last year nine out of 19 polls between early February
and May 26, a week before the referendum, showed a No majority.
There are fewer don't knows this year. In polls published by the three
institutes last week, Gallup reported 13 per cent undecided, Greens 11 and
Vilstrup 8. A week before last year's vote, the figures were 18 14 and 15
per cent.
The average gap between Yes and No in the three polls last week was 22
points, with a 61-39 per cent majority for Maastricht (after eliminating the
don't knows). Last year, a week before the vote, Gallup and Vilstrup showed
a small No majority. Greens showed a Yes by 53.5 to 46.5 per cent.
In daily polls by Gallup in the final week up to the June 2 vote last year
there was a sudden and misleading (as it turned out) swing towards Yes.
There has been no such swing, either way, in 1993.
The Noes have gained ground this year from the beginning of February, when
they were receiving 25-26 per cent of support, until the first week in May,
when their support seems to have stabilised at about 32-34 per cent of the
vote, including the don't knows and won't-votes, according to Gallup.
The Yes vote lost ground in the same period, but since the beginning of May
it has consistently been around 48-50 per cent.
But in none of the surveys by the three institutes have the Yes and No
curves come anywhere near crossing each other this year. In the survey
conducted by Greens last week, however, the percentage gap between Yes and
No, after eliminating don't knows, was a relatively meagre 11 points.
Voters can still change their minds, of course, but, taking the average of
the polls, there will have to be a landslide change of mind if the Noes are
to win.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Danish Referendum: UK minister reveals vote desperation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR British minister yesterday underlined how desperate the government
is for a favourable outcome in tomorrow's Danish referendum on Maastricht by
warning that a No vote would have 'a fairly devastating effect'.
On the BBC's Breakfast with Frost programme, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home
secretary, said a No would 'send shocks through western Europe'. He added it
would dent his personal optimism that a 'fairly dreadful' year was
improving.
The referendum comes as British Prime Minister John Major attempts to
reassert his authority after this month's Conservative party election
disasters.
He began this process last week with a determined speech to the Scottish
Conservative Conference. A Danish No would deal a telling blow to the
rehabilitation process, however.
Separately, Sir Edward Heath, the former Conservative prime minister,
launched a devastating attack on the Tory Euro-sceptics, saying they would
be hated for the rest of their political lives.
On BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Sir Edward said people were
'furious at this small band of sceptics holding everything up month after
month after month - absolutely furious.' He added: 'These people are going
to be hated for all time. Think what they have done to our party.'
Mr Clarke said a No vote would result in 'a period of difficult rethinking'
on Europe which 'may well not emerge with solutions which the Euro-sceptics
would like at all'.
Member states 'would have to consider how to continue to develop the EC
despite the Danish rejection'. He indicated Britain would be reluctant to
press on without Denmark.
Mr Clarke was also at pains to reassure those who have expressed concern
about the consequences of the Maastricht treaty's ratification that a Yes
vote tomorrow would not encourage the government to just charge on with the
European agenda.
'I do think it is extremely important. . . that we pro-Europeans remember
the experience of Maastricht,' he said. 'We went absolutely to the limits of
keeping public opinion with us in the UK, in Denmark, France and elsewhere.
We have to put in place the bits of Maastricht that reassured people.'

FT  17 MAY 93 / Political row to put peseta to the test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish peseta's new level in the European exchange rate mechanism may
be put to the test this week as the political battle over last Thursday's
devaluation escalates.
In the run-up to elections on June 6, the ruling Socialists and the
conservative Partido Popular (PP) exchanged accusations over the weekend. If
the PP insists on further interest rate cuts - the Bank of Spain trimmed its
official rate from 13 per cent to 11.5 per cent the day after the peseta's 8
per cent devaluation - the peseta could come under pressure again.
With the PP and the Socialists running close in opinion polls, the markets
will be watching developments carefully.
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez accused Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the PP leader,
of precipitating the final speculative attack on the peseta by revealing
details of a conversation in which Mr Gonzalez had tried to seek a deal not
to attack the currency during the campaign. A few days later Mr Aznar had
said Spanish interest rates should fall quickly.
In an interview with the Financial Times at the weekend Mr Aznar rejected
this. 'Mr Gonzalez is beyond all shame,' he said. 'There was absolutely no
agreement on silence at all and no one in this country can say a single word
of mine has cost the country a single peseta of our reserves. What is more,
I have resisted many voices who are urging me to make the most of this
opportunity.
'The person responsible for the trouble Spain is in is Mr Felipe Gonzalez.'
Anxious not to hand the struggling Socialists a lifeline, Mr Aznar, who is
to meet British Prime Minister John Major during a visit to Britain today,
would not say whether he was satisfied with the scale of the devaluation and
the subsequent interest rate cut. 'I will be satisfied when the Spanish
economy begins to recover,' he said.
Nevertheless, there are few early signs that the PP has managed to turn
Thursday's devaluation - the third in less than nine months - to its
advantage.
Two nationwide opinion polls published yesterday put the Socialists ahead.
Although the polls were taken before Thursday, they demonstrate how well the
Socialist vote is holding up, despite the recession and divisions in the
ruling party. The polls also continue to show that Mr Gonzalez is more
popular than Mr Aznar.

FT  17 MAY 93 / France to renew sell-offs

THE French cabinet is due to table a draft privatisation law on May 26, to
pave the way for an ambitious programme of state company sell-offs expected
to start after the summer.
Terms and conditions will be similar to those in the last wave of wholesale
privatisations, under the previous centre-right government of 1986-88,
according to leaked details published by Figaro, the right-wing newspaper,
over the weekend.
The government is hoping to raise up to FFr200bn (Pounds 24bn) over four to
five years from the sale of recently restructured industrial companies, the
largest round of privatisations attempted in France. Likely candidates
include Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals, Pechiney
in aluminium, and leading banks and insurers.
The main difference from previous state sell-offs is that the government
will create stronger takeover defences for privatised companies in sensitive
sectors and will try to build loyal long-term shareholders, according to the
leaked details.
As in 1986, foreign stakes in privatised companies will be limited to 20 per
cent. On top of this, foreign buyers could now be required to make some form
of pledge to be long-term shareholders.
One likely innovation is that private investors will be allowed to pay for
privatised shares in instalments, a marketing device borrowed from British
state sell-offs.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Franc fort policy wins the battle but not yet the war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO THE French franc has survived. Last week's devaluations of the peseta and
escudo within the European exchange rate mechanism confirm both the emerging
two-tier structure of monetary relations in Europe and France's membership
of the northern core of hard currencies which cluster around the D-Mark. But
French industry will continue to pay a high price for some time yet before
the franc fort policy can finally be declared triumphant.
French monetary policy has eased markedly in recent weeks as the pressure on
the franc has eased. Official interest rates have been cut six times in six
weeks: the latest  1/4 point cut in the influential 5-10 day intervention
rate to 7.75 per cent last Thursday brings the cumulative fall in official
short rates to 1.85 percentage points since peaking in autumn. The more
important three-month money market rate has fallen by nearly 5 percentage
points since then, from its 12 per cent high.
Yet the real interest rate squeeze remains viciously tight. With annual
consumer price inflation now barely above 2 per cent, short-term real
interest rates are still well over 5 per cent, as the left-hand chart shows.
They remain at least 2 percentage points higher than in Britain.
Nor are long-term real interest rates, more important for French fixed-rate
borrowers, significantly less severe. Ten-year French bond yields are a
little above 7 per cent, only half a point above German long rates. But if
France's newly independent central bank is going to deliver German-style
inflation rates over the next 10 years, then long-term French real rates are
still very high. Nominal French long-term rates are now half a point lower
than UK rates, but few investors are expecting a similar inflation
performance from the dependent Bank of England.
French and German interest rates should fall further. But the loss of French
trade competitiveness within Europe as a result of repeated devaluations by
competitor currencies both within and outside the ERM will remain. More than
60 per cent of French exports are sold in European markets, of which half
are sold outside the ERM's northern core. But, against a basket of European
currencies, weighted by their share of French trade in Europe, the French
franc has appreciated by 8.6 per cent since last September.
This blow to export competitiveness is partially softened by the slow pace
of French inflation relative to the rest of Europe. But the French real
exchange rate, which measures trends in export price competitiveness by
adjusting for relative inflation rates, has still appreciated since last
September by 4 1/2 per cent within Europe, as the right-hand chart shows.
The assorted realignments in the ERM since last autumn have, as a result,
reversed the hard-won gains in competitiveness that the franc fort policy
had accumulated. Between the beginning of 1987 and last summer, French
competitiveness in Europe had risen by nearly 4 per cent. This occurred
almost entirely because France had managed to maintain lower inflation than
its European competitors, albeit at the cost of slower growth and rising
unemployment. But the trade-weighted appreciation of the franc since then
has more than wiped out these gains.
These sacrifices have not necessarily been in vain. France does appear to
have emerged from the ERM's recent turbulence with its inflation-fighting
reputation substantially enhanced, in marked contrast to the UK. If the
newly independent French central bank is able permanently to lock-in to
inflation rates below 3 per cent, then this lost competitiveness can be
quickly regained. But that implies more months of pain for French industry
while economic growth in the UK, and in the other more inflation-prone
countries of southern Europe, accelerates. The real test of the French
political commitment to the franc fort policy begins now.
CORRECTION. In the chart that accompanied international economic indicators
on May 10, 1993, the label 'national investment' in the top section should
have read 'national saving'.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Europe's car sales continue to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales in west Europe dropped by 18.6 per cent last month as demand
fell sharply for the fourth consecutive month. Sales declined by 29.6 per
cent in Spain, 28.6 per cent in Italy, an estimated 16.5 per cent in Germany
and by 11.7 per cent in France.
In the first four months west European new car sales have fallen by 17.6 per
cent to an estimated 4.15m, from 5.04m in the corresponding period a year
ago.
Most leading carmakers in Europe have been forced to implement short-time
working and are cutting their workforces in the face of shrinking profits or
mounting losses.
According to industry estimates, new car sales in April fell to 1.087m from
1.334m in the same month a year ago. Sales last month were lower than a year
ago in 16 of 17 markets. Registrations rose only in Ireland.
The recent recovery in UK new car sales faltered in April with a 1.9 per
cent year-on-year decline. UK industry leaders claimed the fall was
misleading, however, as sales a year earlier had been inflated by a
reduction in car purchase tax.
In the first four months new car sales in west Europe were higher than a
year ago only in the UK, with an increase of 8.2 per cent, and in Ireland.
Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands all suffered declines in the first
four months of about 30 per cent year on year, while sales have dropped by a
fifth in Germany, Italy and France.
Rover, the UK car producer and a subsidiary of British Aerospace, was the
only carmaker in west Europe to increase its sales volume in the first four
months, with a rise of 9 per cent.
Among the big six volume carmakers, the Fiat group of Italy, which includes
Alfa Romeo and Lancia, is being hit by the decline in its domestic market,
where new car sales fell by 28.6 per cent in April.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Spending curbs hit drug sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH of the European drugs market continued to slow during the first
quarter this year as governments struggled to control healthcare spending.
Underlying sales of prescription medicines in the top seven European markets
increased only 2.1 per cent during the first three months. During the whole
of 1992 the same markets grew 8 per cent.
The seven markets, about 85 per cent of the entire west European market,
actually fell in dollar terms from Dollars 11.923bn (Pounds 7.7bn) during
the first quarter last year to Dollars 11.166bn over the same period this
year.
The figures, compiled by IMS International, the pharmaceuticals market
research company, include purchases by pharmacies, representing about 80 per
cent of total drugs sales. The statistics exclude end-users such as
hospitals.
Sales in Germany fell from Dollars 2.942bn to Dollars 2.527bn. Excluding
exchange rates, they dropped 13.4 per cent, following price cuts introduced
at the beginning of the year and followed by a price freeze.
France remains Europe's largest single market and the third largest in the
world after the US and Japan. Spain, which has recently overtaken the UK as
the fifth largest market, is now Europe's fastest-growing market for drugs
sales, increasing 14.4 per cent, compared with the UK growth of 11 per cent.
The British government is concerned about the UK drugs bill.

RUSSIA yesterday suggested for the first time that the implementation of the
Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia could begin even without the agreement of
Bosnian Serbs, who were set to reject it in a weekend referendum.
But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic defiantly declared the UN-backed
peace plan dead and his army's general threatened bomb attacks in London and
Washington if the west tried to intervene to force them to accept it.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, stressed that the plan,
supported by the presidents of Serbia, Montenegro and the rump Yugoslavia,
was the international community's agreed position on the fighting in Bosnia.
The Russian foreign minister was speaking to reporters after talks in Moscow
with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators.
Though he gave no details on how the plan could be implemented in the teeth
of Bosnian Serb opposition, Mr Kozyrev said the UN Security Council might
approve a new resolution on the subject this week. Like Britain and France,
Russia has expressed strong reservations about US calls for air strikes and,
particularly, for arming Bosnian Moslems.
Bosnian Serbs turned out in large numbers yesterday to vote in the
referendum. They were expected to ignore the advice of the leaders of Serbia
and Montenegro by voting massively against the Vance-Owen plan. In reply to
a second question, they were also expected to vote in favour of an
independent Bosnian Serb state, with the right to unite with other peoples
and states. The result is expected on Wednesday.
After the voting, Mr Karadzic said the world was 'wasting its time' if it
tried to forge a single state in Bosnia. 'The Vance-Owen plan cannot be
implemented as it is far away from reality,' he said and called for work to
start on a new one.
General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb army commander, warned the west not
to intervene with air strikes to try to force the plan on the Serbs. 'If
they bomb me, I'll bomb London,' He told Reuters newsagency. 'There are
Serbs in London, there are Serbs in Washington.'
He said any western troops which intervened on the ground would 'leave their
bones' in Bosnia.
Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb forces pressed on with their assault on Moslem and
Croat forces around the north-eastern town of Brcko, where they are trying
to widen the corridor linking Belgrade with Serb-held territories in Bosnia
and Croatia.
Bosnian Croat forces also launched a fierce attack on Moslem positions in
Mostar, the south-western Bosnian city, after a week of clashes between the
former allies.
Reuter adds: Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic yesterday signed a
ceasefire agreement with Bosnian Croat military chief General Milivoj
Petkovic covering the whole of Bosnia. The agreement, due to come into force
at noon tomorrow, was signed at a meeting at Sarajevo airport attended by
the commander of UN troops in Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon.

<TEXT>
THE agreement reached on Friday in the Saxon capital of Dresden between
Germany's metal and electrical employers and the country's powerful
engineering union, IG Metall, provides a formula for ending a strike which
could have paralysed what remains of eastern German industry.
Yesterday, both sides were debating on the regional level whether the Saxon
compromise reached by Gesamtmetall and the union could be applied to the
metal and electrical sectors of the other four states.
If so, workers will be balloted today and if 25 per cent support the
agreement, the strikes in this sector are expected to end on Wednesday.
But strikes in the steel sector, centred mostly in Berlin-Brandenburg, could
continue after the breakdown yesterday evening of separate talks between the
steel employers and the local IG Metall branch over this year's wage rises.
Regardless of the outcome in both cases, the Saxony compromise leaves
unanswered how eastern German industry can become competitive and how
productivity can improve.
For those small German and foreign companies already located in east
Germany, the agreement offers little chance for further investment which
could lead to the creation of new jobs in the region. Investments will be
soaked up by a spiralling wage bill.
The Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Forecasting (DIW) recently
showed that for 1993, eastern Germany's gross domestic product will exceed
DM201bn (Pounds 81.7bn), while the wage bill will exceed DM248bn. In western
Germany, this year's GDP is estimated to total DM2,223bn, and wages
DM1,555bn. In practice this means the small and medium-sized companies will
find it increasingly difficult to generate profits in eastern Germany.
Productivity in the metal, electrical and steel sectors in east Germany is
already lagging behind its western counterparts by about 70 per cent, which
means that unit labour costs in the east are 70 per cent above west German
levels.
Through the strike weapon, IG Metall reinstated, in a modified form, the
basis of the March 1991 contract, signed with the employers, which will
equalise eastern and western wages from mid-1996, instead of 1994. The
principle of collective wage bargaining in the region has also been upheld.
Above all, the union used the strike to attack the Treuhand, the agency
responsible for the privatisation of eastern German industry. Many of the
targeted enterprises were under the Treuhand. If the agency manages to
privatise sections of this remaining core, thousands could lose their jobs.
This will push up the unemployment rate, which, taking into account job
creation schemes and short-term work, is about 30 per cent of the region's
labour force.
By targeting these enterprises, and later the privatised sector, IG Metall
wanted to ensure the future unemployed received higher unemployment
benefits. But the strategy has left little room for creating investment
which would lead to jobs. Indeed, this policy will not only reduce the
union's eastern membership, it will deprive east Germany of the stimulus for
growth and competitiveness.

neighbourhood, in the wake of a car bomb explosion that hurt 23 people on
Friday. Police, who were continuing investigations yesterday, said members
of the Mafia were the most likely instigators, even though the explosion did
not bear the familiar signs of a terrorist action by the organisation.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Haider held back in Austria election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIAN right-wing populist Jorg Haider suffered a rare setback yesterday
in provincial elections in Lower Austria, the country's largest province,
writes Ian Rodger.
His Freedom party took only 12.1 per cent of the vote, up 2.7 percentage
points on its showing in the last Lower Austria election but well below its
near-20 per cent tally in other recent polls.
The setback was partly due to a breakthrough by the Liberal Forum, formed
only three months ago by Mrs Heide Schmidt and other Freedom party
defectors. The Forum won 5.1 per cent, for three seats in the 56-seat
legislature, gaining most of its support in middle-class Vienna suburbs.
Mr Haider's party increased its seats from five to seven.
The conservative Austrian People's party (oVP) and the Social Democratic
party (SPo) both lost ground.
The oVP lost three of its 29 seats - and its absolute majority - as its
share of the popular vote slid to 44.1 per cent. The SPo slipped to 34 per
cent and gave up two of its 22 seats.

THE APPOINTMENT of Professor Romano Prodi as chairman of Iri is being viewed
as a strong signal of the Italian government's intention to push ahead with
privatisation of the state holding company.
His appointment at the weekend followed the arrest of Iri's chairman, Mr
Franco Nobili, on Wednesday on charges of corruption.
Mr Luigi Abete, head of Confindustria, the industrialists' association,
welcomed the appointment of Prof Prodi, who resumes the post he left little
more than three years ago.
Mr Abete said it represented clear evidence of a desire to 'accelerate the
process of privatisation'. Iri's 1992 losses are believed to be more than
L4,200bn (Pounds 1.8bn) and group debts are L70,000bn.
Mr Nobili is still being held in Milan's San Vittore jail as magistrates
investigate allegations that he was involved in arranging kick-backs on
contracts for two power stations both while he was heading Iri and in his
previous role as chief executive of Cogefar, the private construction group.
Prof Prodi, who is close to the Christian Democrats, headed Iri from 1982 to
1989. A firm believer in slimming down Iri he was frequently frustrated by
political interference. He tried unsuccessfully to privatise SME, the
foodstuffs and distribution group, and pushing this sell-off will now be one
of his first tasks.
Iri desperately needs to raise cash through divestiture to meet pressing
financial commitments. Apart from SME, Prof Prodi is expected to turn his
attention to delays in proposals for Iri to move out of banking through the
sale of its stake in the commercial banks Credito Italiano and Banca di
Roma.
The return of Prof Prodi raises questions about the future role of Mr
Michele Tedeschi, the chief executive who had been making decisions about
current and strategic operations. Prof Prodi is likely to have a more
hands-on role.
Ian Rodger adds from Zurich: The Swiss Federal Banking Commission has asked
Union Bank of Switzerland to comment on statements by Mr Florio Fiorini,
imprisoned former head of the collapsed Sasea Holdings group, implicating
the chairman of UBS in Italy's political corruption scandals. Mr Fiorini has
told Geneva prosecutors Mr Nikolaus Senn, UBS chairman, assisted in the
transfer of funds from Eni, the state-owned Italian energy group, through a
UBS account in Lugano to the Italian Socialist party in the late 1970s.

investigate allegations that he was involved in arranging kick-backs on
contracts for two power stations both while he was heading Iri and in his
previous role as chief executive of Cogefar, the private construction group.
The quick substitution of Mr Nobili bore the stamp of the decisiveness of
prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former governor of the Bank of
Italy, who last month was called in under crisis conditions to head the
government.
Prof Prodi had been a strong front-runner as an independent candidate to
head the new government. He was even called to Rome from his native Bologna
under the impression he was the next premier. But the Socialist party
objected at the last minute to his candidature.
Prof Prodi, who is close to the Christian Democrats, headed Iri from 1982 to
1989. Another economist, Prof Franco Reviglio, was brought in to run Eni,
the state oil concern and the other large public sector group. Mr Giulio
Andreotti, then prime minister, had him replaced by Mr Nobili, marking a
return to more politicised management at Iri.
A firm believer in slimming down Iri, which accounts for more than 5 per
cent of GDP, Prof Prodi was frequently frustrated by political interference.
He tried unsuccessfully to privatise SME, the foodstuffs and distribution
group, and pushing this sell-off will now be one of his first tasks.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Lofoten tries to shake off Arctic barbarian image: Norwegian
and Japanese whaling communities are united in their defiance of IWC
moratorium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ANTAGONISTS call the people of Norway's Lofoten Islands 'Arctic barbarians',
yet the fishermen and whalers feel misunderstood and unjustly condemned by a
world hostile to the way in which they make their living.
Today - Norway's Constitution Day - will be celebrated by the islanders
while they anxiously await tomorrow's commercial whaling quota announcement
by the government, after a two-year battle with anti-whaling activists.
At the weekend, Lofoten's whalers began rigging their boats and testing
their harpoons before resuming traditional coastal whaling, hopefully, they
say, sometime this week. As the IWC deliberated in Kyoto, foreign media
descended upon Lofoten asking how whaling could be so important to so few
people that the entire nation would risk isolation by most of the rest of
the world.
'You begin to wonder what the IWC has become and what real use it is since
it refuses to listen to the advice of its own scientists,' remarked Mrs
Marietta Korsrud, wife of a Reine whaler and fisherman. 'It calms me to have
a government which makes decisions based on scientific results because this
is the only way in which the environment can be truly cared for. It's
important for the world to know we are not barbarians.' Mr Korsrud's father
was a whaler, as was his grandfather.
The Lofoten Islands comprise six municipalities and a population of 25,000.
Granite mountain pinnacles forming the jagged 'Lofotwall' rise from the
treacherous Norwegian Sea. Four of the municipality's seven whaling boats
returned on Saturday with a paltry spring catch of four minke whales out of
50 allotted under research quotas. The whalers spent the last month battling
storms around the Bear Islands in the Barents Sea and in the West Fjord,
which separates Lofoten from Norway's mainland.
Captain Olav Olavsen of the Nybraena said the weather was so severe, just 17
hours of whaling was possible. Last December, the Nybraena was partially
sunk by US anti-whaling activist Paul Watson, who is threatenening further
action. Capt Olavsen was forced to take out war insurance coverage in order
to remain in business.
This spring's catch was brought to auction on Saturday in Skrova and Myre in
Vesteraalen, where buyers paid NKr32.50 (Pounds 3.13) a kilo for the dark
red meat, but they hope to get up to NKr80 a kilo in the second-hand market.
They say the meat will fetch NKr120 a kilo in food stores around the
country. According to Mr Tor Haug, the hunt's leader, it cost about
NKr100,000 a day for each of the four whaling boats to operate. Whaling
represents about 50 to 60 per cent of the annual income of Lofoten's
fishermen, who began coastal whaling in the 1920s.
Ms Zoelvi Pedersen, a spokeswoman for pro-whaling organisation High North
Alliance, said Lofoten was disappointed Norway did not withdraw from the IWC
but relieved the government was to allow coastal whaling. The whalers
themselves do not have huge expectations for high quotas. As Mrs Korsrud
said: 'They need quotas high enough to cover their operating costs - maybe 8
to 10 whales each, but will be thankful for what they get.'

FT  17 MAY 93 / Taiji takes the whaling ban as a personal affront: Norwegian
and Japanese whaling communities are united in their defiance of IWC
moratorium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIJI, JAPAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIJI is a whaling town and proud of it - two humpback whales are mounted
above the entrance to the town, whale motifs are emblazoned on manhole
covers and it boasts a harpoon boat museum.
Last week, 160 residents from the port in southern Japan protested in front
of a Kyoto conference hall where the International Whaling Commission
extended the moratorium on commercial whaling and angered the Japanese
government.
A frustrated Mr Setsuo Hamanaka, Taiji's mayor, stood with the protesters,
who carried placards demanding that the delegates 'respect differences in
food culture' and suggesting that 'France, get out of the IWC', a reference
to the French proposal for a whale sanctuary in the southern oceans.
'The problem is that the IWC has become an environment protection group and
not a whaling management association,' said Mr Hamanaka, who was yesterday
guiding a Danish delegation around the town. 'The IWC was never intended to
be a love-the-animals commission.'
Taiji is determined to convince visitors that the whaling history in the
region, traced back more than 1,000 years, has taught the town to understand
and 'love' the whales.
Most of the residents still have links with the fishing industry, but the
town is not much interested in presenting itself as another fishing port,
and wants to be known as 'the town living with the whales.'
The result is a marine park, where killer whales charm tourists with their
intelligence and tricks, a whale museum, whale meat restaurants, and
whale-shaped boats which cruise the nearby islands.
But the fluffy whale toys, the key rings, and blow-up mammals are not enough
to satisfy the Taiji Fishermen's Co-operative which wants to get back into
the business of whale hunting.
The co-operative takes the whaling ban personally and nationalistically,
seeing Japan as suffering unfairly at the hands of the international
community. The co-operative's members complained that the people of Taiji
are victims because the IWC does not understand the tradition of whaling
culture in Japan.
That tradition is displayed in the local museum, where an old whaling boat
has been reconstructed, and benign-faced whalers spear their prey. But the
question of whether whales will survive modern whaling techniques is raised
by Kyomaru No. 11, a harpoon boat beached at the opposite end of Whale Park.
The Kyomaru No. 11 takes credit for a haul of 12,638 whales and was part of
a fleet which scoured the Antarctic in the 1960s and 1970s, bringing home
the carcasses not for the local community, but for large Tokyo and Osaka
companies.
Mr Hamanaka says Taiji's immediate ambition is to return to a
community-based whaling programme, not large hauls for Tokyo companies. But
a Japanese proposal for a community-based quota of 50 whales was rejected
last week by a majority of IWC member nations.
'We didn't win that vote, but I think we are starting to improve
international understanding,' the mayor said. 'But western nations must
remember to respect our culture.'

FT  17 MAY 93 / Demirel presidency leaves vacuum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Suleyman Demirel yesterday won election as Turkey's ninth president,
after failing to get the two-thirds majority he needed in the first two
rounds of voting last week. His election, however, pitches the country into
political uncertainty during the selection of his successor in the post of
prime minister.
Mr Demirel, 68, was formally sworn in last night for a seven-year term. He
won 244 votes, a straight majority, in the third ballot of the 450-member
Grand National Assembly. Deputy prime minister Erdal Inonu takes over as
caretaker premier while Mr Demirel's True Path party (DYP) decides on a
successor.
Mr Demirel leaves a coalition government without strong leadership during a
difficult period. Economic reforms are stalled, the government is at a
watershed in the Kurdish rebellion, and the country is over-extended on
several foreign policy fronts from the Balkans to the Caucasus and north
Iraq.
Moreover, the search for a new leader could put considerable strain on the
coalition between the DYP and Mr Inonu's junior partner Social Democratic
Populists (SHP), whose cohabitation has become difficult.
With a special DYP leadership congress due within 45 days, four names have
emerged: house speaker Husamettin Cindoruk, economics minister Mrs Tansu
Ciller, interior minister Mr Ismet Sezgin and state minister Mr Cavit
Caglar, widely seen as Mr Demirel's own choice.
The choice of party leader and therefore premier will determine the extent
to which Mr Demirel continues to influence policy.
Under the 1982 constitution, the presidency is a largely ceremonial
position. Mr Demirel attacked the late president Turgut Ozal for using his
office for partisan purposes.
Mr Demirel is adamant he will be a 'constitutional' president. But all the
candidates except Mr Cindoruk won their political spurs through Mr Demirel's
patronage. For this reason alone, Mr Demirel is expected to exert
considerable influence over policy.
His accession marks the pinnacle of a career spanning 30 years in which he
has been prime minister seven times, twice ousted by the military.
It required a national referendum - passed by the narrowest of majorities -
for him to be allowed to return to active politics after the last coup in
1980.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Israeli government starts bank sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Jerusalem Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S finance minister, Mr Abraham Shochat, yesterday announced the sale
of 60 per cent of the shares in the country's Union Bank, calling the deal
'a turning point' in the government's programme to sell off its bank shares
to the private sector.
Mr Shochat said that the Eliahu Group, a group of private investors headed
by Shlomo Eliahu, had valued the Union Bank at Dollars 140m (Pounds 90.9m)
and had agreed to pay Dollars 85m for 60 per cent of the shares.
The Union Bank is not one of Israel's leading banks, but Mr Shochat welcomed
the sale as 'the beginning of a process' that would see the government
ultimately divest itself of its controlling interest in the banking system.
He said the government hoped in the near future to sell off 20 per cent of
the shares in Israel's largest bank, Bank Hapoalim, which has assets
estimated at Dollars 40bn.
The Israeli government became the effective owner of the country's banks a
decade ago, after the October 1983 bank shares crisis. For years the banks
had artificially boosted their own share prices, with stockholders treating
their shares as government guaranteed bonds. A mass rush to sell the shares
in October 1983, however, triggered the collapse of the national banking
system, leaving the government with little alternative but to bail out the
banks at a cost of more than Dollars 9bn.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Kantor in the firing line for excess zeal on Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration may have run foul of US government ethics laws in
its zeal to drum up support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Congressional critics say Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative
(USTR), may have overstepped the line by setting up a coalition of
governors, mayors and state legislators in favour of Nafta, breaching a
prohibition on any use of government money to organise a lobbying effort.
Congressman Collin Peterson, chairman of a House of Representatives
government operations sub-committee, has asked the General Accounting Office
to investigate USTR's involvement in the Nafta coalition, which he says
raises 'serious questions about potential ethical violations and possible
criminal activities on the part of USTR officials and employees'.
Mr Peterson leads an anti-Nafta coalition in Congress.
Trade has become a highly politicised issue under President Bill Clinton, as
the administration has sought to build popular acceptance of economic
benefits within free trade agreements such as Nafta or the Uruguay Round of
negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
At the same time, however, it has sought to stem protectionist currents in
public opinion by taking tough enforcement measures against countries such
as Japan.
Signalling the high priority Mr Clinton attaches to trade policy, Mr Kantor
will, unusually, be joining heads of government, finance ministers and
foreign ministers at the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations in July.
Although the US criminal code appears to impose a blanket ban on any use of
government money to attempt to influence a member of Congress in any way,
the law is in practice grey; administration officials are free to lobby
Congress themselves, and may advise or inform outside groups.
Congressional aides suggest that USTR clearly overstepped that line by
actually organising the Nafta coalition, to the extent of issuing press
releases on its formation.
In a statement responding to Mr Peterson's letter, USTR insisted that the
pro-Nafta coalition was entirely independent.
'At no time did anyone at USTR directly or indirectly ask any individual to
lobby the Congress. No US officials will be involved in staffing or funding
the activities of this group,' the statement said.
Some elected officials listed as members of the coalition, however, said Mr
Kantor's office had contacted them about joining.
'I don't know if it began in the White House or began in Mickey Kantor's
office, but it is Mickey Kantor's office that actually got in touch with me
about being a part of this,' said Mr Richard Raymond, a Texas state
representative.
Some experienced former officials from Congress and the administration
yesterday agreed that the Nafta coalition went beyond past efforts to win
support for administration policy.
Mr Leonard Santos, a lawyer with the Washington firm of Perkins Coie and
former trade counsel to the Senate finance committee, said it was 'certainly
outside the norm,' although less blatant efforts to stimulate grassroots
lobbying were common.
Other Washington trade specialists, however, viewed the action as well
within normal usage.
Violations of the lobbying law are punishable by a small fine or prison
sentence, but also by removal from office.

FT  17 MAY 93 / US weighs action against Chilean over arms for Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Department of Justice is facing a politically delicate decision on
whether to indict a top Chilean arms dealer who used US technology in
large-scale weapons sales to Iraq.
Mr Carlos Cardoen, who made a fortune in the 1980s as one of the biggest
suppliers of cluster bombs and other weapons to Baghdad, has been under
investigation since 1991 by US law enforcement agencies and federal
prosecutors in Miami.
The Clinton administration's decision on the Cardoen case - expected in the
next fortnight - could also have repercussions on other politically
sensitive US prosecutions related to the arming of Iraq.
A year ago US prosecutors filed a civil suit against Mr Cardoen, accusing
him of money laundering and of illegally exporting 100 tonnes of zirconium
from the US to Chile in the 1980s; zirconium is a material that can be used
in cluster bombs or other armaments.
US government officials have told the Financial Times that a criminal
indictment of Mr Cardoen for the zirconium deal was due to be unveiled
earlier this year, but was put on hold after new information was provided to
prosecutors by the CIA.
The CIA information indicated US government awareness as far back as 1984 of
Mr Cardoen's likely military use of the zirconium shipments. At the weekend
Mr Cardoen was quoted in the US as saying American officials were aware of
his work in arming Iraq and of the planned use of the US shipments of
zirconium.
He has also stated he communicated with the CIA about his Iraqi dealings,
contradicting past denials by the Bush administration that the US
intelligence agency had ever had any relationship with Mr Cardoen.
Mr Cardoen's claim that the Reagan and Bush administrations knew precisely
what he was doing mirrors the defence in London last year of former
executives of Matrix-Churchill, the UK machine tools company that was a
Cardoen business partner and also supplied Iraq.
Other pending Iraq-related US cases could be affected by the Clinton
administration's decision on Mr Cardoen, including the planned September
trial of Mr Christopher Drogoul, former manager of the Atlanta branch of
Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Mr Drogoul was accused by the Bush
administration of single-handedly organising Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of
clandestine Iraqi loans that helped to finance Baghdad's war machine.
BNL Atlanta provided letters of credit that indirectly financed equipment
shipped to Mr Cardoen by Matrix-Churchill, the company at the heart of the
present arms-to-Iraq inquiry being conducted in London by Lord Justice
Scott.
The Matrix-Churchill case collapsed last autumn after it was revealed that
key executives were working with British intelligence services and receiving
the UK government's blessing for their sales of militarily useful equipment
to Iraq.
Mr Drogoul has claimed his activities were known about and approved by the
Reagan and Bush administrations, and by BNL headquarters in Rome. The bank's
head office has denied any knowledge of the BNL Atlanta loans.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Palestinians kill four in Gaza Strip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Jerusalem Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Israelis and two Arabs were shot dead by Palestinians in the occupied
Gaza Strip yesterday, in the worst attack since the Israeli government
sealed off the occupied territories almost two months ago.
The four men were trading vegetables outside a greenhouse at the Jewish
settlement of Gadid, in the south of the strip, when gunmen opened fire from
a passing car.
The Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement and the Fatah wing of the PLO -
usually bitter rivals for Palestinian support in the territories - took
responsibility for the killings in an unprecedented joint statement.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Danish PM attacks opponents as Yes vote grows
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANISH political debate over the country's second referendum on the
Maastricht treaty grew more bitter at the weekend as the final opinion polls
before tomorrow's vote showed a modest strengthening of the Yes vote.
A Gallup survey, due for publication today, showed 50 per cent in favour of
the treaty, the No vote little changed at 32 per cent, and 18 per cent
undecided or not planning to vote.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democrat prime minister, sharpened his
attack on opponents, using terms unusually harsh for Danish politics.
'They're raving mad,' he declared in a Sunday newspaper.
At the only campaign meeting where he has met a leader of the left-leaning
June Movement, the biggest of the anti-Maastricht organisations,
face-to-face, he lashed out at his opponent, Prof Niels I Meyer, a
physicist.
'The June Movement claims that Danish democracy will disappear if there is a
Yes vote on Tuesday. I am astonished that well-educated people, even
professors, can say this without blushing or a tremor in their voices,' he
said.
The prime minister is apparently not alone in thinking the No movements are
unconvincing. A newspaper poll yesterday showed that leaders of the
pro-Maastrict campaign were regarded as more reliable than the June
Movement's leaders.
Danes appear to be preparing to turn out to vote in record numbers, judging
by the advance postal vote, which is 13 per cent up on last year.
After a campaign marked by poorly attended election meetings and low viewer
ratings for television campaign programmes, the size of the postal vote has
come as a surprise.
In last year's referendum, the verdict was 50.7 per cent against the treaty,
with 49.3 per cent in favour.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Bosnian Serb voters set to reject peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb soldiers queueing up to vote yesterday in the Bosnian Serb
referendum on the Vance-Owen peace plan, near the northern Bosnian town of
Brcko, the scene of fierce fighting between Serb and Moslem forces over the
weekend.
An overwhelming No vote is expected on the UN-backed peace plan which
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic declared was dead. General Ratko
Mladic, the Bosnian Serb army commander, threatened bomb attacks in London
and Washington if the west tried to intervene to force Serbs to accept it.
Meanwhile, Russia suggested the peace plan should be implemented regardless
of the outcome of the referendum.
In Mostar, south-western Bosnia, Croat forces launched a fierce assault with
missiles and artillery on Moslem positions.

FT  17 MAY 93 / EC predicts year of no growth: Commission to issue
downgraded forecast after Maastricht referendum in Denmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC has sharply downgraded its economic forecast for this year, according
to internal estimates which the European Commission plans not to release
until after tomorrow's Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
The revised forecast of zero to 'slightly negative' growth compares with
earlier official predictions of 0.75 per cent growth. The slowdown threatens
to push EC unemployment beyond its present level of 17.4m, renewing doubts
about member states' willingness to follow Maastricht's tough 'convergence'
criteria for European monetary union.
It also threatens to prompt a crisis in the EC budget, where falling
revenues have already forced the Commission to leave 1,000 posts unfilled.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, paid a discreet visit to
Bonn last Thursday for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl to discuss the
deteriorating outlook for the EC economy and how to co-ordinate the position
after the Danish referendum.
Yesterday, Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, came out in
favour of amending the convergence criteria.
EC finance ministers and the European Commission have generally avoided
suggesting that the Emu criteria covering inflation, budget deficits and
ratios of government debt to GDP should be changed. They fear undermining
budget discipline and upsetting the German Bundesbank, which has ruled out
short cuts to a single European currency.
Mr Maystadt's comments reflect concern in Brussels about the short-term
deflationary impact of the convergence criteria on growth. They are likely
to arouse attention because Belgium takes over the EC presidency from
Denmark on July 1 and is often seen as a candidate for an inner-core
monetary union.
The latest European Commission forecasts support the International Monetary
Fund's prediction in April that growth in the EC would be flat this year.
They confirm the impact of the German recession on the European economy, but
are believed to support the UK government's view that Britain is likely to
grow faster than its main European competitors this year.
Mr Henning Christophersen, the Danish Commissioner responsible for
economics, has delayed amending his 0.75 per cent forecast until the last
minute.
Like many of his fellow commissioners, Mr Christophersen has argued that a
Danish Yes vote would speed ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the UK,
spurring an improvement in business confidence.
Mr Delors is expected to use the new, gloomy forecasts to press EC member
states to beef up the Community's 'growth package' in the run-up to the
Copenhagen summit.
The plan mixes national measures such as a shift from current to capital
spending on infrastructure and housing, with modest new EC lending to small
and medium-sized businesses.
The EC budget is already overstretched.
The freeze on personnel results largely from a rapid rise in pension costs
for retiring EC officials who joined the Community at its inception in 1958.
Officials also point to the wave of recent currency devaluations in the
exchange rate mechanism.
These have reduced the value of the Ecu, the unit in which all EC spending
is calculated, by about 5 per cent.

FT  17 MAY 93 / Clarke reassures sceptics with ERM pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke underpinned his claim to the chancellorship by reassuring
the Euro-sceptic wing of the Tory party yesterday he would not seek
sterling's early return to the European exchange rate mechanism.
The home secretary's suggestion that ERM re-entry might be delayed beyond
the general election due by 1997 came as the semi-public debate among
ministers about Mr Norman Lamont's future at the Treasury intensified
pressure on Mr John Major to bring forward his expected summer cabinet
reshuffle.
Some senior members of the government want the reshuffle during the Whitsun
recess at the end of this month. Friends of Mr Lamont, however, said he had
received no indication in conversations with the prime minister that Mr
Major had already decided to replace him.
Mr Lamont was said to be 'getting on' with preparations for November's
unified Budget. It was also pointed out in the chancellor's support that it
was only at Mr Lamont's insistence that the government removed from the
Maastricht treaty a provision that would have made ERM membership a legal
obligation.
Mr Clarke's comments coincided with admissions from other 'pro-European'
ministers in the cabinet that they have all but abandoned hope in anything
but the long term of retying the sterling to the D-Mark.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said it was 'very
difficult to see' Britain fulfilling the condition in the Maastricht treaty
that all currencies should be in the narrow bands of the ERM by the end of
1994. Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, echoed that view.
Mr Clarke, a favourite to replace Mr Lamont, went further. He said that he
would be 'surprised' if the pound rejoined the ERM during the lifetime of
the present parliament.
His statement was interpreted by supporters of the home secretary as
providing clear evidence that Mr Major could appoint him chancellor without
risking a renewed split in the Conservative party over Europe.
In the past, Mr Clarke's known enthusiasm for Europe and for the ERM have
brought warnings from the Euro-sceptics and their allies on the Tory right
that they would not tolerate his appointment as chancellor.
Speaking to Sir David Frost on BBC Television, though, he said his
well-known commitment to exchange rate stability did not imply an early
return to the ERM.
'At the moment . . . the circumstances for our return to the ERM simply
don't exist'. Stressing the lack of convergence among European economies he
added: 'So I would be surprised if we were back (in the mechanism) before
the end of this parliament.'
In a typically forthright interview, Mr Clarke readily acknowledged his
ambition ultimately to be prime minister. But, dismissing suggestions of a
challenge to the present incumbent, he added that he was sure that Mr Major
would remain as prime minister for 'many years to come'.
Mr Heseltine also downplayed Westminster speculation that Mr Major's
position will come under serious threat unless he moves quickly to restore
his authority.

FT  17 MAY 93 / IBM chief halts plans to break up computer group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LOU Gerstner, International Business Machines' newly appointed chairman
and chief executive, has stopped plans to break up the world's largest
computer company.
Mr John Akers, who last month stepped aside as IBM chairman and chief
executive in the wake of 1992 losses of almost Dollars 5bn, had planned to
sell interests in large parts of the business, which last year generated
sales of Dollars 64.5 bn (Pounds 41.8bn).
Mr Gerstner has told the group's managers that 'the whole of IBM is greater
than the sum of the parts', and that he had reversed the strategy.
Mr Akers had spoken of plans for 'variable IBM ownership across the range of
businesses . . . from wholly owned, to majority-owned, and minority-owned,
or none at all,' when he announced the planned restructuring 17 months ago.
The strategy had been proposed to find alternative ownership for Adstar,
IBM's data storage products business, with sales of Dollars 6.1bn; Pennant
Systems, the company's Dollars 2.3bn printer subsidiary; and IBM Personal
Computers, a Dollars 9.8bn business.
As recently as last December, Mr Frank Metz, former IBM chief financial
officer, said the company was moving fast in gathering the separate
financial data needed to complete the restructuring.
Although officials now discourage any speculation about spin-offs or
divestment, Mr Akers' goal of decentralising IBM's management has survived.
Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM's vice-chairman, said the group was determined to
decentralise decision-making and establish sound financial objectives for
business unit managers. 'Corporate management is trying to create the
environment and remove the impediments to enable our people to take
advantage of our technology leadership,' he said
Mr Gerstner's determination to keep IBM intact appears to have been a factor
in his selection as the first company 'outsider' to head the world's largest
computer manufacturer. Some of the other potential candidates for the post,
including John Sculley, Apple Computer chairman and chief executive, had
more radical ideas.
Mr Sculley, who confirmed that he had proposed a merger of Apple and IBM to
members of IBM's management committee earlier this year, is also believed to
have suggested that IBM sell off its Dollars 12.7bn mainframe computer
business.
Mr Gerstner's rejection of a wholesale break-up of IBM may not signal
complete reluctance to take drastic action. IBM executives now acknowledge
that the company may need to shed far more workers than the 'more than
25,000' already estimated.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Markets: A note of new issue caution - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOOD of new issues in the last year has proved a rich seam for
investors but professionals are beginning to caution restraint.
New stocks have been among the best performers in the stock market this
year. Tadpole Technology, for example, which reported its first profit
yesterday, has risen from 65p to 307p. A more modest new issue increase has
been Quality Care Homes', up 72 per cent at 234p since it floated last year.
So robust has been the renewed private interest in new issues - and concern
that they have been kept way from placings like Tadpole and Quality Care
Homes - that the Stock Exchange has tightened its listing rules again to
ensure better access for the public.
But some brokers and fund managers are beginning to question the quality of
some of the stocks coming to market. One wondered whether private investors
were not becoming too indiscriminate.
The prevailing sense that new issues could not fail reminded him of the old
advice to sell as soon as the stock market becomes so popular that even the
hotel bell-hop starts giving share tips.
With interest rates so low, migration towards the stock market is not
surprising. The difficulty is how to spot which new companies to avoid and
which are coming to market at the right moment in their development.
Particularly worrying is the preponderance of companies floating at a very
early stage of development. A number demonstrate very exciting potential and
tell fascinating stories but are simply inexperienced.
'The companies have a record in their field and the credibility of the
people involved is very high,' says one fund manager. 'But you just don't
know if they are going to sell their product.'
Tepnel Diagnostics, which makes equipment to identify contamination in food,
is perhaps the most extreme example. It had no sales when it came to market
but shares have nearly doubled to 233p.
Anagen, a medical diagnostic company due to come to market next month, is in
a similar position. It has powerful backing from an international
distributor. But again the product is not fully developed for a mass market.
A third company, Drew Scientific, another diagnostic equipment company that
is coming to market via a placing next week, has a product and markets. But
it has limited experience of continuous manufacturing at the volumes it is
anticipating.
Of course if such companies get their product and marketing right, the
operational gearing of a low-cost manufacturing base can do wonders and the
shares may outperform.
This appetite for new issues - perhaps best demonstrated by the six times
over-subscription for David Lloyd Leisure - has had a knock on effect on
price. If the last issue to market went immediately to a 20 per cent
premium, the next sponsor tweaks his price. Not only the risk but the price
of new issues may be rising.
For private investors not put off by growing professional wariness, there
are a number of imminent issues. BT3, the sale of the government's remaining
21 per cent stake, is expected in mid-July. More cautious investors may be
attracted by what should be an above average yield.
At the other end of the scale is OGC International, the offshore oil and gas
contractor, for which the offer closes on Wednesday. OGC last year made
Pounds 10.5m on sales of Pounds 226.6m.
Fleming Claverhouse, the investment trust, is hoping to raise up to Pounds
100m in an offer of conversion shares that closes on June 4. And pathfinder
prospectus are expected soon from Court Cavendish, the UK nursing home
operator, Inveresk, the speciality paper maker and RPC, the rigid plastic
packaging group.
The prospect of commission-free purchase of shares that immediately move to
a premium may prove too difficult to resist. But even stags have to be
careful.
'The temptation is to put the profits of one issue into the next, says one
institutional investor. 'But there is bound to be a howler and then the
appetite for new issues will wane.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London International Group should know perfectly well that the fact that
everyone else is at it is no excuse for not taking precautions. Since, for
once, it had firm evidence to go on, the stock exchange was right to censure
it for selective dissemination of information. Companies such as LIG may
like to prepare the market for disappointing news, but it is difficult to
defend a procedure that gave 13 analysts and four institutions an advantage
over the rest of the market. If that is common practice, as LIG claims, it
is only because such clear infringements of the exchange's rules are
difficult to prove.
The exchange seems inclined to try harder after the Tiphook insider
controversy and the Thorold Mackie case in Scotland. If it is interested in
the integrity of its markets, the City should wish it luck. Tomkins showed
this week that extensive disclosure still leaves a role for analysts. Its
statement on the integration of RHM may have been mainly designed to boost
its share price, but it was also a good example of how private briefing can
be combined with public information. While wielding a bigger stick, the
exchange should be sure to encourage this approach. Otherwise companies may
end up disclosing even less.

FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SMS reverses into Osprey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Osprey Communications, the marketing services and advertising
group temporariliy suspended on Thursday at 26p, yesterday jumped 6 1/2 p to
32 1/2 p following news that SMS Communications Group had reversed into it.
Osprey will allot 4.5m ordinary shares of 25p and pay Pounds 500,000 in cash
to the vendors - a total value of Pounds 1.63m. Osprey is also to launch a
rights issue on a 1-for-3 basis to raise Pounds 1.3m net.
SMS is headed by Mr Jack Rubins who was previously chairman and chief
executive of Dorland, the UK's second biggest advertising agency and a
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi subsidiary, and group chairman of McCann-Erickson, the US
advertising group.
On completion of the current deal, Mr Rubins will become chairman and chief
executive of Osprey, replacing Mr John French, who will retire. Furthermore
Mr Rubins will have a personal stake of about 21 per cent - and consequently
effective control - of the new Osprey.
Completion, however, hinges on the successful disposal of Osprey's marketing
services side to its management for an initial Pounds 2m cash and a deferred
Pounds 200,000 depending on post-tax profits and assets at May 31.
Osprey felt the division had not managed sufficient growth in its main
tourism and travel markets as a result of the squeeze on client budgets and
'increasingly competitive conditions'. It was expected to make a loss in the
current year. Consequently, Osprey needed to revert to its advertising core.
Also, it can safely be assumed that Mr Rubins would not want involvement
with a company with anything more than negligible gearing. The proceeds of
the rights issue and the disposal will all but wipe out Osprey's short-term
borrowings and will enable it to pay the cash element of the SMS
acquisition.
Some 60 per cent of SMS' business in the year to October 1992 derived from
its BSkyB billings. It is thought that Mr Rubins would not have reversed
into Osprey without assurances from the satellite TV service that the
account would stay put. It is thought that BSkyB will account for about 15
per cent of the new Osprey's billings.

FT  15 MAY 93 / How soccer's dream ticket fell foul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR and JANE FULLER

<TEXT>
MR Alan Sugar, chairman of Amstrad and Tottenham Hotspur, is not known for
his cool temperament. He once admitted: 'I have got a terrible temper,
violent, wild; I bang the table and scream and shout.'
He is rarely lost for words and he does not take kindly to being told what
to do. So it must be rather difficult for him to comply with legal advice
that he say nothing about the boardroom bust-up with Mr Terry Venables, the
club's chief executive who was sacked as Tottenham's chief executive
yesterday and then re-instated last night on the orders of the High Court.
Whatever the immediate cause of the falling-out, it has been an open secret
that the relationship between the two Eastenders has slid downhill ever
since Mr Venables persuaded Mr Sugar to help him buy the club to thwart a
takeover bid by Robert Maxwell. That was two years ago  - the year Mr
Venables steered Spurs to FA Cup victory.
In the event it seems Mr Sugar wanted Mr Venables to stick to football and
leave the business side to him.
He was once quoted as saying that he would look after the Pounds 11m debt to
the bank while Mr Venables would look after the 11 men on the field.
This was bound to conflict with Mr Venables' ambitions of graduating from
football management to business management. And the strong coaching team,
headed by Doug Livermore and Ray Clemence, was designed to lighten the
training burden on him.
It should have come as no surprise that Mr Sugar would be the boss. He made
its clear during his abortive 30p-a-share buy-back bid for Amstrad  -
rejected by shareholders as being too cheap - that one of the key reasons he
wanted to take Amstrad back into the private sector was because he feels
instinctively more comfortable when he has day-to-day direct control.
When he took over Spurs with Mr Venables, it was regarded as a dream ticket
 -two East End boys working together, one looking after the finances and the
other looking after the football. The falling-out has been equally dramatic.
There appears to be no obvious reason for the split. The company turned a
Pounds 1.78m pre-tax loss into a Pounds 2.66m profit in 1991-92 and is
forecast to make Pounds 5m pre-tax in the year just ending, albeit boosted
by a Pounds 3m gain on player sales inflated by the Paul Gascoigne deal.
The share price, however, has typically traded well below the 125p rights
issue price.
It would seem the two men, from similar backgrounds, could just not get
along. For Mr Venables yesterday marked the lowest point in a colourful
football and business career. The former Tottenham manager, 'Son of Fred' -
to quote the title of his autobiography - came from a council estate in
Dagenham to enjoy success on and off the soccer field.
He played for England at every level including schoolboy, youth and under-23
teams. He followed this by managing Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace
before going to coach Barcelona - one of the biggest clubs in the world -
which led to the Spanish League title in his first year.
Off the field he has had a modest success as an author co-writing the Hazel
detective novels, and has run several pubs and clubs.
He risked personal ruin to buy into Spurs with Mr Sugar after the former
chairman Mr Irving Scholar had been ousted and a rival bid by Robert Maxwell
had been fended off.
Mr Sugar has often acknowledged that he is not really a 'team player'. He
also showed ruthlessness early on at Tottenham. He sacked Mr Ian Gray as
managing director and Brown Shipley &amp; Co as financial advisers. Both parties
launched litigation.
He also led the charge not just for Tottenham but for many of the Premier
League clubs in negotiating a lucrative deal with BSkyB, the satellite
broadcaster in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. The
bagging of live Premier League matches for satellite TV has provided an
obvious fillip to dish sales - one of Amstrad's lines.
Mr Sugar does not forgive and forget, either. When his old friend Mr Gulu
Lalvani, head of the Binatone private electronics group and the man who gave
Mr Sugar his first break, interviewed and then hired Mr Bob Watkins,
Amstrad's technical director, Mr Sugar broke off the friendship.
Some who know the private and reportedly rather shy Mr Sugar say much of his
street-wise style reflects his upbringing in an east London council house.
Others including Lord Young, who first met him at a Downing Street seminar,
have suggested that his apparent unease in government and City circles
reflected insecurity.
But Mr Sugar is also a chameleon. Charming when he needs to be, he is the
reverse if angry. His wife Ann has said he enjoys the spotlight so much so
that he ought to be on the stage.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Venables regains Tottenham post after court injunction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER, ALAN CANE and DAVID HELLIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY VENABLES, the football manager turned entrepreneur, was reinstated
as chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur last night just hours after being
sacked in a boardroom battle with Mr Alan Sugar, the self-made electronics
millionaire.
A High Court judge ordered Mr Venables be reinstated until a further court
hearing on May 25.
Mr Venables, who played a key role in rescuing Tottenham two years ago, had
applied for an emergency injunction on the grounds that his dismissal was
not in the football club's best interests.
Last night, the club issued a statement saying it had not been given a
chance to give evidence to the court but would do so when the hearing
reconvened.
Earlier, in a day of high drama, Mr Venables, a former Tottenham player,
emerged from an hour-long board meeting to announce that he had been sacked
as chief executive and would be consulting his solicitor. The meeting was
reported to have been dominated by Mr Sugar, chairman of the holding company
which owns and runs the north London club.
Mr Venables' dismissal, at the hands of the man he brought in to help rescue
the club, shocked fans and provoked outbursts from some players.
Tottenham has just completed a relatively successful season, finishing
eighth in the Premier League and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup.
Mr Sugar, who is also chairman of Amstrad, the electronics company, has
invested more than Pounds 10m in Tottenham and now owns 48 per cent of the
equity.
After yesterday's board meeting, he told downcast staff at the club's White
Hart Lane ground that there had been a difference of opinion between himself
and Mr Venables. Only one person could run the club.
There was also an unexplained reference to 'a particular group' that was
said to be influencing Mr Venables.
Mr Sugar praised the former chief executive's football management skills,
but was critical of his activities on the commercial side. He described as
ludicrous any suggestion that he wanted to be involved in team selection or
team management. Mr Venables is reported to have accused Mr Sugar of wanting
to run the whole thing.
If Mr Venables is removed from his Tottenham post, it could prove a heavy
financial blow. He has put about Pounds 3m into the club - much of it
borrowed - taking his stake to 22 per cent. At yesterday's closing price of
89p, this was worth Pounds 3.2m - not enough to cover his financing costs.
However, Mr Venables could claim the best part of Pounds 1m from the club.
According to the rights issue document, he was earning Pounds 225,000 a year
on a five-year contract running to July 1996. He was also entitled to about
1.5 per cent of pre-tax profits and a year's notice.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Man in the News: Return of the Invisible Man - Jacques
Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barring the odd volcanic outburst, Mr Jacques Delors has been a model of
self-restraint this year. The president of the European Commission has
assumed such a low profile that Brussels officials joke that the man known
as Mr Europe has turned into Mr Invisible.
But if the polls are correct and Danish voters approve the Maastricht treaty
in next Tuesday's referendum, Mr Delors intends to mount a comeback. This
may come as a surprise to those in Britain and elsewhere who dismiss the
67-year-old Frenchman and his vision of a federalist Europe as a busted
flush. But Mr Delors, with one eye on the French presidency in the 1995
elections, still sees himself as a present and future leader in Europe.
One of Mr Delors' residual strengths is that he is not afraid of entering
areas where others fear tread. Hence his decision to order an in-depth
European Commission study of whether Europe is losing the battle to remain
competitive with the US and Asia. This is more than an academic study about
why there are 17m people out of work in EC. According to aides, the
Commission president is prepared to tackle the sensitive question of whether
Europe's welfare state is indirectly contributing to low growth, rising
unemployment and the failure to create new jobs.
Now, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Delors, a Christian and a socialist
from peasant stock, has undergone a midnight conversion and decided to
create a US-style society in Europe; nor is there any sign that Mr Delors
intends to encourage the Commission to put forward legislation. On that
count, at least, his ambitions for Brussels have been blunted beyond repair.
Mr Delors simply wants a public debate. For just as he anticipated the
political tide was moving in favour of economic and political integration in
the 1980s, so he now suspects that another shift is underway in the 1990s,
one which could undermine the social policies which he has championed.
What is worrying Mr Delors is that Europe seems to be losing its capacity to
generate new jobs. Between 1983 and 1990, the EC generated 9.4m net new
jobs, partly in anticipation of the single European market; since 1990 it
has lost a net 1.4m jobs. Low growth in the EC in 1993 and 1994 means no
immediate dent in the dole queues.
The second area of concern is the Maastricht treaty's squeeze on budget
deficits. This is a natural consequence of the 'convergence' programmes  -
the path of economic virtue which member states must tread to meet the
requirements for European monetary union. But hard-pressed governments
looking for savings are naturally tempted to look at cuts in social spending
to meet the targets, all the more so in a deeper-than-expected recession.
Mr Delors says it is time to 'pull the alarm chain'. The pace of
technological change means that the competitiveness question will not go
away. In Switzerland, workers are paid Dollars 20 an hour, 85 times more
than in China. Growth rates in east Asia dwarf the EC's. 'How in Europe can
we ensure minimum employment and preserve the social dimension,' he asked
recently.
Events in Germany suggest that Mr Delors is on to something. The deal
between engineering employers and trade unions, reached yesterday, to delay
raising eastern wages to western levels until 1996, is one straw in the
wind. Just as telling was last week's decision by the leading private German
industrial lobbies to reject government plans for a new social insurance
surcharge for workers and employers. The idea was to finance residential
care for the chronically sick and elderly with a DM13bn (Pounds 5.2bn)
spending package. But the employers described the package as a direct threat
to jobs and investment.
Mr Delors frets, too, about the UK. He is irritated by the ruling British
Conservative party flaunting its opposition to the Maastricht treaty's
social chapter. While he bears no grudges against the UK government's
success in boosting growth, he remains worried that other EC countries may
be tempted to follow the British model, either engaging in competitive
devaluations or floating their currencies outside the European exchange rate
mechanism. This week's forced devaluations of the Spanish peseta and the
Portuguese escudo seemed to confirm Mr Delors's fears.
Mr Delors recently declared that Europe faces a choice between survival and
decline. What he is really saying is that his own legacy - eight years
during which he has been by far the most impressive Commission president in
history - is at risk. This means the single market; the Emu programme; the
Delors II spending package to bridge the gap between the richer north and
the poorer south; and lastly the social policies which Mr Delors fought for
in the Maastricht negotiations. These policies, he insists, are the price
which EC member states must pay if their citizens are to be persuaded of the
economic sacrifices necessary to create a single European currency.
Ever since the first Danish referendum last June, Mr Delors has been forced
to come to terms with a painful political fact - the national debates on
Maastricht, notably in his native France, have opened up a huge gap between
what the 12 EC governments were able to agree and what European public
opinion is able to accept. Narrowing that gap is the great challenge of his
remaining 18 months as president.
The Delors study on Europe's unemployment crisis is partly an attempt to
bridge the gap, to make the Community more relevant to its citizens. The
main focus will be on job creation, partly through better training, a more
efficient use of the Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.74bn) social funds in Brussels, and
new fiscal incentives for keeping people in work.
On the question of French presidential ambitions, Mr Delors is keeping his
options open. But those who know him suggest that he is unwilling to have a
straight fight with Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist party's standard-bearer.
'Only if Rocard clearly fails, will Delors enter,' says one EC official.
This may reflect a lack of killer instinct, a curious failing in a
politician as successful as Mr Delors. It could be the greatest obstacle to
a comeback.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: The great leap forward - Doing the
splits / Split capital trusts are investment trusts with several different
classes of share, designed to appeal to as many investors as possible. They
can be highly tax-efficient, but they can also be risky and confusing. In a
new series, Philip Coggan will examine the structure and records of some of
the leading split trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1987, River &amp; Mercantile made a leap into the unknown. It was one of the
first big trusts to create the modern fashion for a split capital structure.
Its success has allowed its managers to offer a range of similar trusts and
enabled the trust to expand via a rights issue in 1991.
The trust was founded in 1881 as the River Plate Trust and Loan Agency
Company to finance the development of the pastoral industry in Argentina.
The name change to River &amp; Mercantile occurred in 1962 but the company did
not formally become an investment trust until 1975.
After more than a decade as a UK income trust, the change to split capital
status was aimed at eliminating the discount to net assets, a problem that
plagued all investment trusts in the 1980s. Since the package of shares
currently stands at a premium to asset value six years later, the move must
be counted a success.
As with a conventional investment trust, the assets of a split capital trust
are invested in shares and other securities. What makes a split different is
that the rights over those assets are divided in unconventional ways. The
earliest type of structure was to give all the revenue to one class of
shareholder and all the capital growth to the rest. But there are infinite
possibilities and investors need to be clear what they are buying.
In the case of River &amp; Mercantile, there are four classes; preference,
stepped preference, income and capital, plus warrants on the capital shares.
There is a fairly small amount of preference shares in issue, which pay a
fixed rate of 5 per cent. The other three classes of shares are really the
key to the trust. The stepped preference shares have the right to receive a
5 per cent annual increase in dividend, plus a 5 per cent increase in asset
backing. The repayment value of the shares, when the trust is wound up in
1999, is scheduled to be 188.6p. At the end of 1992, the net assets per
stepped preference share were 134.01p. The initial price in 1987 was 100p.
The dividend for 1992 was 5.36p and for the current year, it will be just
under 5.63p. At a price of around 149p, the shares are on a yield of around
4.7 per cent.
Someone who buys a stepped preference share is therefore buying a relatively
safe security - one which will not make them rich but which will allow for
steady dividend growth.
The income shares have the right to the revenue of the trust after the
preference and stepped preference shareholders have been paid. Dividends are
paid quarterly and for 1992, the total dividend was 9.2p. Antony Foucar, the
chairman, says the board intends to maintain that dividend this year.
The shares were initially priced at 100p and have the right to be repaid at
100p on the wind-up date in 1999. However, the income shares will only be
repaid after the preference and stepped preference shares have their
entitlement.
Any income-seeking investor needs to be aware that buying the shares at the
current price (around 115p) involves locking in a capital loss. The flat
yield looks attractive at 10 per cent, but if the dividend fails to grow
between now and 1999, the gross redemption yield (which allows for both
income and capital loss) falls to 9.7 per cent, according to analyst Lewis
Aaron at SG Warburg.
However, potential capital loss on those income shares is much smaller than
on many other trusts in the sector. This safety element means the yield on
these shares are lower than on many other income shares in the split sector,
says Aaron.
The capital shares receive no revenue but are entitled to all the assets of
the trust after the preference, stepped preference and income shares have
been repaid. The asset value on May 7, assuming the other classes of shares
are repaid in full, was 59p, compared with a share price of 74p. On the
current entitlements of the other shares, the net assets per capital share
are 172p.
This discrepancy is one of the problems for investors who want to buy
capital shares. In the back pages of the Financial Times, capital shares
appear to be at enormous discounts to asset values - over 50 per cent in the
case of River &amp; Mercantile's capital shares. To the casual observer, they
might seem as if they are fantastic bargains.
But these discounts cannot be judged in the same way as those which apply to
conventional investment trust shares. The steady increase in the claims of
the other shares are like termites nibbling away at the foundations of the
capital shares. The trust needs to grow merely for the asset value of the
capital shares to stand still.
In the case of the River &amp; Mercantile trust, the assets of the trust need to
grow at around 0.5 per cent per annum to repay the current share price and
at 3.3 per cent per annum for the investor to earn the stated net asset
value of 172p per share.
In short, the capital shares are a highly geared play on the success of the
managers in growing the trust. A small difference in annual percentage
performance can result in an enormous difference in the eventual return to
the capital shareholders.
If the assets of the trust grow at 2.5 per cent per annum, the capital
shares will offer a 10.66 per cent annualised return, according to Warburg's
Aaron. At 5 per cent asset growth, that return increases to 18.9 per cent.
Iqbal Assan, split capital specialist at brokers Olliff &amp; Partners, sees R &amp;
M's capital shares as among the most attractive in the sector.
The warrants entitle the holder to buy one capital share at 249p. Obviously,
with the capital share price at 75p, a lot of growth is needed for the
warrants, currently at 11p, to be worth exercising.
The structure of such a trust is obviously important, but in the end the
success or failure of the trust must depend on the assets in which the
manager invests.
The portfolio yield is around 6 per cent to 6.3 per cent, says manager Piers
Godfrey, the equivalent of around 150 per cent of the yield on the
All-Share. Achieving that yield by buying ordinary shares would involve
buying some high risk stocks, so Godfrey has around 20 per cent of the
portfolio in fixed interest securities, mainly preference and convertible
preference shares.
The ordinary shares in the portfolio fall into three segments, according to
Godfrey. The main element is a core of high yielding stocks, such as the
utilities. Then Godfrey will buy recovery and cyclical stocks for the upturn
 -but these are not shares which he would hold for long periods. Finally, he
will buy a limited portion of growth stocks, where faster-than-average
dividend increases are expected.
The ten largest holdings in the portfolio are: BT, BAT, British Gas,
National Westminster, Shell, Fisons, General Accident, Smith &amp; Nephew, BICC
and P&amp;O.
'The share price has never really recovered from the rights issue two years
ago but it has delivered the goods in terms of asset performance,' says
Warburg's Aaron.
With a high-yielding portfolio, River &amp; Mercantile has benefited from the
post-devaluation recovery. But manager Piers Godfrey accepts that, because
of the need for UK corporates to rebuild cover, there may be little scope
for dividend growth on the income shares in the short term.
Key facts. The trust has assets of Pounds 178m and a market capitalisation
of Pounds 180m, so the overall package of shares stands on a slight premium.
The quarterly fee paid to the managers is the higher of 1.25 per cent of the
gross annual revenue plus 0.05 per cent of the value of the investments, or
Pounds 117,500, together with one quarter of the dealing profits of R&amp;M
Securities.
Board. Antony Foucar, chairman, is the former chairman of insurance brokers
John Plumer. Philip Macpherson is deputy chairman of Misys and an investment
banking adviser to Baring Brothers. The other two directors are River &amp;
Mercantile employees, Piers Godfrey and Vivien Gould.
Savings scheme and Personal Equity Plan details. There is no savings scheme,
except via the Pep. The River &amp; Mercantile group, which manages several
investment trusts, offers a variety of Peps. The stepped preference and
income shares of the main River &amp; Mercantile trust are available in an
income Pep; the capital shares in a growth Pep. The initial charge on these
plans is 4 per cent plus VAT and the annual charge is 1 per cent plus VAT.
Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000 or Pounds 250 per month. R &amp; M also
offers actively managed Peps which invest in all its trusts.

FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Icahn offers Dollars 1.18bn for
E-II
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CARL ICAHN, the financier and former greenmailer, yesterday stepped up
the battle over the E-II Holdings, telling directors of the bankrupt holding
company - which takes in Samsonite luggage, Culligan water softener and
McGregor clothing - that he was prepared to pay Dollars 1.18bn in cash for
its assets.
The response from the company, however, was cautious. 'Earlier this
afternoon the board of directors of E-II Holdings received a new proposal
from Carl Icahn, concerning E-II's emergence from Chapter 11,' it commented.
'The proposal has been forwarded to the E-II creditors' committee and our
attorneys. We will be happy to comment after they have had the opportunity
to fully examine the proposal.'
Mr Icahn's letter to the board suggested that he was prepared to acquire all
E-II's assets and liabilities other than the senior subordinated notes and
junior debentures for the cash payment.
It added that the offer was not subject to finance being obtained, and
claimed that ACF Industries, his major operating company, had 'more than
enough' capital to consummate the deal.
The tussle over E-II has been continuing since last summer. The company  -
once run by Meshulam Riklis, husband of Pia Zadora - filed for Chapter 11
protection in July, after a 'bondholder revolt' led by Mr Icahn scuttled
restructuring plans. Mr Icahn owns almost 32 per cent of the group's junior
bonds.
The company, however, has presented its own reorganisation plan, which has
been backed by both management and the creditors' committee. Voting on the
plan closed earlier this week, although the result is not yet known. A court
hearing is set for May 24.
The plan is also supported by rival deal-maker, Mr Leon Black, whose company
 -Apollo Advisers - speaks for 24 per cent of the senior bonds and 27 per
cent of the junior bonds.

<TEXT>
FOUR 'persistent' poll tax defaulters have been declared bankrupt after
actions brought by Knowsley Council on Merseyside, the local authority said
yesterday.
The council conducted 12 test cases at Liverpool County Court last week  -
the other eight defendants agreed in court to clear their debts.
The four bankrupt defaulters will now have their property, belongings and
income possessed by the bankruptcy trustee who will discharge their debts.
The council warned that it would pursue other poll tax defaulters.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Japanese offer tariff cuts to revive trade talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN HAS offered to cut customs tariffs on 770 industrial products as part
of a new effort by leading industrial countries to breathe life into the
Uruguay Round of multinational trade negotiations.
Mr Yoshiri Mori, trade minister, announced the offer at an all-day meeting
in Toronto yesterday with his counterparts from the US, the European
Community and Canada.
One western trade official immediately dismissed the Japanese trade
proposals as little more than tariff reductions already scheduled to take
place. Mr Mori said implementation of the proposal depended on 'improved
offers' from other countries, including cuts in their 'peak' tariffs.
All four ministers expressed optimism that yesterday's meeting had given the
Uruguay Round a new lease of life.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said the talks 'achieved
everything we wanted and perhaps a little more. This meeting has increased
the rate of progress and we are now in top gear. There can be no doubt of
the momentum towards a Uruguay Round agreement.'
The ministers plan at least two more meetings in the next two months in the
hope of a breakthrough on the broad 'market access' agreement by the time
leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries assemble for their summit
in Tokyo in July.
Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said the participants at
yesterday's meeting agreed to aim for a 'positive outcome' to the
long-stalled Uruguay Round this year. All four ministers declined to comment
on progress or disagreements on specific subjects.
Among the 770 products included in the Japanese offer are electronics goods,
construction and farm machinery, chemicals and rubber. Mr Mori said tariffs
on 700 of these items would be eliminated. The proposed cuts would bring the
average Japanese tariff down from 1.9 to 1.6 per cent.
The Japanese cabinet yesterday approved a Y2,188bn (Pounds 12.9bn) plan to
finance the central government's portion of the Y13,200bn emergency pump
priming package announced last month to revive the depressed Japanese
economy, Charles Leadbeater writes from Tokyo.
Most of the remainder of the package will be financed by a Y5,000bn
expansion in funds from the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, Japan's
shadow budget which is funded by savings deposited in the postal savings
system. The FILP funds will be used to finance an expansion in housing loans
and small business funds.

Kenya reintroduced key economic liberalisation measures yesterday in a bid
to win back western aid suspended 19 months ago, Reuter reports from
Nairobi.
Government statements said it was reintroducing 'retention accounts', which
allow exporters to keep hard currency instead of remitting it to the central
bank were being reintroduced with immediate effect. They were abolished in
March after a row with the International Monetary Fund.
The statements by the ministries of finance and commerce said the government
was also abolishing all controls on imports except for prohibited goods.
The statements were issued hours after the government ended talks with an
IMF team.

<TEXT>
Norway yesterday unveiled adjustments to its 1993 fiscal budget which pushed
the deficit to a record NKr53.9bn (Pounds 5.1bn), up from December's
forecast deficit of NKr51.4bn, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
The minority Labour government also announced plans gradually to reprivatise
the commercial banks in 1994, beginning with wholly state-owned Christiania
Bank, the country's second biggest bank.
The finance ministry said the state-backed bank insurance and investment
funds would issue a limited number of shares in Christiania this autumn in
order to establish an indicative price level in the stock market ahead of
gradual reprivatisation next year.
In presenting the budget, the finance ministry said the deficit, excluding
revenue from North Sea oil and gas, would widen to NKr77.1bn from its
December forecast of NKr76.6bn. Norway's overall borrowing requirement will
expand to NKr93.7bn from NKr88.2bn seen in December, and NKr55.7bn in 1992,
the ministry said. Although the government sees signs of economic recovery,
it forecast that gross domestic product growth would slow to 0.8 per cent in
1993 from 1.0 per cent predicted in December.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Leniency urged for form-filling farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday urged national authorities not to be too
strict with farmers struggling to meet the bureaucratic demands of the EC's
reformed common agricultural policy.
Today is the deadline for farmers to submit new forms to national
authorities if they want to claim EC funds this year. But many have
complained that the new system, which requires farmers to give a detailed
breakdown of the area farmed and the type of agricultural activity, is too
complex and that Brussels and member states should be lenient about mistakes
and delays.
Mr Rene Steichen, the EC farm commissioner, indicated yesterday that if the
Commission found that genuine errors and minor delays were widespread some
of the severe penalties for breaking the new rules might be relaxed. But he
stressed that this was not an invitation to flout the system.
Officials indicated that a decision on whether and how to relax the
regulations would not be taken until next month, after a Commission review
of problems with implementing the CAP reform.
The National Farmers Union of England and Wales welcomed Mr Steichen's
comments but urged farmers not to interpret the Commission statement as an
excuse to delay submission of the forms.
Addressing EC farming organisations in Brussels, Mr Steichen said the
Commission and member states should 'show flexibility, fairness and
understanding' in dealing with the aid applications. But he added that the
rules were necessary to prevent fraud. 'Community taxpayers are entitled to
be assured that the Ecu35bn (Pounds 27.7bn) which will be spent this year to
support the EC agricultural sector actually reaches its legitimate
destination,' he said.
EC farm spending will rise an estimated Ecu50m (Pounds 39.5m) over the next
12 months as a result of Thursday's devaluations of the peseta and escudo, a
Commission spokesman said, Reuter reports from Brussels.

FT  15 MAY 93 / More Britons to holiday in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S share of the UK package tour market is expected to grow as a result
of the peseta devaluation - even though the effect will not feed through to
holiday brochure prices until summer 1994.
British travel companies say they do not intend to reduce the cost of
holidays to Spain this year, but that bookings are likely to increase
because UK holidaymakers will now get more spending money for their pounds
once they arrive.
The prices of the 7.5m UK package holidays sold each year are set well in
advance as tour operators buy their foreign currency forward. The
pre-devaluation exchange rate will apply for this summer's holiday brochures
as well as those for winter 1993-94.
Travel agents Thomas Cook said UK bookings to Spain had been rising even
before the devaluation. Sales of summer holidays to the Balearic islands are
up 18 per cent. Bookings to the Canary Islands have increased 31 per cent
and those to mainland Spain have risen 7 per cent.
The company added: 'The exchange rate change will result in even heavier
bookings as people have that extra confidence that their pound will go
further when they get there.'
Ms Rosemary Astles, marketing director of Thomson, the UK's biggest travel
company, said publicity given to the devaluation in the British press would
also encourage bookings.
The impact of the devaluation on brochure prices should be more apparent in
August when companies announce their summer 1994 programme. Ms Astles said
it was too soon to say whether holiday prices would fall. This depended on
the exchange rate at the end of the summer and whether Spanish accommodation
owners used the devaluation to push up peseta prices.
The devaluation of the escudo is likely to have less impact, as Portugal is
a small market for UK travel companies. Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, marketing
director of travel agents Lunn Poly, says Portugal is likely to be the
destination of only 400,000 UK package tourists this year, compared with
2.8m to Spain.

FT  15 MAY 93 / As They Say in Europe: I am waiting to be asked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE UPON a time I thought this column was going to gain me a place as an
expert. Somebody somewhere would ask on some late night show, or
back-of-the-paper opinion page, what the European press thought of this or
that. It could have been the Newbury by-election or fiscal convergence: I
would have a ready answer.
But I have learned that few believe that much can be gained from other
people's news. This view was encapsulated in the observation of a top FT
writer who said that this column showed that foreign papers were 'as crazy
as our own.' I believe the time has come to demolish the idea that reading
El Pais or Bild is a kind of journalistic train spotting. (As Richard
Tomkins put it in his piece last week about real train spotters, they do it
because it is no worse than doing something else.)
In a last-ditch attempt to prove that valuable insights can be gained from
other's news, I opened a random copy of the Neue Zurcher Zeitung: last
Saturday's, at pages 10 and 11. While you were reading about Jancis
Robinson's wine bargains or Ms Davenport's delicious ways with oxtail, your
opposite number in Zurich was glued to a page devoted to 'The weather in
April.' This is a regular feature and it keeps to its brief: to cover as
fully as possible all meteorological phenomena in Switzerland for the month
in question, mentioning other countries only insofar as they contribute to
drought or storm. It is a mine of information and a model of its kind in
precision and breadth of coverage. One chart shows minimum and maximum
temperatures, rainfall and respective deviations from the norm in 11 Swiss
cities.
The flavour of this unique feature can be gained from a single paragraph:
'The largest part of the country in April experienced below-normal levels of
sunshine. But positive deviations were to be found in northern and eastern
Switzerland, mostly about 10 to 20 per cent but up to a maximum of 30 per
cent. The greatest reductions, around a quarter of the norm or even more
were in upper Valais and the Bernese high Alps into the central Alpine
region, from the upper part of Lake Geneva almost into the Freiburg region
as well as the southern high Jura and the Upper Engadine. There were also
substantial below-normal figures throughout Ticino.'
But there is always the danger of attempting too broad a canvas, thereby
boring the reader. So the weather editor ensures local interest is fully
covered in several paragraphs and two diagrams about Zurich alone. One is a
graph showing the amount of daily sunshine in the city compared with
theoretical maxima. There is a day-by-day pollution record too. The
seasonally adjusted increase in ozone in April appeared small.
Page 11 was headed 'Various announcements.'
Certainly the 'Various' title was well-earned. The main story was
'Inauguration of the new Bavarian State Chancellery - Less-than-convincing
example of 'Building for democracy'.'
It was noted that 50,000 people had signed a protest against the project, a
pretentious affair commissioned by Bavaria's most famous post-war son and
known, as a result, as the 'Straussoleum.'
Next door was a large piece entitled 'Ireland relaxes contraception.' This
said that the question had been a 'seismograph of church-state relations.'
Then followed an obituary of the British film actress Ann Todd.
The most interesting story was about the 'Surprising change of ownership' at
the Demel cake shop in Vienna. Demel's Konditorei is famous throughout
middle Europe and has been locked in a bitter battle for some time with the
Hotel Sacher over the rights to the Sachertorte, 'Austria's most famous
pastry.' The enterprise has now been taken over by the Raiffeisen
Zentralbank. Demel's had been compromised by its links with a convicted
murderer, Udo Proksch; the government is chasing his money which came from
an earlier sale of Demel shares.
That instructive tale was followed by 'Medical failures - not quite so
rare.' The filler was about an 'uncompleted rape' in Lucerne. And there was
a bit about Asil Nadir's escape to northern Cyprus.
One gains a total picture of the Swiss, or more specifically the inhabitants
of Zurich, from these two pages. There is the obsessive concern with the
physical environment which is based on a fanatical sense of place. There is
the scarcely concealed dislike of Bavaria and the not-very-genial contempt
for Austrians. The Irish story feeds a stiff-necked protestant
anti-clericalism. Then there is the usual bit of crime, an obituary and a
half-hearted attempt to whip-up a medical scare story.
So it is that I have become expert in many questions about other nations.
And so it is that I have never been asked the questions.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Greed lives in the caring '90s: Dominic Lawson suggests a
way to keep company executives under control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE HE was exposed as a crook, Ivan Boesky was much in demand as a
speaker at graduation ceremonies at US colleges.
On one such occasion the great share price manipulator proclaimed to his
starry-eyed audience: 'Greed is good.' A film of this speech exists, and it
shows the students clapping and cheering.
Perhaps a number of those students are now on the boards of unfortunate
companies, busily profiting privately from the insight taught them by the
future jailbird. We are often told, as if it were a fact of human evolution,
that while the 1980s were the decade of greed and excess, the 1990s are a
period of calm restored in the financial markets, of relative austerity. We
are even told that, in Britain, John Major has ushered in a less grasping
and divisive society, in contrast to the supposed excesses of unfettered
Thatcherite capitalism.
The recent procession of company annual reports, and the details of
executive pay revealed in them, shows that this view is a myth. While no
manager in Britain can compete with the Dollars 127m (Pounds 82.4m) of
salary and stock options realised last year by Thomas Frist of the Hospital
Corporation of America, the gains have still been spectacular.
Over the past three years, according to the Institute of Management, the pay
of the typical chief executive of Britain's larger companies has risen by 40
per cent. This at a time when the pay of the typical worker has risen at
about a tenth of that rate, if indeed that typical worker has not been made
typically redundant.
Many recent examples of executive excess affect those who are leaving
companies in the hands of others: a whacking final year increase has a big
impact on pension payments and ensures a scrumptious retirement package: few
more scrumptious than that of Sir Anthony Tennant of Guinness who, after a
five years service with the company, will be collecting a pension of Pounds
500,000 a year, including a top-up of Pounds 204,000 a year above his normal
company entitlement. Guinness was certainly good for Sir Anthony, although
Sir Anthony, it would be fair to add, was good for Guinness.
But what of Gerald Ronson? It transpired this week that bondholders in
Ronson's Heron property group, which last year saw shareholders funds of
Pounds 585m turned into a deficit of Pounds 328m, are asked to agree to pay
Ronson Pounds 5m over the next five years, and to hand over 25 per cent of
their stake in the company to Ronson and his managers, should they succeed
in restoring the company's balance sheet.
When Ronson owned Heron it was perfectly proper for him to pay himself
whatever he wanted. (As indeed,it now appears: the company paid Pounds 1.7m
of the Pounds 5m Ronson was fined for fraud in the Guinness affair, when
Ernest Saunders ran Britain's most generous drinks company). But now that
Heron is in the hands of bankers, they are responsible for getting the best
possible deal for their shareholders, rather than for the erstwhile owner of
the insolvent client.
This, some other bondholders are arguing furiously, they failed to do. In
this case the bankers are behaving rather like institutional investors in
joint stock companies: cowardly or indifferent in the face of the demands of
greedy and overpowering managers. As a result of this, some City reformers
are suggesting that the pay of senior executives in public companies should
be read out and put to the vote at annual general meetings.
It is argued that even if the institutional investors do not care, small
shareholders might embarrass the executives with awkward questions. But the
sort of chief executive who terrifies the remuneration committee is just the
sort who would feel no embarrassment in front of ordinary shareholders: in
fact he would positively thrive on the conflict.
I have an alternative remedy: that the chief executive's pay, whatever its
base, should not increase in any given year by more than the average rate
awarded to the company's workforce. After all, in a well-run company their
increase, in aggregate, should reflect the company's performance, cash
balances, and dividend obligations: why should not the chief executive's
increase be subject to the same considerations? It is an extreme remedy, for
a group which includes some extremely greedy people.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Private View: A million-dollar convert from Watergate -
Chuck Colson, a former dirty tricks expert, explains what it's like to be
born again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LIFE filled with irony and paradox is how Charles W. Colson, the former
Watergate convict, describes his career. That is putting it mildly.
Prince Philip may not have appreciated the irony when at Buckingham Palace
this week, on the very day the Royal bugging controversy re-erupted, he
found himself presenting Richard Nixon's dirty-tricks expert with the
largest cash prize in the world.
'Chuck' Colson received the Templeton Prize, whose previous winners include
Mother Teresa, Billy Graham and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. He got a cheque for
Pounds 650,000 - nearly Dollars 1m and bigger than any Nobel award - for
advancing the world's understanding of God.
For Colson is born again. 'It was 20 years ago this summer that I
surrendered my life to Jesus Christ,' he told me in his Claridges suite
before going to the palace.
The former Special Counsel to the President, known as the hatchet man of the
White House, was a scholarship boy, tough-guy marine corps infantry
commander and high-earning Washington lawyer who played a prominent part in
the intrigues that led to America's biggest political scandal and Nixon's
resignation in 1974. 'Colson has the balls of a brass monkey,' was Nixon's
approving comment.
Colson the hard man does not look as if he has gone soft. He is courteous
but briskly efficient, loquacious but somewhat passionless. He talks about
Jesus with embarrassing familiarity, like a loyal staffer referring to the
boss.
Has Charles Colson really changed? Or has blind loyalty to Richard Nixon
been transmuted into blind loyalty to Jesus Christ?
Washington hooted with laughter when Colson announced at the height of the
White House scandal that he had found God. But friends do not doubt his
sincerity and his record defies disbelief.
His is a butch Christianity. Colson served seven months in Maxwell federal
prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, for obstruction of justice and has been
visiting prisons ever since. His foundation, Prison Fellowship, has become a
worldwide charity which takes the Gospels to jailbirds and campaigns for
better conditions.
Crime is the result of a moral vacuum, he said this week, and only religion
can provide the morality. Liberals wrongly assumed that people were never
depraved, only deprived, while conservatives mistakenly argued that force
and fear were the real deterrents.
And here is the paradox. Colson was very strictly brought up, a nominal
Episcopalian, in the puritanical tradition of Boston. His father, of Swedish
descent and his mother, of English, 'called themselves Christians in the
same way the vast majority of Americans or Britons do.
'My dad used to tell me: 'Whatever you do, never lie.' If I had any
distinction, dubious though it may be of going through Watergate, I was the
only one of the major figures never charged with perjury.'
But where was the voice of his own conscience? Colson, an acknowledged
expert in campaign dirty tricks over many years, replied with the rather
technical defence that he had known nothing of the burglary and bugging of
the Democratic Party offices at Watergate. Like others, he had been 'backed
into' the conspiracy of two or three ringleaders.
'There were a lot of rough, tough, ethically borderline political
manoeuvres. But in terms of breaking the law . . . I had done four years of
law school at nights, graduated top of my class. I wasn't going to
jeopardise that - on pragmatic grounds.
'I take full responsibility for helping create the moral climate in the
White House that led to Watergate. But I thought I was too shrewd to have
done anything that was legally wrong.' In the end he pleaded guilty to
leaking to the press the FBI records on Daniel Ellsberg who was awaiting
trial for theft of the Pentagon Papers.
'I had seen the ugliest side of politics since 1952 . . . stealing
information . . . dirty tricks. It didn't bother me when Nixon said get the
dirt on this guy and give it to the papers.'
The voice of conscience was stilled by pride and self-righteousness. 'Almost
the better educated you are and the more sensitive you are, the more
dangerous you are. This is one of the paradoxes of life.
'In college I studied Kant and the Categorical Imperative. I believed that
through a rational process you could arrive at the right ethical judgments.
And so when I went to the White House - I had a successful law practice and
took a large pay cut - I put everything in a blind trust. I would never see
anyone I practised law with. If I received Christmas gifts I would give them
to the drivers of my limousine . . .
'I, Chuck Colson, with a puritanical background and with a brilliant
education, would never be compromised. No way. But I went to jail: which is
why I don't believe Kant's Categorical Imperative is a sound basis for
ethics. It assumes that by reason you can control your passions. It ignores
the fact that human beings have an infinite capacity for self-justification
and self-delusion.'
You were up to your neck in it, I said. Was your religious conversion a way
of escaping responsibility?
'You don't escape responsibility. I suspect if it had not been for my
conversion to Christ I wouldn't have gone to prison. In fact I know I
wouldn't have.' (Colson claims the original charge against him would have
failed and that he provided the prosecutor with another - the Ellsberg leak
 -to which he could plead guilty.)
Why, then, was his conversion so sudden?
Colson said the doubts had begun even before Watergate. When he left the
White House in 1973 he had achieved everything he had set out to achieve.
'I'd done all of these things and I sat one day looking out over the south
lawn of the White House feeling a terrible emptiness.'
He went to see a friend, Tom Phillips, soon to become president of Raytheon,
and was startled by his appearance. 'His desk was clear, he was smiling and
relaxed. Fifteen minutes into the conversation I said: 'Tom, you've changed,
what's happened to you? He said. 'Yes, I have. I have accepted Jesus Christ
and committed my life to him.'
'I nearly fell off the chair because I'd never heard anyone talk that way. I
thought: what in the world is this man talking about? So I very nervously
changed the subject.'
Phillips, it transpired, had been to a Billy Graham rally. Later that year
Phillips read to Colson a chapter from CS Lewis's Mere Christianity on the
sin of pride.
'I was deeply affected because I recognised my own sin as I never had
before. Tom Phillips wanted me to pray with him that night, but I couldn't.
I left and went to my automobile in the driveway. Patty (Colson's second
wife) and I were heading off on a week's holiday and I couldn't drive out of
the driveway because I was crying too hard to get the keys into the
ignition.
'I sat there probably for an hour, praying the first honest prayers I had
ever prayed in my life. I said: 'If you're true, Jesus, I want to know you.'
I never normally showed emotion. I was embarrassed. But I got up next day
and felt wonderful.'
What did your wife think?
'She was astounded because she is a life-long Roman Catholic and far more
religious than I am - was. I think she was terrified at first.'
When people laughed at you - some probably still do - you can understand
what goes through their minds?
'Sure. If I'd read that story I'd have said that's the biggest con-game, the
biggest scam I've ever heard.'
When I asked Colson whether 'getting religion' might be a kind of
psychological condition, a mid-life crisis exaggerated by stress, he replied
that in that case St Paul, St Augustine and John Wesley were merely showing
psychological symptoms. It could not explain why he had turned down
lucrative offers to spend 20 years working in prisons on a salary of Dollars
59,000 a year.
Colson describes himself as a conservative, orthodox, evangelical Baptist, a
fundamentalist in the non-pejorative sense of accepting all the basic dogmas
of Christianity. Although he says he has given up party political contacts
and has attacked the Moral Majority for its political links he is still more
at home with the Right than the Left - except where criminal justice is
concerned.
You're non-political?
'Well, I can't vote, I'm an ex-convict.'
But he went on to criticise Bill Clinton for squandering the goodwill of the
presidency by raising divisive moral issues during his first 100 days. 'I
very much oppose legitimising homosexuality and repealing the abortion
restrictions.'
Is homosexuality a sin?
'The Bible says it is. I get a little bit angry when people talk about us
prejudiced, Bible-pounding people. Not many who criticise me will go and do
what I do . . . take AIDs victims who are homosexuals and hold them in my
arms and talk to them about Jesus. It's one thing to be offended by a sin.
It's another to love the sinner.'
Do you believe in the book of Genesis literally?
'I do believe in it literally.'
Are you a Creationist?
'Oh, yes, absolutely. Of course I am. Anyone who reads the Bible
historically has to be a Creationist.'
So you don't believe in Darwin's theory of evolution?
'No, I do not.'
Species might have adapted but were separately created, Colson said, and Man
was created human, with a soul, not descended from an ape-like ancestor.
A lot of people would say for an intelligent man you're being dumb.
'It isn't a question of intelligence, It's a question of prejudice - the
idea that because something is modern it has to be more enlightened.' A
hundred years ago, he added, universities all over the world had denied the
existence of the Hittite Empire because the only reference to it was in the
Bible.
Do you believe in Original Sin?
'The greatest curse on the 20th century is that we forgot the doctrine of
original sin. When you do, you get people like Stalin and Hitler. Utopians
say just get rid of the social vices and the goodness of man will come
through. But we are born flawed and have to be civilised.'
I suggested to Colson that religion was the best career available to him
after Watergate.
'Your readers will say: 'Oh, sure, he got in trouble in Watergate, he lost
his law practice, he didn't have anything else to do, and went into the
religious world. It's not a bad life, you get to stay at Claridges, you can
write books, have fame and money and everything else' - though I keep no
royalties, no speaking fees, no prizes.
'Since learning I had won the prize I have felt not one moment of
exultation. I have felt driven to my knees in gratitude to God for what he
has done in my life.
'I guess I can't ask you to believe it or your readers to believe it. But
I'm giving you an honest answer.'

FT  15 MAY 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A kiss for Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
I CALLED in at Conservative Central Office in London this week, which is not
my typical habitat. The royal box at Ascot, certainly. An anti-whaling
conference, naturally. Or any meeting whose declared purpose is to raise the
status and self-confidence of womankind. But Tory Central Office?
In fact, they were happy to see me. With morale as it is at present, they
are happy to see anyone. So in I cheerily strode, and made towards the
bookstore.
There was a man behind the desk. 'I was wondering,' I said pleasantly,
'whether you had anything in stock that was extremely pro-Europe - in fact,
pro-federal - because that is where I'm at, aggressively pro-federal. I
believe in a federal Europe. As I remarked some time ago, I want peace and
prosperity for all the people of Europe. I want one army, one navy, one air
force, one queen, one president, one chief executive, one flag (very small),
one currency, one language, one set of tax laws, one summer sport and one
winter sport, one way of cooking estouffade a la provencale, one way of
spelling Cologne, one BBC, one archbishop of Brugge, one motoring rulebook,
one price of petrol, one railway gauge, one opera house (which is probably
one too many), and one school curriculum.
'I see a federalised Europe as the precursor of world government, which
would solve most of our troubles at once. So what have you got on your
shelves that will pull it all together for me? I need some ammunition.
Ammunition is what I lack.'
The man studied me. 'As a matter of fact,' he said, 'material of that
nature, extremely pro-Europe, let alone pro-federal, is remarkably thin on
the ground. But I'm expecting some stuff next week. Perhaps you will call
again, Sir?' I said that I probably might.
Yet I could not leave it there. I have been so nauseated by Britain's
disgracefully slow progress in ratifying the Maastricht treaty on closer
Euro-integration - let alone by the government's refusal to countenance a
national referendum on the issue - that I am striking out on my own. I am
changing my mannerisms. With luck, I hope to take on the appearance of a
true European, just waiting to go federal.
I am far too Englishly, even though I have lived abroad for a quarter of my
adult years. I wear drippy, unstylish clothes. I am inhibited and diffident.
I am not particularly tactile. When I kiss, I suck and go 'mwah]' (it is
called vacuum-kissing, and is done to conceal embarrassment). And I am
always absurdly punctual. I am a bit of a prat, actually, although I do not
believe I am odious, what a hurtful thing to say.
To help me with my mission, I am dipping in and out of an upcoming book,
Foreign Bodies: A Guide to European Mannerisms, by Dr Peter Collett, a
research psychologist at Oxford University. According to Dr Collett, the
study of European mannerisms presents a special challenge, partly because
they are so diverse and partly because Europe is in the throes of upheaval.
'On the one hand,' he says, 'there are centripetal forces bringing nations
together in an attempt to exorcise the past, and create a unitary structure
with a common identity, while on the other hand centrifugal forces are at
work, with local identities being asserted, people being flung in every
direction, and states being torn apart.'
He says that mannerisms are important because they form the basis of social
exchanges between people, and because they can very easily give rise to
misunder-standings.
We are often tempted, says Dr Collett, to assume that mannerisms are somehow
less important than values or attitudes, or what people say to one another.
'This simply is not the case. The way that people behave is crucial, not
only to the sort of impression that they make on each other, but to how they
feel about themselves.'
In remodelling my mannerisms, I shall start with kissing. I want to kiss
like the French, the champions of Europe. All I ever do is go 'mwah]' and
then 'mwah]' I want to be as unpunctual as the Spanish, as comfortable with
intimacy as Italians, as rollicking as the Dutch, as sexy as the
Scandinavians, as perfidious as the Greeks and as humorous as the Germans.
(I say they are humorous).
I am in for a sea-change.
Foreign Bodies will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster on May 27 at Pounds
14.99.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Records: Decadent opera comes good - David Murray reviews
Decca's new series of 'Degenerate Music', or music banned by the Nazis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY people know that the Nazis once staged a Munich exhibition of
'Degenerate Art', Entartete Kunst, by way of pillorying visual artists whose
work they found offensive. The criteria stretched wide: artists and their
works could qualify if they were any or all of (a) Jewish, (b)
social-critical, (c) lurid in the eyes of decent folk, (d) abstractionist,
or (e) sympathetic to Negroes.
There was also, a little later - 1938, in Dusseldorf - a copycat exhibition
of Entartete Musik, 'Degenerate Music'. There the criteria had to be fudged
a bit. For (d), read 'atonalist", and for (e) 'sympathetic to jazz'; but (b)
could be detected only in libretti and song-texts, and any plausible
equivalent for (c) would take in, embarrassingly, grand old Richard Strauss
(Salome] Elektra]) and even the one seriously respected composer with Nazi
leanings, Hans Pfitzner. Thus the resultant exhibition was less effectively
vicious than just confused and stupid. (When Bartok heard of the exhibition,
he demanded that his music be included too.)
The criteria for Decca's new CD series of Entartete Musik are no less
generous. Any composer whose work was arguably significant but has been
neglected, and whose fortunes suffered somehow under the Third Reich, seems
to qualify. And why not? - it makes a good enough excuse for a welcome
venture. One way and another, the Nazis did manage to deny performances to
composers they judged inimical to their ethos. Careers were stifled or
truncated, or driven to uncertain continuations in foreign lands, and German
music certainly lost by that. Schoenberg and Hindemith were grave losses;
Schreker and Zemlinsky were ruined.
Decca has inaugurated its series, however, with two operas by utterly
different composers. Erich Wolfgang Korngold (his middle name indicates the
hopes vested in him by his music-critic father) began as a brilliant but
innately conservative Wunderkind, a pre-'teen prodigy of competence in an
early-middle-Strauss vein. Since Strauss himself had by then progressed to
late-middle, it was unsurprising that even early-middle Korngold soon
sounded passe, perfervid though it was, and that from 1934 he should find a
lucrative permanent niche as a Hollywood film-composer. It was almost beside
the point that the Nazis condemned his 1927 opera Das Wunder der Heliane as
'pornographic'.
Yet it is a good, sour joke that what wrecked Heliane's prospects for
continuing success was the outrageous campaign mounted by Korngold pere  -
with epithets worthy of Nazi denunciations - against Ernst Krenek's hugely
successful opera of the same year, Jonny spielt auf, 'Johnny strikes up'.
Krenek (who died a year and a half ago aged 90) was a musician whose acute
intelligence left him exposed to the virtues of every new musical mode.
Before Jonny he had investigated free atonality and then neo-classicism;
soon after it, he espoused Schoenberg's dodecaphony for good. Jonny,
however, was a free-wheeling affair, with jazzy borrowings which at once
prompted the label 'jazz opera'.
It was no such thing, and in current lingo should count rather as
'post-modernist'. Not only does Krenek's score tack insouciantly between
different idioms - late-Romantic, light operetta, chromatic abrasiveness,
Stravinskian chorales and 'jazz', strictly associated with Jonny, the black
American character - but the text (his own) plays off a
soulful-artist's-crisis drama, as in Pfitzner or in Strauss's early Guntram,
against amoral modern farce, the spectacular delights of new stage
technology and the lusty allure of America.
On the Decca set (436 631-2, two CDs) Lothar Zagrosek and the Leipzig
Gewandhausorchester capture its dispassionate verve elegantly, and with an
unerringly chosen cast: Heinz Kruse as the sweetly self-absorbed composer,
Alessandra Marc's sumptuous soprano for his erring diva, Krister St. Hill
(the parti-coloured young Swedish phenomenon) as the mischievous opportunist
Jonny. Somehow there is a consistent Krenek voice through it all - and
musically speaking, a fine variety of pace and tone, though recent stage
revivals suggest that the story may be too slight for its playing-time.
At the Almeida last summer, the astringent wit of Krenek's little 1945
one-acter What Price Confidence was a delightful revelation; Jonny, though
more expansive, has plenty of that too. Contrariwise The Miracle of Heliane
(436 636-2, three CDs) strikes me as a gangrenous monstrosity. The erotic
'mystery-play' that seized Korngold's cosseted imagination was vacuous,
crypto-pornographic stuff, and he set it as an overcrowded sequence of
overblown climaxes, replete with celestial celesta, harp, glockenspiel,
piano and an overweening orchestra.
Devotees of that dated idiom may warm to the strenuous vocal flights, which
sound sincere and even noble from the mouth of Anna Tomowa-Sintow's Heliane,
and fully committed from her co-principals John David de Haan (a liberating
Dionysian stranger, as in Euripides' Bacchae) and Hartmut Welker as her
grimly repressed royal husband. What the conductor John Mauceri draws from
the Berlin Radio Symphony passes muster, though never on the Leipzig level.
Szymanowski's 1926 King Roger, too, features a Dionysian ephebe who triggers
seismic upheavals in the hearts of a royal pair; but here the drawn-out,
'untheatrical' music sustains an uncanny charge, hauntingly personal and
original. There is a tantalising question about how far Szymanowski was
aware of his homoerotic subtext. The new Schwann album (314 014 K2, two
CDs), passionately sung and conducted - by Robert Satanowski with the forces
of the Warsaw Teatr Wielki - surpasses the only previous version on records.
Finally: in the post-modernist stakes Schnittke's scabrous, grossly
inventive comedy Life with an Idiot (Sony S2K 52 495, two CDs) is a
front-runner - bravely unabashed cast, recorded during the Rotterdam
premieres last year, with Rostropovich conducting and terrific
sound-effects. It is nevertheless so narrowly bound to its Ortonesque action
that non-Russophones must either keep their eyes glued to the translation,
or else let much of the music-drama pass by unheeded, tuning in only when it
rises (as often it does) to a domineering pitch. Better, perhaps, to see the
thing first (and blench), and then use the recording to recall the effect.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Records: Bruggen conducts with period passion - New
recordings of Bach and Haydn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT

<TEXT>
Bach: St John Passion. Soloists, Netherlands Chamber Choir, Orch. of 18th
Century/Frans Bruggen. Philips 434 905-2 (two CDs)
Haydn: Symphonies nos 100 and 104. Orchestra of the 18th Century/Bruggen.
Philips 434 096-2 (one CD)
Haydn: Symphonies, Vol. 2 - nos 3, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 25, 33, 36, 108.
Academy of Ancient Music/Christopher Hogwood. L'Oiseau-Lyre 436 592-2 (three
CDs)
FRANS Bruggen's new St John Passion recording establishes a vital pulse
almost with the first note, and maintains it unflagging to the last. In the
sanctimonious, top-and-bottom-heavy oratorio-style performances of yore,
there were features of Bach's ever-astonishing masterpiece particularly in
danger of being obliterated: highly charged atmosphere, impassioned urgency
of story-telling, subsuming of elaborate form and intricate device into
rapidly-unfolding dramatic action, masterly placing of the oases of lyrical
reflection. Here, all are cherished.
Textures are briskly clarified, rhythms and verbal accents sharply pointed.
Lightness is always the aim. And yet, in contrast to other recent Bach
Passion recordings on 'period' instruments and with small choral forces, the
danger of miniaturising the music, of rendering it precious, denatured,
detached from communal-celebratory context, is completely avoided. The
degree of reverberance in the Philips recording  - it was made in the
Vredenburg at Utrecht - may come at first as a surprise: but, since this
aids the Netherlands Chamber Choir in maintaining a presence at once
thrustful and musically sentient, clean in contrapuntal divisions and firm
in overall mass, the sound-picture counts as part of the performance's
strong, distinctive character.
Unfortunately, the quality of solo singing undermines it. Nico van der Meel,
an unaffectedly intense Evangelist, and Kristin Sigmundsson, a robust,
touchingly simple Jesus, both declaim the recitatives with an apt sense of
Bruggen's larger dramatic purposes.
In the arias, however, the modest apparatus and technical skills of almost
all the chosen soloists apart from the tenor, Christoph Pregardien, seem
rather more exposed than might have been the case in a less 'organic'
interpretation - as the alto's is the first solo voice to be heard, and the
one with the weightiest moments of lyrical expression, James Bowman's frayed
countertenor tones and bumpy line are here exposed to the point of
unkindness. This, then, may not be a 'complete' St John Passion - has there
ever been one? - but it is nonetheless quite extraordinarily exciting,
gripping, affecting.
Bruggen's two previous Philips recordings of Haydn symphonies (nos 86 and
88; nos 101 and 103) have given me enormous pleasure. His third - a coupling
of the 'Military' and the 'London', two of the most elating of all symphonic
constructions - do no less. This is the work of an 'interventionist' Haydn
conductor, one who brings a peculiar combination of robustness and vivacity
to 'period' performance, most telling in matters of timing, attack and
instrumental timbre. In the past I have occasionally found his enthusiasm
for detail overdone (though always excusable); but of these works, with
their tremendously grand, buoyant and above all surprising finales,
Bruggen's command and control seem to me faultless, unarguable on its own
terms.
The merits of his Haydn conducting, clear enough, become doubly emphasised
by the appearance of the second issue in the complete Haydn symphony series
currently being undertaken by Christopher Hogwood and his Academy of Ancient
Music. Volume 2 roughly covers the period 1760-3; as the Haydn scholar
Robbins Landon has written, 'if these early symphonies were all that were
known of Haydn, his name would be no more illustrious today than those of
d'Ordonez or Hofmann or Michael Haydn' - predecessors in the great Austrian
symphonic exploration of the middle 1700s from whom Haydn particularly
learned.
That said, there are bounteous delights to be sampled here, constant
illuminations small and large of the inventiveness with material, the
muscular confidence and individuality of personality which Haydn (unlike
Mozart) manifested early in his dealings with symphonic form. A general
criticism of the Hogwood/Academy readings is that they sound just that -
readings, not fully-fledged performances. As such they are always neatly and
musically made, tasteful and style-conscious in 'period'-instrumental
balance and tempo variation; as a library-shelf item the set will
undoubtedly justify its existence. But Haydn, even early Haydn, really
wants, and would undoubtedly reward, a lot more in the way of commitment.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Records: Between the 'best of' and the boxed - The latest
pop anthologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL HARDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LURKING benevolently between the 'Best Of', with its all the hits and
nothing more philosophy, and the boxed set, with its detailed discography
and emphasis on unreleased material, lies the anthology. Intended neither
for the dabbler nor the completist, the anthology, if is to succeed, has to
find a way of bring together rather more material by an artist than one
would initially expect to find.
One way of doing this is to focus on an artist's career, including the
interesting moments as well as the peaks. This is the strategy adopted by
Motown for their Anthology series. Recent releases include double CDs
devoted to Marvin Gaye (530-181-2), The Four Tops (530 190-2), The
Temptations (530 184-2), Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes (530 196-2). All follow
the same path: they include virtually all the hits, early recordings and
fillers from would-be 'classy' albums made by Motown to show that its
artists were as at home at the Copacabanna as the Apollo.
Take the Supremes. The first (non-hit) recordings are quite fascinating.
They reveal a group with no identity veering from style to style, awaiting
the tambourine and chord-driven rhythms and coy come-hither vocal pose of
'Where Did Our Love Go' and 'Baby Love'. The hits are fine but the fillers
are real fillers. No one needs the Supremes' version of 'Funny How Times
Slips Away' or The Temptations singing 'Ole Man River'. Nonetheless,
although the general strategy backfires (unless like the Four Tops or Marvin
Gaye, you have made very few clinkers) and confirms the view that Motown at
its height was essentially a singles label, since the 40-plus sets have hits
galore it is hard to complain too much.
Love may have been one of the seminal groups of the psychedelic era, but it
certainly recorded a few clinkers in its time. There is none, however, on
Comes In Colours (Raven RVCD 29). Culled largely from their first three
albums the 24 track CD neatly catches the mysterious romanticism, terse,
edgy druggy rhythms, hippie philosophising and lush string-laden productions
that is as awesome today as it was a quarter of a century ago. This is the
perfect introduction to Love. Enjoy it and you'll be bound to want their
classic album, Forever Changes.
Also from Raven is Warm Evenings, Pale Mornings, Bottled Blues (RVCD 24)
which charts the erratic but historically hugely important career of Gram
Parsons, the man who forcibly yoked country and rock together without losing
the heart of either. Warm Evenings collects together his early recordings
with the Shilohs and International Submarine band, classic tracks from his
short stay with the Byrds, his seminal works with the Flying Burrito Bros
and a fine selection of his solo recordings. Not all the tracks are wholly
satisfying but all are passionate, from the melancholy of 'Hickory Wind' to
the surreal mystery of 'The New Soft Shoe'. What makes the album so
satisfying is that all the stages of Parsons' career are covered (and from
five different record companies, no less). This is a true anthology.
'Satan Is Real' sang the Louvin Brothers a decade or so before Parsons
recorded the remarkably similar 'Sin City'. Like Parsons, they dealt in
unfashionable extremities - 'Broadminded is spelt s,i,n'; 'When I stop
breathin', that's when I'll stop loving you' they sang in fierce, delicate
harmonies. Capitol Country Classics (EMI 7 89271 2) collects together their
finest recordings of the 1950s. Though the brothers had few hits, their
intense harmonies and direct celebrations of the joys and sorrows of life
were too old fashioned for the times, they were direct influences on the
Everly Brothers 'Love Hurts' and so entered the mainstream. They deserve to
be better known.
Weighing in at 3 CDs and including its fair share of unreleased tracks,
Watching The Dark (Hannibal HNCD 5303) is big but essential. Its subject is
Richard Thompson, who from the 1960s and Fairport Convention to the 1990s
and a solo career that has won him cult status, has sung and played about
pain and trouble with an incisiveness only seen elsewhere in the work of
Neil Young. Touching on every stage of his recording career The Dark reveals
a powerful songwriter and performer whose generally bitter view of life is
relieved by a caustic wit and an enthralling guitar style. Not for the
wearers of rose-tinted spectacles.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Records: The sound of French Baroque - Ronald Crichton on a
new 'Castor et Pollux' and a re-issued 'Faust'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM Christie's recordings with his group Les Arts Florissants are as
eagerly awaited as those of John Eliot Gardiner with his London forces. Both
excel in bringing style, sympathy and vitality to the fascinating but not
foolproof world of French Baroque theatre music.
Christie's new Castor et Pollux (HMC 9014353/37, 3 CDs) is well up to
standard. Rameau's drama of the half-brothers (sons of Leda, but Pollux's
father was divine Jupiter) and the Princess Telare whom they both love is
presented with clarity and tautness also with tenderness and relaxation when
needed for the dazzling changes of mood and colour in Rameau's skilfully
assembled and contrasted divertissements. The dialogues, in recitative with
brief airs, are done with spirit and point - following them with the text
(English translation provided) makes all the difference.
Castor is Howard Crook, a fine high tenor often admired in music of this
period, the voice gaining in strength. Brother Pollux is the baritone Jerome
Correas, less assured at first but warming up to a deeply account account of
the big aria 'Nature, Amour'. As Telare, Agnes Mellon sings the famous
'Tristes apprets' with admirable control. Mellon's voice, too, is gaining in
strength and richness. Veronique Gens is a most effective Phebe, an
unsympathetic character for whom one nevertheless feels rather sorry.
The sonorous Jupiter of Rene Schirrer might with advantage have been placed
further from the others - one does not feel he is singing ex machina.
Sandrine Piau does full justice to three of the demanding small roles with
which stud the score, Mark Padmore likewise catches the attention in two
more. Rameau's chorus writing is testing as well as brilliant. The ensembles
here are sung with notable trenchancy and rapidity of articulation.
The version used is the original of 1737, as given in the Durand score. The
music is a joy: only the athletes' dances fail a little below the general
level, but perhaps routine triads and trumpets are what those Spartans
deserve. I was brought up on the early version and on the whole prefer it
while admitting that (as the English Bach Festival Castor at Covent Garden
in 1981 memorably showed) the ending from the later, 1754 revision,
reflective rather than jubilant, is the more moving of the two finales.
Re-issues on CD from the age of 78s continue to throw up treasure. Of major
interest is the (almost) complete Faust made in Paris in 1930, conducted by
Gounod's friend and pupil, Henri Busser (re-mastered by Ward Marston for
Pearl, GEMM CDS 9987, 2 CDs). The sound is elderly and uneven, but so clear
is Busser's exposition (this is the 'old' Faust with recitatives) and so
high the standard of singing that one soon forgets.
The Mephistopheles of Marcel Journet was famous. What a voice, even
throughout the range, full of colour, zest and verbal inflections, with
plebeian mockery peeping out from beneath a 'gentlemanly' exterior. The
bronze-toned Cesar Vezzani's Faust is more heroic than lyrical, a fine
example of its kind. Mireille Berthon, a very experienced soprano, is
equally apt to the girlish side of Marguerite, the roulades of the Jewel
Song and the drama of the church and prison scenes. She lacked a strong
vocal personality. Valentin is Louis Musy, a sterling singer who no more
shows the unpleasant side of the character than Vezzani suggests Faust's
studiousness. Journet apart, they do not 'act with the voice', but lines are
beautifully firm and words blessedly clear.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: Murder and verse - TS Eliot in Stratford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a lot of murder in Stratford this week: the murder of TS Eliot's
marvellous verse. It is not just manslaughter. This is clearly a coldly,
carefully premeditated act. Where Eliot wrote for a verse-speaking,
fatalistic chorus, the women of Canterbury now affect a kind of naturalistic
prose.
On the other hand, there is a very understandable motive. Murder In The
Cathedral, written in 1935, was Eliot's first play. In a memorable essay
nearly 20 years later Eliot admitted that it had not solved the problem of
reinventing verse drama. For Murder is more of a pageant and a ritual than a
genuine play. It was designed for the Canterbury Festival and is still
usually performed in a cathedral. The unmistakeable echoes you hear in it
are those of Eliot's poetry, not of his later dramatic work.
Nevertheless, two substantial sections of Murder In The Cathedral are in
prose. One is the archbishop's sermon on Christmas Day when he prophecies
his own death. The other is the attempted justification by the knights of
why Becket had to be killed. This latter part is almost Shavian and involves
the knights in a direct engagement with the audience, pleading their cause
as plain, blunt Englishmen while the body of Becket lies bloodily before
them. They murdered the archbishop because, in the interests of efficient
government, it was necessary to choose between the powers of church and
state.
That is the scene which dominates Steven Pimlott's production. The knights
have a case which it would be artificial to put in verse. They are witnesses
addressing a jury, not part of a pageant. Quite why they are dressed as
parodies of SAS commandos is another matter. Some of the lines are
remarkably modern. For instance: 'Our king saw that the one thing needful
was to restore order: to curb the excessive powers of local government,
which were usually exercised for selfish and often for seditious ends.'
Eliot emerges here as an effective writer of prose drama, catching precisely
that diffident way some Englishmen have of taking to public speaking. They
even have names like old Tory MP's, such as Reginald Fitz Urse. Guy Henry,
as knight number 2, is the best of a very good quartet.
Whether the earlier sacrifice of the verse was worth making for the sake of
getting down to the politics later is more questionable. I think that
Pimlott should have recognised the exceptional nature of the piece. It falls
into separate parts. The verse-speaking of the chorus is essential to
emphasise the ritual, the sense that the women are impotent to influence
what goes on around them.
Pimlott tries to differentiate between them, splitting up the lines and
seldom letting them speak in unison. He does the same thing with the
priests, clearly implying that one of them is gay - note Becket's firm kiss
on the lips - and that another is a potential defector. Yet in the end the
priests, like the chorus, stick together.
Becket is played by Michael Feast: he would be better under more mature
direction. Those who know Murder In The Cathedral largely from reading and
an admiration of Eliot's poetry are liable to be disappointed, yet there are
scenes, such as the knights, which make it worth seeing.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: A finely tuned 'Wozzeck' - Opera North's first
production of Berg's masterpiece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST new production of the 1992-93 Opera North season at Leeds is also
the last under the departing general administrator, Nicholas Payne. The work
is Berg's Wozzeck, of which Payne writes feelingly in the programme - 'I
suppose that I love Wozzeck as much as any opera' - and of which, happily
but by no means fortuitously, his company now offers an outstanding
presentation.
It bears, indeed, the marks of a performance put together with loving care:
meticulously prepared orchestral and choral contributions, a production
finely attuned to the spirit of the opera and finely tuned by almost all its
participants. The results, as shown on Thursday, reveal qualities of the
highest appropriateness to Berg's opera - theatrical immediacy born of
economical, forceful statement, musical and dramatic; emotional power
searing without the faintest trace of melodramatic excess or
self-consciousness; a fierce, uninflated truthfulness of characterisation.
The show possesses above all the rare merit of allowing the music to
dominate the experience, of baring to the audience Berg's unequalled
combination of intricate workmanship and animal directness of expression,
while at the same time never neglecting the revolutionary inventiveness of
his total theatrical vision, his foreshortening of emotional time and space.
Done this way, in a small, intimate theatre, and in English - a new
translation by Richard Stokes, convincingly colloquial if also at times
bluntly worded - Opera North's Wozzeck proves one of the most completely
absorbing and compelling I have heard and seen.
Much advance publicity was generated by the operatic debut of Deborah
Warner, the celebrated theatre director. For a change the ballyhoo was
justified. The naked intensity, austerely arresting control of stage space
and tautly over-arching line of thought which rendered, say, the Warner
Electra at the London Riverside Studios such a shattering experience have
been re-invented in the operatic medium with no evident loss or dilution.
Flat-planed designs by Hildegard Bechtler, hard yet luminous,
characteristically atmospheric in their painterly manipulation of colour,
allow Berg's pattern of scene and interlude to form and dissolve with
unshowy deftness - the swish of a diaphanous black front curtain, the
sideways slide of panels and bleak props, and the 'psychological' lighting
of Jean Kalman are all functional and at the same time crucially poetic
properties. Apt tribute seems to be paid to the original 1925 Berlin Wozzeck
designer, Caspar Neher (also Covent Garden's in 1952).
The 'extremeness' of the opera's situations and moods is here balanced by an
acutely disciplined acting style - sited within the bounds of naturalness
yet shaded and heightened by expressionist intensity.
Vivian Tierney, a Marie of quite wonderfully unaffected pathos, unadorned
physicality and (except in the highest notes) lyrical fullness of voice, is
perhaps its most immediately affecting exemplar; but Andrew Shore's Wozzeck
(the shaking inner torment depicted in small, precise detail), Jeffrey
Lawton's rubicund, self-satisfied windbag of a Captain and Alan Woodrow's
small, musclebound Drum Major stand no less proud at the head of a cast
almost all musically strong and untainted by exaggeration or cartoon
grotesquerie. Violence, when it comes, is horribly well-plotted (Marie's
blood streaks the floor); Mark Curtis's Idiot haunts the proceedings like a
blood relation of Pierrot Lunaire.
Paul Daniel conducts the English Northern Philharmonia in a manner and style
exactly matched to the production - Wednesday's performance was one of those
treasurable operatic occasions in which it became increasingly hard to
distinguish between the activities of stage and pit. At this stage the
conductor's innate honesty of approach does not allow him to relish as fully
as some have done the 'Viennese' elements in Berg's musical idiom, the
portamento phrasing and sickly-sensuous waltz rhythms and drenched string
textures underpinning Marie's Bible reading and the D-minor Interlude.
That may come. Already Mr Daniel and his orchestra and chorus provide so
assured a command of the score that the good fortune of Leeds audiences in
having as their first Wozzeck this admirably rounded realisation is hardly
to be believed.
The production is supported by Friends of Opera North; in repertory at the
Grand, Leeds until May 21, then on tour in Manchester, Nottingham, Hull and
Sheffield

FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: 'Angels' on Broadway - Karen Fricker talks to Tony
Kushner about his play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY TWO weeks after its opening at the Walter Kerr Theatre, Angels in
America: Millennium Approaches has every look of a Broadway hit. The first
part of Tony Kushner's freewheeling seven-hour-long play about gay life,
AIDS, Reagan-era politics, Mormonism, and Roy Cohn (the second half,
Perestroika, is scheduled to open in the autumn and to run in repertory with
Millennium) opened with over Dollars 1 million in advance ticket sales - a
very high figure for a non-musical. The production was dogged with technical
problems in the final weeks before it opened, but Kushner's being awarded
the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for Millennium on the day of its first
preview surely boosted company morale.
The reviews were excellent, and, most importantly for business, the New York
Times' Frank Rich, who reviewed the play favourably in its two previous
major productions at London's Royal National Theatre in early 1992 and at
the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles last November, gave it a rave. This week
Millennium was nominated for nine Tony (Broadway theatre) awards, more than
any other play in Tony history, including nominations for best play and best
director, George C. Wolfe.
This strong reception, fed by and fuelling the kind of hype that only
American popular culture can provide, and little competition in an otherwise
bleak Broadway season, has made Millennium essential viewing for New
Yorkers.
'I never thought I would write anything that would go to Broadway,' Kushner
said this week. 'and it was never terribly important to me to do so. But
when the opportunity presented itself to take Angels to Broadway, I wondered
if I'd ever get another chance.'
The playwright, who is 34, was talking about the decision he faced late last
year after Angels' Los Angeles opening. This production was originally
slated to transfer intact from the Mark Taper Forum to the Public Theatre,
the flagship house of the not-for-profit New York Shakespeare Festival, and
then, perhaps, move on to Broadway. Critical reaction in Los Angeles -
ecstatic about the play (though most suggested that Perestroika wanted
rewriting), but not about Oskar Eustis' production - meant that whatever its
course, Angels would have a new director and design team.
Kushner returned to New York to find the power barons of commercial theatre
falling over themselves to produce his play on Broadway. But it was
important to him that the play be accessible to the gay and downtown theatre
communities that had nurtured him, and several advisers urged him to stick
with his original plan, to work out Perestroika's kinks and to gain momentum
downtown. But the play's technical challenges could better be answered on a
Broadway stage and with a Broadway budget than at the Public, and the wider
audience that Kushner could reach on Broadway beckoned. The earliest any
production could open would be May, so that a transfer uptown from the
Public could not happen until early summer, missing this year's Tony Award
deadline: box office suicide.
In the current glow of his success, what Kushner decided looks like the
obvious choice, but at the time it was an act of chutzpah inviting hubris.
Many of the play's defining characteristics - it is long, political, about
serious subjects, and loved by the intelligentsia - are thought to be
commercial audience repellents.
'I thought it would be fun,' says Kushner, 'to take a risk.' He accepted the
Jujamcyn Organization's offer of its Walter Kerr Theatre, a relatively
intimate space that he felt best suited the play. It was soon announced that
Wolfe, the young African-American theatrical auteur who wrote and directed
last year's Broadway musical hit Jelly's Last Jam, would direct. And New
York has not stopped hearing about the play since.
That his risk paid off is due, at least in part, Kushner thinks, to recent
changes in America's social and political climate. 'We are in the middle of
an historic transformation for gays and lesbians in this country. People are
seeing Angels on Broadway as a harbinger of that, or, as a symptom of it, if
it's something they don't approve of.'
Though Angels opened big, it still faces its greatest challenge: staying
big. When the rush of ticket sales after the Tony Awards (which it is bound
to sweep) has died down, will Angels be a success with tourist audiences and
theatre parties?
'The biggest gratification right now is that we've done something that
defies the conventional wisdom that big, daring political plays can't play
on Broadway,' says Gordon Davidson, the artistic director of the Mark Taper
Forum/Center Theatre Group which is one of Angels Broadway producers, 'but
that's not to say that we are out of the woods yet. Once we get past this
initial surge we have to get to a much wider audience.' Kushner agrees: 'We
still have to prove that there is a real audience for this show and that it
can work as a popular event.'
It is certainly not a show that is going to make a fortune for its
producers. Not only is it expensive to mount and keep running, but it will
cut back to four performances a week in August and September while the
company rehearses Perestroika. Kushner's insistence that there be low-price
tickets available at every performance - his way of assuring accessibility
to the downtown community - and the dollar per ticket that is donated to
Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, also cut into profits.
Kushner surveys his ever-expanding kingdom with exhaustion: 'There was a
production of Angels in Sydney that's now running in Tel Aviv, and there are
productions planned in Japan, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, France,
and . . . other places. The play's going to have a new life in this country
in regional theatres and in amateur and college productions, and I'm excited
about that. I hope that the life of this play will go on and on, but this
part of it, which has been the most extended and difficult project of my
life, will come to an end when Perestroika opens in the fall in New York and
London (at the National, where it will run in repertory with Millennium,
both directed by Declan Donnellan). I hope I get it right this time because
if I don't I just can't go back and fix it. I have to move on. I can't keep
writing Angels in America all my life.'

FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: YMSO tackles social themes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a double achievement to come up with a programme which is not only
musically ambitious, but also politically correct. For its Royal Festival
Hall concert on Wednesday - a splendid achievement all round - the Young
Musicians Symphony Orchestra brought together two works which tackle major
social themes of our century.
The First Symphony of John Corigliano is the more recent, the more urgent in
what it has to say. First performed in 1990, this is the composer's
symphonic tribute to friends who had died from AIDS. It is impossible to
escape the issue that the music confronts, for the theme is no convenient
tag attached at a late stage; it dominates the argument from the first note
to the last. The message and the music cannot be divorced.
In these circumstances a cool-headed evaluation of the symphony's musical
virtues is not easy (one might even say not desirable.) Corigliano's style
is overtly sensation-seeking. The thumping heartbeat on the timpani, the
'brutal scream' of death from madness, the unashamed sentimentality as
fragments of favourite music from better times are heard in the distance -
all these are obvious effects, which are probably half expected even before
the symphony begins.
What still makes the listener gasp is their impact. In his desire to blast
the audience out of complacency, Corigliano has not stinted on the size of
the orchestra. The YMSO had players spilling into the choir seats (it
seemsunlikely that a professional orchestra here could afford to put the
symphony on). Under James Blair the young musicians played with enormous
intensity and the rage, the passion, the sadness of the music were
white-hot.
In the 1930s other world problems occupied the thinking composer's mind.
Tippett's oratorio A Child of Our Time ostensibly deals with the hounding of
a Jewish mother and son, but the use of spirituals at the point where Bach
would have had chorales points to wider sympathies ('in the continual
persecution one race stood for all').
The YMSO performance was not on the level of the Corigliano for unbuttoned,
spontaneous involvement, but it was as involving as many a professional
encounter with this score. Blair obtained acute, sharp playing from his
musicians. The Crouch End Festival Chorus was well rehearsed and there was a
fine young quartet of soloists, especially Stephen Gadd, the firm and
eloquent bass.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: Pilko walks and talks - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON in Kyrgyzstan has a regrettably comic sound to it. Tony
Wilkinson, who travels less far but more often on Radio 4, gets a nickname,
as in Wilko's Spain, also on this week. In his engaging talk last Thursday
John Pilkington tried to add some fun to his chat by, for example, not
cutting from his tape his fall into a snowdrift; but mostly it was purely
informative. He went to Kyrgyzstan in 1991, when it was only just disengaged
from the USSR and was now Kirghizia, though no one had noticed that. The
more vital reform announced this week, with the rouble replaced by the som,
would be noticed all right, for in Pilko's Kyrgyzstan there was already high
inflation.
Pilkington told us little of how he lived for the three months of his visit;
but he was given sheep's milk yoghurt by a herdsman who had 100 sheep and
eight children and thought everything was fine. He described the myriad new
market stalls in Parliament Square in Bishkek (probably Fronze on your map).
President Akayev was quoted as saying that 'the market was favourable for
foreign investment', and indeed the Italians were involved in the silk mill
near Ozh, on the old Silk Road. Pilkington seemed never to have had trouble
finding English-speakers - evidently he has some Russian, even if not
Kirghiz or Uzbek. Most of his talk was about his walking exploits, and very
impressive these were. The producer was John Watkins.
John Spurling's MacRune's Guevara, the second Sunday play in Radio 3's 1968
season was actually in the National's 1969 Workshop. I wrote then that it
was 'as trenchant as it is comic', and I stick by that, though I have to say
that this production under Jeremy Howe is not quite as comic as that of 1969
under Frank Dunlop. It is a series of parodies of Che Guevarra's exploits in
current theatrical styles - orgy, five-act drama, musical, etc - written on
the wall of his bedroom by MacRune, a Scottish-Irish artist, rescued by the
next tenant. It is less easy to laugh at a joke second time, and I had to
work harder, but it was worth another airing and was well played.
The 1968 theme was also shown in some half-hour Messages. First, the message
of Timothy Leary, Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out, mostly a boost for LSD, which
William Burroughs approved, Alan Ginsberg did not, and in England - those
were the days] - was used mostly by the middle-classes at Oxford and
Cambridge. Om dealt with 'transcendental meditation'. Ginsberg was there
too, but the best-known practitioners were the Beatles, with Ravi Shankar
and the Maharishi. I ignored further messages, and Radio 2's Tuning In, a
new series for Tuesdays, is more about the radio than other narcotics, in
the 1950s yet.
I meant not to write more about 1968, but I cannot miss Edward Bond's Early
Morning next Sunday, which in 1968 was followed by a 'teach-in' that
liberals thought prompted the end of theatre censorship, though it was
mostly about John Calder's Defence of Literature, stimulated by Last Exit to
Brooklyn.
The theme of Radio 4's Monday Play, Grandma and Ms Chaterjee by Kitty
Fitzgerald, was bizarre enough for 1968, but it dealt with working-class
people of our own day. Hospital-bound Kathleen Riley (Liz Kelly) and her
fellow septuagenarian Mira Chaterjee (Leena Dhringra) can induce radio sets
to emit the voice of their Goddess (Julie Christie). She preaches atheism
and feminism, emphasising sex; she sneers at the Bible and condemns the many
deaths in the pursuit of Christianity. This distresses their everyday
relatives, taints the relationship of engaged granddaughter Breda and her
devout Philip, even leads to police activity. We are not expected to believe
it, I hope, but at least we may conclude that the Goddess's principles are
for the general good. Kate Rowland directed.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: Eccentric's collection goes on the road - Elspeth
Moncrieff takes up the story of the philanthropist Albert Barnes's
Foundation now that Richard Glanton has taken over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELSPETH MONCRIEFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BARNES Foundation situated in Merion, a smart suburb of Philadelphia, is
notoriously inaccessible, often dubbed 'the greatest museum you never heard
of'. Now it is closing down for two years and, in an unprecedented world
tour, has sent 90 or so of its paintings to Washington, going on from there
to Paris, Tokyo and two further unconfirmed venues.
The exhibition, Great French Paintings From The Barnes Collection, includes
such masterpieces as Seurat's 'Poseuses', Matisse's 'Bonheur de Vivre' and
Van Gogh's 'Joseph-Etienne Roulin'. Sixteen glorious Renoirs, 20 Cezannes,
15 Matisses and nine Picassos will be exposed to mass public scrutiny for
the very first time.
The tour, expected to raise Dollars 15m, Dollars 7m of which to restore the
Foundation's buildings and the rest to boost the existing Dollars 9.8m
endowment fund, has whipped up a storm of controversy. Many people question
the conservation issues involved and the ethics of overturning the will of
its eccentric founder, Dr Albert Barnes.
In a typically American 'rags to riches' story, Barnes, the son of a
Philadelphian butcher, made his fortune through the discovery of a patented
antiseptic, and acquired an art collection. Not for him the pursuit of
famous Old Masters to aggrandise his social status. Instead he scoured the
Parisian dealers and studies for modern art, purchasing 171 Renoirs, 57
Cezannes 54 Matisses and 19 Picassos and 'discovered' Soutine who, with
Modigliani and other School of Paris painters, he introduced to the US.
Barnes decided to turn his collection into a personal 'educational
experiment under the principles of modern psychology as applied to
education.' The Barnes Foundation was created in 1922; it was never
conceived as a public gallery but as a place for the education of 'plain
people who gain their livelihood from daily toil'. Barnes's own factory
workers were subjected to the experiment with two hour breaks put aside for
aesthetic instruction.
The display of the galleries was never to be altered from Barnes's
idiosyncratic hang which ignored art historical schools. Paintings by
Picasso and Modigliani are juxtaposed with second rate old masters, African
masks, Greek sculpture and New Mexico folk art. There are no labels or
explanations. To complete his experiment, Barnes introduced a collection of
metalwork. Candlesticks and tea pots sit in front of paintings by Matisse
and Picasso and weather vanes hinges and keyholes punctuate the walls at
regular intervals along with brightly coloured American Folk art, pottery,
painted chests and furniture and Navajo rugs.
Barnes had broken down the established perimeters surrounding art history,
but the effect is so bizarre one senses a wicked sense of humour below the
apparent seriousness. King in his little kingdom, he delighted in turning
away such luminaries as Le Corbusier, TS Elliot or millionaire collector
Walter Chrysler. None of the works were ever to be lent or reproduced in
colour - the exhibition catalogue is the first of its kind - and social
activities, with their associated preening and posturing, were not permitted
inside the galleries. A decade after Barnes's death in 1951, after its tax
exempt status had been challenged, the Foundation was forced to admit the
public two and a half days a week. Otherwise it remained frozen in time.
Barnes appointed Lincoln University, a small local black college with the
power to nominate four of the five Barnes Trustees. In 1990, a combination
of circumstances saw Richard Glanton elected Chairman of the board of
Trustees and the pace of this inward looking institution was dramatically
changed. Glanton is a 46 year old ambitious African-American attorney who
has no artistic or museum qualifications. He decided that the building was
in need of an urgent conservation and security upgrade and proposed selling
Dollars 15 million of paintings to finance the operation.
A storm of protest shook America and Glanton quickly changed his tactics. He
enlisted Walter Annenberg, the Philadelphian publishing billionaire and art
collector on his side, which silenced all museum opposition. Annenberg, one
of the most generous patrons of American Museums, was at the time courting
four leading Institutions who all hoped to receive his magnificent
collection of Impressionists. In the event he left it to the Metropolitan in
New York. Glanton explained that the idea for the tour and accompanying
catalogue came from Annenburg.
Suddenly Museum directors throughout the world were eating out of his hand
at the thought of the prestige and ticket revenues this remarkable and
unknown collection would bring. Paris has agreed a loan fee of Dollars 2.5m,
Tokyo Dollars 4.5m and the Royal Academy tried desperately to secure the
exhibition for London, but failed, unable to raise the necessary
sponsorship.
The contract to publish the catalogue has been awarded to Alfred A Knopf,
and a licensing agent has been hired to unlease a flood of Barnes
memorabilia, reproductions of 16 of the paintings will cost Dollars 600
each. Glanton estimates the potential revenue at about Dollars 15 million.
Glanton's critics, led by the students of the foundation, claim he is
destroying its very essence. By seeking a court injunction to overturn the
founders will and tour and publish the collection he has violated a basic
moral trust. Glanton counters their claims with equanimity, he wants only to
bring the foundation securely into the 21st century.
In the future he hopes to turn the Barnes into 'a full educational
institution, running accredited courses with two chaired professors endowed
from Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania.'
One of Glanton's most outspoken critics is the New York dealer Richard
Feigen, who was formerly a Lincoln board member and on the Barnes
Foundation's Art Advisory committee. He questions the whole raison d'etre of
the tour and the wisdom of subjecting masterpieces of this size and quality
to such hazardous exposure. Prior to Glanton's appointment he had undertaken
detailed surveys into the condition of the building. 'It was not in that bad
condition. The paintings are all on canvas and on the whole in exceptionally
good condition. The humidity, ventilation, air-conditioning and security
systems could have been brought up to standard with the minimum of
disruption to the Foundation and the students and the money obtained through
an appeal. And if the building is in such appalling condition why are the
paintings fit to travel?'.
Glanton admits that the paintings are 'in pristine condition and have not as
yet suffered any damage.' However, 'the building is a long term hazard and
if they continue in poor environmental conditions there will be serious
consequences.'
What ever the tour's detractors claim, this is an exhibition the crowds will
flock to. But although the paintings may look their very best in the
high-tech conditions of a Washington or Paris show, seen thus they will have
little to do with the spirit of Albert Barnes. The selection has focused on
the most popular aspects of the collection virtually ignoring Soutine and
the school of Paris and all the applied arts so dear to Barnes. To
understand one of this century's true eccentrics take the pilgrimage to
Merion to see the Picasso hanging next to the pitchfork on the old burlap
covered walls.
Great French paintings from the Barnes collection, National Gallery of Art,
Washington until August 15; Musee d'Orsay, Paris, September 6-January 2
1994; National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, January 21-April 3, 1994. Other
dates and venues to be determined.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: Arts Council to patronise the underdogs - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAT BAND of unregenerate old hippies, the members of the Arts Council,
gathered at Woodstock this week, to overthrow the national arts scene as we
know it. OK, it was Woodstock Oxford rather than Woodstock NY, but their
conclusions would have received a cool 'right on' from any survivors of the
1960's. Cultural diversity; more money for education and 'outreach'; support
for new creative works; along with finally biting the bullet and funding
fewer arts organisations better, were the buzz words to emerge from the two
day conflab.
In addition to these familiar good intentions there were some actual
specifics - contemporary dance and the visual arts are going to receive more
subsidy at the expense, it seems, of the theatre, in particular the regional
theatre. So the two most unpopular art forms win out over the most popular.
Contemporary dance has been shedding its always tiny audience quite
dramatically in recent years and the visual arts, by which the Arts Council
means contemporary art, is the most elitist and universally disparaged arts
activity in the land.
Fortunately the Arts Council has also chosen the two most insignificant art
forms to patronise. It gives less than Pounds 2m of its 1993-94 budget of
Pounds 225m to contemporary dance, and only around Pounds 5m to the visual
arts. They can hardly absorb more than an extra Pounds 3m between them, so,
in theory, few local theatres, or orchestras, or popular classical ballet
companies need disappear through this prejudice.
An even bigger constraint on a wide scale slaughter is government funding.
The government is pledged to reduce its subsidy to the Arts Council by
Pounds 5m in 1994-95. History suggests that a planned budget has never
actually taken effect - last minute lobbying has always secured more cash -
but this year the government could actually take its axe to the arts. The
Heritage Minister, Peter Brooke, is weak and the Pounds 50b national
overdraft is awesome. The Council's secretary general, Anthony Everitt, said
yesterday: 'I am very glum'.
So the nation's arts companies can expect to hear in December that they will
have their grants cut, and the Council will probably take advantage of the
universal misery to start its commitment to withdraw cash from some clients
and give more to others. The howls of anguish will be very loud but the
government will take most of the flak.
A year ago the Arts Council seemed to be on the way out. Now it is taking
the initiative. It has made clear it expects the Regional Arts Boards to
fall in line with its policy and it is looking forward to getting its hands
on the Lottery money devoted to the arts. But with a government commissioned
report into its operations by Price Waterhouse landing on the Heritage
Ministers desk any day now its ebullience may be short lived.
When not chairing the Arts Council, Lord Palumbo is a property tycoon. All
the more galling for him then that the Council must pay out Pounds 500,000 a
year in rent on a property it has not occupied for years.
The Council moved out of its grand premises at 105, Piccadilly to a more
modest home in Westminster in 1991, but it still carries the lease on a
building at the rear of 105, which was acquired to accommodate a staff
over-flow. It has been frantically seeking a new tenant, but with no luck.
With almost five years of the lease still left to run the Council needs a
quick pick up in the property market to release this sizeable sum of money
which could be the life blood for many hard pressed arts companies.
Another blow for Lord Palumbo is that his brain child, the Arts Foundation,
the organisation set up to foster the avant-garde in the arts, ended its
first year with a deficit of over Pounds 50,000. In addition to the
investment income it received on its Pounds 1m endowment from the mysterious
benefactor, Mr Hoch, it attracted only Pounds 1,000 in additional revenue.
So income of Pounds 140,000 was far exceeded by expenditure, which included
just Pounds 49,000 in grants. With the Foundation currently awaiting its new
director its future looks bleak.
The arts sponsorship industry was in a self-congratulatory mood when it
gathered at the Tate this week to celebrate the winners of the Goodman and
Garrett Awards. Lord Sainsbury was Pounds 10,000 richer after receiving a
cheque from Lord Goodman in appreciation of his voluntary encouragement of
business support for the arts, while Ruth McKenzie of the Nottingham
Playhouse took the professionals award from Lord Garrett for boosting the
sponsorship take at the Playhouse from Pounds 2,000 in 1990 to Pounds
117,800 today.
Of course the winners pass on the cash, Lord Sainsbury giving his money to
the Benesh Institute of Choreology, which records the dance steps of
ballets, and Ruth McKenzie to the Playhouse educational programme. The
awards were, in their turn, sponsored by Reed Elsevier.
For once the speeches were fierce, Lord Sainsbury taking a swipe at the Arts
Council (which had eliminated the Benesh's annual grant) and Lord Goodman
comparing today's Arts Ministers unfavourably with Ministers of the past,
especially Jennie Lee. The current incumbent, Peter Brooke, diplomatically
left before Lord Goodman spoke, but there is a growing groundswell in the
arts world that he must fight his corner more fiercely with the Treasury
ministers - or go.
The one topic not mentioned was the current disaster affecting the hosts of
the evening, the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts. A routine
audit in March suggested that the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme,
which ABSA administers on behalf of the Government, had given Pounds 150,000
in top up grants to imaginary arts companies claiming to have received
sponsorship money from equally mythical companies, or their subsidiaries.
The British Sponsorship Incentive Scheme administrator Nicholas Wood is
currently on police bail.
ABSA hopes to retrieve a good slice of the money. A few years ago a short
lived West End play was based on the idea of an obscure northern theatre,
which put on bingo and striptease, asking for, and receiving, an Arts
Council grant. The boundaries between the arts and reality have always been
murky.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: Open house on the Carre - A Parisian fair with a party
atmosphere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT RAINED buckets but thousands turned up and some even bought art. The 140
dealers on the block of seven streets called the Carre Rive Gauche, next to
Paris's Musee d'Orsay, threw open their annual spring time open house event
last Tuesday evening to charm Parisian and foreign collectors with free
champagne and lots of meagre-looking potted plants topped with tricoleur
flags.
The Carre covers every artistic speciality from Chinese porcelain to Old
Master paintings and over recent years the open house events held in May
(dealers put on special displays and stay open longer hours) have been as
depressed as the art market itself. This year a number of galleries spared
themselves the expense of joining in while others complained that too many
collectors, frightened by low prices, were unwilling to part with their
belongings. But the area, as well as being delightful to visit - it contains
some of the most handsome town houses and courtyards in Paris - has an
abundance of exceptional objects this year. Dealers report that high quality
art is selling and trade in lower priced items is better than it has been
for several years.
Pierre and Dominique Chevalier of France's leading tapestry dealers, Galerie
Chevalier on the Quai Voltaire are displaying a small and beautifully fresh
16th century tapestry of the Virgin of the Rosary, made in the Catholic area
around Lucerne. It sold immediately on Tuesday evening. Pierre Chevalier
said the market seemed to be shaking itself out of the slump but that
collectors pushed hard bargains.
Proving his confidence in the Paris market, Frankfurt furniture dealer
Thomas Poller has gone into association with the Chevaliers and become the
only specialist in a city in Biedermeier. Nearby, medieval art dealers
Bresset are showing a very rare 1490 wood sculpture of the Annunciation by
Maastricht artist Jan van Steffesweert for around Fr500,000. The Virgin sits
in a garden symbolic of maidenhood with a unicorn while the Archangel
Gabriel, dressed like a hunter, knocks at the door.
In a different vein Lorraine Norre at 6, rue de Beaune has a carved Russian
chair of the Talachkine school in the line of the English 'arts and crafts'
style, similar to two others in the Musee d'Orsay. Porcelain expert Helene
Fournier, at 25 rue des Saints Peres, is showing 18th century earthenware
terrines resembling cabbages and melons while Jean-Pierre Gros, just down
the street, has three Beauvais tapestries of 1680 in exceptional condition
depicting Louis XVl in front of his Royal residences.
Next door to the Carre, which continues tomorrow (Sunday) the 50 dealers in
contemporary and African art of the Saint-Germain district are also staging
an open house event this weekend. Before the market slumped in 1990, high
prices were squeezing work by young artists out of galleries and
intimidating many visitors from going inside. Nowadays more galleries are
investing in lesser known talent at reasonable prices.
That change is immediately obvious in Saint Germain, which has chosen an
Italian theme this year. Some galleries are still showing surefire classics.
The Galerie Krief at 50 rue Mazarine has minutely drawn semi abstract
compositions in enamel on aluminium by Roman artist Gianfranco Baruchello.
Galerie Di Meo is exhibiting mixed media on cardboard works by Pierre Pizzi
Cannella, member of the circle of young Roman painters; and Galerie Protee
at 38 rue de Seine is staging the first ever one-man show in France devoted
to the Italian artist Bargoni.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Summer Festivals: Jazz from London to Montreux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

EVEN AS you read this, sound checks are taking place all across North
London. The festival season kicks off today with the launch of the London
Jazz Festival (May 14-23). A successor to the Camden fest, the event has
been expanded by the involvement of the north London boroughs of Islington
and Hackney and this year involves nearly 100 concerts at 13 metropolitan
venues. Eclectic programming has produced main attractions to suit all
tastes and features Abdullah Ibrahim at the Hackney Empire, Tania Maria at
the Forum (May 16), Anthony Braxton at the Bloomsbury Theatre (May 22) and,
appropriately, the gospel according to the Five Blind Boys of Alabama at the
Union Chapel (May 23). A Festival Nomad ticket which allows free entry to
some concerts and concessions on the door at others costs Pounds 30. (London
Jazz Festival Information Hotline 071 911 1652)
For concentrated enjoyment in a more pastoral setting Brecon Jazz (Tel: 0874
625557), this year celebrating its 10th anniversary, is hard to beat.
Between Aug 13-15 the market hall will feature concerts by Lionel Hampton,
Wynton Marsalis and Stephane Grappelli while the rest of the town will be
jumping (and sometimes lurching) to the varied outdoor gigs held across the
Welsh market town. Weekend 'stroller' tickets let you wander from hotel bar
to outdoor bandstand although individual concert tickets for the main events
are also available.
North of the border, Glasgow (July 1-11) and Edinburgh (Aug 7-14) continue
to vie with one another - this year to produce the most in mainstream jazz.
The Glasgow International Jazz Festival (Tel: 041 227 5511) balances Oscar
Peterson, Nina Simone, BB King and Tony Bennett with the more exotic sounds
of Don Pullen's Afro-Brazilian Connection, the Art Ensemble of Chicago and
Hermeto Pascoal. The Edinburgh International Jazz Festival has clarinettist
Bob Wilber leading a tribute to Benny Goodman, Acker Bilk teaming up with
Humphrey Lyttleton and Leon Redbone lying back with a five piece band.
For its 27th outing, the Montreux Jazz Festival (Tel: 41 21 963 8282) has
moved from the foreshore of Lake Geneva and the crumbling confines of the
town's Casino to the shiny new Stravinsky Auditorium. The move could render
the festival (July 2-17) more anodyne than usual with its glittering parade
of the great and good but the fringe sessions at the New Q's club and the
likes of Ray Brown Trio plus James Morrison, Elvin Jones and Michel
Petrucciani look good. In the main hall this year animateur Quincy Jones
oversees a fortnight of showcasing from the Tribute to Duke Ellington, Vive
la France to The Atlantic Living Legends.
Montreux' rival show, the JVC Grande Parade du Jazz (July 13-24), also uses
the biggest names to draw and this year's parade is intoxicating. Lionel
Hampton, Pat Metheny, Joe Henderson, Illinois Jacquet and George Benson
feature among crossover types such as Manhattan Transfer and Manu Dibango.
(Tel: from June 14, 33 93 71 89 60)
It might sound greyer than Nice (and is probably less clement) but the
Hague's North Sea Jazz Festival (July 9-11) is as spectacular in its
programming, possibly better for its fringe events and is under cover. Its
'trumpets for Dizzy' features Roy Hargrove and Jon Faddis with an all-star
band; the 'saxophonists series' has Joe Henderson, Stanley Turrentine and
Jackie Maclean alongside the younger Joe Lovano and Kenny Garrett, for
example; pianists include Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Horace Silver, Herbie
Hancock and Chick Corea. The programme even has a 'Gigs for Kids' section.
(Tel: 31 70 354 2958).
Big is not always best and the greatest little jazz festival is the Festival
de Jazz Django Reinhardt (Tel: 33 1 64 24 60 01). Held on an island in the
Seine four kilometres from Fontainebleau on the weekend of 25 June, the
gathering of Romany clans this year features the gypsy guitars of Bireli
Lagrene and Babik Reinhardt alongside the virtuoso skills of Grappelli
sideman Martin Taylor and American Jim Hall.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Summer Festivals: Adventurous opera, classical dance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FELDKIRCH
June 16 - July 3
Schubertiade Feldkirch, Schubertplatz 1, Postfach 625, A-6803 Feldkirch,
Austria. Tel: 5522-38001. Fax: 5522-38005
Now transposed permanently from Hohenems to nearby Feldkirch, this rarefied
Schubert festival is mourning the recent retirement of Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau. But this year's programme still offers ample goodies.
Andras Schiff gives two recitals and accompanies Peter Schreier in a
selection of Goethe settings. Schreier also conducts concert performances of
uncompleted Schubert operas. Tokyo String Quartet gives a complete cycle of
Beethoven quartets. Recitalists include Christa Ludwig, Brigitte
Fassbaender, Boje Skovhus, Robert Holl, Anatol Ugorski and Cyprien Katsaris.
HOLLAND
June 1 - 30
Holland Festival, Kleine-Gartmanplantsoen 21, NL1017 RP Amsterdam. Tel:
31-020-627-6566
Adventurous opera choice forms the core of this year's Holland programme.
Ton de Leeuw's Antigone (world premiere); Steve Reich's music-theatre piece
The Cave (local premiere); a new Netherlands Opera staging of Pelleas et
Melisande by Peter Sellars, conducted by Simon Rattle; and concert
performances of Les Troyens (conductor: Edo de Waart) and Le nozze di Figaro
(conductor: John Eliot Gardiner) make up the shortlist of attractions, along
with a conspectus of the works of Henryk Gorecki, the classical world's
flavour-of-the-year.
Dance: There is a season by the Belgian choreographer Anna Teresa de
Keersmaaker at Beurs van Berlage, between June 10 and June 27, and there are
also performances scheduled by Nederlands Dans Theater on June 2, 3 and5
with a new work by Jiri Kylian; and by the Dutch National Ballet on June 17,
19, 21, 22 and24 at the Muziektheatre with a new piece commissioned from
Laurie Booth.
KUHMO CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL
July 16 - August 1
Information from Kuhmo, Tel: 010-358-86/520-936, fax /521-961; or Helsinki
Tel: 010-358-0/493-867, fax /493-956.
There is really nothing like the annual orgy of chamber music at Kuhmo. To
this tiny Finnish town below the Arctic Circle and just west of the Russian
border, distinguished and newly acclaimed European and American ensembles
and soloists come to provide some five concerts daily, besides giving master
classes. (The marathon concerts on the last two Saturday evenings may go on
until the sun has slipped briefly below the horizon and reappeared.) What
makes the festival continually exciting is that so much of it consists of
music-making by fine performers who have had just a few days to rehearse
together. Chances are taken, spur-of-the-moment insights flashed: marvellous
things happen. The atmosphere is blessedly informal, amid all those lakes
and pines. This year as usual several leading British players figure, and
there are Lieder, Japanese concerts, a great Argentinian tango ensemble, the
Maly Ballet and chamber opera too.
KYBURGIADE
August 12 - 17
Internationales Kammermusik-Festival auf Schloss Kyburg, Postfach 408,
CH-8400 Winterthur, Switzerland
Last year's inaugural event was so successful that the Kyburgiade seems
certain to become a fixture on the map of chamber music festivals. It owes
its unique atmosphere to the open-air setting of Kyburg Castle near the
Swiss town of Winterthur, and to the participation of one of Europe's
leading young string quartets, the Carmina Quartet. They are joined this
year by the Vienna String Sextet, the Orlando and Cherubini Quartets and
Basle Madrigal Soloists. The programme ranges from quartets by Beethoven,
Brahms and Dvorak, to less familiar music by Bruckner and Fanny
Hensel-Mendelssohn.
LA ROQUE D'ANTHERON
July 31 - August 22
Festival de Piano, Chateau de Florans, 13640 La Roque d'Antheron, France.
Tel: 16-4250 5115. Fax: 16-4250 4889
The castle grounds of La Roque d'Antheron, equidistant from Avignon and
Marseille, are the peaceful setting for a piano festival which has been
gathering international renown since it was founded eight years ago. Among
this year's 33 concerts are programmes celebrating anniversaries of Grieg,
Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov; a cycle of Schubert sonatas on a modern concert
grand and on pianoforte; a Debussy series using instruments of the period;
plus introductions to Medtner and Corigliano. The line-up of artists
includes Christian Zacharias, Nikolai Demidenko, Maria Joao Pires, Moura
Lympany, Michel Dalberto, Stephen Hough and the Novosibirsk Philharmonic
Orchestra from Siberia.
LONDON, THE PROMS
July 16 - September 11
Promenade Concerts Ticket Shop, Royal Albert Hall, London SW7 2AP.
Tel:071-823-9998
No binding theme for the Proms in its 99th season, and no visit from
Glyndebourne (closed for re-building): but otherwise the usual wide range of
fare, imaginative distinction of performer choice, enticing premieres and
rediscoveries and jolly popular celebrations. As ever the BBC Symphony
Orchestra takes the lion's share of concerts - such as the opening-evening
account of Strauss's opera Elektra, conducted by Andrew Davis. This year's
foreign-orchestra visitors include the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra,
European Community and Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestras (under Kurt Sanderling
and Claudio Abbado respectively); the Leipzig Gewandhaus under Masur and
Oslo Philharmonic under Janssons. Among the out-of-the-ordinary events are
the late-evening visit from the Wynton Marsalis Band and the midday concert
of Henze's Requiem (UK premiere); other new works can be expected from John
Buller, Thomas Wilson and Nicholas Sackman.
LUCERNE
August 14 - September 8
Internationale Musikfestwochen Luzern, Hirschmattstrasse 13, Postfach,
CH-6002 Lucerne, Switzerland. Tel: 41-235272
This year's programme focuses on anniversary celebrations of Tchaikovsky and
Rakhmaninov, with Alfred Schnittke as the festival's first-ever composer in
residence. Visitors from Russia include the Bolshoy Opera Orchestra and
Chorus, the St Petersburg Capella Choir and Orchestra and the Russian
National Orchestra. There will be a Rakhmaninov piano marathon with Barry
Douglas and others, the world premiere of a new work by Edison Denisov and a
Schnittke ballet programme. Visiting orchestras include the Berlin, Vienna
and Oslo Philharmonics, and the line-up of artists ranges from Jessye Norman
and Yuri Bashmet to Abbado, Barenboim, Jarvi and Sawallisch.
MONTPELLIER
July 13 - August 6
Le Corun BP 9214, 34043 Montpellier Cedex 01. Tel: 6702-0201
Radio France's annual festival continues to promote off-the-beaten-track
operas in concert formats. This year, these include Morlacchi's Barber of
Seville; Wagner's Rienzi; Zemlinsky's Birthday of the Infanta; Puccini's Le
Villi; and - best of all - Reyer's grand, unjustly neglected Sigurd, with a
fine cast headed by Chris Merritt, Michele Lagrange and Valerie Millot.
MONTPELLIER DANSE 93 June 22 - July 6
Festival Internaitonal Montpellier Danse, Hotel d'Assas, 6 rue Vieille
Aiguillerie, 34000 Montpellier. Box office: 67-60-80-08. Info: 67-60-83-60.
Fax: 67-60-83-06
There will be a certain amount of French new dance at Montepellier 93, but
of more general interest are the performance of Jason et Medee on June 27 -
a 'reconstruction' of a celebrated 18th century ballet by the Ballet du
Rhin; and a reconstruction of Filippo Taglioni's famous L'Ombre by Pierre
Lacotte for his Ballet National de Nancy on June 29 and 30.
MONTREUX
August 20 - September 24
Festival de Musique Montreux-Vevey, Rue du Theatre, Case postale 162,
CH-1820 Montreux, Switzerland. Tel: 21-963-5450. Fax: 21-963-2506
The festival can finally boast a purpose-built concert hall - the
newly-opened Auditorium Stravinsky on the shore of Lake Geneva. Montreux has
never prided itself on thematic content, but this year includes a series
devoted to French chamber music, including rare works by Reynaldo Hahn,
Vincent d'Indy and Charles-Valentin Alkan. The line-up of artists includes
Alicia de Larrocha, Teresa Berganza, Barbara Hendricks, Pinchas Zukerman,
and the Royal Concertgebouw and St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestras.
NEW YORK CITY BALLET
Balanchine Festival
Until June 27
State Theatre, Lincoln Centre New York. Tel: (212)-870-5570. Fax:
(212)-870-5693. Ticketmaster (212)-307-4100
The work of its master choreographer, George Balanchine, dominates the New
York City Ballet progamme this summer. To mark the tenth anniversary of his
death, the company will stage an eight week season of Balanchine
choreography - a miraculous 73 ballets on view - at the State Theatre,
Lincoln Centre, New York, from May 4 until June 27. Essential viewing.
PARIS
Nouveau Festival International de Danse
June 15 - 27
15 Avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris. Tel: (1)-49-52-50-50
The prestigious Nouveau Festival International de Danse de Paris has pulled
off a coup by bringing our Royal Ballet to Paris for the first time in 40
years. The company will appear at the Theatre des Champs Elysees between
June 15 and June 27 with five programmes, which inclued Mayerling, Swan Lake
and Ballet Imperial, The Judas Tree, Still Life at the Penguin Cafe, A Month
in the Country, Gloria.
ST LOUIS
May 21 - June 20
PO Box 191910, St Louis Missouri, 63119. Tel: 314-961-0171
Opera Theater of St Louis, one of the world's most pleasurable and also most
adventurous opera festivals, this year offers a world premiere - Carlson's
The Midnight Angel - alongside Massenet's Cendrillon, Don Giovanni, and
Britten's Billy Budd (in its rare original version). All are sung in
English; theatre conditions are intimate; and picknicking on the lawns of
the Loretto-Hilton Center helps create the amiable atmosphere.
SALZBURG
July 23 - August 31
5010 Salzburg, PO Box 140. Tel: 043-662-8045
The renewal of Salzburg as a place of festival excitement continues apace
under Gerard Mortier's inventive direction. A Shakespeare staging of
extraordinary interest can be expected from Deborah Warner (Coriolanus,
European debut), alongside the revival of Peter Stein's Julius Caesar. This
year's new opera productions are Cos fan tutte (with Cecilia Bartoli and
Jennifer Larmore), Lucio Silla (with Ann Murray and Luba Orgonasova), and
Monteverdi's Poppea (with Sylvia McNair and Philip Langridge) and Orfeo;
revivals include Salome and Falstaff; and there are concert performances of
Dallapiccola's Ulisse and Nono's Prometeo. Concerts of contemporary music
may have been increased, but the luxus elements of Salzburg - the parade of
top-class international orchestras, conductors, soloists and recitalists -
have by no means been eradicated. A notable occasion will be the farewell
concert of Christa Ludwig, one of the best-loved of Salzburg veterans.
SANTA FE
July 2 - August 28
PO Box 2408 Santa Fe, New Mexico 87504. Tel: 0101-505982-3855
This year's productions are a diverse, attractive mixture: La Boheme (with
Cynthia Haymon); The Magic Flute; Handel's Xerxes (in English, with
Frederica von Stade and Dawn Upshaw); Strauss's Capriccio (with Sheri
Greenawald) and a double bill of Kurt Weill rarities - Der Protagonist and
Der Zar lasst zich photographieren. And the pleasures of the place itself
never pall.
SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN

Kartenzentrale des SHMF, Postfach 3840, D-2300 Kiel 1, Germany. Tel:
431-567080. Fax: 431-569152
Like a musical mosaic, this festival spreads out from Hamburg, Lubeck and
Kiel to some of the most attractive towns in northern Germany, in venues
which give a more local atmosphere than most. There is a strong Polish
influence this year, with three Polish orchestras touring the region and
performances of Szymanowski, Penderecki and several of their less familiar
compatriots. The Festival Orchestra will give concerts under Georg Solti,
Semyon Bychkov and Valery Gergiev, and the line-up of recitalists includes
Shura Cherkassky, Jessye Norman and Anne-Sophie Mutter.
SPOLETO
June 29 - July 18
Associazione Festival dei Due Mondi, Via Cesare Beccaria 18, 00196 Rome,
Italy. Tel: 6-3210 288. Fax: 6-3200 747
Spoleto offers a hot, hectic round-the-clock collage of events, spearheaded
by two opera productions - Puccini's Trittico staged by Spoleto's ageless
festival supremo Gian Carlo Menotti in the Teatro Nuovo and The Rake's
Progress at Teatro Caio Melisso. The dance programme features the American
company Garth Fagan Dance and the Ballet of the Deutsche Oper, Berlin, with
Peter Schaufuss. Steve Berkoff directs Oscar Wilde's Salome, and there is an
Italian-language production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire.
STRASBOURG
June 4 - July 3
Festival de Musique de Strasbourg, 24 rue de la Mesange, 67081 Strasbourg
Cedex, France. Tel: 8832-4310. Fax: 8832-4238
Despite its attractive setting on the Rhine and its proximity to the
Alsatian countryside, Strasbourg has never really capitalised on its
potential as a festival centre. But this year's programme offers some
worthwhile events, including a series of concerts by the Kiev Opera
Orchestra and staged productions of Nabucco and Cosi fan tutte. There are
also concerts conducted by Pierre Boulez and Michael Gielen.
TANGLEWOOD
July 9 - August 31
Until June 14: Tanglewood Ticket Office, Symphony Hall, Boston, MA 02115.
After June 14: Tanglewood Ticket Office, Tanglewood, Lenox, MA 01240. Tel:
617-931-2000
For more than 50 years, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home has
provided a relaxed setting for concerts in the heart of the Massachusetts
countryside. The Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov anniversaries provide the
connecting thread of this year's programme, with a roster of artists
including Evgeny Kissin, Yuri Bashmet, Galina Gorchakova and Sergei
Leiferkus. Seiji Ozawa conducts a Bernstein memorial concert and a new work
by Alexander Goehr. Roger Norrington conducts two concerts, John Eliot
Gardiner makes his Tanglewood debut and William Christie directs Les Arts
Florissants in Purcell and Charpentier.
TEGERNSEE
July 3 - 14
Internationales Oleg-Kagan-Musikfest am Tegernsee, Kurverwaltung Kreuth,
Nodliche Haupstrasse 3, D-8185 Kreuth, Germany. Tel: 8029-1819. Fax:
8029-1828
The picturesque setting of Kreuth, a former court spa at the foot of the
Bavarian Alps, makes this one of Europe's most peaceful and intimate
festivals. It was founded four years ago by the late Russian violinist Oleg
Kagan and his cellist wife Natalia Gutman, and is notable for attracting
high-powered Russian virtuosi, some of them little-known in the West.
WARSAW
September 17 - 25
Warsaw Autumn, Rynek Starego Miasta 27, 00272 Warsaw. Tel/Fax: 22-310607
Despite the presence of chamber ensembles from Lithuania, Czechoslovakia and
the Netherlands, the programme of this year's Warsaw Autumn contemporary
music festival is less international than in the past two years, apparently
because of economic problems. Nevertheless, the festival continues to
provide a worthwhile international platform for Poland's lively contemporary
music scene, with prominent contributions this year from Lutoslawski (Fourth
Symphony), Penderecki (Flute Concerto) and Gorecki (Concerto-Cantata).
WEXFORD
October 14 - 31
Theatre Royal, High Street, Wexford, Ireland. Tel: 0353-53-2214
A classic Wexford trio of unjustly neglected or forgotten operas this year:
Tchaikovsky's beautiful Cherivichki (The Tsarina's Slippers); Paisiello's
Barber of Seville; and Zampa, Herold's once-popular 19th-century
opera-comique. A typically full concert schedule gives prominence to
Wexford's young singers.

AIX-EN-PROVENCE
July 11 - 28
Ancien Palais de l'Archeveche, 13100 Aix-en-Provence, France. Tel:
(16)-4217-3434
An attractively diverse trio of operas this year: Weber's musically abundant
Euryanthe, Handel's magnificent Orlando (with Felicity Palmer), both in new
productions, and a Don Giovanni revival. Among the concerts are a Berlioz
Enfance du Christ in the Cathedral and Campra's L'Europe galante in the
Archbishop's Palace theatre; among the many choice recitalists attracted to
this choicest of festival locations are Wilhelmenia Fernandez, Andreas
Schmidt, Gundula Janowitz and Lella Cuberli.
ALDEBURGH
June 11 - 27
High Street, Aldeburgh, Suffolk IP15 5AX. Tel: (0728)-453543
The first of this year's two operatic events is a concert revival of one of
Britten's less acclaimed works, the 'television opera' Owen Wingrave, long
overdue for re-evaluation; the second is Monteverdi's Orfeo (also in
concert), given by students of the Britten-Pears School conducted by a tenor
who is himself a famous Orfeo - Anthony Rolfe Johnson. Performing luminaries
include Julian Bream, Peter Serkin, the Borodin Quartet, Esa-Pekka Salonen
and Thomas Allen; composers under the spotlight include Peter Paul Nash,
Takemitsu - and, of course, the founding genius himself.
BAD KISSINGEN
June 25 - July 18
Stadt Bad Kissingen, Postfach 2260, D-8730 Bad Kissingen, Germany. Tel:
971-807110. Fax: 971-807191
The chief attraction of the 'Kissinger Sommer' is its setting in a north
Bavarian spa town. The Regentenbau - a former royal house - incorporates
four splendid concert halls, and there is also a fin-de-siecle theatre. This
year's attractions include operatic concerts with Margaret Price, Cheryl
Studer, Edith Wiens and Katia Ricciarelli; a staged production of Handel's
Tamerlano; song recitals by Emma Kirkby, Gwyneth Jones and Wolfgang
Holzmair; and symphonic concerts conducted by Lorin Maazel, Kurt Sanderling
and Gerd Albrecht.
BATH
May 21 - June 6
Linley House, Pierrepoint Place, Bath BA1 1JY. Tel: 0225-463362/466411
The last Bath festival under the directorship of Amelia Freedman, founder of
the Nash Ensemble, focuses on the music of Grieg (a 1993 anniversary
composer), Schumann and Robin Holloway (two Nash concerts in the opening
weekend). Other attractions are the front-rank pianists - Brendel, Alexeyev,
Pizarro, Kovacevich, Joanna McGregor, Schiff, Melvyn Tan - among this year's
crop of recitalists, and a clutch of Norwegian groups (the pianist Leif Ove
Andsnes, Norwegian String Quartet, Norwegian Chamber Orchestra) to add
authenticity to the Grieg celebrations.
BAYREUTH
July 25 - August 28
Kartenburo, Bayreuther Festspiele, Postfach 100262, D-8580 Bayreuth,
Germany. Tel: 921-20221
Interest this year focuses on a string of debuts. The east German dramatist
Heiner Muller tackles his first-ever opera production, Tristan und Isolde,
to be designed by another Bayreuth debutant, Erich Wonder. After a decade as
Bayreuth's reigning Kundry, Waltraud Meier attempts the soprano heights of
Isolde, while Siegfried Jerusalem tackles his first Tristan. Daniel
Barenboim returns to conduct his second Bayreuth Tristan. In Parsifal, the
new Kundry is Deborah Polaski, while Poul Elming and Linda Finnie join the
cast of Lohengrin.
BERGEN
June 2 - 15
Bergen International Festival, Box 183, 5001 Bergen, Norway. Tel 5-216100
Fax 5-315531
Bergen is celebrating two landmarks - the 40th birthday of its festival, and
the 150th anniversary of its most famous son, Edvard Grieg. The Norwegian
Ballet presents two new Grieg ballets, while orchestras from Bergen and
Trondheim play the major symphonic works. The festival also showcases
leading Norwegian instrumentalists - including cellist Truls Mork, pianist
Leif Ove Andsnes and violinist Arve Tellefsen. Dmitri Kitaenko conducts a
Schnittke world premiere, English National Opera gives two performances of
Jonathan Miller's mafioso production of Rigoletto and Ingmar Bergman brings
his Stockholm production of Ibsen's Peer Gynt.
BERLIN
August 31 - September 30
Berliner Festspiele, Kartenburo, Budapester Strasse 50, D-1000 Berlin 30,
Germany. Tel: 30-254890. Fax: 30-254 8911
This year's festival is a meeting point between Europe and Japan, with
performances by the Tokyo Ballet, the New Symphony Orchestra of Tokyo,
traditional Kabuki and Noh theatre companies and other Japanese ensembles.
There are concerts conducted by Abbado, Ashkenazy, Barenboim, Maazel,
Norrington, Sanderling and Tennstedt, plus Beethoven piano recitals by
Brendel and Pollini, and a visit from the Paris-based Peter Brook Company
with L'homme qui, the British director's latest theatre piece.
BREGENZ
July 20 - August 23
Bregenzer Festpiele, A-6901 Bregenz, Postfach 311. Tel: (5574) 4920-228
The opera festival on the Austrian corner of Lake Constance continues to
solidify its connection with front-rank British opera producers. This year's
operas are Nabucco on the floating stage, in a production by David Pountney,
and Giordano's Fedora indoors, in a Jonathan Miller production with Mara
Zampieri.
BUXTON
July 14 - August 1
Buxton Opera House, Buxton, SK17 6XN
Turbulence behind the scenes preceded the finalising of this year's
programme: Jane Glover departed from the post of Artistic Director before
actually occupying it, in circumstances of some controversy. With her
departed an attractive-looking opera-plan; what replaces it has -
intentionally but at the same time disappointingly - a bought-in look: a
Jonathan Miller production of Cimarosa's Secret Marriage borrowed from Opera
North, and another Miller production (distinctly mediocre and poorly cast)
of Donizetti's Maria Stuarda borrowed from Monte Carlo Opera. Buxton's days
as a source of home-generated festival-opera excitements seem to be gone for
good.
CHELTENHAM
July 3 - 18
Festival Box Office, Town Hall, Cheltenham GL50 1QA. Tel: 0242-523690
An exciting 'first' for Cheltenham - the specially-commissioned premiere of
Michael Berkeley's first opera, the Kipling-inspired Baa Baa Black Sheep
(given by Opera North) - ties in with an Cheltenham ambitious project, the
larger examination of works by both composing Berkeleys, Michael and his
late father Lennox (a long-time Cheltenham favourite). Among the many other
British composers prominently featured are Nigel Osborne, David Blake and
John Casken; otherwise, the mixture of orchestral and chamber music has the
familiar Cheltenham profile.
COVENT GARDEN
May 17 - 31
29 Shelton Street, London WC2H 9PU. Tel: (0839-600-600 for info,and
071-497-9977, bookings)
This London enterprise started small, has grown increasingly ambitious and,
in 1993, with sponsorship from BOC, spreads itself out in various Covent
Garden locations. Siting a new Magic Flute production (conducted by Jane
Glover) in Freemasons' Hall and one of the G &amp; S Trial by Jury in the Bow
Street Magistrates' Court may prove to be brilliant feats of imagination or
else mere gimmicks; but the two-week programme is also filled with fare,
mainly opera- or voice-oriented, of solider, simpler attractions - such as
Monteverdi's Vespers; Purcell's Fairy Queen; Handel's Belshazzar; and young
singers in recital, all in St Paul's Church, and several music-theatre
programmes by bold young companies in the Donmar Warehouse.
DRESDEN
May 20 - June 6
Direktion Dresdner Musikfestspiele, Postfach 6, D-8016 Dresden. Tel 351-486
6666
The appointment of Michael Hampe as festival director, together with
Dresden's suitability as a festival setting, augurs well for the future, but
this year's programme is hampered by lack of funds and hotel accommodation.
The emphasis is on dance, with guest productions by Nederlands Dans Theater;
Polski Teatr Tanca; Lar Lubovitch Dance Company; the Stuttgart Ballet; and
Bavarian State Ballet. Peter Ustinov stages a double-bill of Tchaikovsky's
Iolanta and Rakhmaninov's Francesca da Rimini. Visiting orchestras include
the Royal Philharmonic and Hungarian National Philharmonic, while the
Dresden Staatskapelle offers a Strauss and Schumann programme under
Sinopoli. The festival's most enchanting venues are the former court palaces
and country houses outside Dresden.
DROTTNINGHOLM
May 20 - September 4
Drottningholms Teatermuseum 'Forestallnigar', Box 27050, S-102 51 Stockholm.
Tel: 08-660-82-25
Elisabeth Soderstrom, much-loved Swedish soprano, takes over this year as
artistic director of the world's most important 18th-century theatre still
in action. Gretry's beautiful Zemire et Azor and Martn's Cosa rara are
performed by the Drottningholm-based company, Haydn's Fedelta premiata by
Stockholm Royal Opera forces; ballet and recital programmes fill out the
schedule of the first Soderstrom-devised festival season.
EAST MIDLANDS DANCE FOR '93
May 20 - 23; and August 31 - September 4
Derngate Theatre, 19 Guildhall Rd, Northampton, NN1 1dp. TEL: 0604-26222
The excellent and lively Derngate Theatre will host a variety of dance
performances this summer as part of the Dance for '93 celebrations in the
East Midlands. Events will include the Royal Ballet of Flanders with
Dracular May 20-23; and Stars of American Ballet from 31 August-4 September.
EDINBURGH
August 15 - September 4
21 Market Street, Edinburgh EH1 1BW. Tel: 031-225-5756. Fax: 031-226-7669
Edinburgh looks in particularly good shape this year. The 1992 Festival made
a large enough surplus to pay off the accumulated deficit and the early
bookings for 1993 are surprisingly heavy. This is excellent news for Brian
McMaster who had to throw his first festival together quickly last summer,
but is able to present a more considered programme this year. The
international element is all pervading. Music: Given McMaster's background
running Welsh National Opera it is hardly surprising that the music
programme is particularly strong. The main theme is a juxtaposition of the
music of Janacek and Schubert, through 13 concerts and recitals, culminating
in a concert performance of Janacek's first opera Sarka and Schubert's
rarely performed opera Die Freunde von Salamanka. There is a small homage to
Verdi, with a concert performance of his first opera, Oberto, and Peter
Stein's production for the WNO of his last, Falstaff. In addition Scottish
Opera is presenting a new I Due Foscari, and there is a performance of the
Requiem. A third strand is an exhaustive look at the work of the young
Scottish composer James MacMillan. Other music includes the UK debut of the
Canadian Opera Company with a double bill of Schoenberg's Erwartung and
Bartok's Bluebeard's Castle, directed by the notorious Robert Lepage, and
visits from the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the Oslo Philharmonic and the
South West German Radio Symphony Orchestra.
Theatre: The drama slot is also impressive this year and very international,
with four of the world's leading directors mounting productions. In addition
to Lepage's operatic double bill, the American director Peter Sellars is
responsible for The Persians, a modern version of Aeschylus' tragedy by
Robert Auletta, and Robert Wilson is bringing over the Hebbel Theater of
Berlin in Gertrude Stein's 1938 version of the Faust legend, Dr Faustus
Lights the Lights. The Persians is a co-production with the Salzburg
Festival, and perhaps the biggest event of this year's Edinburgh was also
seen at Salzburg last year: this is Peter Stein's production, in German, of
Julius Caesar. With 200 extras for the crowd scenes this needs a big venue
and for the first time the Festival is using the Royal Highland Exhibition
Hall at Ingliston. At least 2,000 tiered seats will be installed. McMaster
is keen to put a spotlight on overlooked playwrights. Last year
Granville-Barker got the treatment; this year the German Jakob Lenz, a
contemporary of Goethe, is singled out, with the Glasgow Citizens presenting
The Soldiers and two other Lenz works done by London's Gate Theatre.
Visual Arts: This has always been the weak link at Edinburgh, with the local
art institutions doing their own thing and largely ignoring the Festival.
McMaster has put his resources behind one large show, The Waking Dream:
Photography's First Century. It is the property of the Gilman Paper Company
and reckoned to be the greatest private photography collection in the world.
The show comes from the Met in New York and goes on to St Petersburg; this
is its only British viewing.
Dance: Edinburgh Festival treats dance shabbily yet again this year, with
only two dance companies. The good news is that the Mark Morris troupe
returns, after last year's success, with the ravishing Love Song Waltzes at
the Playhouse (August 17,18,19 evenings) with a fine quartet of singers also
in attendance, and shows new Morris pieces on the evenings of August 21, 22,
and 23. On August 28 and 29, the Bill T. Jones troupe will be on view at the
King's Theatre.
Extras: Scottish Variety Theatre hopes to recapture the 'Fabulous Fifties',
the last days of the music hall, with appearances by Jimmy Logan, Walter
Carr, the Tiller Girls, and others. Late night events include traditional
Scottish story telling, Catalan protest songs by Lluis Llach, and French
songs from Felicity Lott.

<TEXT>
GIFTS by Nuruddin Farah Serif Pounds 9.99, 242 pages
AFRICAN WOMEN'S WRITING edited by Charlotte Bruner Heinemann Pounds 6.99,
211 pages
A LONELY DEVIL by Sousa Jamba Fourth Estate Pounds 12.99, 154 pages
THE SOUTH AFRICAN critic Lewis Nkosi once spoke fondly of the African novel
as 'the bastard child of many cultures and genres.' The creative tensions of
a mixed descent are clear enough in the latest novel by Nuruddin Farah, the
expatriate Somali writer. Gifts is set in Mogadishu during the 1980s, before
much of Somalia's seaboard capital was destroyed by clan wars. This is a
love story, told largely through the reactions of the central character,
Duniya, to a persistent and kindly suitor.
Farah's fiction is rarely as simple as it seems. The puzzling arrival of a
foundling child marks a hiatus, both in Duniya's life and in the plot of the
novel. Duniya is happy to take on the baby but it dies soon afterwards and
she is thrown back on her circumspect courtship. A clue to the foundling may
well lie with that other bastard child, Nkosi's African novel.
Gifts is an exemplary hybrid, in which the Somali habit of metaphor,
grounded in oral tradition, gives depth and structure to a finely woven,
rather English prose. The arrival of the child, followed by its death, opens
an inquiry into the nature of the gift. To Farah, all gifts - from foundling
children to overseas aid for poor African states - are suspect. Food
donations, says one of his characters, undermine 'the African's ability to
survive with dignity.' Those who accept a gift at face value may merely be
conniving in their own misfortune. Caution is the answer, or part of it;
candour must supply the rest. Duniya, who has already been given away in
marriage as a young girl, can favour her suitor only in the absence of
coercion. She makes the 'gift of herself' in the closing stages of the novel
and, by doing so, retrieves a plausible innocence for love, if not for all
forms of give and take.
Farah has always written well about women. So, of course, do the
contributors to Charlotte Bruner's collection. The book is well edited with
detailed notes on the women writers in question, among them Bessie Head, the
South African novelist who died in 1986, and the Egyptian author, Nawal El
Sadaawi.
Some of the best material comes from the Maghreb. Assia Djebar writes with
wit and elegance about the stir caused in a conservative Algerian village
when a man on his travels sends a postcard home to his wife. 'My father had
quite brazenly written his wife's name . . . he had dared to refer to her in
the western manner as 'Madame So-and-So'.' Henceforth the couple speak
openly of each other and their little daughter has her first inkling of 'the
possible happiness, the mystery in the union of a man and a woman.'
So-and-so would be the best form of address for the hero of Sousa Jamba's
novel A Lonely Devil, who ascends into the higher orders of wickedness on an
imaginary island which has more than a passing resemblance to the author's
native Angola. Nando, who is abandoned at the age of four and develops a
reckless taste for cruelty, illustrates the axiom that those who are left in
harm's way do harm to others. 'We deluded ourselves,' says Nando, at the end
of a career in the torture chamber and the party caucus, 'with the idea that
the glorious future awaiting us justified anything.' This novel is a pungent
little fleur du mal; its scent clings obstinately to one's hands.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Books: Simply the colour of Chinese blood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RED SORGHUM by Mo Yan Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 378 pages
THE DAWNING by Milka Bajic Poderegin Honeyglen Publishing, Pounds 5.95 365
pages
BROTHER JACOB byh Henrik Stangerup Marion Boyars Pounds 15.95, 304 pages
THE FINAL MARTYRS by Shusaku Endo Peter Owen Pounds 14.99, 200 pages
EVERY COLOUR in the spectrum brings a train of associations in its wake. Red
means anger, the rising sun, blood, potency, victory in war - and, of
course, death.
The barbarity of Red Sorghum, a novel that explores in great and compelling
detail the fratricidal violence that engulfs three generations of a single
Chinese family in the province of Shandong from the 1920s, is underpinned
symbolically by the abiding presence of red sorghum in the fields, a crop
that grows tall and dense and, in the autumn, 'shimmers like a sea of
blood.' The novel is newly translated from the Chinese and written by a
member of the cultural affairs department of the People's Liberation Army,
Not since D H Lawrence's The Rainbow has the natural world so effectively
aided and abetted the themes of a work of fiction. The characteristics that
shock, disgust and exhilarate, in almost equal measure, in Mo Yan's
narrative are two-fold: its headlong, almost unmitigated cruelty; and the
breathtaking speed with which barbaric incident is piled upon barbaric
incident.
Almost every page seems to be taken up with the dirty, messy business of
death, death-dealing and dying, and all these incidents are rendered in a
language that possesses a kind of ritualised luxuriance.
There are two kinds of warfare being waged in the book: that among the
native Chinese themselves who, in the 1920s, seemed to be part brigands and
part freedom fighters; and between the Chinese and the Japanese in an
on-going war of resistance that reaches a climax of bloodletting in 1939.
The backdrop is almost always the same: those faithful sorghum fields in
which this orgy of fanaticism and cruelty is enacted.
The re-publication of The Dawning by Milka Bajic Poderegin, the late Serbian
novelist, is timely. The first novel in a trilogy that was never completed,
this book, too, analyses the travails of an entire people largely through
the effects on a single family, but Poderegin's manner of writing could not
be more different from Mo Yan's.
The novel spans the period from the mid-19th century until the outbreak of
the first world war, and it is set in the small town of Plevlje in southern
Yugoslavia. A Serbian family chronicle, its presentation is deceptively
leisurely in a manner often reminiscent of Turgenev, but beneath all the
painstaking attention to dress, social custom and domestic detail, there are
profound forces for change at work.
When the novel opens, Plevlje is being administered by the Turks and is also
home to an Austrian garrison. By the book's close, the Austro-Hungarian
empire is collapsing and the Turks have suffered defeat in the war of 1912,
thus expunging five centuries of shameful memories of the historic Battle of
Kosovo.
This impressive, sombre document is, above all, an extended description of
the passive, heroic suffering of that most oppressed of the social classes
in the 19th century - women; but it also reminds us, chasteningly, how deep
and extensive go the roots of present Balkan troubles.
The Danish novelist Henrik Stangerup, has just completed the third book in a
trilogy of novels (the first two were The Road to Lagoa Santa (1981) and The
Seducer (1985)) that have explored what the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard
regarded as the three essential stages upon life's way: the aesthetic, the
ethical and the religious.
Brother Jacob, the 'religious' conclusion to the trilogy, describes the life
of a 16th century mendicant Franciscan friar who has been driven out of his
native country by the dogmatism and sterility of the Lutheran Reformation,
and flees to Mexico to minister to the Amerindians. Unfortunately, he then
finds himself at war with the established forces of Roman Catholicism
because of his belief that the Amerindians themselves, being human beings,
have as much right to be ordained as priests as anyone else.
Stangerup's novel is an impassioned piece of fictionalised historical
research, compellingly learned and maddeningly abstruse by turns.
Unfortunately, it lacks the inner momentum that every novel needs if it is
to be anything more than a concatenation of fictional circumstances.
The plight of Catholic believers in Japan is a theme to which the Japanese
novelist Shusaku Endo returns repeatedly in The Final Martyrs, a new
gathering of stories that have been written over the past 40 years. In his
preface to the English edition of the book, Endo explains the reason for its
principal weakness: the tiresome overlapping of themes (others include
family disharmony and case histories in physical decrepitude, for example)
from story to story.
Endo writes that the short story form is useful because it enables the
writer not so much to present characters and themes as to explore the
possibilities of using them in more ambitious contexts elsewhere - in the
next great novel that one hopes to write, for instance. On the other hand,
no one can deny that an important writer's nail clippings are worthy of a
certain amount of forensic attention.

SUGAR CANE by Paul Bailey Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 228 pages
CAESAR by Allan Massie Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 228 pages
AMONG THE DEAD by Michael Tolkin Faber Pounds 14.99, 229 pages
PAUL BAILEY reaches for big themes of loneliness, fragility and disguise in
his seventh novel, but in spite of his clear, pared-down writing, the result
is a disappointment. Sugar Cane's central figure Stephen, a mixed-race
runaway from Halifax, teases the story along by posing riddles about his
life. The narrator, Esther Potocki, a doctor of venereal disease, rightly
guesses that he is a prostitute. But it is left to her lover Gabriel to
deduce that Stephen's mysterious 'Bish' is the notorious, self-styled
'Bishop of Wandle', jailed years before the book opens for running a ring of
rent boys from a Wandsworth warehouse.
Bailey is good on dialogue - particularly that of Esther's edgy patients -
and on interweaving Esther's memories of her parents with Stephen's
revelations. But although one of his themes is the claustrophobic ties
between children and parents, he gives improbable accounts of how his
characters try to break them. We are to believe that Esther chose
venereology to rebel against her mother's wish that she become a ballerina;
and that Gabriel can get an erection only by putting on his mother's
polka-dot dress and then shedding her memory as he takes it off. The result
of this constricted psychology is to turn the characters into grotesques.
But the greater weakness of the book is that the prolonged suspense is not
warranted by the eventual revelations. Gabriel explains to Esther that
Stephen 'needs to bewilder you. He has to make himself as opaque as he
possibly can, in order to keep you interested in him. He's scared of your
finding him ordinary'. The book takes the same risk, and fails.
Stephen's account of how he was lured into the Bishop's 'palace' is hardly
the 'descent into hell' that Esther claims. He expresses no despair and
little revulsion - or excitement - even at the regular duty of masturbating
the 'Bishop'. Soon after introduction to the punters of Piccadilly Circus,
he concludes 'the funny thing is that after a time the hundreds would all
merge into one'. And his tale - which makes up the second half of the book -
is delivered as a tape recording to Esther and Gabriel because 'I could
never tell you this to your face'. Bailey thus spares himself an exploration
of their disgust or pity, and, because the Bishop is already jailed, of
their responsibility to act.
The ducking of a confrontation between Stephen and Esther leads to a moral
blankness at the heart of the novel, nor does Bailey manage to show why the
reader should share his fascination with Stephen's descent.
The narrator of Allan Massie's Caesar has more substance. This version of
the plot to kill Julius Caesar is told through the eyes of Decimus Brutus,
the protege whom Caesar most trusted and who became one of his assassins.
Given the difficulty of bringing historical figures to life, it is
unexpectedly rich and detailed, particularly on Caesar's manipulation of
loyalty. It carries echoes of Margaret Thatcher's blindness to opposition
and of her eventual fall: 'I have heard Caesar deny the very existence of
society', says the narrator.
But the pace often slows to that of a politician's memoirs, and some
sentences take schoolroom concentration to comprehend: 'So nothing was done
on his (Ptolemy's) behalf, until, as a result of the famous meeting between
Pompey, Caesar and the millionaire booby Marcus Crassus at Lucca, the three
of them formed what Cicero (in private) described as a 'criminal conspiracy
to share sovereignty and dominate the Republic'.' Readers who dare skim over
those passages will be left scrabbling for the six-page chronology and list
of characters at the front.
In contrast, Michael Tolkin's highly amusing second novel is an effortless
read. Like his first, The Player, it will no doubt translate easily into a
satirical film of West Coast life. Frank Gale, a 'loser' by Los Angeles
standards, has been unfaithful to his wife. But he is convinced that with
the right words, and a trip to Mexico, he can repair his marriage. His self
delusion is laid bare in the opening pages as he designs what he believes
will be a more honest life.
When the aeroplane he has missed crashes, however, killing his wife and
child, the inexorable exposure of his fantasies becomes a nightmare. In the
end, the only one who has the right words is the author, who manipulates the
characters' fates with the comic deftness - and cruelty - that he showed in
his first book. Satisfyingly, with immense speed, retribution arrives.

HAUGHEY: HIS LIFE AND UNLUCKY DEEDS by Bruce Arnold HarperCollins Pounds
17.50, 308 pages
THERE ARE two ways of looking at this thoroughly recommendable biography of
Charles Haughey, the former Irish prime minister.
One is to admire the professionalism of the research and the quality of the
writing and to be swept along to the author's seemingly objective conclusion
that Haughey was a poseur who thought he could walk on water and sometimes
almost did.
The other is to stand back a bit and notice how much Ireland has changed
over the years. Surely Haughey and his friends cannot have done everything
wrong?
Haughey was prime minister on and off for about the same period as Margaret
Thatcher was prime minister of Britain, though without her continuity. Bruce
Arnold has also written a biography of Lady Thatcher and thinks that the
pair of them had something in common, 'including a shared disdain for those
under them, and a fearful, obsessive concern for control and power'. Yet
perhaps that is simply a truism about leaders who remain a long time in
office. It may be more instructive to look at Haughey in an Irish context.
Few will remember how backward Ireland was in the 1950s. It was cut off not
only from mainstream Europe but also from mainstream Britain. It was
excessively under the influence of the Catholic church. Then it began to
change.
The top of the civil service picked up the example of Italy, a country with
some of the same problems, and Ireland began a process of liberalisation,
mostly economic yet also political. It is now a matter of course that
meetings of the European Council should take place in Dublin. Even the
British no longer look down on the Irish Republic, as once they did:
friendliness towards the Irish has grown, in spite of the IRA.
All of those changes took place within Haughey's political career. It would
be an exaggeration to give him too much of the credit for them, except to
say that he was a liberal when he was at the department of justice and a
relatively free market economist when he was minister of finance.
Even when he made a wrong judgment, he was capable of reversing it. For
example, he was luke-cold at most about the New Ireland Forum and the
Anglo-Irish accord to which it led, but as prime minister he respected the
agreement.
He had one singular achievement in that he promoted the arts. He did so by
providing tax breaks for the artists rather than subsidies for the audience,
which is an enlightened as well as an economic approach. Ireland has done
well out of its writers.
Nevertheless, Haughey is a tainted figure. The main reason is his
involvement in the arms scandal at the end of the 1960s. Until then the main
case against him was simply that he was a bit of a show-off, 'a man in a
mohair suit' seeking to combine new wealth and old. It was never clear, and
Arnold provides no new evidence, where the money came from. Haughey had not
been conspicuously interested in Northern Ireland before. Arnold suggests
that he changed opportunistically because he saw the cause of the Catholic
minority in the north as a route to power in the south and a way of keeping
up with his rival, Neil Blaney.
To be fair, events in Ulster had taken a turn for the worse and there was
room for apprehension. Haughey as minister became at least party to illegal
arms imports designed to cross the border, and was at least partly found
out. Arnold says that the full details of the case will probably never be
known.
It took nearly a decade for Haughey to rebuild his reputation, yet the
striking fact is that he did. There were other suggestions of scandals and
errors of judgment to come, but where I think Arnold is unduly censorious is
in pressing that these were peculiar to Haughey. They are more in the nature
of Irish politics. True, Haughey was the son-in-law of a former prime
minister, Sean Lemass, but there is a lot of nepotism about. The Irish
system is very inbred: there are plenty of FitzGerald relations about as
well as Haughey's. And when Haughey finally left office, his successor,
Albert Reynolds, became involved in the kind of scandals that were familiar
in the past.
Arnold makes a revealing choice of word when he writes that Haughey was
'recruited' into Fianna Fail in 1947, just as he might have been recruited
into the KGB or MI5. The party has its authoritarian tendencies and fondness
for expulsions, but it does have achievements. This book is a wonderful
demonstration of the Irish talent for attacking other Irishmen: it would be
even better if it were less unremittingly hostile.

PAPER DREAMS by Stephen Glover Jonathan Cape, Pounds 17.99, 328 pages
STEPHEN GLOVER makes the foundation of The Independent newspaper sound such
larky fun that, at first, it seems difficult to explain why it all ended in
tears. As he acknowledges, Glover was lucky that his two co-founders,
Matthew Symonds and Andreas Whittam Smith, were more dedicated and
knowledgeable about newspapers - he himself could not distinguish between a
wholesaler and a retailer or between circulation and readership.
Fortunately, too, the obsessional Symonds and the languid Glover were led by
Whittam Smith, who was not only older but also enjoyed considerable City
credibility as the long-serving City Editor of The Daily Telegraph.
The book provides a vivid insider's view of the foundation of the paper: the
refusal of Lord Hartwell to consider Whittam Smith's idea of asking readers
to refinance the Telegraph; the example set by Eddy Shah; the crucial
involvement of Saatchi and Saatchi; the identification of the 'missing
readership' which could be satisfied by a new paper; and the choice of the
name.
They were also lucky: for the paper was launched at the height of the boom a
few months after Rupert Murdoch moved his papers to Wapping, which resulted
in a 'rush of applicants' from The Times and The Sunday Times. 'Mr Murdoch
may have regarded these journalists as ideologically unsound, and he may
have been overjoyed to be rid of them. But they included many of his best
journalists.'
The story is dominated by the way that 'Andy Smith, (Whittam Smith) turned
down for officer training during National Service because he supposedly did
not have leadership qualities' was transformed into a charismatic
entrepreneur who 'could have been a Nobel laureate in conviction, able to
persuade dozens of City institutions to invest in the first serious paper to
be launched in well over a century.' But his contribution was not only
financial and managerial - even Glover, turned sour by his experiences,
admits that Whittam Smith was always on the side of the reader, and credits
him with some notable touches, notably the paper's imaginative use of black
and white photographs.
Astonishingly, the City did not worry at the founders' lack of managerial
expertise, or, even more crucially, of any real experience of hard news
reporting. Glover points up the City's obsession with form, the obsessional
verification of every financial and legal detail at the expense of content -
the founders' capacity to undertake their adventure was seemingly taken for
granted by the financial community.
The resulting paper was one of the defining events of the 1980s,
demonstrating the can-do atmosphere of the times, the ability of the young
to translate dreams into practice. Interestingly, Symonds defined the paper
as mixing 'the politics of the extreme centre' with a preference for 'free
market solutions to economic problems and a responsible liberalism on social
issues,' an attitude shared by The Economist, another publication run
largely by talented and arrogant youngsters.
Glover's laid-back, semi-detached attitude makes him an admirable
chronicler, but proved a disaster when, as seemed natural, he became editor
of the Independent on Sunday, founded just as the recession was biting. But
here I must declare an interest: to adapt a phrase I was 'an unpaid acting
lance-corporal in the stage army of the good' commanded by General Glover
and can thus compare his account with the way it seemed in the front line.
As so often, the view from the trench is profoundly at variance with the
despatches of the commander-in-chief, with their obsessional,
self-justifying concentration on the political manoeuvrings at the top
rather than on the progress of the war.
Thanks to the success of the daily, the Sunday paper enjoyed a flying start,
building up a colossal head of steam - which soon evaporated. To the troops
Glover seemed to lack the energy, the enthusiasm, the decisiveness, the
clarity of vision as to the message he wished to convey and the audience he
wished to address, qualities common to all good editors. As Whittam Smith
kept repeating, the paper did not 'create enough noise.'
To make matters worse Glover surrounded himself with similar characters. His
deputy, Sebastian Faulks, was a stylish novelist and feature writer but
without any apparent interest in the actual editing process. The top brass
as a whole formed what the troops termed the 'meeting' or 'strolling'
classes, spending half their time in interminable, indecisive meetings, and
the other half strolling down the open office which housed the hacks, for
all the world behaving like overseers in a trireme looking down their
patrician noses at the rows of galley slaves. I am afraid that General
Glover is deluding himself when he says that it was 'an exceptionally happy
paper.'
Matters improved when Faulks was replaced by Stephen Fay, an energetic
former Sunday Times man with a flair for choosing and inspiring younger
journalists. But the combination of the recession and Glover's inadequacy
made a crisis inevitable: in the summer of 1991 the daily and the Sunday
were largely merged and he left.
Since then the Sunday has flourished under a new editor, Ian Jack.
Unfortunately, Glover is bitter in defeat: at no point does he face the fact
that justice was done. As he puts it: 'An editor should be allowed to edit
unless he were thought not to be up to the job.' Quite so.

GENIE: ESCAPE FROM A SILENT CHILDHOOD by Russ Rymer Michael Joseph Pounds
14.99, 227 pages
A BOOK wafted into a reviewer's hands on publicity puffs from such diverse
sources as crime writer Ruth Rendell and linguistic theorist professor David
Crystal looks immediately dubious. But some - like this - are much better
than their PR people tell us. This is an interesting moral tale, with a
central character who utters scarcely a word.
Genie - not her real name - was discovered in a small Californian town in
November 1970. Aged 13, she had spent all her life caged inside a single
room, often inside a wire-mesh cot, trapped by a demented father and a weak,
cowed mother. Having lived in almost complete silence Genie spoke not a
word, instead communicating her basic urges by a variety of crude physical
gesticulations.
The moral outrage of the media which the case aroused swiftly gave way to
the muddled clumsiness of bureaucratic care and scientific fascination.
Psychotherapists, doctoral students, social workers, lawyers and linguistic
analysts spent the next decade squabbling over who owned and had the right
to analyse - exploit is not too strong a word - Genie. No one emerges with
honour; each used her as a means of self-promotion, even while fiercely
declaiming altruistic intent.
Rymer considers previous cases of children brought up without language, the
most famous perhaps being that of Victor of Aveyron, discovered in France in
1800. The appalling irony of Genie's case is it demonstrates that while
science has progressed, humanity has not.
Were this simply a gentle delineation of man's inhumanity to man it would
scarcely be anything more than a familiar moral tale. What lifts it are
Rymer's efforts to explore the debates concerning how language is learned
and how important is the learning of language to intellectual development.
He concludes that 'the organisation of our brain is as genetically ordained
and as automatic as breathing, but, like breathing, it is initiated by the
slap of a midwife, and the midwife is grammar.'
It will be interesting to see whether this thoughtful book adds a further
layer to the exploitation of Genie. It has all the ingredients of a
Hollywood movie. Will Rymer be able to resist becoming the final player in a
grisly, shaming script? Does it snow in Greenland? Well, not always.

Stevenson

<TEXT>
ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON: A BIOGRAPHY by Frank McLynn Hutchinson Pounds 20,
568 pages
FRANK McLYNN is an extremely prolific author of second-rate biographies.
Here he does it again and takes 500 pages to tell a familiar story to which
he adds a particular spin.
Robert Louis Stevenson has always attracted hordes of biographers, no doubt
because his short life is a wonderful romance. But do we really need another
version so soon after Ian Bell's useful effort a few months ago? Jenni
Calder and James Pope-Hennessy are still available and - oh Lord - there are
probably more in the pipeline for next year's centenary. The answer depends,
of course, on what the biographer has to offer.
McLynn is a practitioner of the dreaded new genre of the 'psycho-biography',
although his qualifications are by no means clear. For those still ignorant
of this fashion, one quotation serves to illustrate the quality of his
(psycho)analysis - and also his prose: 'Proper 'socialisation' into normal
attraction to the female was further vitiated by the stern Victorian moral
code and if Thomas Stevenson was indeed instrumental in ending an early
relationship with a prostitute . . . this would both have increased oedipal
antagonism between father and son - since Louis would, at least
unconsciously, have seen Thomas as a dog in the manger - and left him in a
sexual cul-de-sac.' Note that this appalling farrago is dependent on a
speculative 'if'.
The main point about this book is that McLynn has decided that the wife,
Fanny Osbourne, is the villain of the piece and has turned a conventional
biography into a polemic of abuse against the wretched woman. Fanny has for
long had her critics, who many years ago began to question the portrait of
the dedicated wife nursing her consumptive husband.
It can be agreed that she was often absent, often ill herself, selfishly
extravagant, over-indulgent of her children, 'insanely jealous' of his
friends. But in McLynn's portrait she becomes a monster; RLS became 'a
martyr to the greedy grasping Osbourne family'; he died at 44 of 'cerebral
haemorrhage brought on by overwork and anxiety caused by the Osbourne clan.'
This older divorcee from Indianapolis was, from the beginning, 'a very rum
creature indeed'. Perhaps she was. But we soon start to wonder whether she
can have been devoid of virtue. The vilification of Fanny, and also her
children - notably the 'treacherous ingrate' Lloyd - is so obsessive, so
constant and unrelieved, that the reader begins to object and say, well,
Louis must have liked her, and she did nurse him often, and yes, her
illnesses may have been psychosomatic, but that does not mean they were not
illnesses. Then there are the poems: 'Dark as a wayside gypsy,/Lithe as a
hedgewood hare,/She moves a glowing shadow/Through the sunshine of the
fair;/ And golden hue and orange,/Bosom and hand and head/She blooms a tiger
lily,/In the snowdrifts of the bed . . .'
Biographers are required to be very convincing. For example, it has always
been known that RLS dreamed the story of Jekyll and Hyde, and told it to his
wife. His first draft of the dream, she convinced him, was not right, and as
a result he burned it and started again - to finish with a masterpiece.
McLynn sees it otherwise. The diabolical Fanny, concerned principally for a
best-seller and alarmed by the 'adult view of sexuality' in the first
version, made such a stink that he threw it in the fire. There is no proof
for this version of events. It is at least possible that Fanny, as she and
Lloyd later reported, realised that the first attempt to communicate the
dream which she had already been told about somehow missed the point. No-one
can be sure; it does not really matter.
Fanny apart, McLynn is good when he writes about sailing in the South Seas
(which sounds terrifying), about RLS's ambivalence about the
Pacific-as-Paradise, about his constant money worries, about his problems
with the Grundyism of the 1990s. McLynn is far too long. He surely overdoes
the tension between father and son. He is numbingly boring about Samoan
politics. He cannot resist fisticuffs with earlier biographers. More
happily, he esteems, in particular, Kidnapped, The Master of Ballantrae, The
Beach of Falesa and The Ebb-Tide - with which we can all agree.
And RLS survives yet again - the Scottish genius who combined the awkward
strands of Calvinism and Jacobitism, the lover who pursued his woman from
France to America, the sickly boy who escaped to the South Seas, the
lifelong consumptive who recovered his health in the tropics to die there of
a stroke. Leave him with this exchange with Henry James, his friend and
admirer: of Treasure Island, James had pronounced, 'I have been a child but
have never been on a quest for buried treasure.' To which RLS replied in an
essay: 'Here indeed is a wilful paradox, for if he has never been on a quest
for buried treasure, it can be demonstrated that he has never been a child.'

de la Mare

<TEXT>
THE IMAGINATION OF THE HEART: THE LIFE OF WALTER DE LA MARE by Theresa
Whistler Duckworth Pounds 25, 478 pages
WALTER de la Mare had one of the longest innings of any British poet. He was
a young hopeful at the turn of the century; he was a Grand Old Man in the
1950s, a CH and an OM, having turned down the offer of a knighthood. By then
he had to his credit two massive collected volumes - Collected Poems and
Collected Rhymes and Verses (both now reissued in paperback by Faber). He
was exceptionally active as a creative writer and anthologist from his
sixties onwards, producing five volumes of poetry between 1942 and his
death, aged 83, in 1956.
When de la Mare was an obscure young man, working as a clerk in London, the
cult of Beauty associated with Oscar Wilde and his set was all the rage. One
of the photographs in Theresa Whistler's The Imagination of the Heart, an
authoritative biography gestated over many years, shows de la Mare in the
typical gilded lily attire of the aesthetic movement. When he was an old
man, a widower living at Twickenham, the cynosure of a wide circle of
friends and admirers, his dress had become casual and his publisher had
become the author of the Four Quartets, thanks to his son Richard, a
colleague of Eliot's.
Thus de la Mare was not just pre-modernist but a pre-Georgian to boot. True,
generous amounts of his work were included by his benefactor Sir Edward
Marsh in his collections of Georgian Poetry from 1912-1922, and those
best-selling anthologies helped to establish de la Mare's reputation; but
while de la Mare became friendly with other Georgians such as W H Davies,
Ralph Hodgson, Siegfried Sassoon and Rupert Brooke, as a poet he remained
aloof from the movement. And he stayed staunchly his own man throughout his
working life. He inhabited a remarkably solid and impregnable ivory tower, a
place of enchantment and mystery, unsullied by ennui and sensuality, where a
mature technical mastery over language and rhyme is deployed to re-create
the innocent vision of childhood.
The ancestry of his work may be found partly in Edgar Allen Poe and also in
the anonymous tradition of the Border Ballads, whose haunting refrains and
narrative magic are echoed continually. As a poet de la Mare remained aloof
not just from poetic movements and fashions but from contemporary history.
The traumas of the 20th century are seldom reflected in poetry which seems a
delightful irrelevance once childhood is over. We feel it to be a truancy
from responsibility.
Theresa Whistler does not combat directly the view of him as a poetic
isolationist but her book helps the reader to see that there was rather more
to him than it would suggest. To begin with, he had the most almighty
struggle to become a writer at all. He won a scholarship to St Paul's Choir
School from a humble background, Huguenot by origin. Further education or
training was out of the question. He was forced to accept the option of a
clerkship in the oil business for a meagre salary under conditions worthy of
Mr Gadgrind.
Eighteen years would pass, during which he married a woman older than
himself and raised a family of four children, before he was liberated from
his office stool. During those years his working day as a poet began around
midnight. Yet poems and stories poured out of him. He seemed undaunted by
the regularity with which they were returned by the journals to which he
submitted them. In his meticulous, clerkly way he preserved every rejection
slip.
Eventually he achieved his breakthrough and a minor reputation. On the
strength of a one-off grant from the Civil List of Pounds 200 de la Mare was
able at long last to quit his job. In those days pensions for lowly
employees were unheard of and his livelihood was still precarious.
He became a staff-reader for publisher Walter Heinemann - almost as great a
form of servitude as the oil business. What saved him, ironically, was the
death of Rupert Brooke. De la Mare was one of three poets (Wilfrid Gibson
and Lascelles Abercrombie were the others) to whom Brooke left the royalty
income on his copyrights, a marvellously far-sighted gesture on Brooke's
part that makes one feel quite differently about him.
De la Mare now began to take his rightful place among the lions of
contemporary poetry. His work was favourably reviewed in the prestigious
Saturday edition of the Westminster Gazette. Its literary editor was Naomi
Royde-Smith, a woman of powerful ability and striking presence. De la Mare
met her at one of her parties and instantly fell for her. The revelation of
the biography is the passionate affair between them that ensued. Theresa
Whistler asks us to believe that it was a platonic passion, never
consummated even though the couple once spent three days entirely alone
together. She must forgive us if we remain sceptical.
At any rate, thanks to this book we can re-read de la Mare's love lyrics
knowing who inspired them. The best known ends with the line 'the sweet
cheat gone' and its structure, turning on the idea of non-consummation, is
characteristic of de la Mare's art. His even more famous anthology poem 'The
Listeners' is another instance of non-consummation. The moonlit Traveller
knocks on the door. No one answers even though he feels there is someone
there behind it. He goes away unsatisfied. It is quite clear from this book
that de la Mare had no idea what all this signified nor who 'the traveller'
was meant to be, even though he was asked hundreds of times.
In his short stories the theme is repeated again and again. Here the
traveller tends to go, not on horseback, but by train. Graham Greene, who
much admired de la Mare's tales, drew attention in a perceptive article to
the prevalence in them of the railway station as a point of departure for a
quest into the unknown. De la Mare dealt at length with unconsummated love
in the compass of a long novel, Memoirs of a Midget. In this novel the
diminutive heroine is only two feet high and we see the world entirely
through her eyes - a tour de force of invention comparable to Swift's in
Gulliver. Miss M. comes under the spell of a dazzlingly attractive
full-grown woman who shares many of the traits of Royde-Smith.
De la Mare paved the way here for the novel of magical realism. As Angela
Carter said in her preface to the Oxford Twentieth Century Classics
paperback edition of 1982: 'It may be read with a great deal of simple
enjoyment and then it sticks like a splinter in the mind'. The view that
Miss M. was a metaphor for Me or Mr de la Mare is strengthened by the full
portrait of him presented in this excellent biography.

FT  15 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Best advice from a closet mistress - Jane
Mulvagh puts a wardrobe adviser to the test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY PEOPLE, both men and women, initially baulk at the idea of going to a
dress adviser assuming that, like an interior decorator, they are an
unnecessary extravagance.
The popular myth runs like this: they flounce into your life, toss out half
your wardrobe, impose their own taste, turn you into a fashion victim by
sending you to a designer with whom they are in cahoots and then charge you
for the humiliation.
On the other hand, if you have just experienced a big change in your life -
be it a windfall, a change of job, a new relationship or the birth of a
child - treating yourself to a dress advisory session can be a therapeutic
fillip.
This is where the London Fashion Advisory can help. The most significant
feature of the LFA is its independence. It offers impartial advice and
recommends shops and private dressmakers who do not pay them a kick-back for
doing so. Sessions take place in the privacy of your home, after work if
necessary.
This is not only for your convenience but also to allow the consultant to
see you in situ and assess your wardrobe and the state in which it is kept.
A consultation takes at least three hours, can be exhausting and costs
Pounds 180.
The LFA is run by Kate Ward Jones, a 32-year-old graduate of fashion who has
spent ten years as a private dressmaker. Her strengths are that she is
keenly informed about cut, shape and cloth; she is objective about your
shape and colouring; has amassed an impressive array of research and - most
important - conducts herself with winning tact and kindness.
She is not, however, a creative original; her strengths are that she will
respect your taste, will help you create an idiosyncratic style of your own
or, if that is what you want, just help you dress in a more flattering or
suitable manner.
Doctor Alison Joy, a London GP, agreed to be our guinea pig - although she
said she would normally never dream of employing a dress adviser because she
did not want to change her own style.
Her current wardrobe is jam-packed, as she loathes throwing things out, and
contains a few good classics, brought recently, some 'Oxfam Grunge' bought
as a student and still worn, and a few dearly-loved character pieces. She
has a strong artistic streak and a suspicion of corporate dressing.
Kate first asked what Dr Joy was aiming for. A new look? Not particularly. A
clearout? No, she hates throwing things away. To spend some money? Yes, she
wanted a better wardrobe both for her professional and private lives.
Alison admitted that she has never spent more than Pounds 1,500 a year on
clothes and shoes, but now that she wanted to improve her wardrobe, 'an
independent adviser is very helpful, for friends and husbands get bored with
this sort of overhaul.'
Like so many women, and in spite of a pleasing figure, she is dissatisfied
with her shape. 'I should be small all over but in fact I'm small on top
with wide hips - a classic pear. It's a difficult shape to buy for
off-the-peg.'
Kate worked steadily through the clothes, making piles to keep, piles to
alter, piles to sell and piles to give to Oxfam. Her diplomacy was
impressive but she rightly pointed out that 'I'm going to be ruthless and
say what I think, because you're paying me for this.'
Kate quickly grasped the essentials of Alison's lifestyle. Throughout the
session she emphasised that 'clothes are a serious investment and you must
look after them.'
Maintenance tips are part of the service: metal coat hangers, old dry
cleaning bags and sentimental but unwearable hand-me-downs were all
banished. She gave advice on moths, how to press clothes by hovering a steam
iron a millimetre or so above clothing rather than pressing down on them,
how to disinfect wardrobes and keep them aired. She recommended that jumpers
be washed inside out and suggested spot cleaning rather than repetitive dry
cleaning.
Best of all were her 'make do and mend' tips. A beautifully tailored but
very old-fashioned cream wool overcoat was transformed into a long-line
dandy jacket with amusing buttons, while the garish red braid that had
rendered a loden jacket unwearable was exchanged for a subtle and pretty
floral one. The jacket has become the stalwart of Alison's country wardrobe.
Two favourites - Moschino shorts and a Pollen bustier which are no longer
pristine - were altered and copied.
A few days later Alison was sent a thorough report suggesting what needed to
be bought, altered, copied, thrown out and including a helpful list of
stores with varying price levels: ranging from Fortnum &amp; Mason and bespoke
tailors to inexpensive boutiques in the suburbs. If Alison had wanted to,
she could then have gone shopping with a consultant to advise her.
On the whole the suggestions were sensible rather than wildly original,
concentrating on a professional working woman's look, but overall LFA did an
impressive job.
Alison's verdict? 'On the whole I thought Kate was excellent, although I
felt that she was dressing me up too much as a professional woman and not
enough for my real life or my fantasy life, be it the countryside or playful
evenings. Her knowledge about tailoring a shape is good. She taught me how
to use my figure and not to mind its curves. Kate gave me the guts to use my
good bust and has suggested bodies - they are flattering and inexpensive and
don't have to be ironed] I've already bought one each from Maxmara and
Graham &amp; Greene.'
She also felt that Kate was excellent at pulling various pieces together, at
advising how to add a new belt or an inexpensive accessory to make them look
smarter.
Another satisfied customer said: 'LFA came to my rescue. I have no time to
plan a wardrobe, let alone go shopping on a budget, and they even helped to
produce a new wardrobe out of old clothes and horrendous mistakes.'
Amanda Pelham Burn, director of Corporate Relations International, says:
'LFA performed the arduous task of forcing me to weed out a 15-year-plus
collection of clothes. Once I could see what was left, together we built a
coordinated and organised wardrobe for both work and play.'

FT  15 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Hire education for DIY idiots - From
chainsaws to scaffolding, the local hire shop can provide tools for every
job. But watch out for snags
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO EXPERIENCE the truly unbridgable gap between fantasy and reality, stop
dreaming about that film star and head for your nearest tool hire shop.
These emporia of (mainly) manly interests enable anyone instantly to become
anything from a scaffolder to a chainsaw-wielding lumberjack. But, before
you hire, be prepared for extreme disappointment and even severe personal
injury.
A friend hired a miniature trench digger, which looked wonderful: a sort of
scaled-down cross between a Caterpillar and a JCB. He climbed into the
machine, accelerated a little too viciously and flipped it over. He is still
paying off the loan he required to finance a year-long relationship with a
chiropractor.
My local hire shop is on the school run and, every morning, I see Transit
vans being filled with those bits of equipment that jobbing builders cannot
afford.
I do not know the injury rate among the chaps in these battered Fords, but
the shop does a good trade. And I assume the tools are brought back by
people who have succeeded not only in using them correctly but also have
managed to protect themselves from terrible injury.
At weekends, the customers change. Volvo estates line up, and men who look
as though they have never lifted anything heavier than a Biro load equipment
with which they intend to improve their homes and gardens.
I am one of these men, and I believe everything I read in the brochure.
"Makes old wooden floors look new . . . combines operator comfort and
control with an outstanding performance' . . . 'for easy removal and fitting
of engines' . . . 'designed to break concrete and other hard materials . . .
with minimum operator fatigue,' And so on.
The fantasy that grips weekend hirers is so strong that, even after a number
of expensive and possibly injurious mistakes, we return to try another tool
we hope will bring that unattainable improvement to our lives.
A few weekends ago, I spent an entire Saturday stuffing garden cuttings into
the dangerous and noisy mouth of the chipper/shredder, said to be capable of
turning 3in-diameter branches into instant sawdust.
'Whenever there is a requirement for large-scale garden waste disposal,'
sang the brochure, confidently, 'this powerful chipper/shredder will cope.'
The reality was that it did wonderfully on dry branches but any organic
matter with a moisture content higher than about 30 per cent caused great
problems.
First, the little petrol motor spluttered, smoke rose from the hopper, and
hidden blades chattered like demented monkeys caught in the bowels of the
machine. Then, with a great cough, it would die, forcing me to dismantle
various bits and clear the gunge.
After nearly an hour of noisy failure, I was left with a mere handful of
shreddings. The bill to learn that garden shredders, no matter how powerful,
are not suitable for damp waste came to about Pounds 60 (hire, VAT,
insurance, delivery and petrol).
I should have known better. On previous forays with hired equipment, I have
failed to sand a floor (entirely my fault), failed to polish a floor (also
my fault), and failed to knock down a wall with a bucking bronco device that
I could hardly pick up when switched off, let alone press against the bricks
when alive.
The problem is two-fold. First, it is silly to think that you can do a job
quickly and elegantly without some experience in using the tool you have
hired. But, second, the hirer should be obliged to explain the true
abilities of the tool.
To take my case. most garden waste in the middle of winter is pretty damp,
and it is no good flogging a shredder without warning the ignoramus waving
his credit card that the machine does not like wet leaves.
This need is becoming even greater as hire shops start to look for more
business from weekend idiots. HSS Hire Shops now stock patio heaters - a
sort of umbrella affair with an element that radiates heat so that we 'can
enjoy outdoor entertainment in comfortable warmth.' They also have candy
floss-makers and gas cylinders to blow up 200 balloons.
HSS has acknowledged that, if it intends to pursue the leisure side of the
market, it has to be understanding about people's failures. The new HSS
brochure offers a money-back guarantee if the hired contraption does not
work as described.
I've got my money back and now have my eyes on the Mini Crawler Excavator
and Dozer.
Its 'tear-out force' is a mammoth 1.2 tons and it costs only Pounds 110 a
day (plus VAT, transport and insurance). All I need now is to find something
tough to work on.

FT  15 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Green shoots in Africa - Lucia van der Post
invites readers to join her on a special trip to Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I THOUGHT I had hung up my (professional) safari hat. With small groups of
FT readers I have canoed down the Zambezi, camped in the innermost reaches
of the Kalahari, walked through swamps in Botswana, looked for Bushman
paintings in the Tsodilo hills, skirted hippos in the Okavango Delta,
watched the eagles fly and the lion hunt . . . happy, happy days in the
company of lots of smashing readers.
That Africa could still have further delights to offer seemed unimaginable.
But that was before I met Iain and Oria Douglas-Hamilton.
Anybody who knows anything about Africa knows that there is scarcely another
soul who knows as much about elephants, who has spent as many hours right in
among them, as Iain and Oria. Ever since Iain went out to Africa as a young
Oxford zoology graduate to complete his Ph. D thesis on elephant behaviour,
and met Oria at a party in Nairobi, elephants have been their lives. They
have studied them on the shores of Lake Manyara, charted their falling
numbers up and down the width and length of Africa, fought for them, lobbied
for them and written about them. 'Nobody,' said Desmond Morris recently,
'has done more for elephants than the Douglas-Hamiltons.'
So a chance to go in among the elephants with Iain and Oria as our guides
seemed special enough to make me look to my safari hat. This will be the
first time the Douglas-Hamiltons have taken a group on this kind of safari.
There are places for just 16 people in all. The Douglas-Hamiltons will
accompany the group from beginning to end. They will take you among the
groups of elephants they have got to know so well in Lake Manyara, in Tsavo
East National Park and along the Tarangire River where in September (the
time of our safari) huge herds gather to drink among the baobab trees.
You will stay in private camps, most of them set up specially for the group
in areas where the game viewing is best or where the herds are known to be
gathering. There will be picnic lunches in the bush, evening meals on the
banks of rivers, nights spent with nothing but slivers of canvas between you
and the African darkness.
Iain and Oria, however, will not be the only experts. After seven days the
group flies (with the Douglas-Hamiltons as well) to the ottoman-style camp
of Roland Purcell in the Mahale Mountains on the eastern shores of Lake
Tanganyika. Here among the palm-nut vultures, the fish eagles, the goliath
herons you will stay for three nights, with Roland on hand to illuminate the
experience. Roland is to chimps what the Douglas-Hamiltons are to elephants.
He has studied them, knows their families, has given them names and is a
world-renowned expert on primate behaviour. There, in the tropical
rainforest, is the largest known group of chimpanzees in the world, some 100
strong, which Roland will take you to.
From the Mahale Mountains another private charter flight takes you to your
own camp in a private part of the Masai Mara Reserve to search for the
wildebeest migration, one of the great sights of Africa.
The trip ends with three days in the Douglas-Hamiltons' own home on the
shores of Lake Naivasha with more local treats such as lunch among the
flamingoes of Lake Nakuru and a flight round Mount Kenya (designed to make
sure you come back to climb it).
The safari starts at Heathrow on Friday, September 3 and finishes back at
Heathrow on Monday, September 20. It has been orchestrated by African
Explorations of Holwell Manor Barn, Holwell, Burford, Oxon OX18 4JS.
At Pounds 5,499 per person it is not cheap - (time perhaps to say sod the
recession?) - but I believe that what you will be getting is unbeatable:
world authorities on elephants and chimpanzees, private camps in secluded
parts of the bush and private charter flights from one area to another.
Anybody wanting more information and a detailed itinerary should write to me
at The Financial Times, No 1 Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL, marking the
envelope 'Safari'. To book a guaranteed place a deposit of Pounds 1,000 will
be required (non-returnable except in cases covered by holiday insurance).
It should be made payable to Africa Explorations but sent to me.
As I have learnt from past experience that readers in far-flung parts feel
rather disadvantaged by distance and postal services, I will allow a full
fortnight for letters to arrive and itineraries to be sent out. After that
it will be first come, first served.
'Even today, to visit Africa is a feast for the senses,' says Bartle Bull in
his splendid tome on the history of the safari. I believe he is right. We
cannot know what Africa must have looked like to those first explorers a
century and a half ago but I do know that conservation policies are
beginning to show some results. Iain Douglas-Hamilton tells me the elephant
herds in Kenya are healthier and more numerous than they were ten years ago.
Everywhere a sense of the treasures that we so nearly lost - and might yet
lose - has brought a heightened sense of care and awareness. At present we
are lucky. The Africa we yearn for is still there to be discovered.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Fashion: Ethnic jewellery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEWELLERY is being worn ethnic this summer, writes Lucia van der Post. Put
away (for another time, another fashion) your discreet diamond studs, your
pearls, your genteel little brooches - and search out the biggest, boldest,
chunkiest pieces you own. According to Veronica Manussis, of Cobra &amp;
Bellamy, this season's jewellery is 'savage and brutalistic.' Which is why
she and her partner, Tania Hunter, have put together one of the biggest,
most exciting collections of amber jewellery to be seen in many a year.
Amber is the fossilised resin found in fossilised trees. As those who love
it will know it comes in many colours, from clear, pale yellow to richest
blood red. The changing colours are caused by minerals from the soils, by
the earth's movements and by the degrees of pressure to which the amber is
subject.
Cobra &amp; Bellamy's collection is all from Russia, mainly from fossilised
forests around the Baltic Sea. There are huge, chunky necklaces and
bracelets of raw amber, some of which are photographed above. Prices for a
necklace of some presence range between Pounds 200 and Pounds 400, though
the most spectacular is Pounds 3,000. Then there are more refined and
sophisticated pieces which they buy cut, often as cabochons, and which
Veronica incorporates into her designs, setting them in sterling silver.
Prices for these brooches, ear-rings and rings start as low as Pounds 9 for
a pair of very simple ear-rings. A ring with a great deal of panache could
be had for Pounds 103, a brooch for Pounds 63.
The collection is on sale now at Cobra &amp; Bellamy, 149 Sloane Street, London
SW1 and the Cobra &amp; Bellamy shop in Liberty of Regent Street, London W1.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Fashion: It's true: you are what you wear - Lucia van der
Post reflects on dressing for work - and invites FT readers to a fashion
workshop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DRESSING FOR work, we learned from the series of articles we have just
finished in the Weekend FT, is a serious business. Whether it was an
architect purveying a minimalist message, a surgeon trying to look safe with
a scalpel, a government minister dressing to care, or an advertising
executive trying to look creative AND responsible, everybody agreed that,
whether we like it or not, how we dress conveys a powerful message.
Getting it right is not always easy, particularly for those who, perfectly
properly, feel that their mind is better applied to the job in hand than to
the clothes in their wardrobe.
Quite right. Let physicians stick to their stethoscopes, architects to their
drawing-boards, lawyers to their briefs, and politicians to their boxes. But
there may come a time when you might like a professional to sort out your
wardrobe - just as you would call in an architect to build a new house, or
an artist to paint a portrait.
This kind of help is in its infancy in the UK. In the US, stores have long
acknowledged that the way to prosperity is to keep the customers happy, and
the way to keep customers happy is to make them feel good in the clothes
they buy. The store that stops you buying purple flares or an over-busy
jacket is the store you go back to. The assistant who takes time and trouble
to help you put a look together is the one you learn to trust.
A few of the smaller, more upmarket British boutiques have led the way.
Susie Faux at Wardrobe, 3 Grosvenor Street, London W1 and 17 Chiltern
Street, London W1 has long had a well-deserved reputation for helping the
professional woman look both efficient and glamorous - NOT as easy as you
might think.
She and her staff advise on hair, make-up and accessories as well as the
clothes. 'These days,' says Susie, 'my customers cannot afford to have two
wardrobes so increasingly they want clothes that work in their professional
and private lives. Though we are commonly perceived to be an expensive shop
and you cannot dress well on nothing, the average income of our customers is
between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 18,000 a year - but they believe that good
clothes are an investment.' Her favourite labels are Jil Sander, Erreuno,
Mani and Strenesse.
I have had great success at Whistles stores, where if you are prepared to
spend time and look as if your mind is made up about getting a new look you
can persuade an assistant to give you some serious attention.
Some of the larger stores, such as Harvey Nichols and Harrods, have
full-time wardrobe advisers who will search out garments for you at no extra
charge. A colleague and I asked Gabriella Di Nora of Harvey Nichols to help
find something special for a chic wedding. Gabriella was sympathetic and
unpushy and she tried very hard. We both thought she was extraordinarily
nice but we had initially hoped for a little more flair.
The lesson is that no matter how clever a wardrobe adviser is, it takes time
to build up a relationship. Gabriella had never seen my colleague and it was
asking the impossible for her to come up with some stunning number for a
total stranger.
My colleague went back a few days later and Gabriella produced a much more
interesting collection, from which she eventually bought two suits: a
navy-blue one by Yves St. Laurent (in the sales reduced from Pounds 750 to
Pounds 300) and another by the German designer Lange with which she is
extremely pleased. She will be using Gabriella again and Gabriella has even
promised to look out for bargains that might suit her when sale time comes
round.
Andrea Galer is strictly speaking a dress-designer cum dressmaker, but she
seems to become a wardrobe adviser to her clients. She started as a costume
designer and when asked to provide a series of snappy clothes for the
yuppies in ITV's Capital City (remember the elegant Johanna Kanska?) she
realised how difficult it was to find stylish clothes at a reasonable price.
She then went into the designing and manufacturing business and now provides
a beautiful bespoke service for a raft of (mainly) professional men and
women.
Soft wool and silk or silk and linen jackets, linen dresses, hand-printed
silk blouses - the clothes are lovely but not cheap. A bespoke jacket would
cost about Pounds 550, an off-the-peg version (she always has a collection
so that customers can see her range and style) about Pounds 400. Her
customers, such as Jane Hill, a writer and art consultant, stockbroker Ruth
Sack and barrister Gillian Marks, love the personal attention, the fact that
the clothes really fit and that every one is different. Her shop is at 4
England's Lane, London NW3. Tel: 071-483-3242.
If you want wide-ranging advice - from how to get your hair cut, what shoes
to buy and which of the many designers and shops is the one for you - then
Amanda Platt (who regular readers may remember 'did over' our buccaneering
travel writer Nicholas Woodsworth) will give you her personal undivided
attention for Pounds 225 a day. And if you think that is expensive, I would
point out that that sum will ensure everything you buy will really work for
you and will probably end up costing less than you would have spent on your
own. Contact her at 28 Holland Park Avenue, London W11 3QU. Tel:
071-229-8109.
Finally, if you are still confused (and if you are, you are not alone) and
longing for help Browns, of 23-27, South Molton Street, London W1, is
holding a fashion workshop on the evening of Tuesday June 8 for the first 50
Financial Times readers to apply for tickets. Joan Burstein, the inspiration
behind Browns and a legendary chic figure in the retail world, feels that
fashion at the moment is in a state of flux and that most of her customers
are more in need of advice and help than ever before.
'Unless we are under 20, in which case there is no problem, it is difficult
to find a look that is comfortable, suitable and fashionable,' she says. 'I,
for instance, am wearing trousers now which I have not worn for years. The
long skirt is still a debatable issue as far as I am concerned - it isn't so
much the length that matters as the proportion. I find a long skirt also
looks better if it is of flowing material and not stiff, and the right shoe
(with a heel) is essential.
'Above all, women should feel comfortable in their clothes. Clothes should
never be tight, and women should never get talked into buying something that
they are not going to enjoy wearing. I wish customers would ask for help
more. All my staff love to help and are trained never to push customers into
unsuitable clothes - we want them to come back, which they will only do if
they are happy - but on the whole the British are shy to ask. Many of our
customers start with us by coming during the sales, and I wish more people
knew about our Labels for Less shop across the way at number 45, where there
are always bargains on offer.'
Those who are accustomed to thinking of Browns as expensive (and undoubtedly
some of the labels are) should know that there are also plenty of less
expensive things that could do wonders for any wardrobe - Jil Sander
T-shirts in masses of colours at Pounds 15 a time, fine, silky long-sleeved
cotton tops in mouth-watering shades at Pounds 25, a crisp, classic white
shirt for Pounds 25 and so on.
She thinks the key pieces this season are a blouse with a jabot, a long
sleeveless gilet and soft, widish crepe trousers (but study the proportions
carefully). 'I don't say no to jackets - most working women need them - I
just say NO to power jackets. It is fabrics that matter - they should be
softer, more flowing, more sensuous.'
The Browns/FT fashion workshop will run from 6.30pm to 8.30pm on Tuesday
June 8. Tickets are Pounds 20 (the money will go to the Leukaemia Research
Fund) and will also entitle the reader to a 15 per cent discount on all
purchases until the end of June. Champagne and snacks will be served, a
Molton Browns goodie bag will be given to every reader and for the winner of
a lucky draw there will be a Pounds 250 gift voucher. Tickets will go to the
first 50 readers to send their name, address and Pounds 20 cheque (made out
to the Leukaemia Research Fund) to me here at the Financial Times, No. 1
Southwark Bridge, London SE1 (mark the envelope Browns/FT Fashion Workshop).

FT  15 MAY 93 / Eton's oarsmen land in a hole: The latest development in a
dispute splitting the community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL STOURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETON, Britain's most famous school, wants planning consent to quarry 3.5m
tons of gravel and fill the resulting hole with water. The college
calculates this would take eight years; the result would be something -
described variously as a rowing lake, course or trench two kilometres long,
half a kilometre wide and covering more than 11 acres.
All this would take place on agricultural land at Dorney; although owned by
the college, it is inside London's green belt, within which development is
supposed to take place only under the strictest controls, if at all.
The planning application was turned down but an appeal opened on Wednesday
this week. It is being heard by an inspector from the department of the
environment.
Should it succeed, the effect on the lives of local residents would be
serious. For eight years, they would have to endure noise, dust and fumes
from the extra traffic. Internal roads would have to be built. In certain
instances, paths, bridleways and tracks, used for years by residents and
visitors for recreational purposes, would be removed.
Eton was aggrieved by the refusal of planning consent. For one thing, it had
been at pains to make clear that the new lake would be shared with other,
less-privileged schools. For another, it believed Eton boys would be more
relaxed and safer rowing up and down this artificial course instead of
sharing the river Thames with its busy boating world.
What came as the biggest shock, however, was the whisper that Etonians
themselves were having second thoughts about the project. Would things be
the same, they asked, without the glamour of the river and the traditions
built on it? Would the famous Eton Boating Song sound anywhere near the same
as schoolboy rowers toiled up and down a monotonous off-Thames course?
Even more to the point, the doubters pointed to the school's great liberal
traditions, of which pressurisation was never a part. This argument gained
ground increasingly as more and more glossy pamphlets favouring the project
were produced, along with letters from the headmaster to parents and entries
of encouragement in the Old Etonian Association journal. There were designer
mock-ups and artists' impressions - even the promise of a nature reserve
(referred-to, trendily, as a Nature Conservation Area).
Further appeals were made. The college's bursar wrote a letter that started:
'Dear Friends of Rowing.' There was a circular letter from the chairman of
the Henley royal regatta addressed to 'Member of the regatta enclosure.' And
there was a rallying call to past and present members of the Eton Viking
rowing club. Recently, though, I asked a senior boy at Eton what he made of
the proposal. 'A waste of money,' he replied, with commendable brevity.
With the planning refusal on the table, Eton had two choices: either to
accept it with regret and dignity - or to appeal. In the latter case,
though, more issues were at stake than a mere 'yes' or 'no.' In particular,
there was the delicate issue of Eton College coming into direct and public
confrontation with a significant number of 'ordinary' people opposed to the
project.
Locals put it more bluntly. Which, they asked, came first: a sport at Eton
which had already achieved great success using existing facilities on the
Thames, or the quality of life for residents in the way of a powerful and
prestigious institution?
This, then, was the situation the college's provost and fellows faced after
the planning refusal. The fellows are an august body of men with wide fields
of interest and accomplishment. Among them is old Etonian Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary.
The decision was made to fight and mount a carefully-prepared
counter-attack. Specialists were retained and, on Wednesday, battle was
joined. The result is expected to be known in about five weeks.
Meanwhile, Eton will be en fete as usual on the fourth of June. Where? On
the River Thames, of course.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Anyone for golf, chaps?: Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS ALWAYS been a source of wonder, and some irritation, to me that so
many otherwise sensible and civilised people should be obsessed with golf. I
cannot make up my mind which aspect of the game is most off-putting: the
self-importance of the committee types who run it: the pettifogging rules
they impose; the manicured artificiality of courses; or the inherent
dullness of hitting a stationary ball and walking after it to hit it again.
I dallied with golf a while ago, mastered its basics (mastered might not be
quite the mot juste), then put it aside. I felt that golf and fishing were
spiritually antipathetic and that I had to make a statement about where I
stood.
In the light of the start of the new trout fishing season, however, I am
reviewing my options, reassessing my priorities and considering the
possibility of rowing back. Like President Clinton's first 100 days, my
first week did not fulfill expectations.
The advantage of golf, I now realise, is that you are either playing it or
you are not playing it. This might sound ridiculous; but what I mean is
that, when playing golf, you place the ball on the tee and you hit it. It
might land in a duckpond or a bramble thicket, but there is no doubt that
you are playing golf.
What, though, of the fisherman who has on his waders and coat, his bag and
net slung over his back, his rod in his hand - but is not casting his fly?
Is he really fishing when all he is doing is stalking up and down the banks,
staring at the water, and cursing the absence of visible fish life? I think
not.
My first outing was on the last Tuesday in April. On the whole, I do not
believe in April trout fishing: May 1 is the time for the off. But I had
played cricket that Sunday (caught at mid-on for six, if you must know), and
it had been balmy enough to persuade me that the season was advanced enough
for trout to be on the look-out for the first titbits of the year.
This opinion was not shared by the trout. Titbits there were in the shape of
hairy, black hawthorns dropping occasionally from air to water. But the fish
kept their noses down. I prowled around for a couple of hours, noted the
marvellously beneficial effect on the river of a winter's decent rainfall,
and scarcely bothered to cast. Give it a week, I thought.
I gave it a week. Sunday's cricket had been decidedly chilly (given out
leg-before for two by an umpire who was corrupt, or senile, or both), and
the chill persisted. I made a bad start by looking at the book in the
fishing hut in which members are obliged to record their catches.
The theory behind looking at the book is sound. If others are catching fish,
the confidence that you will do the same should rise. On the other hand, if
they are not catching anything, you are reassured that you can do no worse.
So much for the theory. I found that they had been catching fish, and big
ones - three over 4lb and one six-pounder. They had all, I noted
resentfully, been taken the previous Friday and Saturday when it had been
warm and sunny, with a soft breeze from the south. Now, though, it was dry
and the wind from the north-east was cold and discouraging.
I reminded myself that those who write about fishing must fish to have
anything to write about, then set off. My morning was entirely barren, as I
could not find a feeding fish anywhere. I met another member, who agreed
that there was no sort of a rise before confessing, with an intolerable
smile, that he had managed a brace, one just above 4lb and the other just
below.
I asked him what fly he was using. He showed me something that looked like
the business end of a garden broom. 'Doesn't look like anything on the
water,' he smirked, 'but they seem to like it.'
A little while later, I found a rising fish. It looked like a tiddler, so I
was more than usually ill-prepared when it took, tore across the stream
(ripping line off the reel) and rushed through a weed bed. By the time it
came out the other side, the connection between fish and fly was no more.
Muttering grimly, I stomped off to a distant part of the river where I was
sure they would be feeding. I took a short cut - which involved climbing
over a barbed wire fence, on which I tore my waders - and found they were
not feeding. I continued on my way, at almost every step disturbing wild
fowl which flapped, quacking, into the air before belly-flopping on all
likely fish-holding spots upstream. At last, I returned to the hut, wrote
'Fort - nil' in the damned book and left.
Since then, I have acquired some old golf clubs. I am eyeing them now,
recalling the sweet satisfaction of following the progress of a
cleanly-driven ball, the smell of a mown fairway, the laughs, the
comradeship. Perhaps . . .

FT  15 MAY 93 / The polecat's return: Country Note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS GAMEKEEPERS continue to become endangered species in many areas of the
UK, the victims of their constant vigilance during the past century and a
half are beginning to return to the countryside.
Some have not been seen in living memory over large parts of the country and
were long ago crossed off the list of native fauna by most people. One of
these is the polecat, which has been waiting in the wings, mostly holed up
in the wilder parts of Wales, until conditions were right to move back on to
the English stage. The end of gin traps and the protection given to it by
the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act are part of the reason for its current
expansion.
So, too, is the growing rabbit population, which is surviving better in our
warmer winters and reaching higher levels in between bouts of myxamatosis.
Polecats are voracious rabbit-eaters: more than a third of their diet
consists of rabbits and almost three-quarters is mammalian in content,
largely mice and voles.
Polecats hunt mainly at night and are quite happy to pursue prey
underground, being able to slip into quite small spaces. They chase their
quarry with a series of large leaps and jump on to it, dispatching it with a
bite to the back of the neck.
They are known to feed on amphibians and can cope with the poison glands of
toads which deter many other species. Like moles with worms, they will cache
numbers of frogs and toads, which are bitten at the base of the skull to
paralyse rather than kill them and so keep them fresh until required.
They live solitary lives. Each has a number of dens, spending about 24 hours
at each before moving on to the next. In winter they tend to den in farm
outbuildings or near dwellings on the edge of settlements where prey will be
more numerous, and where they are more likely to be seen. But few people
would recognise the dark, lithe, ferret-sized animal with a masked face as a
native and, as it has now crossed the River Severn and is moving steadily
eastwards, it is likely to feature increasingly in press reports of strange
animals crossing roads at night or turning up in suburban gardens.
Dr Johnny Birks, of English Nature, who has recently started a two-year
project studying the return of what he sees as a long-lost friend, is
concerned that, like the mink, the polecat will be regarded as an invading
alien and will receive a similar exaggerated and hostile press. He is
currently collecting road casualty polecats in the border counties in an
attempt to assess the status and speed of its spread. His task is made more
complicated by the fact that polecat ferrets have a very close resemblance
to wild polecats; only careful measurements of the skull will distinguish
the two. It also has one other snag - the polecat's smell. Not for nothing
is it also called the foul marten . . .

FT  15 MAY 93 / Gardening: In the beginning were the words - Robin Lane Fox
waxes ecstatic over bluebells and the new Plant Finder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING gardening is just on the turn: the first rosebuds are visible; by
next week, wallflowers will be dropping their petals and hyacinths starting
to turn yellow and die down. Meanwhile, nobody can complain about the recent
clear spells in May. Lilac and fruit blossom have been wonderful and, to cap
it all, we now have the best season for bluebells in the past five years.
Do try to visit a wood during the next few days while they are at their
peak. They have revelled in the wet weather since last July and have proved
the gloomy forecasts wrong. Bluebell woods in Britain will be among the
first casualties if the globe ever starts to warm seriously. To judge from
their mood at the moment, the forecasts of warming have a very long way to
go.
We all love bluebells but, officially, we cannot decide what to call them.
The uncertainties surface in this week's most welcome arrival: it is not an
iris, a swallow or a peony but the most indispensable book of all for
gardeners. The year's The Plant Finder is out, just in time to catch the
cuckoo and to set us all on a mad path of hunting, visiting and ordering by
'phone.
The new edition is essential because it is bigger and has so many changes of
address and identity. At Pounds 10.99, it is still superb value. If your
bookshop cannot find it, you should apply to Moorland Publishing, Moor Farm
Rd, Airfield Estate, Ashbourne, Derbyshire.
Chris Philip and Tony Lord have continued to widen their brainchild's scope
and value. It now lists more than 60,000 varieties of plant on sale in the
British nursery trade, together with code names for their sources, maps, and
a check-list of their whereabouts. Each year, it cuts ever more deeply into
my fictional bedtime reading. Not only is it a self-published best-seller -
it is the essential companion for any keen gardener.
At this point, I should perhaps reassure the female reader who wrote to me
last year asking if it was my column which had mentioned a
privately-published Man Finder. There are fewer than 60,000 varieties, not
many of whom can cook or sew; and as most of them carry a health warning,
this volume has yet to finalise its distribution maps.
Meanwhile, in its absence, the new Plant Finder is a chance for a check-list
of personal favourites. How are the national stocks of the yellow-flowered
Onosma tauricum? Where can we still buy a long-flowering dianthus called
Jane Austen? And who lists the rare, ice-blue Hepatica with the biggest and
clearest flowers, Hepatica media Ballardii, which was for long presumed
missing in commerce? My first week of bed-time cross-referencing has sent me
to sleep with a smile.
All these favourites are alive in British circulation. Better still, the
number of stockists continues to increase. I suspect that plant-finding is
the sort of enterprise where growth is broadening the market. As we arm
ourselves with this book and start to hunt more widely, more nurseries begin
to trace and multiply the rarer lines of stock.
Twenty years ago, everyone was predicting the opposite. Big nurseries were
slimming down and packing up; we all began to lament that gardens were
'vanishing' because we simply did not know what a range of varieties was
still on offer in widely-scattered nurseries without a central database. The
Plant Finder has destroyed this myth. The balance might have shifted between
particular families, but I doubt if there were more than 60,000 varieties
from which our grandfathers could choose when making a pre-war garden.
We also have an embarrassment of nurseries - now up to 600 in the maps  -
and plant-finding acronyms, from CAbb to WWye. Random visits are the
pleasure of a plant-finding summer, to places which sell Parma violets among
the peat and goldfish to family nurseries round small-holdings in one of
which, last summer, I found bindweed growing up through the floorboards and
encircling neatly the pan of the visitors' indoor WC.
All manner of eccentricity lurks behind the acronyms, from plants in prams
to gasbags who talk the doors off their plastic tunnels. Plant-finding not
only changes the possible scope of our borders, it also widens our idea of
humanity.
For scent in spring, try the low-spreading meehania, listed here from four
suppliers (although I bought mine recently from a fifth); for a long season,
try the old white Agapanthus Ardernei, now listed by five nurseries where,
formerly, there was but one. The lovely white Helleborus olympicus is now
available from three suppliers, although the Finder adjusts its name
slightly; six sources list the low-growing Jeffersonia with sky-blue flowers
for a shady place.
Last week, I wrote about the brilliant blue Echium webbii at Tresco and I
now find that, in spite of the garden's doubts, two nurseries do list it,
although cuttings are hollow-stemmed and not easy to root. As yet, the
fabulous Paeony Joseph Rock has yet to re-appear in the lists and I am glad
that, three years ago, I bagged a bit of a sky-blue spring Phlox called
Geddington Cross: its one supplier has closed down. Otherwise, almost
anything is there if you want it, and who knows what you might find if you
gamble on the unknown?
The one problem for amateurs is the naming. Rightly, the editors follow
scrupulous standards and set the pace by keeping up with the latest
botanical names. Montbretias, therefore, turn up all over the place and you
cannot rely on a chrysanthemum any more. Here, the bluebells come back into
view: while you admire a wood of them this weekend, what exactly should you
call them in order to be politically correct?
Not long ago, you might have opted for a scilla, as a bluebell sounds
patronising and emotive. Then, it became an endymion, like the gorgeous
Greek boy who was loved in myth by the visiting moon.
Not so nowadays: a bluebell has become a Hyacinthoides, non-scripta being
the blue British form. Was endymion thought to be sexist? I cannot keep up
with botanists, and soon we gardeners will need a Name Finder as well.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Distilled essence of Irish - The country's
slimmed-down whiskey industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Alfred Barnard visited Ireland to research his book The Whisky
Distilleries of the United Kingdom, published in 1887, he was able to survey
28 licensed distilleries: six in Dublin, three in Cork and ten in Ulster.
His job would be considerably easier today - there are just three: Midleton
in County Cork, Bushmills in Antrim, both owned by the Irish Distillers
Group (a subsidiary of Pernod-Ricard), and Lockes in Kilbeggan, County
Westmeath.
Lockes is a brave independent venture centred on a mothballed distillery.
They only started distilling again a few years ago and I have yet to see any
whiskey released under its label.
It has been a sad decline and fall for the country which invented whiskey
and which remained the favourite until well into our own century. The
virtual eclipse of licensed Irish distilling in our own time was intimately
linked to the Irish revolution and the turmoil which accompanied the early
history of the independent state.
By the 1960s the handful of remaining distilleries had become so embattled
that it was decided to roll the whole business into one and create the Irish
Distillers Group. The next move was to close the stills in Dublin,
Tullamore, Cork and Coleraine and transfer their functions to a modern
distillery in Midleton.
All malt whiskey was to be made at Bushmills on the Antrim coast, Ireland's
oldest distillery.
Bushmills made its successful blends such as Black Bush by adding Midleton
grain whiskey to its own malt spirit. Later they released their highly
successful ten-year-old malt. As for the old brands which had previously
provided Irishmen with solace at home and abroad, they were now all made at
Midleton by deftly juggling a gigantic battery of pot and column stills,
which allowed them to imitate the styles which had previously been the
responsibility of different sites, recipes and wells.
The Irish Distillers found this easier than one might imagine because the
country's distilleries had been for the most part urban institutions
producing styles of pot-still whiskey. In this they varied considerably from
the great Scottish distilleries, where the character of the whisky depended
on a number of almost accidental factors, such as trace elements in the
water and the shape of the stills.
Nor had traditional 'Dublin Pot Still' ever been a malt whiskey. Malt formed
part of a cocktail of grains which included rye and oats. This was blended
before the mash was made and distilled for whiskey. The grains were dried in
sealed chambers so that Irish whiskey was never impregnated with that
kippery peat smell so distinctive in Scotch.
Irish whiskey was never blended either. Even before 1966 the styles were
created in the stills, not by the Scotch method of putting together the
produce of different distilleries and then smoothing over the rough edges
with a bigger measure of bland grain spirit. The smoothness (some might call
it blandness) of Irish whiskey came from distilling the spirit not twice, as
in all but lowland Scotland, but three times.
This is how whiskey is made today at Midleton, but there is more
column-still whiskey made these days than there was in Barnard's time.
Barnard had travelled from distillery to distillery noting the continued use
of pot stills in most of Ireland's distilleries, in spite of the fact that
Aeneas Coffey, the inventer of the super-efficient continuous still, had
been an Irish excise man.
Today Midleton makes six 'building-block' whiskies: two pure pot still
spirits, one of which is 100 per cent malt; two pot and column still blends,
one with a majority of pot, the other mostly column still and two grain
whiskies. It is these whiskies which are poured in their various
permutations into old Bourbon, sherry and rum casks to become Jameson's
Paddy's, Power's, Tullamore Dew and a host of less well known names
restricted to the home trade.
Midleton does not quite have the charm of a Scottish distillery perched
above a fast running stream in the mountains of the Highlands or set in the
jagged coastline of a Hebridean island; nor does Irish whiskey have the
nuances of flavour associated with a great malt, but it is a good drink for
all that, and a worthy alternative to blended Scotch.
Personally I have always opted for Paddy among the brands on the advice of a
medieval historian who told me that he always knew when he had had enough
from the map of Ireland on the label: when the level got down to his native
Leinster he put down his glass and went to bed.
Information: for anyone travelling in Ireland both the Irish Whiskey Corner
in Dublin (tel: 07 72 55 66) and the old distillery at Midleton near Cork
021 61 35 94) operate tours and tastings.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Cookery: Turkish delights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE intriguing aspect of eating out in Turkey is the way each catering
kitchen sticks to a narrow range of dishes. There is no need to eat a whole
meal at one sitting. You enjoy one course in which the restaurant
specialises and then move on. Mezze are served on saucers along with drinks.
Take a digestive stroll and, a little later, order kebabs in another
establishment. Then take coffee and dessert in a third.
Tables do not have to be booked - in fact some places do not have tables.
Rarely are you hurried on your way. You can read the newspapers, play
backgammon, talk or just watch the world go by.
Just as mealtimes can be contracted or spun out according to whim so can the
form a meal takes be varied. Visit a kebab kitchen first, and subsequently
settle down elsewhere to a serious mezze session. Or skip the savoury stuff
and devote your appetite to a coffee and pastry emporium.
This may seem a Mad Hatter's tea party approach compared with the prescribed
orderliness of the British one-place-and three-courses set menu routine. But
I think it is terrific; I cannot help reflecting how much more I might enjoy
going to many restaurants in the UK if the same principles were practiced
here.
Restaurant is too grand a description for many of the best Turkish street
kitchens. Often they are no more than a portable barrow equipped with a
couple of storage pots, a cleaver, chopping board, and a brazier: no tables
for the diners, and no cutlery. Time and time again I was led by my nose to
such places. I marvelled at the speed with which chunks of lamb, bay leaves
and wedges of onion were threaded on to skewers; and I delighted in the way
the ingredients were basted by brushing them with bunches of wild thyme and
oregano dipped in olive oil.
The skewers were laid on the bars of the charcoal brazier and the embers
revived with a fan. The fan, nothing more elaborate than a few branches of
herb, was waved so the fringes of the herbs would singe. Their perfumed
smoke mingled with the meaty aroma and rose in blue-grey curls. The smell
was mouthwatering - and sometimes my eyes watered too.
Given fine weather and flavoursome British lamb anyone with a barbecue can
surely - weather permitting - lunch on food as simple and good as this.
Wedges of lemon to squeeze over the semi-charred meat, good bread to sop up
the juices and a leafy salad are the natural accompaniments. A suitably
Turkish follow-up would be baklava.
BAKLAVA (makes nine squares) For the pastries: 6 sheets filo pastry; 1 1/2
oz butter; a mixture of chopped pistachios and flaked almonds totalling 3
oz. For the syrup: 4 oz sugar; 2 tablespoons each runny honey and water; 2
teaspoons lemon juice; 1 teaspoon rose or orange blossom water.
Working with filo pastry is more like dressmaking than baking. You need
scissors, not a rolling pin, to shape it, but even a poor seamstress like me
can produce professional results. Filo does, however, need protection
against drying out. Unwrap each sheet as you need it, and cover the
trimmings as soon as cut with greaseproof paper and a damp teatowel to stop
them becoming brittle.
Melt the butter and brush some over the inside of a shallow baking tin 6 1/2
 7 inches square. Take a sheet of pastry and cut a piece large enough to
line the tin and overhang the sides a little all round. Brush it with melted
butter and lay it buttered side up in the tin. Cover with a second layer of
pastry, cut and buttered in the same way.
Use the trimmings plus extra sheets as necessary to line the base of the tin
only (no more overhang is necessary) with another three layers of buttered
pastry.
Sprinkle on half the nuts, add two more layers of buttered pastry, and
sprinkle on the rest of the nuts. Cover with five more layers of buttered
pastry, folding the overhang from the the bottom two sheets of pastry into
the tin just before adding the final layer.
Brush the top of the pie with more butter. Cut into squares with a sharp
knife and sprinkle with a little cold water to stop curling. Bake until
golden and crisp allowing about 30 minutes at 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4, and
a further 10 minutes in the residue heat after the oven has been turned off.
Make the syrup while the pie bakes. Melt the sugar and honey with the water
and lemon juice. Bring to the boil and simmer for two minutes. Stir the
flower water into the warm syrup just before pouring it over the cooked
baklava, which will absorb it as it cools.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A year to drink up - Wine / The 1991 clarets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE 1991 Bordeaux vintage was devastated by a late April frost and diluted
by rain in the middle of the picking. The 2.15m hl red wine harvest was
little more than 40 per cent of the previous year's record one, and the crop
was particularly short in St Emilion and Pomerol where the Merlot was
severely hit. In spite of spraying and mass picking Petrus is not marketing
a 1991, and throughout the leading communes some chateaux are not selling
their wines under their grand vin chateau label.
Nevertheless, thanks to modern equipment and technique, 1991 cannot be
written off. Indeed, in two or three years it may be very welcome, subject
to certain conditions: only the first generation grapes and not the
post-frost buddings should be used, summer pruning to cut the yield, a quick
end to the picking after the September rains, a rigorous pre-vat selection
of the incoming grapes, and a very careful blending of the vats for the
grand vin.
After all this the wines can only be sold at loss, for taking inflation into
account they will be priced at less than the initially denigrated but now
often much enjoyed 1987s.
These superior appellation '91 clarets are due for early bottling this month
or next, and the Union des Grands Crus has recently shown its members' wines
in London. The 120-strong association represents most of the classed growths
and some lesser chateaux, but not the firsts and only a few of the seconds.
About three quarters of the members presented their '91s in London, but very
few of the Sauternes and Barsacs that suffered very heavily from the frost.
The dry whites had survived in very small quantities, but as they had picked
before the rains they showed fairly light but attractive: particularly
Domaine de Chevalier, Fieuzal and Rahoul.
Overall the clarets had good colour and often a fair aroma, but generally
they lacked backbone, and until one reached the classed growths - and not
all of these - the wines were often short-flavoured in the mouth.
Of those I tasted, those in their districts that had fair fruit and appeared
promising included: Graves - Dom de Chevalier, Fieuzal; Medoc  - La
Tour-de-By, Loudenne; Haut-Medoc - Beaumont, Chasse-Spleen, Clarke,
Couffran; Fourcas Hosten, Poujeaux; Margaux - Anguludet, Malescot,
Monbrison, Palmer; St Julien - Beychevelle, Leoville-Barton, Gruaud-Larose;
Pauillac - Lynch-Bages, Pichon-Longueville, Pichon-Lalande; St Estephe -
Montrose.
It was a former maitre de chai of Lafite who said to Elie de Rothschild of a
previous moderate vintage: 'We need wines like these to wait for the
others.' There is no lack of earlier years with promise of longevity - '88,
'89 and '90 - and the best of these '91s will have the virtue of early
drinkability, with more concentration than the '87s. With advice, worth
'looking at' in the next year or so.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: All you can taste and lots you can't - From
crawfish and Tabasco to gumbo, Giles MacDonagh samples Cajun cuisine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOUISIANA'S gastronomic traditions are quite separate from the rest of the
United States. They stem from the earlier French and Spanish control of the
state, which did not become join the Union until the Louisiana Purchase of
1803.
Half a century before that, the swampy Mississippi delta had become an
asylum for the French-speaking Acadians of Nova Scotia who fled from British
rule after the fall of Quebec. The Acadians became 'Cajuns' and their
primitive life style persisted until oil was found in the delta in the
1930s.
Their isolation had two advantages: it allowed them to retain the French
language, which all but disappeared from the rest of Louisiana; and it
preserved their distinctive cookery (although, in the absence of refresher
courses from France, some of the terms and ideas have begun to look very
deformed).
The Cajuns' basic diet was culled from the swamps and bayous - the
distinctive dead-end rivers of southern Louisiana. They ate fish, crab and
crayfish (which they called crawfish), turtles and alligators. From dry
land, they culled a variety of game: deer, bear, squirrels and opossums. In
short, anything that moved - and one or two things which had ceased to move.
All these treats were served in spicy sauces designed, as much as anything,
to hide the taste.
Chillis played an important role in Cajun cooking; not for nothing is the
apex of Cajun country, Avery island near New Iberia, the home of Tabasco
sauce. Tabasco is made a little like sauerkraut: the chilli peppers are
fermented under salt (for three years), then steeped in vinegar. There are
few Cajun recipes in which Tabasco plays no part and, even when it is not
stipulated in the ingredients, Cajuns tend to dribble it onto the dish.
Crawfish are the Cajuns' favourite food and, given their scarcity in the
rest of the world, the locals eat quite monstrous quantities of them. One
local told me that he reckoned one 35-40lb bag was too little for 12 people
whereas two bags was too much.
Personally, there is a limit to how many I can eat. They tend to be rather
muddy and are better in sauces. The other drawback to the Cajun crayfish
blow-out is the omnipresent spice box, which makes everything taste more or
less the same.
But Cajun cooking does not stop there. One stock in trade is gumbo, a
nourishing soup which derives from an African word for okra, the vegetable
which forms the main ingredient. Besides okra, virtually anything can go
into gumbo - and does.
One favoured element is andouille sausage. Put all thoughts of the Norman or
Breton tripe sausage out of your mind, though: Cajun andouille is more like
a Polish Kielbasa. Equally confusing for francophiles is the boudin. The
Cajun version is a meaty, spicy rice stuffed into an inedible sausage skin.
In New Orleans, a boudin appeared as a rice, spice and duck meat patty
dipped in beaten egg.
Another French word with a distinctly local usage is an etouffee. The Cajuns
translate this to mean 'smothered' (although, in many cases, suffocated
would be more fitting). Indeed, there is even a French term etouffe chretien
which describes dishes which suffocate by their flouriness. The basis of the
etouffee is a thick, brown roux of a sort which was laid to rest in France
by the first onslaughts of the nouvelle cuisine.
For the rest, much is deep fried: cubes of alligator, catfish, prawns and
mushrooms stuffed with crab meat.
Cajun food has much in common with the Creole cooking of New Orleans but the
latter is deemed to be more refined. In some of the more robust dishes, such
as jambalaya - a sort of Creole paella - this distinction would be hard to
maintain.
In New Orleans' restaurants such as Commander's Palace, the kitchen aims to
produce a more elegant cuisine. There is, nonetheless, something
old-fashioned about the style of the dishes - above all, a turtle soup so
thick that it could be spooned only after half a cup of sherry was added.
No visitor to New Orleans should miss having a meal at K-Paul's; it is the
best induction course into the Creole-Cajun question you are likely to find.
The small dining room in the nub of the French Quarter is immensely popular,
and queues for lunch start forming at 11.30 am. The menu contains all you
need to know about Louisianna food. It is astonishingly cheap for anyone
used to London prices.
In the corner sits Paul Prudhomme, the chef, looking like the legendary
gourmand Dodin-Bouffant under his jowls. Prudhomme has put both his mind and
his belly to the whole bizarre repertory of Cajun-Creole cooking.
Commander's Palace restaurant, 1403 Washington Ave (Garden District),
504-899-8221; K-Paul's, 416 Chartres Street (French Quarter), 524-7394.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Travel: Africa - my own private tryst list - Michael Holman
discloses the names of special hotels that he trusts for assignations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SULTAN'S band no longer plays outside the English Club in Zanzibar. It
used to, every Thursday evening, according to my guidebook. But that was
published in 1952, when the island was a British protectorate.
Some 30 years later I sat on the balcony of the club and watched the dhows
drift by at sunset. The band stopped playing at independence in December
1963. The club had become the Africa House Hotel, its past revealed by the
battered snooker table and a faded sign pointing to the 'Ladies Powder
Room'.
As in many of my favourite African hotels, ghosts seemed to walk the club's
corridors and prop up the bar. Like the club, the hotels usually have high
ceilings and creaky fans, mosquito nets and wide verandas. The bedroom keys
have worn wooden tags, the cast-iron baths rest on clawed feet, and the bar
has trophies of long-forgotten tournaments.
They are on my idiosyncratic African tryst list: scenes of assignations with
companions real or imagined. Hotels where, by chance or design, I have met
up with a friend; or which were my destination in a search for the past.
Most of them are - or were in their heyday - tourist hotels in the
conventional sense, either set amid spectacular scenery or near man-made
marvels. They still provide hospitality, though many show the strains of the
continent's crisis. But my judgment of their appeal is flawed, distorted by
that narcotic nostalgia, or by the strange juxtapositions of life as a
journalist in Africa. Being a witness to poverty and distress and then
retreating to comfort and security; or simply thankful to have survived a
long car journey or bumpy flight, accentuates the pleasures of the senses.
Never has chablis tasted so good as at the Hotel de la Gare in Lubumbashi,
southern Zaire, in the wake of one the abortive uprisings against President
Mobutu. Nor has my thirst been slaked so well as by the cold beer served on
arrival at the Mweya Safari Lodge, high above Lake Edward in eastern Uganda,
at the end of a fraught and dusty journey from Kampala, not long after Idi
Amin's downfall. Seldom have I enjoyed my Davidoff cigar more than on the
lawn of the hotel at Bahar Dar on the banks of Lake Tana in central
Ethiopia. On the horizon was one of the lake's ancient island monasteries,
some dating back to the 13th century. The monks still observed age-old
rituals of meditation and prayer.
Other unsung wonders of Africa are served by the hotels on my list. War made
some of them well-nigh inaccessible for most visitors. Peace has since
brought them within reach, although they remain hard to get at for all but
the determined visitor, who will have to brave pot-holed roads and endure
rickety aircraft.
The modest hotel in Lalibela, in northern Ethiopia, overlooks a wondrous
spectacle - 12 churches hewn out of solid rock over 800 years ago. From the
Gohar hotel, high in the hills that surround Gondar in north-eastern
Ethiopia, one looks down in the valley with the 17th century castle of
Emperor Fasiladas.
At the window of a dilapidated hotel I watched dawn break over Mozambique
island, where Vasco da Gama's ships cast anchor in 1498. Sunrise revealed a
16th century Portuguese town, transplanted to the east African coast and
frozen in time. It was the capital of Mozambique until the end of the last
century; now it is a crumbling relic of 400 years of colonial rule.
The upper floor view from the hotel on the island of Goree, off Dakar,
Senegal, takes in the picturesque harbour as well as a neglected monument to
Africa's holocaust - the island's slave house, the last staging post in a
terrible journey.
The slave trade has been called the greatest forced migration in the history
of man. Between 1650 and 1850, the period when the trade flourished, some
12m slaves were landed in the Americas, according to one estimate. It is
calculated that 2m perished on the journey and 7m died before embarkation.
Their ghosts can be found on Goree.
Some of my favourite hotels are long gone, like old Meikles Hotel in Harare,
which had high ceilings and wide red-polished verandas.
Some are preserved and thriving: the Mount Nelson Hotel, for example, in the
shadow of Cape Town's Table Mountain. Union Castle passenger liners used to
carry hotel guests across the Atlantic from Southampton, a two-week voyage I
did as a child. They now step off a 12-hour flight from London; but the
hotel still recalls an era past and residents write postcards home from
escritoires in a stately lounge.
Some have evocative names, like the Mountain of the Moons Hotel, Fort
Portal, in western Uganda, overlooking the Ruwenzori Mountains.
Others have powerful associations, like the hotel in Stanleyville, now
Kisangani, on the bend in the Congo river made famous by V S Naipaul's
classic novel. They were terrible times in the Congo in the 1960s.
The Belgian Congo, now Zaire, was in bloody post-independence upheaval. The
country symbolised anarchy: a confusing battlefield of communists,
nationalists, secessionists, mercenaries and United Nations troops. Belgian
refugees streamed across the border with Northern Rhodesia. To the whites of
neighbouring Southern Rhodesia, it seemed a harbinger of their own fate.
Schoolboy memories of Stanleyville, whose reverberations reached me in my
home in Gwelo, Rhodesia, would have been enough in themselves to draw me to
the city. But my interest was whetted by the recollections of journalists
who covered the Congo, equipped with Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriters, and
who filed by cable. Some ended their careers in Salisbury, ancient mariners
telling tales of expense claims on a heroic scale.
It was not until 1985 that I made my pilgrimage. The hotel had become a
pit-stop for trans-Africa safaris, but the ghosts were there.
Other hotels on my list I arrived at by chance. Like the Karibu Hotel near
Goma, in eastern Zaire, with a wine list that harked back to the days when
coffee exports flourished and French fashions and Belgian chocolates were in
the town's high street windows. I was stranded at the airport one minute,
the next minute rescued by the local coffee baron and drinking champagne on
the banks of Lake Kivu.
The crisp air and the mountainous scenery were a world away from the steamy
heat and seamy intrigue of Kinshasa. Even Fanta orangeade tasted special in
the Restaurant Ca Depend, off the main road from the airport to Goma. It was
served with engaging informality, the proprietress nonchalantly uncapping
the bottle with her teeth, plonking it down on the red-and-white check
tablecloth, and chewing the cap reflectively as she moved back behind the
counter.
Some while ago I added the Pointe Venus Hotel on the Indian Ocean island of
Rodrigues to my tryst list. A wood-slatted verandah surrounds an elegant but
fading colonial residence, one of the first built on the island, and perched
above Port Mathurin.
But closest to my heart is the Kuchawe Inn, on Malawi's Zomba Plateau. It is
a 30-minute drive from Zomba, the sleepy former colonial capital. The rooms
are on the very lip of the plateau, each with its own balcony. I recall
morning tea while looking down on hawks circling in the valley; fresh
strawberries; an idyllic lake; cows as sleek as if they lived in
Switzerland; and walking in the plateau's cool forest with the ghosts of old
Malawi and a companion by my side.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Travel: Guilt trip to Tasmania's past - Australians are
beginning to exploit their convict history. Keith Wheatley visited Sarah
Island
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARRIVING in Strahan, the loneliest town in Tasmania's south-west wilderness,
after a taxing drive on bumpy mountain roads, it was hard not to feel
bone-weary. And guilty. After all, what were the privations of a few hours
at the wheel of a hired Toyota compared with the miseries endured by the
first Europeans to reach this area?
Just offshore from Strahan, in the limpid waters of Macquarie harbour, lies
Sarah Island. From 1822-32 it held men and women prisoners in conditions of
deliberately bestial cruelty. Sarah Island was a 19th century precursor to
Belsen and Dachau.
Convict tourism - a very special branch of the heritage industry - is
relatively new in Australia. Even a decade ago, the era of transportation
could be a touchy subject at an Australian dinner table. However,
publication of Robert Hughes' masterly account of penal colony life, The
Fatal Shore, was a turning point. Hughes emphasised the role of Sarah Island
as an ultimate deterrent - far beyond fear of capital punishment.
'This place was at the very bottom of the inferno-like system of convict
classification devised by George Arthur, Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's
Land (as Tasmania) was then known,' wrote Hughes. 'It was a hell where men
deprived of the means of suicide had been known to commit murder solely for
the privilege of being taken in chains to Hobart and hanged - and thus
escape.'
If Australia itself was remote, Sarah Island was another planet. There was
no overland route through the 250 miles of mountain and rainforest - an
untouched wilderness that now attracts visitors, hikers and naturalists -
that lie between the settlement and Hobart.
Like the convicts, we arrived at Sarah Island by boat. In those days,
prisoners took up to a month on sailing ships that travelled the wickedly
rocky coastline from Hobart. They were given no accommodation aboard. They
had to lie in chains on top of the cargo, wrapped in soaking wet blankets.
Today, the comfortable Wilderness Explorer takes about 90 minutes from the
sleepy Strahan waterfront.
'Stick to the paths as you walk around. There are big leeches in the
undergrowth,' warned the Explorer's owner-skipper, Guy Grining. He has seen
a big rise in interest towards Sarah Island. Ten years ago eyes were averted
as his ship cruised past, heading into the nearby Gordon River and the deep
rainforest. Recently, Grining carried a visitor related to a convict who
died on the island.
'She was first off the boat and last back aboard. Didn't speak for hours,'
said Grining. He is the great-grandson of a German boatbuilder who came to
Macquarie Harbour in the 1890s to build ships of the magnificent local Huon
pine.
Boat-building became one of the principal activities at Sarah Island. Traces
of the slipways can still be glimpsed through the clear but tea-coloured
water. Tannin from the roots of the buttongrass leaches into every local
watercourse and turns it brown.
Ashore, little survives of the prison buildings. There is a stone wall here,
or a fragment of the chaplain's hut. Sensibly, the Tasmania wildlife and
heritage department has kept its work on Sarah Island low-key. There are
small engraved information plaques at key points, but everything is
intensely quiet.
Despite the endless floggings, hunger and cold, many convicts did attempt to
escape from Sarah Island. Since many were sent off into the forest on
logging parties - involving a 15-mile row each way, towing huge logs on the
return journey, and without mid-day food - the convicts had only to conquer
their fear of the unknown to slip away into the green dankness.
Flying today over the trackless forest, incised by deep, fast-flowing
rivers, one can understand how nearly two-thirds of the 112 prisoners who
absconded in the first six years of Sarah Island died of hunger or animal
attack in the bush.
Chas Osborn, temporary pilot of the tourist seaplane and by trade a
crop-sprayer, says it still gives him shivers flying over the deep forest.
'Once you're on the ground in there you can see nothing and you don't even
know which way is up,' he says.
Convicts who escaped would occasionally resort to cannibalism. Various
incidents are documented, though the most celebrated concern Alexander
Pearce. When soldiers apprehended him after his second escape in November
1823, they found the part-eaten arm of another convict in Pearce's bag.
This is a beautiful but hostile area. It was 30 miles from Strahan, at the
site of the proposed Franklin River dam, that environmental protestors
chained themselves to bulldozers in 1982 and set off a Ghandi-like campaign
that still resonates around the world.
The unusual and beautifully designed Strahan visitors' centre tackles both
the convict story and the environmental campaign with vigorous and
thought-provoking displays. It must be one of the few tourist information
bases where the visitor is challenged to ask whether he or she should even
be there. Guilt is never far away in south-west Tasmania.
Keith Wheatley travelled to Tasmania c/o Air New Zealand (London tel:
081-846-9595). Information about travel within Tasmania can be obtained from

FT  15 MAY 93 / Travel: Sociable city of counter-cultures - FT Guide to
Civilised Breaks / All the world and Nicholas Lander beat a path to
Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the European cities, there is an intimacy about Amsterdam that makes
it different. It has not got the hard-edged drive of cosmopolitan London or
the self-conscious fashionability of Paris. It has not got Florence's art,
Madrid's energy, Rome's history, St Petersburg's architecture or Geneva's
wealth.
What it has is sociability. On a continent of crowded urban anonymity this
is indeed a civilised quality; to my mind it makes Amsterdam a splendid
choice for a civilised weekend.
What is it about Amsterdam that gives it such immediate familiarity? Even on
the Leidseplein, the busy commercial entertainment district where I began my
weekend wanderings, visitors feel a relaxed spontaneity. This is a city that
asks you to let the mask down, to relax your guard, to be just a little bit
more your private self in public. Why?
Certainly one answer is Amsterdam's scale. This is a small city of human
proportions. You can walk across its centre in half an hour. Nowhere will
you find the overwhelming, the monumental. The buildings here, like most
things Dutch, are plain, functional and without ostentation; they are narrow
and rarely more than four stories tall. In a crowded city where space is at
a premium, the streets, too, are narrow. Even the city's bright yellow trams
are toy-like.
Bicycles by the thousand add to this air of domesticity. They are not shiny,
hi-tech products but heavy-framed black clonkers. They give the city a
wonderfully homey feel.
Another answer to Amsterdam's casual, somewhat bohemian atmosphere is its
canals, boats and water. The canals give the city its distinctive
topography. Radiating outwards in concentric circles from the port, the
city's 160 canals are everywhere. But the canals give more than just a
physical definition to the city. As any resident of Amsterdam's 2,500
houseboats will tell you, there is something wonderfully soothing and
peaceful about a prospect of placid water. Normally, city walking is a
tiring business: I found long canal-side walks in Amsterdam refreshing.
The essential element to Amsterdam's character, though, lies in its people.
Strolling in the sun past the outdoor cafes of the Leidseplein, I had the
odd sensation that Amsterdammers could be a Mediterranean people. There is a
tremendous sociability about them, an obvious enjoyment found in
conversation and in the company of others. Like Latins hundreds of miles to
the south, Amsterdammers are cheerful, expressive, energetic and gregarious.
There is, however, an essential difference. Underlying this happy
countenance is a cool, northern rationality, a social awareness and sense of
civic involvement wholly foreign to the egocentricities of the
Mediterranean. It is from this strong recognition of a social contract that
Amsterdam's renowned liberal tolerance springs.
Exactly how a society with morally rigid traditions like Holland's gave
birth to a permissive society like Amsterdam's is confusing - Amsterdam made
itself the greatest trading city in the 17th century world by virtuous
adherence to a Calvinist work ethic. But the basis of capitalism was also
the basis of egalitarianism, civic democracy and personal freedom, beginning
300 years ago, when minority groups started to find in Amsterdam the liberty
to pursue their ideals.
More recently, the city's traditions of tolerance were hijacked by the
counter-culture of the 1960s. Easy-going attitudes towards sex, drugs and
alternate lifestyles made Amsterdam a world centre for the non-conventional.
People poured in from everywhere.
Aids, hard drug abuse and economic recession have made youth culture a less
flamboyant spectacle. But the young, and those middle-aged Amsterdammers who
retain something of the 1960s - no-one seems very old in Amsterdam -
continue to exert influence on a city lifestyle that is offbeat, creative
and sensitive to social issues. And the world continues to pour in: one out
of every four Amsterdammers is an immigrant. Today, tolerance is not just
some fanciful notion; it lies at the heart of Amsterdam's survival.
It is the spirit of the city that makes Amsterdam so attractive. Walk the
streets here and you will see vastly different kinds of people and styles.
Yet more conventional Amsterdammers take it all without raising an eyebrow.
The best way to experience the city is simply to wander about, have a look
at everything, and try whatever you like.
Tour-boats are precisely what they sound - touristy. But they are a
wonderful way to see Amsterdam. I liked them so much that I went on them
twice, once clockwise around the city under brilliant blue skies and
sunshine, once anti-clockwise under grey overcast skies.
Both moods suit the sombre, liver-coloured brick of the bridges and the
austere, white-window-framed, gabled-topped houses that lie to either side.
Add leafy canal-side trees, colourful barges and their even more colourful
inhabitants, and you have a city that is a delight to explore by boat, on
foot, or by bicycle. The great fun of Amsterdam is that all its nonsense -
drugs, sex, loony leftism, bohemian living - takes place against a
traditional, 17th century background.
The restaurants, cafes and coffee shops one floats past in the day take on a
life after dark. I became hopelessly lost trying to relocate one attractive
cafe, but in the labyrinth of bridges and canals that make up the Jordaan
area I found all sorts of compensations.
Still a working-class district with a strong local character, the Jordaan
quickly became my favourite part of Amsterdam. Rich in small shops,
restaurants and 'brown' cafes - bars named for their dingy, old-fashioned
decor - it still has an authentic atmosphere. Quite different are the city's
designer cafes, steel and glass monuments to modernism. And different again
are its 'coffee shops,' where the main interest is not coffee but hashish
and marijuana, sold openly and legally.
I enjoyed mixing Amsterdam's high culture and pop culture in equal
proportions. In the Rijksmuseum I gazed at Rembrandt's Night Watch,
Amsterdam's most celebrated painting, but found far more to marvel at in
17th century still life. How did the Dutch masters so precisely capture the
texture of things like oyster shells, lemons, pewter, clay pipes,
tablecloths? They were magicians.
Afterwards, I relaxed on the grass in the nearby Vondelpark, favoured haunt
of joggers, frisbee players and sun-worshippers, and gazed at more
conventional magicians - the types who use top hats and white rabbits. They
are just one of the scores of different kinds of artists, musicians and
street entertainers who make modern Amsterdam's sidewalks anything but still
life.
One could hardly find a more eclectic mix than in Amsterdam. On my last day
I spent the morning looking at some of the world's best-loved tableaux at
the Van Gogh museum. I passed the afternoon in the red-light district; the
spectacle of women in their underwear sitting in windows is matched only by
bus-loads of wide-eyed tourists giggling at it all.
Early evening found me at the Concertgebouw, home to one of the great
orchestras, listening to a chamber music festival. The late evening was
spent watching a Jamaican reggae band through clouds of hashish smoke at a
club.
That is all very well, you might say, but every city in the world has its
sacred and profane, its great circus of human variety. And you would be
right. But nowhere in the world can you pass with such equanimity from one
to the other. Amsterdam may not always be entirely civilised, but it is
almost always sociable.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Travel: Gratified by the Gower - Snapshot / Jill James
braves the rain to visit a Welsh haven of great beauty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES

<TEXT>
WE HAD to guess where the centre of the road lay. Up to our axles in muddy
brown water with the rain beating down on our car, and apparently miles from
anywhere, we were beginning to fret.
The drive from Llanrhidian to Penclawdd, to take a look at birdlife on the
marshes of the Gower coast, seemed a good way of spending a battleship-grey
morning in south Wales on a family holiday. But we had not reckoned on the
havoc a combination of spring tides and torrential rain would wreak on the
peninsula's little roads.
Away from the marshes, fields and roads alike were becoming lakes and
drainage channels at roadside edges were turning into streams.
Yet still we pressed on, taking the car inch by inch across flooded patches
of road and praying that the carburettor and spark plugs would not be the
first to drown.
Unidentifiable birds flew arrow straight across the vast expanse of dull sky
which met the misty green of marsh and reed in the far distance. Boats sat
in fields waiting for the incoming tide to mop them up.
The peninsula is a paradise for soul searchers, depressives, the intrepid
and villains with bodies to dispose of (although you cannot move off the
marsh roads because of the signs warning of unexploded bombs - leftovers
from the area's use by the military).
Above the marshes young lambs bullocked and bumped their way around the
sodden fields while their mothers stood stolidly chewing the wet,
green-growing grass, oblivious to us and the weather.
Gower (Gwyr in Welsh) will appeal to those who want a simple break. There is
no railway, no cinema and no smart restaurant. By way of compensation there
is magnificent walking, golden, safe beaches (on the south side) and enough
of historical and archaeological interest to feed fertile family interest
for a fortnight.
Local pubs serve good local beer (Felinfoel). Cockles, laverbread (boiled
seaweed, a peculiarly Welsh delicacy) and warm welcomes are available almost
everywhere.
In August and on bank holiday weekends, the roads are choc-a-bloc with cars
and caravans as holidaymakers seek out the castles, cromlechs, downs and -
most of all - the vast sandy bays which are one of the glories of this
peninsula, which dips its foot into the Bristol Channel just after you leave
Swansea.
The area has deservedly been declared one of outstanding natural beauty. Its
climax is the 16 miles of sands, limestone headlands and cliffs that form
its southern coast and which are topped by the village of Rhosili.
Just a few houses, a shop and a hotel cluster around the church of St Mary,
which contains a memorial to Edgar Evans, the Rhosili man who died with
Captain Scott on the return from the South Pole.
From the big National Trust car park there is a walk out to the Worms Head -
a rock which winds out to sea like the serpent or dragon that the Norsemen
are said to have named it after.
Shipwrecks in the sands of Rhosili bay intrigue serious walkers and children
alike. They may even tread in the footsteps of the old Celtic saints who
have left their names all over the area's churches: Cattwg, Teilo, Madog,
Cennydd and Dewi.
My abiding memory will be looking out over the bay on a misty evening as the
ghostly surf swept all before it.
Getting there: There are no trains and we never saw a bus although we did
see people waiting at shelters. Best way in is by car from the M4 motorway
taking the B road down through Sketty on the outskirts of Swansea.
Staying there: Bed and breakfast places are scattered around. A good
traditional Welsh pub with a coal fire and friendly, child-tolerant staff is
the Greyhound at Llanrhidian.

PROVENCE, it seems, is passe. The Dordogne has been done to death. Where
next for the discerning British francophile trying to beat the crowds to a
little corner of real rural France?
Well, one could do worse than Languedoc Tarn - the hinterland of Toulouse,
in the south west. Barry Fryer has gone to the extent of buying a small
dilapidated chateau standing in 55 acres of parkland half an hour's drive
from the city. It used to belong to the English secretary of Charles de
Gaulle, the French president, during the last war.
Fryer is an architect/developer, and Chateau Seran is an ambitious project.
He is restoring and converting the chateau's outbuildings into individual
apartments and houses for sale, keeping the main building and grounds as a
select country club.
It is his third such development in the area having completed and sold all
24 houses in his previous two projects.
Outbuildings have been converted into a selection of cottages and houses for
sale, some with their own private gardens, some without. The first have been
completed. There will be 20 in all, priced from Pounds 65,000 to Pounds
95,000 - and they will include mod cons like central heating and washing
machines.
Fryer's preoccupation is with quality artisan workmanship, in keeping with
the character of the buildings themselves: he stresses preservation and
restoration, opting for plain whitewashed walls, tiled or stripped floors,
and hardwood fitments.
An annual maintenance charge of Pounds 1,000 covers services including
security and maintenance checks and full use of club facilities including
tennis courts,a pool, riding stables (the chateau is surrounded by 50km of
bridleways), a restaurant, billiard room and business facilities.
It is planned to open the country club to a limited non-resident local
membership as well.
Full details are available from Fryer at Chateau Seran, 81500 Massac,
Lavaur, France. Tel 63 58 30 08, fax 63 58 28 37.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: Island sun traps with a tax carrot - Audrey
Powell considers the similarities - and differences - between Malta and
Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   by AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALTA OR Cyprus? How does one make a comparison between the two islands as
the location for holiday or retirement homes?
Both are in the Mediterranean and are sun traps, and each has a golf course.
Beyond that, at first Malta 17 miles long and flat, and Cyprus stretching
150 miles and mountainous, might seem to have little in common. Yet both
were once under British rule and popular with retired British service
families. Both had periods when they lost their attraction - during the
Mintoff regime in Malta and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.
Now they are back in favour, with a different government in Malta and years
of peace in Cyprus. (United Nations-sponsored talks between the separate
sectors of the island are being resumed). Both Malta and Cyprus offer
beneficial tax arrangements and a lower cost of living than Britain.
English is understood on both islands although too much reliance should not
be placed on this. The Briton who asked a Maltese builder to paint a wall
came back to find it demolished, through a misunderstanding.
On both islands foreign buyers may purchase only one property. In Cyprus
they may not let (though many do). In Malta they may only let if the
property has a pool.
On both islands flat roofs have been the style in the past, though changes
are creeping in. In Malta the properties, of mellow limestone blocks, look
Biblical - if you ignore the television aerials. In Cyprus the flat roofs
tend to look unfinished, as they may have been, awaiting a further storey
for a daughter's dowry. Now daughters work and do not need dowries, and
solar water-heating apparatus sits on the roof.
In Malta a foreign buyer cannot purchase a property costing less than about
Pounds 26,250 (Pounds 31,000 with stamp duty and legal fees), to leave the
lower-priced homes for locals. But there is plenty of choice above that.
Generally, the property market retains its upward trend, says Eric Mason, of
the Malta &amp; Gozo Property Group. Over the past 12 months houses with gardens
have shown a sharp increase - averaging 30 per cent for detached villas or
farmhouses. With flats in holiday areas, where supply exceeds demand, value
has only increased by up to 5 per cent. Yet apartments in popular
residential areas, such as Sliema and St Julians, have shown increases of up
to 20 per cent.
In the first nine months of last year sales to foreigners dropped 20 per
cent, mainly due to the absence of the British. Some buyers are going ahead
with purchases, using an 8 per cent, five-year, interest-only Maltese
mortgage facility.
An EC-funded structure plan for the Maltese islands has been drawn up by
British planning consultants Colin Buchanan &amp; Partners, in conjunction with
Generale Progetti, of Rome, and is being implemented. This will limit new
development which could increase prices of larger houses. Over the past 20
years property prices in Malta have increased by an average of 13.5 per cent
a year, says Mason. He thinks this could continue.
Prices go up to Pounds 525,000 but the most popular price for foreign buyers
is the Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 150,000 band. That could buy a converted
farmhouse with valley views. Prices of farmhouses, with their interior
arches, courtyards and often stone steps at the side of the building, depend
on condition. One with two bedrooms - and the possibility of three more - a
garage and garden is Pounds 22,000 including stamp duty and legal fees.
There is plenty of new property. This may be offered in shell form, to be
completed as a buyer likes, as in the case of Park Towers in St Julians
where there are nearly 60 flats and penthouses with two to five bedrooms,
verandahs and garages. A three-bedroom flat is Pounds 92,300; a penthouse,
Pounds 166,250. All have sea views. Some flats, new or resales, are sold
furnished.
Property lists and copies of a new guide, Moving to Malta, published by the
finance ministry, are available from the Malta &amp; Gozo Property Group's
office at Ashford, Kent (Tel: 0233-720216).
In the Greek sector of Cyprus few older properties come on the market.
Families tend not to sell the appealing houses, with their verandahs
wreathed in vines, in the mountain villages. So the selection is mostly
among the many new developments in coastal towns like Paphos and Limassol.
There are also some projects in the hills inland. The D Zavos Group
(0708-450784), with about eight developments on the island, has a price
range of from Pounds 35,000 for compact bungalows to Pounds 50,000 for
specially designed villas.
Cybarco (071-436-3881), with its own clutch of schemes, has marina beach
apartments back from the water in what is becoming a hotel part of Limassol.
There will be 100 apartments, with the first blocks finished next month.
Prices from Pounds 40,000.
A Cyprus reader gives a warning to the potential buyer who might be swayed
by the friendliness of the people and the choice of property and decide on a
spur-of-the-moment purchase. Procedures are not hurried in Cyprus and it can
take 18 months for permission to transfer a property from seller to buyer.
The authorities receive many applications and like to check papers
thoroughly and ensure that the 'right sort of people' will be coming to live
in their sector of the island. Thus, there is a a period of limbo during
which, in the absence of proper legal assistance to safeguard a buyer, it is
possible for problems to occur.
When a developer or seller offers the services of their advocate to handle
both sides of the transaction to save enormous costs, a number of buyers
accept an offer which cannot be loaded in their favour.
A buyer should always appoint his own advocate, negotiating the fee before
appointment. A list of advocates is available from the British High
Commission in Nicosia. For British people planning a purchase, a visit to
the Citizens' Club in Nicosia, Larnaca, Paphos or Limassol is recommended.

<TEXT>
'GABYLANDIA ESTA DE FIESTA' proclaimed one of the many banners that were
strung along the railings high up in the stands of Rome's marbled
masterpiece, the Foro Italico. 'GABYMANIA STUPENDA]' shrieked another.
Sadly, the reality was neither stupendous nor fiesta-like. Gabriela
Sabatini, the darling of the noisy army of Argentine and Italian youngsters
at the final of the 1993 Italian Open last Sunday, was struggling. Indeed,
the four-time champion whose last tournament win had been earned exactly 12
months earlier in this same red dust bowl - a 7-5 6-4 victory over Monica
Seles - was finding the going tough. Even the huge marble statues, their
faces streaked by daily downpours, seemed to be crying.
To the 22-year-old it must have seemed as if she was looking into a mirror.
The moonballing game of her Spanish opponent, Conchita Martinez, so like her
own, had reduced Sabatini to impotence. Yet she had had her chances. The
third game of the first set should have clinched it for her. This monumental
battle of 30 and 40 stroke rallies swayed backwards and forwards for 24
minutes - the time it normally takes for Seles or Steffi Graf to win a
complete set. It ended with Sabatini hitting a winning backhand volley on
the 32nd point after squandering seven previous break points.
A 2-1 lead should have been the launching pad the defending champion needed.
Yet something was missing: confidence. That precious and fragile commodity
was somehow just out of reach.
There had been moments during Sabatini's super-efficient semi-final
destruction of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, when it seemed that the year-long
nightmare of failure, exacerbated by a series of niggling injuries, had
ended. This was the same woman who had served-and-volleyed her way to the
1990 US Open title so brilliantly against an astonished Graf. She was back
in the groove. Or so it seemed. Yet in the final, once the first set had
been lost, belief died. Sabatini switched off mentally and bowed to the
inevitable, going down 7-5 6-1.
Strolling back to the interview room after the match I fell into step beside
Sabatini's new coach, Dennis Ralston. I asked him if Gaby would shower
before her press conference. 'I have no idea,' he replied. 'I'm still
learning]'
There is much to learn about the art of psychological first aid. One of the
pre-requisites is the undivided attention of the subject. That is not easily
guaranteed by a superstar like Sabatini whose on court earnings alone are
approaching Dollars 6.5m. The pressures on her for interviews and special
appearances are enormous. She has become a multi-million dollar industry
with annual turnover estimated to be Dollars 7m-Dollars 10m. Two perfumes
have been named after her, and there is endorsement income from Aerolineas
Argentinas, Yamaha rackets, Pepsi-Cola, Tacchini sportswear, Longine
watches, Fuji cameras and film, Rayban sunglasses, Gosen tennis strings and
the new Gaby Doll, which is the rage in South America.
Sabatini turned to Ralston a couple of months ago. Her relationship with the
Brazilian Carlos Kirmayr, begun at Wimbledon in 1990, had run its course.
The joy that he had rekindled that year at Flushing Meadow seemed to have
died.
Ralston has had enough experience working with US Davis Cup teams, and with
Chris Evert for a while, to help Gaby rediscover that winning feeling. There
is no doubt that, even after two months, she is already looking fitter and
faster. If she allows Ralston to help her with her serve, then we might see
a real breakthrough. It was deficiency in that department that cost Gaby the
Wimbledon title in 1991. Twice she served for the match in the final set
against Graf and twice she fumbled it.
Gabriela knows she cannot afford any more fumbles. Ten times in the last
four years she has reached the semi-finals or better at Grand Slam
championships but she can claim only one title. She also knows that with
Seles temporarily sidelined by that horrific knife attack she will never
have a better chance. With Ralston's help we may yet see Sabatini's
potential fulfilled.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Motoring: Top marks for the Alfa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALFA Romeo 164 has had its first serious revamp in nearly five years. As
a result this big, front-wheel driven saloon's appeal to user-choosers of
two- and three-litre cars has been strengthened.
Some Alfa Romeo buyers always have put performance before everything else.
They get a 164 Cloverleaf - wide-tyred, sprung firmly and fitted with
aerodynamic body extensions. Its leather seats are as unyielding as a
hunting saddle but it leaps from standstill to 100 kph (62 mph) in well
under eight seconds and owners can boast of an unusable 245 kph (152 mph)
top speed.
The secret of the Pounds 28,100 Cloverleaf's vigour is a new, 24-valve
development of Alfa Romeo's classic short-stroke, three-litre, V6 engine. It
puts out a lusty 235 horsepower at 6,300 rpm and develops maximum torque (in
plain language, pulls hardest) at 5,000 rpm.
As overall gearing is fairly low at 24 mph (39 kmh) per 1,000 rpm in fifth,
the V6 spun freely when I drove it briskly on uncrowded, hilly roads in
north-east Scotland the other day. It pulled nicely in fifth in town traffic
and cruised in relaxed fashion on dual carriageways. Alfa's figures suggest
it might give an uncharacteristically light-footed driver around 27 mpg
(10.46l/100km). Even by Alfa Romeo standards, it cornered and held the road
exceptionally well.
The Cloverleaf's stablemate is the slightly less potent (200 hp) but more
resiliently sprung 164 Super. Both come with air-conditioning, heated and
power-adjusted front seats, six-speaker radio/CD player and ABS brakes.
The Super, which lacks the Cloverleaf's aggressive looks, costs Pounds
25,100 (or Pounds 26,504 with automatic transmission). I liked it even
better because ride comfort means more to me than the ultimate in handling.
I thought a 164 Super might seduce the user of a Saab 9000 2.3 turbo
hankering after a bigger engine; or a Ford Scorpio driver in search of
greater charisma.
Entry model in the revised 164 range is the Pounds 16,850 Twinspark. It
lacks the sheer muscle of the V6 but the two-litre, four-cylinder twin-cam
is no weakling, with 146 horsepower on tap. The Twinspark had the neatest
handling and the best ride of the lot.
The Alfa Romeo 164, Fiat Croma (no longer sold in Britain), Lancia Thema and
Saab 9000 share the same underpinnings. They started off as a joint exercise
because neither Fiat Group nor Saab could contemplate the cost of developing
a big, new car on its own. Inevitably, they grew apart; now, the Alfa Romeo
164 is arguably the most individual and best looking of the four.
Alfa Romeos always have let their drivers feel in more intimate contact with
the mechanics than most other cars although you get the same feeling in a
Porsche. All the 164s make lovely growly noises when you put your foot down
and let the engine soar to high revolutions.
The three I drove all had a slight whimper in the transmission when going
from power-on to power-off. I was happy to put this down to character,
because they felt solidly built and one could believe they would be
mechanically enduring.
Speaking of which, it really is time Alfa Romeo and Lancia were allowed to
come in from the cold. The bad old days, when Italian car makers took a
cavalier attitude toward mundane matters like corrosion resistance, have
long gone but the stigma remains.
Most of the sheet steel used in Alfa Romeo and Lancia bodies is galvanised
and the anti-rust warranty has been extended from six to eight years.
Mechanical and electrical frailties, too, are said to be things of the past.
There is no way of proving this in a brief test drive; only extended use can
do that. But Grant and Taylor, a London firm of information technologists,
has had more than 200 Lancias as company cars in the past 20 years and runs
a fleet of 31 now.
For some years, half the Alfa Romeos sold in Britain have been 164s, more
than 5,500 in all. I know of no reason why they should not be just as
reliable as Grant and Taylor's Lancias.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Sport: Waddle Hoddle-itis - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY's FA Cup Final marks the start of a fraught period for English soccer
fans whose sense of identity and self-worth are intimately tied up in the
performances of the national side.
Six of Arsenal's cup final players and two of Sheffield Wednesday's are in
Graham Taylor's squad for two World Cup qualifying games - in Norway on June
2 and Poland six days later - followed by three games in the US.
Recent England performances at Wembley have provided contradictory evidence.
Against Norway and San Marino the team played the predictable, uninspired,
functional soccer that the fans identify with Taylor. Against Turkey and the
Netherlands there were signs of a more self-confident style. Today's game
will be scoured for omens.
Arsenal in spite of the presence of Ian Wright, the best attacker in
England, scored the fewest goals in Premier League - just 40. But they only
conceded 38. They symbolise the dour, defensive side of the British game.
Sheffield Wednesday represent the attacking spirit.
This contradiction is personified by two players. Tony Adams, of Arsenal,
who will almost certainly play against Norway, and Chris Waddle, of
Sheffield Wednesday, who will not even be on the flight there.
Adams' ungainly gait is a constant reminder of England's humiliation in the
European Championships in 1988: three defeats. The whole business summed up
by the way Marco van Basten skipped around Adams to score for the Dutch.
Waddle's lanky, lazy, elegance recalls memories of England's last moment of
glory: the unexpected run to the World Cup semi-finals in Italy in 1990. If
his extra-time shot against the base of the West German post had been an
inch to the left, or his kick in the penalty shoot-out just four yards
lower, England could have been in the final.
Adams is big, strong and brave. He is a leader and scores his share of
goals. His strike beat Spurs in the semi-final. 'Donkey won the derby' sang
the Arsenal fans. But just because he looks clumsy does not mean he is
without skill.
Where Waddle's long passes are invariably elegant but frequently
ineffective, Adams' passes, delivered elbows locked, with a stiff swing of
the leg and a strange crank of the torso, are consistently accurate and
often imaginative.
His re-emergence as a first-choice international is a reward for persistence
and relative youth. He is 26. Among his rivals, Richard Jobson, Mark Wright
and Keith Curle are all 30 or close to it.
Even so, the donkey has not become a thoroughbred. He remains the player he
has always been; with the same, under-appreciated, virtues and the same
weakness: his slowness on the turn.
Against Turkey the giveaway was precisely the feature of his game that drew
most praise: the string of last-ditch diving tackles deep in his own penalty
area. The sliding tackle is a difficult art and Adams' tackles were
magnificent: but why did he need to make so many? Was it because the Turkish
attackers found it so easy to by-pass him.
What distinguishes top international sides is the number of attackers who
combine close control with speed. The Dutch have three. Last month, Adams'
nemesis, van Basten, did not play, so Des Walker could mark Dennis Bergkamp
while Lee Dixon struggled with Marc Overmars. The moment of truth could come
when the two countries play again on October 13.
While Adams is a pragmatist Waddle is a determined spokesman for the fantasy
tendency in English soccer. He demands the freedom to express his creative
whims. Sadly, what Waddle is demanding is the freedom not to do what he does
best. He is the foremost ball dribbler of his generation. He has a
repertoire of tricks and deceits and can beat defenders from a standing
start.
Perhaps this most precious of soccer gifts comes too easily for he does not
seem to value it. In his time at Tottenham Hotspur, Waddle caught
Hoddle-itis. Ever since, he has wanted to be something which he is not:
Glenn Hoddle. He wants to destroy defences with one elegant 70-yard pass.
The problem with Waddle's long passes is that too many do not reach their
target. He is, in American football parlance, 'forcing' his passes, hitting
them at players who are too well marked. A 70-yard pass cut out a yard from
its target may look wonderful for 69 yards but is a waste of possession.
Worse, Waddle can only play 70-yard passes if he is 70 yards away from the
opposing goal; away from the area where his dribbling - and his imaginative
short-passing - is most dangerous.
Over-optimistic long passes are meat and drink to the Arsenal defence.
Adams' greatest fear must be that Waddle will run at him with the ball on
the edge of the Arsenal penalty area.
When the two teams met in the League Cup Final a month ago Waddle played too
deep and did not run at the Arsenal defence at all. Only if he does so this
afternoon can Waddle demonstrate why he could still play for England while
Adams should not.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Sport: Bright and dull - Cricket

<TEXT>
AS WE neared the Northampton cricket ground last Sunday, we came upon a
road-race. Officials pointed the way for men in coloured shorts and vests
who sweated and panted, grimaced and tried to re-attach their flapping
numbers as they ran.
It was a bad omen but I comforted myself with the thought that they were
probably doing it for charity. That is more than can be said for what the
programme published for Sunday League matches calls 'the bright new world of
Sunday cricket', sponsored by AXA Equity and Law. The Test and County
Cricket Board agreed with AXA to make that world one of coloured clothes,
white cricket balls and black sight-screens, because of what the programme's
editor, Ralph Dellor, calls 'many benefits for cricket.' He mentions two,
the first money, the second youth appeal.
Northampton Cricket Club has new bars and cafes and a knot of shops and
stalls. On Sunday there was a jazz quartet tootling away - more a foyer of
the bright new world than a cricket pavilion. The much vaunted 'replica kit
market' relies on such shops and stalls selling county shirts for Pounds
25.99 each, which is a lot, even for a Northampton shirt in all its faded
maroon and sour yellow glory.
'The manufacturers claim they're very good quality,' said the county's chief
executive, Stephen Coverdale, smiling like anything.
Gloucestershire were the first to show off their full array of new 'county
colours' last Sunday. They took the field in dark blue shell-suits and
baseball caps, with big red and white stripes round the neck and clashing
blue jerseys to pull over the t-shirts, in some cases over the jackets as
well.
Everyone looked ghastly. No-one gave off the faintest whiff of quality or
glamour, not even Chris Broad, stroking his curly hair languidly.
Someone at AXA thought of pointing out that coloured cricket clothes are not
new. The back of the programme has a picture of W G Grace and fellow
cricketers in 1880, posing in coloured neck-scarves, caps, buckles and
belts. Some wear striped, a few wear coloured shirts and Grace sports an
orange and yellow striped MCC blazer. I should not think he played in his
blazer. The picture is an advert for white trousers, cool cotton shirts and
splashes of colour, not garish nylon from head to foot. But then I am not a
track-suit type.
Several players thought it was time I changed. Gloucestershire's bowler,
Martin Gerrard, sang the praises of cricket's new style: 'I'd say it's going
to be a success. It's different. It makes a change.'
Being different seems to be at a premium and to keep the bright new world
distinctive, even its strongest supporters thought it should be restricted
to Sundays, so there would be two styles of cricket on offer.
Umpires are a conservative breed and looked less happy with their place in
all this. Bad weather at Northampton forced them to make repeated excursions
to inspect conditions. Jackie Hampshire, looking like a superior lavatory
attendant in his bright blue jacket, also looked painfully embarrassed.
'Seeing is believing,' announced the public address system cryptically, when
Hampshire and John Holder walked out in their jackets to re-start play.
The white ball did not make the fielding look more auspicious, though sharp
fielding is one of the blessings of limited over cricket. To help everyone
see clearly, the new cricket is played in front of sight-screens covered in
black cloths that billow in the wind, at once absurd and dreary.
It was hard luck for the organisers at Northampton that rain reduced the
opening game to low spirits and less than 40 overs a side, removing any
chance to show what 50 overs a side has to offer. If anything, this
reduction lessened the pain of the awkward new timetable. Play is supposed
to start at noon which is neither a morning start nor an after-lunch start.
The bright-new-world Sunday lunch is at the surrealist time of 3.10pm.
'You could always bring a bacon roll in a flask,' offered one of a small
gang of Gloucestershire supporters. They did not want to comment on the
bright new world. Their Northamptonshire counterparts were less reticent. A
doleful and well-lubricated local had no doubt that it was all a load of
rubbish.
I spoke to some boys between about 10 and 14. They were not interested in
cricket clothes or trappings, new or old. They were there to watch Allan
Lamb hit big sixes.
It is the uninitiated that this new world hopes to attract. A market
research expert on television the other night explained: 'The young like
everything bright. We know that. All we have to do is work out how best to
relate that to cricket.'
I am inclined to think that it is the cricket, not the decor, that must
appeal to people. The Sunday game needs gusto and panache to survive.
Watching Gloucestershire expire limply for 123 last Sunday, I could not
imagine even flashing lights giving the bright new world of Sunday cricket
some sparkle.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Overcast with sunny spells - A
small weather centre's struggle to sell its services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH HUW DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU do not have to be anywhere special to forecast the weather. It is
universal, it. Weather Watchers Services competes against the Meteorological
Office as a seven-day, round-the-clock independent professional weather
service from the village of Laurieston in south west Scotland (population
150).
Weather Watchers was set up by Roland Chaplain in 1987 and is based in
converted outbuildings behind his stone house. On a balmy spring day it
still seems too rural to be serious. Through the open windows come the
bleatings of sheep on the Galloway hills. But the three forecasters working
at computer screens are accessing the same raw data as the Met Office - one
displays the European satellite image that Michael Fish will interpret for
millions of BBC viewers that night.
Weather Watchers has one edge over the opposition. Its forecasters
complement their instruments by telephoning a team of 2,000 volunteer
watchers across Scotland and the north of England for information on
snowfall, temperature and wind direction, enabling them to assemble a
precise local weather picture.
Yet the company has been slipping and skidding on treacherous commercial
ice. Last autumn, it reached its Pounds 20,000 borrowing limit. The bank
forced the original company, Weather Watchers Services, into receivership
and Chaplain lost Pounds 10,000 as a guarantor for the overdraft.
No other buyers came forward so he bought it back for Pounds 4,500, with
another Pounds 2,400 for good will, in effect his own name. It now trades as
plain Weather Watchers. The network of volunteer watchers survives as a
separate charity.
Underlying Weather Watchers's problems is what Chaplain describes as the
'un-level playing field' on which it meets the Met Office.
'No small consultancy can afford the cost of the data provided by a monopoly
supplier, The Met Office, which is also our main competitor.'
Weather Watchers takes much of its data by computer link from the US and
Europe. But it is denied access to data from UK government funded radar
stations, useful for tracking storms. By law Chaplain cannot even know the
deal by which the Scottish Office allows the Met Office access to radar
data. Ironically, The Scottish Office also funds Weather Watchers's road
forecasts. He says the Met Office's price for a year's radar data was a
'prohibitive' Pounds 40,000. 'The radar is paid for by public money. Why
should a competitor get privileged access?'
Weather Watchers offers a special service for businesses. Its forecasters
supply regular, personal weather analysis by telephone. For a small fee a
garden centre, for example, might take the service to determine when to
protect tender plants from frost.
'It is about helping people make the right decision in a finely balanced
weather situation,' said Chaplain. 'Weather-related losses cost the economy
many hundreds of millions. It has taken off in the US, but not yet here.'
Chaplain became interested in the weather at school. He took a theology
degree in the early 1960s, but never entered the ministry. Instead he built
on his first interest and took a course in meteorology. He worked as a
forecaster in Birmingham. The he worked as a teacher and ran a centre for
studying social and economic trends in Leeds before returning to forecasting
in the severe winter of 1981, broadcasting on local radio and TV.
He built his first network of volunteer weather watchers in Yorkshire. When
a local radio station official moved to the BBC in Scotland, he asked
Chaplain to set up a similar network there. Chaplain's big break came in the
bad weather of January 1984, when he used the network to forecast the
progress of blizzards correctly. That initial high media profile launched
the business, at first with BBC support. The BBC soon stopped funding
Weather Watchers in the belief that it would become self supporting.
Weather Watchers Services was set up in 1987, using Manpower Services
Programme labour and grants from local authorities, the Scottish Development
Agency and the tourist board. Over five years those grants have totalled
Pounds 15,000. In 1990 Chaplain and the other trained forecasters turned the
company into a co-operative.
The equipment - computers, softwear, modems and faxes - cost Pounds 26,000.
The house and premises, valued at around Pounds 60,000, were paid for by
Chaplain's mother.
Weather Watchers has built a small clientele which includes The Scotsman,
The Sunday Tribune in Ireland and several other local newspapers, hotels and
highways authorities. A contract with the Scottish Office to monitor certain
high level trunk roads, denting the Met Office's near monopoly of road
weather forecasting, dates back to BBC days.
But progress beyond that has been difficult. An original staff of eight was
progressively cut back as the company failed to achieve the level of trade
it expected. A Pounds 5,000 marketing study, a condition of the loans,
produced no new work. A marketing consultant brought in only one client.
Chaplain employs three forecasters and a secretary, but his Pounds 60,000
worth of business is really only enough to support two full-time employees.
Last winter Chaplain embarked on his biggest gamble, launching a national
0891 telephone forecast across 18 regions in conjunction with Interactive
Media Services, a Leeds-based telephone information specialist, which put up
a Pounds 10,000 loan against future revenue. That money is all used up, but
Chaplain continues to offer a full service at a cost of Pounds 3,000 a
month, subsidising it from his other work, so that any potential sponsors
can monitor it. The commitment is huge - 80 hours of work a week. IMS
managing director Bill Wilson said: 'It's early days yet, but the response
is encouraging.'
Chaplain remains optimistic in adversity. A recent 'cold' mail shot to 125
hotels offering customised weather reports yielded 25 replies. In January he
lost one prestige customer, Scotland on Sunday, when the Met Office undercut
his price, but last month he gained another, the Daily Record, Scotland's
biggest selling daily. In the longer term he still sees potential in an
applied weather forecasting consultancy service. 'The problem is to get
people to see this as an insurance service where they win.'

FT  15 MAY 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Unravelling computer spaghetti -
A company which straightens out old programs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGING the calculations and conditions for insurance policies and the like
may seem a minor matter to decision makers. But for the people who must
incorporate the changes in the tangled spaghetti of company computer
programmes, they can be a headache.
However, a small company has been established to meet this need at the
Mountjoy Research Centre in Durham. The Centre for Software Maintenance
believes it is the only company of its kind in the world.
Its managing director, David Walton, says big financial Organisations went
into information technology early, buying mainframe computers in the 1960s
and writing large volumes of software for them. As time passes, this
software must be changed, possibly to do things for which it was not
designed. These changes are called maintenance.
The maintenance man has to understand the software, among the most complex
structures ever built, to amend it without breaking it. He should then write
notes to explain what he has done, but he may be wanted for another
maintenance job.
After many undocumented changes, the software can become incomprehensible
and impossible to change. An investment of thousands of man-hours has
reached the end of its useful life. Even without such a disaster, the
maintenance work becomes very expensive. In the UK alone, says Walton,
Pounds 2bn a year is spent on this.
Four Durham University staff, with Keith Bennett, professor of computer
science, as chairman, set up CSM in 1988 to do research into this computing
problem, but it soon discovered it could save companies money quite simply
by using existing techniques.
'This is a hype-driven industry,' says Walton. 'It tells people: This new
thing will solve your problem. But a lot of issues are about management
rather than technology.'
Apparently small errors in programming can have devastating effects. One US
airline's program to optimise passenger loading contained a 'greater than'
instead of a 'less than' sign. As a result the airline's aeroplanes carried
fewer passengers than its competitors'.
Errors are especially critical when safety depends on good design and
accurate programming, as in the London ambulance computer system.
Walton says that a good programmer will spot only 30 per cent of his own
errors, which means his work needs to be checked by someone else. 'It is
hard to believe that people are not doing that.'
To guard against errors, computer staff commonly spend a lot of time on
testing, which is expensive and hard to do exhaustively. It is better to
analyse what is going wrong and stop it happening again.
CSM has a staff of 12. Its four shareholders at the university are active as
consultants and Professor Bennett plays a leading part in strategy.
A third of its work is consultancy, and running training seminars for
software specialists. Two-thirds is creating computer tools for simplifying
software, currently for a large computer systems manufacturer and a
government organisation. These tools use mathematical research done at
Oxford and Durham to show how simplified versions of software can do the
same job as the old spaghetti.
CSM is also adapting these tools to other purposes. For example, the US Food
and Drug Administration requires companies to demonstrate that the software
governing the amount of drug in a capsule meets specification. CSM will
analyse the software to demonstrate what it is doing.
In the year to March, CSM had a turnover of Pounds 400,000. 'We have grown
quite rapidly, 45 per cent a year,' says Walton.
CSM has had two SMART awards from the government for its development work.
It has never had any bank borrowing. Walton says it is no good for a small
business in the UK to be in hock to the banks. 'The only way to survive is
to be very conservative.'
Profit - 8 per cent last year - is put back in the business since 'what
counts is long-term ability to do the job well.'
Walton first went to CSM as a marketing consultant and became managing
director last year. Before that he ran his own company making test equipment
for computer software, worked in computer-aided engineering and spent some
time as a full-time pastor at a church in Washington new town in the north
east.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: Echoes of the Raj in a colder climate - The
ubiquitous British bungalow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME PEOPLE like them, others loathe them. Bungalows have been the butt of
more jokes than parrots and vicars, but they are a big part of Britain's
housing stock. The Halifax building society says that The Bungalow remains
the most popular home name in the UK, followed by The Cottage, Rose Cottage,
The Lodge and Hillcrest. It is also top of the pops for new homes, followed
by Orchard House, The Willows and Fairview. Dunroamin' is well down the
list.
The bangolo was the Bengal peasant's tent-like hut; the British Raj copied
the style and added such refinements as the veranda for greeting guests and
taking tiffin. Back in Britain, many a colonel built a replica of his
bangolo, facing north to avoid the heat of the midday sun - even in
Scotland.
The very word 'bungalow' raises a condescending smile in some company; in
Wales, Dai Bungalow is a term for someone of low intelligence (because he
does not have a lot upstairs). But a seaside or country bungalow in East
Anglia remains the dream for many east Londoners.
Bennett Homes, of Lakenheath in Suffolk, has cornered the market, having
built more than 5,000 of them since 1947. Its chairman, Nigel Parker is the
modern equivalent of the Victorian builder RA Briggs, who became known as
'Bungalow' Briggs; plans of those Victorian buildings show a sophisticated
level of development with cavity walls, wall ties and damp-proofing.
Briggs tempted city dwellers to buy his buildings in the country 'to escape
the grime, bustle and hurry.' He wrote of them: 'A cottage is a little house
in the country but a bungalow is a little country house, a homely place,
with verandas and balconies, the plan so arranged as to ensure complete
comfort with a feeling of rusticity.' Even then, though, the bungalow had
its opponents: one writer believed they stood for 'all that is vile and
contemptible.'
Briggs' designs came at a time of change in rural Britain. Town dwellers
with surplus capital often saw a bungalow as a pleasant investment. The
little buildings gained notoriety among contemporary gossip writers, such
were the (supposed) 'goings-on' behind the French windows. Bungalow building
boomed after the first world war, peaking late in the 1920s, and they remain
popular with many. But, where land is scarce, builders often are reluctant
to construct them: a bungalow really needs a fifth of an acre plot, whereas
a two-storey house can make do with much less.
Land prices in parts of East Anglia allow Bennett the space. The firm has 14
basic designs, each adaptable to individual needs; and although they look
similar from the street, they are bespoke homes within. Bennett, however, is
no sleepy rural builder tucked away in the Suffolk countryside. Its
marketing strategy has won many awards for initiative, not least a 'lend a
home' scheme that enables buyers, for just Pounds 35 a month, to move in
immediately while their own bungalow is built. Potential customers have
travelling costs reimbursed when they visit the firm.
With 6m people in Britain aged between 55 and 65, and more than 50 per cent
of older people owning their home, other builders could do worse than crib
some of Bennett's ideas. Its marketing is aimed at the active over-55s but
its designs also catch the eye of younger buyers, even first-timers. Prices
start at around Pounds 65,000. Its latest development is at Holt, close to
the north Norfolk coast. This little town, not far from Cley (pronounced
Clie) and only nine miles from Cromer, is an anachronism where it is
possible to arrive by steam train and be met by horse-drawn carriage. And
there are proper shops, with friendly staff actually serving the customers.
Not that Bennett has a monopoly on bungalows. Anglia Secure Homes is a
retirement specialist and sales director Ruth Rivers says: 'Many buyers want
to retain a 'house' lifestyle without the problems of stairs and big gardens
but with the extra security of a retirement development. Before designing a
development, we study the local vernacular architecture; if bungalows are a
popular house type there, we are pleased to build them as they provide
variety of choice.'
Among the bungalows on Anglia's books are two-bedroom units at Ashdene
Gardens in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, priced from Pounds 70,950; and others
at Harrison Court, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, at Pounds 83,000.
Crest Homes, in the Midlands, says its semi-detached bungalows in mixed
developments are proving especially popular at present and sales manager
Maureen Haywood reports signs of greater movement in the housing market.
Bungalows in culs-de-sac in the Whitwick area are appealing to older people
moving from homes that were too large for them and which lacked modern
amenities, she says. As with many builders, Crest is offering a
part-exchange scheme, buying in the existing home. Prices of the bungalows
start at Pounds 52,950.
So, the much-maligned bungalow is alive and well. Briggs was right, after
all . . .

FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: The jewel next door to the West End - Once,
Regent's Park had more peasants than crescents. Things have changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FAITH GLASGOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY WOULD count Regent's Park as the jewel in London's rich crown of
parkland. But it is more than just space and greenery; the necklace of
creamy, neo-classical terraces which edge it was designed by John Nash as an
integral part of the whole. The area was mostly farmland leased from the
Crown - more peasants than crescents - when the Prince Regent and Nash, his
favourite architect, decided to develop it in 1811. The ambitious plan was
for a 'garden city' stretching all the way down Regent Street to St James's
Park; but only the terraces and a handful of the 56 villas planned for
Regent's Park had been built when it was opened to the public in 1835.
Today, property in and around the park, next door to the West End, is among
the most sought-after in London; a modest two-bed flat will set you back
Pounds 250,000. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has a three-bedroom flat in Cumberland
Terrace (which, unlike the other terraces, contains only apartments) for
Pounds 400,000. At the other end of the scale, this is where you will find
the most expensive house ever sold in London. The Holme, which lies beside
the boating lake and includes four acres of land and a nine-car garage,
fetched Pounds 25m in spring 1991.
This, however, was something of an exception. Neil Gilchrist, of estate
agent Lassmans (who handled the sale of The Holme), says since the end of
1990 the market has, by and large, been 'completely dead.' He explains: 'Our
biggest problem until recently has been the lack of overseas buyers because
of the weak dollar. As a consequence, prices have fallen at least 25 per
cent. It has taken this long for them to come down to sensible levels
because a lot of owners were just not prepared to drop their prices at
first.'
For some, though, the bleak scenario has involved more than a price drop.
Lassmans has on its books a Grade I-listed house in Hanover Terrace, on the
west side of the park, which was repossessed from the previous owners. They
paid Pounds 1.9m in 1988; it is now on offer at Pounds 1.35m complete with
four double, en-suite bedrooms; numerous living rooms; a staff suite; sauna;
60ft garden, and a mews house.
Admittedly, it lacks niceties such as a kitchen: that was ripped out and
sold before the eviction. Gilchrist estimates the new owner will have to
spend Pounds 200,000 to restore the property. 'This hasn't the cachet of,
say, Eaton Square (in Belgravia),' he says, 'but then, it would cost about
Pounds 4.5m there. This is really good value now.' Meanwhile, Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley has a similar house next door (but with some fitments) for around
Pounds 1.475m.
Unlike much of the property around the park, the 20 houses of Hanover
Terrace have private gardens. But Chester Terrace, on the eastern side, has
communal gardens instead and Gilchrist describes it as 'secure and popular.'
Lassmans is selling numbers 34 and 41 at Pounds 1.35m and Pounds 1.4m
respectively; for that, you are looking at recently refurbished five-bedroom
houses with staff accommodation in the basement and great views.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has one of Nash's few villas for sale. Nash House,
which he is thought to have built for his own use, is a pretty, Grade I
property in Chester Terrace for which the agent is asking Pounds 1.55m -
Pounds 200,000 less than when it first came on the market in May 1992. But
it is not necessary to move into the million-plus league for a house in
Regent's Park. If you are prepared to sacrifice the view, you could pay less
than Pounds 1m for 5 Chester Terrace, just round the corner. And for smaller
houses such as 8 Chester Place - which still contains five bedrooms and is
also on Lassmans' books - the asking price falls to a mere Pounds 600,000.
Although it was the prolific Nash whose work established Regent's Park as
the cutting edge of architectural design in its day, he did not monopolise
the area entirely. St Katherine's Precinct by the Danish Church, which was
built as an ancient charitable foundation, was designed by Ambrose Poynter,
a student of Nash but no fan of his (indeed, they hated each other). The
precinct's collegiate Gothic style cocks a hefty snook at Nash's classical
facades, pillars and statues. One six-bedroomed house there, modernised
fully and with a 60 ft garden, has come onto Savills' books recently at
Pounds 1.275m. Another, with Lassmans, needs around Pounds 250,000 spent on
it but compensates with an asking price of Pounds 450,000.
In a late-'80s neo-classical extravaganza, Ouinlan Terry designed three
showpiece villas. The Ionic Villa sold in a couple of months two years ago,
but number two, the Veneto Villa, has been on the market for well over a
year at Pounds 6.75m, complete with every conceivable mod con and Palladian
flourish. Poynter would turn in his grave.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Glimmerings of a golden future -
Diary of a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson takes a modest plunge
</HEADLINE>

THE LEAFLET fluttered out of the free newspaper. A 'long-established family
jeweller' would be visiting an hotel near my home. It offered an 'expert and
discreet service' and was keen to buy gold, silver and antiques - including
'large or small quantities of scrap gold or silver.' The leaflet added:
'Foreign and un-hallmarked gold and silver tested immediately.'
So, I went to the hotel. I expected to find a small queue of people, drawn
by the offer of confidentiality and the recent rise in the price of gold.
After all, many retired people in the area, with modest fixed pensions, have
been used to living off the interest from their bank and building society
deposits. With comparatively low interest rates, would some now be forced to
sell some of their heirlooms, including gold and silver items?
The hotel was quiet and there was no queue; indeed, I was the only visitor
although, admittedly, I had arrived at 3.30 pm and the jeweller was due to
depart at 4. I found him wrapping one of his antique purchases. He did not
appear to have been very busy.
I produced a small gold bar: one tael (1.203 ounces) of fine gold, stamped
with the seal of the Hang Seng bank, which had been given to me some years
before. Since the gold price for the previous day had been Pounds 224.47 an
ounce, I thought my bar would be worth around Pounds 270.
The jeweller took it, produced a pair of electronic scales and weighed it.
Then he scrutinised it through an eye glass. 'Just one moment,' he said.
'I'll have to check the price.' He left the room.
On his return, he told me: 'I can give you Pounds 230 for it. The price of
gold will go down tomorrow.'
Looking at my disappointed face, he added: 'Well, maybe you would like to
think about it. I'm back here again next week.'
I thanked him, took my bar and departed. The next day, I checked the paper
for the gold price. It turned out that the morning 'fix' before I saw the
jeweller had been Pounds 224.823 but the afternoon price was up, at Pounds
226.343.
I thought a dealer spread of more than 14 per cent was a bit much, although
I appreciated that he probably would had had to sell the bar to another
dealer who would have taken a profit as well. Compared with 'mark-ups' on
ordinary goods sold in shops, I suppose it ought to have been considered a
good deal. But I then 'phoned Spink and Son in London.
One of its dealers offered me 95 per cent of the spot gold price if I
brought in the bar for examination. The dealer said that because Spink had a
high turnover in gold bullion and coins, it could afford to work on smaller
margins.
I asked if I could get an even better deal if I had a number of gold bars
instead of just one. The dealer replied: 'If you walked in with a couple of
kilo bars, we would try to get closer to the spot price.'
In fact, I do have a number of gold bars although, unfortunately, each of
them weighs one tael rather than a kilo. I bought most of them in Hong Kong
in 1985 and they have been in a bank vault ever since.
With all the recent publicity about gold purchases by George Soros, the
influential financial speculator, and the subsequent jump in its price, one
might imagine that my bars have proved a very profitable investment. In
fact, the reverse is true.
In spite of the recent price rise, gold has still not quite reached the
price I paid in 1985. And, of course, this investment pays no interest and
no dividends. Compared with what I could have earned from cash on deposit or
from shares, my gold has been a very poor performer.
'But,' say the pundits, 'if George Soros buys gold, it must be a good
investment. Look how much he made last September by correctly judging the
currency markets and seeing that the pound would, effectively, be devalued.'
But Soros is also the first to admit that he did not escape the effects of
the 1987 stock market crash. No one can be right all the time.
Also, it appears to me that Soros is more of a 'dealer' than a long-term
holder. There is nothing wrong with that, but it does concentrate one's mind
on a rapid exit route should Soros decide suddenly to sell.
So, I am keeping my gold for the time being. Not because of Soros, but
because of what appears to be an increasingly unsettled world. I also tend
to share some of the views of Sir James Goldsmith about certain western
economies and their approaches to monetary problems.
Most of all, though, what makes me at least a short-term holder of gold is
the increasing demand for this precious metal in the Far East.
For one thing, Japan is likely to issue numerous gold coins to commemorate
the wedding of Crown Prince Naruhito. And the Chinese have long had a
respect for gold; demand from them is likely to rise substantially as the
numbers of entrepreneurs increase.
There are also rumours that the former Soviet Union countries no longer have
stockpiles of gold and that their mines are working at reduced capacity.
With corruption rife, almost anything could happen.
Gold remains a rare commodity. Because it is so dense, its weight is
surprising: it has been claimed that all the gold ever mined (around 110,000
tonnes) could still fit into a five-bedroom detached house.
As well as being used in jewellery and dentistry and as a useful,
easily-portable international 'store of value,' gold also has uses in
electronics. So, I expect demand for it in the short term to remain high.
While this does not mean I am rushing out to buy more of it, I have
increased my personal pension fund's holding in Lonrho.
As I mentioned in my article on May 1, I decided to take another look at
that company in the light of its sale of the Observer newspaper, and its 45
per cent stake in Ghana's huge Ashanti gold mine. On May 4, I took the
plunge and bought more Lonrho shares, paying Pounds 1 each.
According to Lonrho's annual report, the Ashanti mine 'remains on target to
produce 1m ozs' of gold by 1995-96 - up from 654,000 ozs in 1992. The
company also has important gold production interests in Zimbabwe.
I hope, therefore, that my investment in Lonrho will also have a golden
future.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Titon executives sell 1m shares -
Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETWEEN FEBRUARY and June 1991, three directors of Titon Holdings, the
building materials group, bought shares at prices between 48p and 66p.
Since then, the price has risen steadily and is up more than 60 per cent
relative to the FT All Share index over the past year.
On the day the company announced its final results, along with a bullish
statement about prospects, executive directors sold a total of 1.01m shares
at 208p.
According to the chairman, these sales were made to satisfy demand for the
stock from institutions.
Sir Harry Solomon, now a non-executive director of Hillsdown Holdings, the
food manufacturing group, bought 250,000 shares at 80.5p in September last
year, along with Sir John Nott, the chairman, and John Jackson, the deputy
chairman.
Sir Harry has now sold 1m at 161p to reduce his holding to about 4.3m. At
the same time, Ray Mackie, the recently appointed finance director, bought
25,000 at 155p.
JD Wetherspoon came to the market in October last year at 160p. Since then,
the price has outperformed the market by 59 per cent and Anthony Lowrie, one
of the company's non-executive directors, has sold 100,000 shares at 279p,
reducing his holding to 991,054.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: BES investors face threat to tax
relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 55,000 investors in loan-back business expansion schemes stand to
lose tax relief if proposals for an amendment to the Finance Bill are
enacted.
Michael Stern, Conservative MP for Bristol North West, proposed this week
that an investor in a BES where shares were issued after December 31 1992
should lose relief on a loan taken up after June 30 this year. 'This would
be retrospective legislation of the worst possible kind,' said John Spiers,
of BESt Investment. 'It would be devastating.'
Loan-back schemes allowed investors an exit from their investments after six
months and were introduced in September to attract more investment. The
majority of business expansion schemes issued this year have been loan-back,
and Spiers estimates Pounds 556m has been raised by some 55,000 investors
since the beginning of January. They get tax relief at their highest
marginal rate, and loan-back schemes depend on this relief in order to work.
By offering these loans after six months - typically, of 75p for every
Pounds 1 invested - banks and building societies gained cheap finance.
Top-rate taxpayers benefited since, effectively, they invested only 60p for
every Pounds 1 received by the institutions.
Schemes where shares were issued after midnight on March 15 were abolished
by the chancellor in the Budget. But Stern's proposal would make loans on
all the BES companies launched in the busiest period of the year - from
January until the chancellor's Budget deadline - ineligible for tax relief.
Mavis Seymour, BES tax specialist at accountants Stoy Hayward, said: 'People
who applied for shares did so because they thought there would be no loss of
BES tax relief if the loan was taken. Someone who invested their redundancy
money would have had every reason to suppose that the law would not change.'
Stern has also proposed another change which would make loans received in
these schemes liable to capital gains tax, and BES sponsors this week
expressed surprise and alarm at the proposed amendments.
'We are all very concerned about it,' said Tim Heaton, business development
manager of Close Brothers, the second-largest sponsor of loan-back schemes.
'Stern is trying to put the kybosh into these schemes even more than was
originally envisaged.' Ross Macdonald, partner at Neill Clark, added: 'I'm
totally against Stern's proposals because investors invested on the basis of
the law as it stood. It would be disappointing - to put it mildly - if this
went through.'
Stern's proposals, if selected for debate, would not be discussed for
several weeks and the Finance Bill is not expected to be enacted before the
end of July.
Meanwhile, National Westminster bank and BZW, the securities arm of Barclays
bank, are expected to take the Inland Revenue to court over the tax status
of the loan-back BES companies which they launched before the Budget. The
Revenue said recently it did not accept that shares in them had been issued
in time to beat Norman Lamont's deadline of midnight before the Budget.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: Belgravia: simply the best in town - Mayfair
is on the way back but its neighbour remains the capital's top residential
area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Lord Owen, Britain's former foreign secretary, moved to Narrow Street
in Wapping more than 20 years ago, living east of the Tower of London
suddenly looked trendy. Since then, and especially over the past decade,
vast sums have been poured into developing Docklands and the media has been
full of seductive advertisements and brochures from developers. But the
reality is that Docklands remains a place for the future - a far better bet
than it was but needing another 10 years at least.
If Docklands is not yet 'in,' where is? The simple answer is that money
talks, even though its owners usually prefer to remain silent. They spend
their cash on property in the best residential areas of London (often, in
the most discreet streets) where there are gracious houses, or seemingly
modest ones, with garages if possible and, almost certainly, gardens. If
they prefer to live in flats they want a good location, quality, service
and, above all, security.
Some people think the Monopoly board shows the best addresses in London; and
it is true that Mayfair is on its way back to the top spot now that planners
require so many fine buildings, used as 'temporary' offices for the past 50
years, to revert to residential use. But the leading residential area in
London continues to be Mayfair's neighbour, Belgravia.
Its 200 acres are owned by the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor estate (which
also controls the best 100 acres of Mayfair). The properties are leasehold,
a system being changed by the government through its Housing and Urban
Development Bill, which allows tenants to acquire the freeholds.
Indeed, most of the best residential areas in London remain - for the moment
 -leasehold. Apart from Mayfair and Belgravia, these include the Cadogan and
Sloane-Stanley estates in Chelsea; Smith's Charity in South Kensington; the
Ilchester estate in Holland Park; the Eyre estate in St John's Wood; the
Howard de Walden estate around Harley Street and Portland Place; the Portman
estate around Portman Square; the Church Commissioners' estates north of
Hyde Park; and Eton College's estate in Swiss Cottage. The Crown estate's
leasehold properties in Regent's Park, Kensington, St James's, Millbank and
Hackney are excluded from the bill.
For those wanting to live in Mayfair, the entry price is surprisingly low.
Egerton (tel: 071-493-0676) has two-bedroom flats for sale at less than
Pounds 200,000, but service charges can be Pounds 3,500 a year. Larger flats
needing modernisation cost up to Pounds 475,000.
Wetherell (071-493-6935) is offering newly-refurbished flats in Upper
Grosvenor Street, opposite the US Embassy, at between Pounds 795,000 and
Pounds 1.1m. On the BP pension fund's 20-acre Mayfair estate, reconstructed
flats in Hill Street are being sold by Debenham Tewson Residential
(071-408-1161) from Pounds 320,000, and new houses in Hays Mews from Pounds
390,000.
Anyone who doubts that Belgravia is London's top address should note that
this is where a two-bedroom penthouse in Belgrave Square can be rented
through Humberts Majendie (071-223-0433) for Pounds 1,200 a week  - more
than Pounds 60,000 a year, which does not include council tax.
Belgravia is where property developer Elliott Bernerd bought the Eaton
Square flat where the Duke of Westminster lived, combined it with the Duke
of Roxburghe's flat next door to create one of London's largest apartments
(more than 8,000 sq ft), and sold it last year to Middle East businessman
Wafic Said for about Pounds 9m despite the Grosvenor estate lease having
only 20 years left, an annual ground rent of Pounds 5,000, and service
charges of more than Pounds 30,000 a year.
All but six of the grand houses in Eaton Square have been converted into
expensive flats. One of the houses, on the south side, was bought two years
ago by composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber for Pounds 10.5m.
Elsewhere in Belgravia, houses in Chester Square or Wilton Crescent can
command up to Pounds 4.5m - the price paid last year for one in Wilton
Crescent that was reconstructed and given air-conditioning and a lift. A
house three doors away is for sale at Pounds 3.25m through WA Ellis
(071-581-7654) and Cordle (071-351-0223). An unmodernised house offered for
Pounds 2m through Aylesford (071-351-2383) has the extra advantage of having
a mews cottage with a double garage at the back in Kinnerton Street.
In Cadogan Lane, where the Grosvenor estate meets the Cadogan estate, Wilson
Mordant (071-235-0906) is seeking Pounds 4.5m for a new, six-bedroom
property designed by Michael Brown Associates on the site of the house in
which actress Judy Garland died. This re-interprets the classical style of
Belgravia in a modern way and has an indoor swimming pool, a lift and an
elaborate security system - but no garage. It is also freehold, rare in this
area up to now.
Elsewhere on the Cadogan estate, Pounds 4.85m is being sought by Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley (071-824-8171) for one of the large houses in Cadogan Place;
it has air-conditioning, a lift, a double garage, and a lease with 54 years
left.
After Mayfair and Belgravia and Chelsea, the next prime address is Holland
Park - the street, not the area - where the houses are freehold. Richard
Branson owns two adjoining houses there and the Kensington office of Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley (071-938-4311) has two nearby houses for sale: one at Pounds
6.75m, the other Pounds 3.85m.
On the Phillimore estate in Campden Hill, WA Ellis has a leasehold house at
Pounds 2.5m, John D. Wood &amp; Co (071-727-0705) another one at Pounds 2.45m,
and Lassmans (071-499-3434) a third for Pounds 1.45m.
The redevelopment by Taylor Woodrow and Mitsui Kensetsu of the nine-acre
site of St Mary Abbots hospital in Marloes Road, Kensington, is becoming
recognised as one of the best addresses in London because of the quality of
the new buildings, the ample parking and the high security.
Now called Kensington Green, there are flats with 999-year leases from
Pounds 180,000 up to penthouses at Pounds 990,000, and freehold houses from
Pounds 550,000 to Pounds 1.6m. Of the first phase of 114 properties, 60 have
been sold and 23 let. There is a sales office on the site (071-938-3350).
Two years ago, Regalian Properties developed 20 luxury flats on Crown estate
land at 3a Palace Green, opposite Kensington palace; but with prices from
Pounds 2m to Pounds 13.5m, buyers were conspicuous by their absence. Since
prices were halved recently, nine flats have been sold and the rest are for
sale through Savills (071-499-8644) and Hamptons (071-493-8222) at figures
from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 5.575m. Regalian's chairman, David Goldstone,
insists that 3a Palace Green is not just the finest address in London - but
in the world.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Working women who lose out - A
simple adjustment to NI contributions can make the difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST under 500,000 working women face a reduced income in retirement because
they have no right to a basic state pension in their own name. Instead, they
will join the ranks of the 1.5m women who are forced to rely on their
husbands' National Insurance record to claim a proportion of the pension.
Even this can be lost if the woman changes her marital status.
Yet, these women could improve their pension prospects by making a simple
adjustment to their NI contribution arrangements. In some cases, the
adjustment could even boost take-home pay.
NI is a form of tax on earnings and is levied by the government to fund a
range of benefits including pensions and sickness and disability payments.
Most employees pay full-rate contributions but about 460,000 working women
pay a reduced rate known commonly as 'the married woman's stamp.'
This is an anachronism left over from a more paternalistic era when it was
assumed automatically that women would be provided-for in retirement by
their husbands' company and state pensions. Under the old rules, women who
were married or widowed before April 5 1977 could elect to pay the reduced
rate but all who started work after that date have had to pay the full rate.
The married woman's stamp was popular originally because it meant a much
lower deduction from the weekly or monthly pay cheque. But, in return, these
women forfeited the right to a basic and earnings-related state pension in
their own names. Instead, they claim what the department of social security
(DSS) calls a 'category B' pension, which is worth 60 per cent of the
spouse's basic state pension.
Before October 1989, there were still significant savings for most women who
paid reduced-rate contributions. That year, however, the DSS restructured
the NI rate bands. Since then, many women could have switched to the full
rate for little or no extra cost and, at the same time, they would have
started to build up a claim to the state pensions.
In fact, as the table shows, women who earn less than Pounds 76 a week will
actually pay less under the full rate than they do at present under the
'reduced' rate. Those earning more than Pounds 76 a week should seek advice
from the DSS to find out if the benefits they will earn under the full rate
before retirement will more than compensate for the higher contribution
costs involved.
The decision for higher earners is less clear because of the complicated way
in which an individual's entitlement to a state pension is calculated. The
DSS is reluctant to give an estimate of pension rights without full details
of age, sex, employment history and other factors but, generally, it takes
about 40-44 years to earn the full basic state pension (which is worth
Pounds 56.10 a week for the 1993/94 tax year).
If you pay contributions for a shorter period, your pension is reduced
accordingly. As a rule of thumb, you need at least 10 years' full-rate
contributions to qualify for the smallest proportion of the state pension,
at present worth Pounds 14 a week.
Under present proposals, it is almost certain that the government will raise
the female state pension age from 60 to the male age of 65. But the change
will be phased in, and will not affect woman over 50. This means that they
will not be able to achieve the minimum contribution period for the lowest
proportion of the basic state pension.
They will, however, earn a right to a state earnings-related pension
(Serps), since credits for this build up from day one. Serps is worth
between 20-25 per cent of 'band' earnings - that is, earnings between the
lower and upper threshold for NI. For the present tax year, this means
earnings between Pounds 56 and Pounds 420. Depending on when a person
retires, the Serps pension will be based either on their best 20 years of
earnings or on average earnings over their entire career.
If a woman takes no action to build up a basic state pension in her own
right (a category A pension), she will qualify for a category B or spouse's
pension under her husband's NI record. Assuming he has a full track record,
the category B pension will be worth 60 per cent of the full basic state
pension - that is, Pounds 33.66 a week for the present tax year.
The category B pension does not become payable until the husband reaches 65,
whereas a state pension earned in a woman's own name would be payable from
age 60. When the husband reaches age 65 the woman will receive the higher of
the category A or B pensions but, unfortunately, not both.
Married women and widows who pay NI contributions at the reduced rate will
have a valid certificate, in most cases held by their employer. This will
bear a reference: either CF383, which is a certificate of election to pay
the reduced rate, or CF380A, which is a certificate of reduced liability.
To make the switch to the full rate, they should contact their local DSS,
ask for form CF9, and return it together with their CF383 or CF380A
certificate. But they should check their facts carefully to make sure they
will benefit from the switch since, once they have made it, they cannot
revert back to the reduced rate.
Those who wish to continue paying the reduced stamp should bear in mind that
this right is lost if they spend more than two consecutive years out of
employment. Moreover, the right is withdrawn if their marriage ends in
divorce or annulment, although widows who remarry can continue to pay the
married woman's stamp.
Since 1978, women who have had a career break to raise a family or look
after an elderly relative have been able to claim Home Responsibilities
Protection (HRP). This provides credits towards the basic state pension but
does not build up a right to Serps.
For a full explanation of your state pension prospects, ask for pension form
BR19 at your local DSS.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: It pays to be choosy - Investment
Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   INVESTMENT trusts are good for you
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
at least, nearly everyone says they are - but which one should you choose?
Our series* on the sector, which ended last week, profiled some of the
leading names. The rationale was that while many articles have been written
about investment trusts in general, far fewer have described the activities
of individual trusts.
Looking at the press clippings, it was surprising to find how limited was
the coverage of many trusts with market capitalisations of several hundred
million pounds. Some had not been the subject of an extended article for
five years.
The trusts themselves do not make it very easy for the beginner investor.
Many have names which reflect their 19th century roots - such as Scottish
Mortgage - and which bear little relation to their present areas of
investment.
The more information an investor can be given, the better. The Association
of Investment Trust Companies has done a good job in this respect in recent
years (and it was sad to note the death this week of Philip Chappell, one of
the main driving forces behind the AITC). Some individual management groups
have also produced very clear guides to their trusts.
In all, the series covered 17 trusts, ranging from the largest, Foreign &amp;
Colonial, to Pantheon International with a market capitalisation of just
over Pounds 21m. And, having met such a wide range of managers, my
over-riding impression was that they offer a highly professional service at
a relatively low cost.
To take the extreme: investors in the Alliance trust can hire the expertise
of those who run it for a fee of just 0.2 per cent of the total assets. Fees
can, of course, be higher than that in the specialist sector; nevertheless,
most trusts represent a very cheap way for investor to get a spread of
equities, especially via the savings scheme.
Performance, of course, is more important than charges in the long run
(although the latter can have a significant impact on the former). Looking
at the table, the range of returns over five years varied from Bankers, with
a gain of 148.9 per cent, to Throgmorton, with a loss of 4.9 per cent. But
even investors most wedded to the building societies can see that many
investment trusts have offered returns far higher than those available on
the most attractive 90-day account.
There is nothing to say that in the next five years results will be similar,
or, indeed, that Throgmorton might not outperform Bankers. Part of the
return from some of the trusts in the table comes from a narrowing of the
discount on which the shares have traded. Since many trusts' shares are now
trading at asset value (or even at premiums), such a factor cannot be
repeated. Discounts could widen once more.
Looking back over the range of trusts covered in the series, I would select
a few for particular consideration by investors. Foreign &amp; Colonial and the
Alliance trusts are old-established, well-managed companies with low costs
and excellent records. Bankers has an even better record in recent years and
a manager, Michael Moule, who has proved his skill at several different
trusts.
For those willing to take extra risk, the venture capital trusts covered
(Electra and Pantheon) may prosper from a combination of economic recovery
and a narrowing of the discounts. Two trusts, Fleming Claverhouse and TR
City of London, would be worth considering if their shares were not trading
at a premium to net assets. It makes little sense to pay 105p for assets of
100p when shares in other well-managed trusts are available at a discount.
But Fleming Claverhouse launched a share issue this week, which could reduce
this problem.
Plenty of good trusts were not covered in the series, and a stockbroker or
good independent adviser should be able to guide you through the maze. For
those who like to do their own research, trusts marked with the 'ace of
clubs' sign on the FT's London Share Service pages will provide free annual
reports by ringing 081-643-7181. Callers will need to state the code number
which appears every day at the end of the FT's share listings.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: A penthouse - for one-third of the price -
Having fallen by up to two-thirds, prices are now rising - but not as fast
as vendors with negative equity would hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM ONE of the two penthouses in 25 Jermyn Street, next to the department
store Simpsons in the heart of London's West End, there are splendid views
over Piccadilly, across Regent Street and on to Soho. So I was not surprised
when Kevin Ryan, of Mayfair agent Egerton, said it had been sold. The
surprise was the price: Pounds 295,000. Why? Because, during the property
boom, the same penthouse was on the market at Pounds 900,000.
When the developer, Michael Salliss Group, went into receivership, it had
sold only 15 of the 35 refurbished flats in this Grade II-listed Edwardian
building above the National Westminster Bank. One was the show flat, at
Pounds 600,000. But two buyers were repossessed, one of them committing
suicide. A year ago, the receiver appointed Egerton (tel. 071-493 0676) and
Horne &amp; Sons (071-499 9344) as joint agents to sell the remaining 20. They
priced the penthouses at Pounds 395,000 each; now, despite having taken
Pounds 100,000 off, one remains on offer. The prices of the other flats,
which are studios or one-bedroom apartments, were also cut by 25 per cent
and now range from Pounds 95,000-Pounds 175,000. Only five remain, but two
have no view at all.
While these prices show greater reductions than most in London, property
prices in the capital rose so high in the 1980s' boom that they had a long
way to fall. In fact, they fell further than anywhere in the UK except East
Anglia, where average prices almost trebled between 1983 and their peak at
the start of 1989, since when they have fallen 35 per cent.
In Greater London, prices fell by an average 32 per cent from their peak to
the end of last year, according to the Nationwide building society (although
the Halifax, Britain's leading mortgage lender, claims the figure is only 23
per cent).
Since then, the market generally has shown signs of improvement, although
there is no consensus about this. The Nationwide says prices in Greater
London rose by 2.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year, but the
Halifax says that they fell a further 2.4 per cent. In the prime central
London market, however, prices rose by 1.8 per cent in the first quarter,
according to Yolande Barnes, head of residential research at West End agent
Savills International (which, for good measure, puts the total fall in
prices at 26.9 per cent from their 1989 peak).
House prices dropped less than flats, with the greatest reductions being in
the highest-priced developments in central London or in peripheral areas of
the capital where flat prices continued to drop in the first three months of
this year, especially for apartments in converted houses.
A survey by London's largest independent agency network, Winkworth, shows
that flat prices have fallen most in Streatham, Notting Hill, Shepherds
Bush, Tooting and Catford. John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at stockbroker
UBS, says the typical 1980s' conversions of older houses to produce
bed-sitters and one-bedroom flats for yuppie first-time buyers could now be
almost unsaleable.
Savills believes that the worst is over in central London, where prices of
new houses fell by less than second-hand ones. The greatest recovery this
year has been in higher-priced houses in areas like Mayfair, Belgravia,
Kensington and Chelsea. And interest is reviving in Docklands, where the
Bank of China has bought 48 flats in The Anchorage, at Sufferance Wharf on
the Isle of Dogs, from the receiver of the Rosehaugh group
Meanwhile, a British company, Barratt Developments (071-231-2628), has begun
work on 275 new houses and flats at Sovereign View in Rotherhithe, with
prices starting at Pounds 65,000; and Fairview New Homes (081-366-1271) has
bought 2.4 acres of land at Timber Wharves, on the Isle of Dogs, for starter
homes at prices from about Pounds 39,000 for one-bedroom flats. Many
properties in Docklands are still being offered by the receivers of
over-ambitious developers or owners with negative equity.
Most property people say that the recovery of the market dates from
September 1992 when Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism; this
made property 15 per cent cheaper for the overseas buyers who form 30 per
cent of the market for prime properties in central London.
Although it was December before this made itself felt in the market, Mayfair
agent Anthony Lassman points out that by then 'the strength of the US dollar
and the fall in UK house prices represented in real terms a discount of 50
per cent on price levels achieved at the height of the boom.' No wonder
properties began to be snapped up.
The National House-Building Council operates an index which projects the
ability of first-time buyers to acquire property. When the base lending rate
was cut to 6 per cent a few weeks ago, the index hit an all-time high of
112, indicating that property had become cheaper than at any time since
1975. The result was that viewings increased, offers were made and mortgage
applications soared.
Even now, though, there is no unanimity on the recovery. A few weeks ago,
Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, told a committee of
MPs: 'The recession is probably over.' And the National Association of
Estate Agents says that the first quarter was the most encouraging time in
the property market for three years. But South Kensington agent Patricia
Farley cautions: 'While there is no doubt that things are better than this
time last year, that does not say much.'
Andrew Langton, of Aylesford, is more cynical: 'The London market has been
brought to its knees over the past seven years and I don't see any signs of
recovery.' On the other hand, Wilson &amp; Wilson, an agency that acts for
buyers, says: 'All the evidence suggests prices in prime residential areas
have bottomed out. This is very much a market for opportunists.'
All agents agree that there is a shortage of activity. But perhaps the most
reliable indicator of the apparent up-turn is that agents are opening new
offices again. Winkworth, which closed five in the recession, is launching
two - in Dulwich and Ealing - at the end of May and Barnard Marcus is
opening in Holland Park in June.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE moved to Germany to work on a self-employed basis for an indefinite
period. Should I continue to pay Class 3 voluntary contributions or would it
be more beneficial to invest this money myself?
The decision will turn on how long you expect to remain outside the UK. If
you continue working in Germany, it is probable that you will in due course
be required to start contributing to the German social security system. In
the interim period, payment of Class 3 contributions will keep the door open
for return to the UK system. We suggest that you write, setting out your
position and quoting your National Insurance number, to: Department of
Social Security, Overseas Branch, Longbenton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE98 1YX.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Can I auction pension fund?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UPON LEAVING my previous employer, I transferred my pension into a lump sum
bond with a life assurance office. This is invested in unit trusts and will
provide a lump sum plus a pension for me at age-50. The sum held in units is
Pounds 60,000. Can this kind of fund be auctioned? If so, how would I go
about it? I am now 44 and recently lost my job. I would like to use any
money realised at auction to go into business.
Retirement annuity policies, unlike ordinary life policies, are not
assignable (an Inland Revenue requirement) and benefits can be taken only in
the approved form by the person who has enjoyed the expense relief on his or
her contributions.
If you wish to raise some capital to start a business, you should ask the
insurance company whether it is prepared to make you a loan. Over the years,
a number of insurance companies have been prepared to offer loan facilities
to their pension policy-holders up to the amount that they reasonably expect
to be repaid out of the tax-free lump sum which can be taken at retirement
(and which, therefore, provides a guarantee that the loan will be repaid).

FT  15 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Piano men hit wrong chord
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING the death of my eldest brother, my surviving brother was appointed
executor of the estate and decided to dispose of some furniture, starting
with the piano. A professional piano restorer paid cash and took it away.
In moving it he and his helper apparently scraped the common stairway wall
in several places. The building's management company sent a bill for repairs
to the solicitors administering the will and estate, who assigned Pounds 500
to cover repair costs.
I suggested to the solicitors that the restorer was to blame and should pay.
After some correspondence, including threat of legal action, the restorer
agreed to pay half. In law, who should be held responsible for repairing the
damage? These events took place in Scotland.
It is clear that the executors of your brother's estate have a right of
relief against the restorer and his helper. The management company is
seeking full payment from the executors, but the executors can in law seek
full reimbursement from the perpetrator of the damage if they can prove the
removal was negligent.
The executors might not wish to incur the legal costs in trying to recover
the remaining 50 per cent but, from the facts given, it would appear likely
that they have grounds to do so.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Revenue squeeze on pension plan
abuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH tax authorities are taking a hard look at what goes into and out of
pension schemes - particularly the small, self-administered type which
caters for the retirement future of top executives.
Robert Lusk, controller of the Inland Revenue's pension schemes office (PSO)
told the National Association of Pension Funds this week that the PSO aimed
to audit an additional 2,000 schemes this year. In addition, it would expand
its audits beyond the small, self-administered schemes (SSASs) - which
account for the majority of tax abuses - into slightly larger ones.
In January 1991, the PSO set up a compliance unit to monitor how pension
schemes adhered to the relevant tax laws. So far, 3,700 audits have begun,
nearly half of them of SSASs for fewer than 12 people and most of the other
half covering schemes administered by insurance companies. Of these, 2,400
have been completed.
The unit has found 'unsatisfactory' features in a quarter of them, mostly in
the form of benefits paid out which exceeded Revenue limits. 'We have
identified over Pounds 1m paid out in excessive lump sum benefits,' Lusk
noted.
Inland Revenue limits cap the tax-free lump sum retrievable upon retirement
to a quarter of the lump sum value of the pension. In too many cases, Lusk
indicated, the overpayments appeared to be deliberate. 'We see examples of
manipulation in areas where it is difficult to believe it is anything other
than manipulation.'
One common example was under-reporting pension benefits. A senior executive
coming into a company at age-40 might indicate that he had no prior pension
anywhere; this allowed him to accrue pension up to Revenue limits at his new
place of employment.
Lusk said: 'Perhaps 20 years ago, it might have been quite common for
someone in middle age to join a scheme, having had no previous pension
provision of any kind. But I would suggest that someone claiming the same
now might at least merit a follow-up question.'
In particular, Lusk said, the Revenue was concerned by the number of cases
it found of vast over-payment into insured schemes. 'We have plenty of
evidence that significant over-funding of insured schemes and arrangements
is commonplace. When challenged, some insurers even admit that, in money
purchase schemes, no checks are done until the member actually retires.'
Several companies had been identified as persistent abusers.
In considering how to deal with tax abuse of pension schemes, Lusk suggested
that a new range of penalties should be enacted. Present ones either were
too lenient or too harsh and individuals simply were forced to pay the tax
they should have paid in the first place, or the tax status was revoked from
the scheme itself. 'Withdrawal can have a scatter-gun effect, which means
that it is not always the right weapon to use where there has been a failure
of administration,' he added.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Risk and reward in new futures fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS after regulators opened the doors to geared futures and options
unit trusts, the first geared futures and options fund (GFOF) is ready for
presentation to the British public. The Govett Geared UK Index fund, to be
launched on Monday, aims to double every capital movement in the FT-SE 100
index of UK stocks by using futures contracts to provide gearing.
The 'gearing' means that the fund buys FT-SE index exposure, which is twice
the value of the property of the fund. Any gains, but also any losses, are
magnified by a factor of two. If the index were to fall 50 per cent
overnight, the fund would fall 100 per cent and you would lose all your
money (although, as with all unit trusts, you cannot lose more than your
initial investment). If the index fall was spread over a longer period,
losses would be smaller.
The minimum investment of Pounds 5,000 means the fund is available to both
retail and institutional investors. This worries some in the unit trust
industry; they feel that such highly-geared funds are too dangerous for
retail investors. Such a fund should, they say, be contemplated only as part
of a large, diversified portfolio.
The fund also differs from most other unit trusts because there is no active
management team; in that sense, it is comparable with the recent spate of
FT-SE index tracking funds. The intitial charge is 5 1/4 per cent (with a
maximum permitted charge of 7 1/2 per cent). An annual charge of 1 per cent
is deducted from the fund's income.
Futures and options funds (FOFs), of which only a handful have been
launched, can invest up to 10 per cent of their assets in derivative
products, but the riskier GFOFs can have up to 20 per cent of their assets
in futures and options. Govett already has raised Dollars 130m through a
series of futures and options funds which use futures contracts but are not
geared.

MARKS AND Spencer, the UK food and clothing retailer, is expected on Tuesday
to announce a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 627.2m to between Pounds
710m and Pounds 730m. The average forecast of about Pounds 725m represents
an increase of 16 per cent, but last year's figures were reduced by
exceptional redundancy costs of almost Pounds 50m. Stripping these out, the
profits increase is likely to be between 7 and 8 per cent, reflecting a
considerable pick-up in sales in the second half thanks partly to M and S's
'outstanding value' promotions.
Storehouse, which includes the BhS and Mothercare chains, should report
pre-tax profits on Thursday of about Pounds 13m to Pounds 15m, after
exceptional items. As these are mainly one-off costs relating to disposals
aimed at streamlining the business, analysts expect the City to pay more
attention to the pre-exceptional figure, forecast at Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m
(Pounds 15.8m).
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is expected to report on Tuesday pre-tax
profits of Pounds 500m for the six months to March 31. This compares with
Pounds 488m under the old accounting rules which stripped out extraordinary
items.
Half year profits have been helped by around Pounds 25m of exceptional
profits relating to disposals, the depreciation of sterling against the
dollar and a good result from Cavenham Forest Industries in the US.
Whitbread, opening another round of brewers' results on Monday, is expected
to report pre-tax profits little changed from last year at around Pounds
222m. Volume growth for the group's beer brands is likely to be offset by
margin pressures and increased marketing expenditure; but improved first
half trading by the retail division has been maintained.
Full year results from Allied-Lyons on Tuesday should show profits up from
Pounds 610m to Pounds 618m, at the top end of market forecasts. The group's
leading spirits brands have achieved further growth and on the retailing
side, Victoria Wine and Dunkin' Donuts have had a good year.
Bass, on Wednesday, is expected to report a 5 per cent fall in interim
profits to Pounds 245m against a restated Pounds 259m. Brewing profits are
likely to show little change and retailing is still suffering from the
reduction in pub numbers. Holiday Inn profits will benefit from the upturn
in the US.

A NEW RANGE of private health insurance plans has been launched by Clinicare
and a French insurance group, Strasbourgeoise Assurance Mutuelle. Consumers
will be offered three types of plan (in descending order of cover): Carte
Blanche, Classic and Club.
Clinicare claims the top-of-the-range Carte Blanche breaks new ground in the
range of treatment covered. As well as hospital care, it pays for
prescriptions and GP fees as well as dentists' and opticians' charges.
Alternative medicine is also available.
The Classic plan is closer to the industry norm, says Clinicare, whereas
Club offers in-patient cover but excludes benefits such as nursing at home
and physiotherapy. Clinicare also says it will offer some policy-holders
cover for pre-existing conditions if they pay an additional premium. But it
will not be offering this facility to patients with life-threatening
conditions - such as Aids.
Carte Blanche, for a married man aged 40-44 with two children, varies from
Pounds 1,598 to Pounds 2,526 a year depending on the hospital; the Club plan
would cost between Pounds 763 and Pounds 1,315.
These launches confirm an industry trend to offer an ever-wider choice of
plans, although this makes it more difficult to compare the costs of
schemes.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: For buyers only - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ACQUIRING Dodington Park in south-west Gloucestershire has been a coup for
buying agent Wilson &amp; Wilson (071-727-1977). Working like a management
headhunter, it negotiated the sale without any estate agents being involved
(saving the vendor a nice sum, too). The grand Palladian property comes with
a dower house, two lodges, six cottages and 300 acres of park designed by
Capability Brown. The buyer is a private client who will set up a stud to
breed horses and working German shepherd dogs.
Buying and re-location agents work solely for purchasers. They find, and
negotiate for, properties which (like Dodington) are sometimes not intended
to be for sale or are not on the public market. They also may offer to
manage let buildings on behalf of investment buyers.
The aim is to take all the bother out of buying and shield purchasers from
being at an amateur's disadvantage in dealing with a vendor's professional
estate agent. Savings from negotiating down the price more than cover the
buying agent's fee.
Other buying agents include Property Vision (071-602-8788) which has a link
with Sotheby's; Stacks (0666-860-523), a partnership of 12 covering England
and Wales from Cheshire to the Wash; TLC Homesearch (0626-63000), a
newly-opened firm in Devon; West Country House Search (0935-812-698) in
Sherborne, Dorset; and the buying department of Lane Fox in Banbury,
Oxfordshire (0295-273-592).
County Homesearch (0872-223-349), with offices covering southern England,
Edinburgh, Hong Kong and Provence, has an unusual fee structure: Pounds 300
(including VAT) initially, followed by either 1 per cent of the purchase
price or 15 per cent of the negotiated saving between the asking price and
the purchase price (whichever is greater).
Bedrock International (071-351-2625) has a long computer listing of
available houses, plus pictures, to give clients a fuller initial idea of
what is available. When it has searched through this and made a short-list,
it inspects the properties and goes from there in the usual way.
With all estate agents reporting that good houses are scarce on the market,
and with some still over-priced, the way is open for buying services to show
their worth.
Avonmore House, built in 1720 and only 25 miles from Dublin, is set in 150
acres along the river Avonmore in the hunting, shooting and fishing country
of Co. Wicklow. Hamilton Osborne King in Dublin (01-760-251) is selling what
looks a most comfortable property for horsemen. It has a multitude of
bedrooms and baths and a stable yard with 16 loose boxes, all with a guide
price of IRPounds 1.75m.
For the grand life in France, Philip Hawkes in Paris (1-42 68 11 11) is
offering the Chateau de Mareil le Guyon, fully furnished, restored
beautifully and just 21 miles west of Paris, for FFr47.5m. Simpler and
cheaper, at FFr4.2m, is La Magnanerie de Mousteirol, a pretty farmhouse at
Entrecasteaux in Provence, with a swimming pool and passion flowers in the
garden. From Hugo Skillington in France (94 43 69 79) or Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley in London (071-629-8171).
For remoteness, a farmhouse called Brimblecombe in Exmoor national park near
West Anstey, Devon, is hard to beat; you need a four-wheel drive vehicle to
reach it. This romantic retreat, where you can see badgers on the lawn, has
five acres, three bedrooms, a stable, hay barn and two more barns. Price:
around Pounds 190,000 from Stags in Dulverton (0398-231-74).
Fans of 18th century Gothic architecture will like the grade II-listed
Clearwell castle in Gloucestershire's Forest of Dean. Now run as a country
house hotel and new on the market, it is rich in battlements and bedrooms
(14, all with baths en-suite). Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Hereford
(0432-273-087) offers it for around Pounds 750,000.

FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: History at a premium - The costs of
rebuilding - especially a period property - can far exceed those of simple
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPITT

HOUSES ARE cheap today. Many can be bought for very much less than they
would cost to build. Large, period properties are especially good value.
Most people consider Britain's heritage of fine houses to be irreplaceable
works of art - so valuable that owners have to gamble on when insurance
premiums are due each year. In extreme cases, such as the magnificent
Herstmonceux castle in East Sussex, the cost of re-building would be 10
times the selling price, and that leaves aside the value of the priceless
gardens and parkland.
The dilemma facing owners of period homes was highlighted in the recent
catastrophic fire at Windsor castle. Often premiums are too high for houses
to be covered for a total loss.
English Heritage and agencies responsible for royal palaces and other
national monuments, such as the Tower of London, simply cannot afford to
insure them at all. Money is spent instead on prevention and early-warning
systems.
Surprisingly, while claims blaze even higher, only 61.7 per cent of
Britain's 22m homes are insured against fire. There are signs of improvement
but, even so, claims leapt by more than 7 per cent last year to Pounds 249m.
Even some builders of new homes, desperate to maintain cash flow, are
offering houses for less than they cost to build. Historically, this
situation is a catalyst to a price explosion, but uncertainty over
employment continues to apply the brake.
Building costs vary from region to region and according to house type,
causing a wide difference in premiums. But the British Insurance Association
publishes an annual summary of building costs so, unless you live in a
mansion, do-it-yourself valuation is relatively simple.
Rebuilding costs bear no relation to market value although, fortunately,
total losses are rare. On an average home, the guide price per square foot
varies from as little as Pounds 41 to more than Pounds 70. To replace a
beautiful Georgian mansion, however, could cost closer to Pounds 500 a sq
ft.
To estimate your own rebuilding costs, simply work out the floor area, using
external measurements, and multiply by the number of floors. To complete the
equation, multiply the total area by the rebuilding cost for your area and
house type. Thus, a a moderate detached house of 2,000 sq ft in the home
counties would cost 2,000 x Pounds 46 to rebuild - or Pounds 92,000.
So, what price a Gertrude Jekyll garden or Capability Brown parkland?
'The garden comes virtually free if you take into account the value of the
bricks and mortar,' says Colin Mackenzie, of Hamptons. He was referring
specifically to Barton St Mary in East Grinstead, Sussex, built in 1906 and
having 20 acres that are little changed from the myopic Miss Jekyll's
original design. The price guide is Pounds 1m. Mackenzie says: 'To rebuild
the house would cost Pounds 2m or more, and that excludes the incalculable
value of the gardens.'
Heveningham Hall in Suffolk, featured on these pages a few months ago, is
still on the market. The price of Pounds 4.5m is trifling compared with the
Pounds 16m that Savills and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley estimate it would cost to
re-build. Again, the grounds - in this case, 469 acres sculpted by
Capability Brown - count for nought.
High above Bath is Widcombe manor, an exquisite Grade I Georgian house
sitting in seven acres of terraced gardens thought to be the work of Harold
Veto. Offers above Pounds 1.25m are sought by Savills with Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley.
Savills' man in Bath, Charlie Barkshire, says local building costs for a
standard house are around Pounds 60 a sq ft; but a house of the complexity
of Widcombe manor would cost at least Pounds 280 a sq ft to replace.
One of the most remarkable building works in progress this year is Bliss
mill, a huge Victorian tweed mill built in 1872. It might pass for a
Georgian-style mansion but for the dome and 165 ft tower that soars above
the finials and balustrades. Agent John D. Wood reckons that to build it
today would cost at least Pounds 15m.
The building dominates the rolling Oxfordshire countryside and is close to
Chipping Norton (Chipping being a corruption of the Saxon word 'cheapening,'
meaning market), the gateway to the Cotswolds.
Work on converting the mill and its outhouses to flats was started by an
American a few years ago and swallowed up more than Pounds 5m, much of that
due to the high standards set, but the company went into receivership. Enter
Andrew Davis, a flamboyant 27-year-old whose company, Widworthy Estates, has
now completed a number of successful developments.
'It was a very sad state of affairs,' Davis says. 'The previous owner had
lavished love and money on the old place but we were able to buy it for
below Pounds 2m.
'We have spent another Pounds 3m finishing the 35 flats, providing a
wonderful sports complex and converting the outhouses into cottages and
covered car parks. The buyers will get quality that is far and away beyond
what we could have built for the money had the previous owner not been so
ambitious.'
Prices of the flats and the delightful, bright cottages range between Pounds
125,000 and Pounds 245,000; annual service charges, which cover maintaining
the indoor pool, tennis court and other facilities, will average about
Pounds 1,750.
In Regent's Park, London, the third of an eventual six remarkable villas
designed by the champion of classicism, Quinlan Terry, is now ready for a
house-warming party. The Gothick Villa, as its final 'k' indicates, is not
architecturally pure; rather, a marriage of classic and Gothic style
reminiscent of Palladio's Villa Saraceno in Venice.
It is an extravagant place, with ogee arches, pinnacles, Corinthian
capitals, vaulting, and just about every other trick in the architect's
repertoire. But, as a home, it works much better than the first two, the
rooms encircling the grand entrance hall and staircase being of better
proportions. Savills, with Lassmans, has set a guide price of Pounds 6.75m.
Now, the crunch question. If you buy the Gothick Villa, for how much should
it be insured?
Strawberry Gothic, as it has been described, does not come cheap - at least
Pounds 300 a sq ft. Erring on the side of caution, you should reckon on
closer to Pounds 500 so, with nearly 8,000 squ ft to protect, the premiums
should cover re-building costs of at least Pounds 4m.
