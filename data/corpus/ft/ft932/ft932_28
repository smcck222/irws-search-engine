<TEXT>
JAPANESE vehicle makers are struggling against a deeply depressed home
market, as heavy depreciation charges eat into their earnings. The results
for the 1992 financial year are expected to be littered with special sales
of land and stocks to cover or reduce pre-tax losses.
The yen's recent rise to about Y110 to the dollar will make exporting to the
US unprofitable for many in the short-run.
Nissan's shares have been outperforming the market in recent weeks on the
strength of its aggressive restructuring programme launched in February.
Mitsubishi has been the favourite among analysts, mainly due to its model
range which is in tune with Japanese consumers' rediscovered taste for more
conservative styling.
The truckmakers Hino and Nissan Diesel may be the industry's main
beneficiaries from a new public works programme.
The company most likely to show a strong improvement is Suzuki, the small
car maker, largely because it is well placed to exploit surging demand.

Pounds 8m for the insurance broking and planning business of Norex, the
financial services group.
Shares in Norex rose 12p to 165p following the announcement. Lowndes shares
eased 1p to 347p.
Some Pounds 6m of the consideration will be satisfied through the issue of
1.79m shares, which are being placed by Kleinwort Benson at 335p apiece.
In addition, Norex is being issued 584,796 shares, at 342p, and has
undertaken to retain the stake for 12 months from completion.
The two companies being acquired, Norex Insurance Brokers and Norex
Financial Planning, produced brokerage of Pounds 7.2m in the year to June 30
1992 and an attributable profit of Pounds 47,000.
Lowndes said that in addition to the shares being placed in relation to the
acquisition another 1.1m were being placed for cash at 335p to provide
funding for future opportunities.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Heron Intl restructuring is 'flawed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON International's financial restructuring is flawed and carries a
'fairly high probability of default' according to one representative of the
property group's bond holders.
However, he accepted that the proposed refinancing, explained to bondholders
in a 219-page document, would have to go ahead. The group is already
surviving on the goodwill of its banks, which have had to put up further new
money. If there was a suggestion that the restructuring plan had to be
renegotiated, he said, the banks would withdraw that support.
In the document Price Waterhouse, the accountants, say that insolvency
proceedings would produce a lower pay-out to creditors and long delays in
payments. The document sets a final date for the restructuring to be
complete by July 31. Creditor meetings will be held at the end of June.
The business plan underlying the refinancing of Heron's debts, which
totalled Pounds 1.7bn in November, when sterling's weakness increased the
value of foreign currency borrowings, depends on a recovery in the property
market.
The bond holder representative said that the structure of senior debt,
junior debt and equity was meaningless since servicing the senior debt alone
requires an improvement in the property market. He said the different
categories were no more than 'entitlements to whatever there is'.
The document details Heron's losses for the year to March 1992, when net
losses of Pounds 693.1m produced negative net assets of Pounds 328m. On a
pro-forma basis the restructuring would give the group net assets of Pounds
12m.
However, the document also says, 'further material reductions in values will
need to be incorporated in the financial statements for the year ended March
31 1993.' Also net assets would fall again because interest charges exceeded
operating income and the fall in the pound had increased the foreign debt.
Four pages of the document are devoted to 27 legal cases Heron is involved
in. These include a Dollars 83m (Pounds 53.9m) claim from the owner of Pima,
a US savings and loan company taken over by a government agency in 1990. The
suit is against Mr Gerald Ronson, Heron's chairman, and other directors and
managers, but Heron has indemnified them.
Heron's housebuilding subsidiary is being sued by purchasers of properties
in a Docklands development. They say council tenants were housed in the
development reducing the value of their homes.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African mine group may miss
out on Billiton assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF the juiciest mining and metals assets which Gencor wants to buy from
the Royal Dutch/Shell group might slip from the South African group's
clutches because other companies have pre-emptive rights to them.
This means that Shell's mining and metals business, Billiton, must give its
partners in the joint ventures an opportunity to match any terms it is
willing to accept from a third party.
The assets involved are:
The Boddington mine in Western Australia, which last year produced nearly
352,000 troy ounces of gold. Billiton owns 30 per cent and its partners are
Reynolds Metals, the US aluminium group with 40 per cent, Newcrest, the
Australian mining company, 20 per cent, and Kobe Aluminium Associates of
Japan, 10 per cent.
The associated Worsley Alumina business, which mines bauxite, aluminium ore,
and refines it into alumina, an intermediate product. Worsley's annual
capacity was recently expanded to 1.5m tonnes of bauxite. The shareholders
and their holdings are the same as for Boddington.
Alumar of Brazil, which produces about 1m tonnes of alumina and 350,000
tonnes of aluminium a year. Billiton owns 40 per cent of the alumina
refinery and 47 per cent of the aluminium smelter. Alcoa of the US owns the
rest.
Valesul, a Brazilian aluminium producer (annual capacity 92,000 tonnes)
where Billiton owns 41.5 per cent, Cia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil 49.5 per
cent and Multisilicon 9 per cent.
The Collahuasi copper project in Chile, expected to start up in 1996-97. A
company owned by Minorco and its parent Anglo American Corporation of South
Africa recently paid Dollars 190m (Pounds 123.3m) for a one-third stake in
Collahuasi. The rest is shared equally by Falconbridge of Canada and
Billiton.
While Billiton's partners in these joint ventures are suffering financially
because of present low metal prices, they might be reluctant to pass up the
opportunity to acquire more of these assets. Much will depend on the prices
Gencor is ready to offer - there are indications that these might be what
other companies would consider to be on the high side. It is suggested that
Gencor is willing to pay more than the Dollars 1.8bn book value of the
Billiton assets because the move is of tremendous strategic importance to
the South African group.
Other interests Gencor has bid for include: the Cadjebut lead-zinc mine in
Australia (Billiton, 42 per cent); the wholly-owned Selbaie copper-zinc
operations in Canada; Cerro Matoso nickel (52.3 per cent) in Colombia; the
Bogusu gold mine in Ghana (81 per cent); the Lerokis gold mine in Indonesia
(90 per cent); and the Pering lead-zinc operations in South Africa (100 per
cent).
Gencor obviously has great faith in the future of aluminium - it is backing
a Dollars 2bn project in South Africa for Alusaf to build a 466,000-tonne
aluminium smelter, the western world's biggest ever - and so, apart from the
previously-mentioned operations in Australia and Brazil, it has also bid for
Billiton's other alumina operations: Paranam in Surinam (76 per cent) and
Aughinish in Ireland (35 per cent).
Gencor also wants Billiton's global metals trading and marketing network -
which would certainly help sell some of the extra aluminium from Alusaf.
Billiton's other downstream operations are conspicuous by their absence from
the list, the most glaring omission being the half-share of the Budelco zinc
smelter in the Netherlands.
South African exchange control rules prevent Gencor exporting cash to pay
for the Shell assets, so it will have to borrow a great deal if its offer
succeeds. However, Shell has given Gencor and its adviser, SG Warburg, an
exclusive option allowing them 120 days grace in which to work on that
problem.

FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Worms sells controlling stake in
luxury goods conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORMS, the French holding company, has reshuffled its interests by selling a
controlling stake in Financiere Truffaut, the luxury goods conglomerate, to
Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH group, and reducing its holding in
the Saint-Louis food company.
Truffaut holds investments in a number of luxury goods companies including
25 per cent of the Kenzo fashion house and 17 per cent investment in Fred,
the jeweller. It owns a 10.7 per cent stake in Agache, a company through
which Mr Arnault controls LVMH, and 1.4 per cent of Christian Dior, the
fashion house linked to LVMH.
Mr Arnault, one of France's most ambitious industrialists, has bought
Worms's 94.3 per cent stake in Truffaut in a deal that values the latter at
FFr872m (Dollars 161.5m). The acquisition not only expands his luxury goods
interests, but also strengthens his position at Agache and LVMH.
Worms, which recently reported a sharp fall in net profits to FFr571m last
year from FFr1bn in 1991, has raised capital to stabilise its finances. The
Truffaut sale continues its strategy of concentrating on businesses where it
exercises control. Truffaut, by contrast, is composed of minority stakes.
Under the terms of the deal, Worms will keep Truffaut's 20 per cent holding
in Lancel, the French luggage company, because of the possible conflict with
Louis Vuitton, the luxury luggage maker owned by LVMH.
Worms has restructured its investment in Saint-Louis, the French food group.
It has struck a concert agreement with IFIL, a fellow shareholder linked to
the Agnelli family of Italy, so that they will jointly control Saint-Louis.
Saint-Louis recently staged a capital increase to finance its expansion
plans and Worms ceded its rights to buy new shares to IFIL. As a result, the
two companies control 47.5 per cent of the equity and 56.7 per cent of the
voting rights, with IFIL raising its stake to 15.6 per cent from 6.5 per
cent and Saint-Louis reducing its holding to 31.9 per cent from 36 per cent.

FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Shannon dependent on aviation
spin-offs
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH businessmen and politicians will breathe a sigh of relief if GE
Capital's rescue of GPA, outlined last night, is approved by shareholders,
banks and bondholders.
Irish companies such as Aer Lingus, the flag carrier which provided the seed
money for Mr Tony Ryan to start up GPA in 1975, and institutional investors
such as Irish Life, have seen their investment in GPA wiped out by its
financial problems.
Workers in Shannon, moreover, have become increasingly dependent on GPA as a
source of local employment as the role of Shannon airport in trans-Atlantic
travel has waned.
GPA was established in the Shannon Free Zone in the south-west of Ireland to
take advantage of its low 10 per cent corporate tax rate. A restructured GPA
will most likely remain in Shannon for the same reasons.
The local spin-offs have been substantial. Shannon Aerospace, a GPA joint
venture with the airlines Swissair and Lufthansa, opened an IPounds 80m
(Pounds 78.6m) aircraft maintenance facility last September.
This is the centrepiece of a planned European hub for jet aircraft
maintenance, overhaul and repair, around which 11,500 jobs are expected to
be created by the end of the decade.
Shannon Turbine Technologies, a IPounds 24m GPA joint venture with Sulzer,
the Swiss engineering company, will open this year, to provide jet engine
maintenance. Several thousand jobs are expected to result when both projects
are running at full capacity.
According to a spokeswoman for the Shannon Development Authority, 'GPA has
been an important player for us in developing the concept of the aviation
park. Whatever happens to GPA will not affect our plans to develop that'.

THE Hong Kong owners of a Thai toy plant where at least 204 workers, mostly
young women, died in one of the world's worst factory fires said yesterday
the disaster would do their company's finances little harm, Reuter reports
from Hong Kong.
Kader Holdings, which has a 40 per cent stake in the Bangkok factory, said
it regretted the blaze and had sent condolences to the families of the dead.
The announcement made no mention of compensation for the victims' families.
The company said it 'believes that the accident will have no substantial
financial impact'.
Guards at the Bangkok plant said workers had been locked in to prevent
pilfering. Workers said there were no fire alarms or fire escapes.
Mr Kenneth Ting, chairman, told the South China Morning Post a smaller blaze
had hit the factory in 1989. 'Every precaution was taken after the 1989 fire
to improve the situation, but nothing could be done to stop Monday's fire as
it was caused by an electrical spark.'
However, Thai police said initial investigations indicated an electric fault
was not to blame, suggesting either arson or carelessness instead.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Brushing up on
tradition - Baking soda, once a humble ingredient, has achieved new status.
Nikki Tait and Karen Zagor report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Draw up a list of quintessential '1990s' products, and baking soda
toothpaste would almost certainly be a top pick. The very name evokes homy
memories and 'back-to-basic' values. Baking soda - the main ingredient of
which is bicarbonate of soda - has been a stalwart item in the traditional
housewife's larder for decades. Its conventional uses range from helping
cakes rise to keeping refrigerators odour-free. In image terms, no product
could be further removed from Gucci bags, meals for the microwave and
similar symbols of the 1980s-style yuppie.
But baking soda did not arrive in toothpaste form until 1989. That was when
Church &amp; Dwight, a quoted Princeton-based company and the world's largest
producer of sodium bicarbonate, launched a line of baking soda dentifrice
across the US under its 'Arm &amp; Hammer' trademark. It was, says the company,
a natural product extension. Americans have used baking soda (mixed with
water to form a paste) to clean their teeth for more than a century. Back in
the 1920s, baking soda even carried a 'seal of acceptance' from the American
Dental Association, the ultimate endorsement for dental products.
Over the past four years, the product category has exploded. According to
Nielsen Marketing Research, sales of baking soda dentifrice and toothpowder
products totalled almost dollars 100m (pounds 65m) in the six months to
mid-March, compared with dollars 637m for the toothpaste and toothpowder
market overall - a near-15 per cent share. While toothpaste sales generally
advanced by just 6 per cent during this period, the baking soda segment
soared by 65 per cent.
This heady expansion rate results partly from the entry of large consumer
products companies into the baking soda segment. The likes of Unilever's
Chesebrough-Pond's subsidiary and Colgate-Palmolive quickly decided that the
product's in-roads were too substantial to ignore, and launched 'baking
soda' versions of their traditional brands last year. Procter &amp; Gamble, the
overall dentifrice leader in the US, is currently in the throes of a
nationwide launch of a baking soda version of Crest.
In the process, these consumer product juggernauts have partially eliminated
the higher margins which the original baking soda toothpaste manufacturers
were eager to extract. Today, most US supermarkets carry similar sizes of
conventional and baking soda dentifrices at the same price. A 6.4-ounce tube
of Crest sells for dollars 2.39, whether in baking soda or conventional
form, for example.
Arm &amp; Hammer products, however, have clung on to their premium. In the face
of competition from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, the company has carefully
stressed that its formulation uses more baking soda than its rivals -
'anything from two to three times', says Davis Dickinson, marketing
director. And despite the higher pricing, Arm &amp; Hammer - nothing to do with
the legendary oil tycoon Armand Hammer until he ended confusion by buying a
small stake in Church &amp; Dwight in 1986 - still commands a 63.5 per cent
share of the total baking soda dentifrice market, although its sales growth
rate over the past six months of about 20 per cent has been below that of
baking soda toothpastes generally.
However wholesome the baking soda concept may sound, the irony is that these
toothpastes have no proven advantage over traditional rivals. Their
impressive sales gains are as much a triumph of clever marketing as inherent
product advantage.
None of the baking soda products which have hit the supermarket shelves over
the past four years has carried the American Dental Association 'seal of
acceptance', for example, although Arm &amp; Hammer says that it has been
talking to the Chicago-based organisation since 1989. Disciples argue that
baking soda acts as a mild abrasive on teeth, cuts down on plaque acid and
generally deodorises the mouth. But the ADA has not been convinced: 'We've
not seen sufficient data to prove the effectiveness of baking soda in
toothpaste,' it says.
While it is true that the Crest baking soda product will carry an ADA seal,
this is primarily because of Crest's formulation, not because of the baking
soda element. 'We just got the ADA seal for effective cavity prevention. We
had to submit separately to the ADA for Crest baking soda,' says the
promoters. 'There's no proven therapeutic benefit to baking soda, but there
is for Crest.'
So how has baking soda toothpaste gained such an impressive hold in the
market? From day one, Arm &amp; Hammer has sold heavily on the boast that 'two
out of three dentists and hygienists recommend brushing with baking soda or
a baking soda toothpaste.'
The assertion, says the company, is based on a national, and regularly
updated survey. Anecdotally, it seems to be partially supported. Many US
dentists and hygienists do recommend baking soda to their patients even
though they know that is proven efficacy is limited.
'I don't know how effective the toothpaste is, but baking soda itself is one
of the few things you can use at home to remove light stains, like tea
stains, without hurting your teeth,' says Michelle Freemark, a dental
hygienist. 'Baking soda doesn't always work, but a lot of the other
whitening products on the market are pretty abrasive and will hurt you. I
have had some people who seem to think the toothpaste works.'
The manufacturers are more than happy to support this impression. 'The most
important quality is that it makes the mouth feel clean - like you've just
left the dentist's office,' says Dickinson.
Some of the claims by the toothpaste makers nevertheless seem slightly
far-fetched. 'Dentists recognise that when consumers enjoy the taste of a
toothpaste they brush their teeth more - we see this as a flavour-option,'
says Procter &amp; Gamble.
Retorts Freemark: 'In my opinion, if someone's a lousy brusher to start
with, a better-tasting toothpaste probably won't make them change.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US 'drags heels' over Gatt rulings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is putting in jeopardy the international trade dispute settlement
system because of its 'seriously deficient record' in complying with rulings
against it, according to a US study*.
The study examined 207 complaints put before dispute settlement panels of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade during its 42-year history from
1948 to 1989.
Professor Robert Hudec and colleagues at the University of Minnesota
conclude that 'no resolution of the current malaise in Gatt legal affairs
will be possible without a change in the basic US legal policy - some kind
of reconciliation between the current US legal preoccupation with obtaining
a fair deal, and the recognition of an obligation to use legal means to
secure one'.
The study nevertheless concludes that the Gatt system of settling
international trade disputes 'has produced many impressive successes'. Four
out of five valid complaints were dealt with successfully, it says.
A high percentage of the Gatt panel failures dealt with disputes over
anti-dumping actions, or countervailing duties, the study finds. It suggests
this could be due to the 'typical arbitrariness' of the criteria for finding
dumping, and the legal rigidity of measures, once taken.
The US has ignored Gatt panel rulings on four of the 14 occasions it has
been found to be violating international trade rules  - all four in the past
decade.
Only Canada comes near, having ignored two out of nine rulings against it.
'Just as the US played a leading role in building the Gatt dispute
settlement procedure to its present state of effectiveness, so the US has
played the leading role in placing those accomplishments in jeopardy today,'
the study concludes.
It suggests US reluctance to accept Gatt rulings may be due to increasing
use of Gatt to settle disputes, and the independence of its findings: 'When
a legal system starts pressing harder, the first to resist will be those who
are accustomed to having their own way.'

licensing plans

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S government yesterday expressed strong disapproval of European
Community plans to introduce an oil and gas licensing directive when it is
struggling to convince a resistant electorate of the benefits of EC entry.
In its membership application Norway made clear it expected to voice an
opinion on formulating Europe's future energy policy. Its position should be
given considerable weight in proposals for the regulation of licences for
exploration and exploitation.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norwegian prime minister, said that her country,
as western Europe's biggest oil producer and main supplier of natural gas,
took a keen interest in all European moves and measures relating to energy.
'We do not view the introduction of this proposal as a very positive move
before Norway might be joining the Community,' she said. 'The situation
reminds us of 1972 when the EC adopted a fisheries policy shortly before
Norway was going to make the decision on whether to become a member of the
EC. That move in itself had a considerable impact on the Norwegian
referendum.'
Norwegian voters rejected EC membership in 1972  - mainly because of the
fish issue  - in a bitterly devisive referendum. It began fresh membership
negotiations with the Community last month.
Norway finds it difficult to understand the need for a licensing directive.
'On the contrary,' said Mrs Brundtland, 'it may damage the image of the
Community among the people in Norway in the run-up to a new referendum.'
The proposed directive would have considerable impact on Norway and little
or negligible impact on most EC countries, the prime minister said.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Size of Bundesbank rate cut surprises dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank again surprised dealers in financial markets yesterday by
cutting the cost of lending funds to commercial banks by a larger amount
than had been ex-pected.
The German central bank cut its repo rate, which sets the cost of lending
short-term funds, by 11 basis points to 7.60 per cent for periods of 14 days
and 28 days.
The move was immediately followed by cuts in official interest rates in both
the Netherlands and Belgium, both of whose central banks cut their three key
interest rates by 25 basis points. There was some speculation that France
will again ease its intervention rate when the Bank of France operates in
the money markets today.
Yesterday's Bundesbank move led to new suggestions that the central bank's
council will reduce its discount rate again when it meets on May 19.
One London-based analyst said there was now a possibility that the discount
rate, which sets the floor for all German rates, will come down  1/4 of a
percentage point to 7.00 per cent. The repo rate cut also helped to ease
pressures on the Danish krone in the run-up to next week's referendum on the
Maastricht treaty. The krone was last night trading in London at about
DKr3.8509 to the D-Mark, having been at DKr3.8580 the night before.
French banks yesterday cut their base rates from 9.25 per cent to 9 per cent
in response to last week's reductions in the Bank of France's key interest
rates, continuing the downward trend in French rates, Alice Rawsthorn adds
from Paris.
The fall in base rates, the fourth since France's new centre-right
government took power in late March, coincided with a report by the Paris
chamber of commerce that retail sales increased 'significantly' in April.
The retail sector has for the past year been very sluggish, partly because
of the impact of high interest rates.
Yesterday's report, which included provisional estimates rather than firm
figures, suggested that retail sales had risen by 2.1 per cent in April
compared with the same month in 1992, with department stores registering a
6.5 per cent increase.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (11): Rules must be right, and upheld -
The safeguarding of the tropical forests cannot be taken for granted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO ISSUES will decide whether Indonesia's valuable tropical forests survive
in good health into the next century: are the rules on limiting timber
extraction being enforced, and are the rules the right ones for Indonesia in
the first place?
The answer most often given to both questions is 'no', a source of concern
not only to Indonesian and foreign environmentalists but also to the
government and the country as a whole.
Large-scale exploitation of Indonesia's rich forests began in the late
1960s, and forest products - mainly plywood - are now the country's fourth
most important export after oil, gas, and manufactured goods; in 1991 they
earned Dollars 3.7bn, nearly double all agricultural exports put together.
On paper, Indonesia's plans look reasonable enough. Of the country's land
area of 193m hectares, 144m ha or 75 per cent is classified as forest, of
which 66m hectares is supposed to be selectively logged, 48m preserved
intact for national parks and vital watersheds, and 30m chopped down to make
way for agriculture, new settlements and industry.
Implementation of these sweeping plans, however, is another matter,
particularly when it comes to the logging concessions which are meant to be
exploited in a sustainable manner.
In a damning recent report which shook the Indonesian establishment, Walhi,
the leading domestic environmental group, not only questioned the economic
value of the industry to the country but also cited convincing evidence that
logging companies routinely flout forestry regulations.
Bribes are paid to forestry inspectors to encourage them to under-report the
amount of timber extracted from concessions, Walhi said.
It quoted a 1990 forestry department report as saying that only 22 out of
578 concessionaires had actually followed regulations on selective cutting
and replanting, and cited another official report which disclosed that only
30 per cent of log production in East Kalimantan on Borneo was reported to
the government as required.
In the past, the report added, Japanese figures for the import of logs and
wood products from Indonesia were far higher than the Indonesian figures for
exports to Japan. Walhi concluded that the state captured only 17 per cent
of the economic rent from timber in taxes and fees, compared with 85 per
cent for the technologically much more sophisticated oil industry.
Although the government and big private companies are establishing tens of
thousands of hectares of plantations for the pulp and paper and other timber
processing industries, the programme is behind schedule and has so far done
little to protect Indonesia's natural forests.
There is scant transparency in the bidding for natural forest concessions,
and the logging industry is dominated by timber magnates such as Mr Mohamad
'Bob' Hasan and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who have close ties to President
Suharto.
'Wood is not being harvested, it's being mined,' says a foreign aid
official. Another says: 'The legal loggers are legally logging sometimes and
illegally logging at other times. There's no end to the genius involved.'
However, the government and many foreign donors agree that big logging
concessionaires like Mr Hasan - because of their financial resources and
their huge stake in the future of the industry - are more likely to manage
forests sustainably than smaller operators who might be tempted to
'asset-strip' their concessions for a quick, short-term gain.
There is also agreement that forestry rules are contravened. 'Our government
doesn't have the capability to measure illegal cutting,' says Mr Bambang
Soekartiko, a senior official of the ministry of forestry. 'We know there is
excess cutting.'
As for the existing system of selective cutting and replanting, Indonesian
and foreign forestry experts are acknowledging that, because of their
limited understanding of the biology of forests rich in valuable dipterocarp
species, they might not be able to make it work even if the rules were
strictly applied.
Part of the problem is that a typical forest does not contain equal numbers
of large, medium-sized and small trees which would allow regular cropping as
each generation reaches maturity. In fact the large, harvestable trees
dominate the canopy and thereby stunt their successors which then take many
years to reach the required size.
Several proposals to improve the rules for managing Indonesian forests and
the enforcement of those rules are under discussion, including an extension
of concession periods from 20 to 35 years, the use of costly performance
bonds to ensure logging companies comply with the law, and the deployment of
foreign inspectors.
Foreign donors have welcomed the appointment of Mr Djamaloedin
Soeryohadikoesoemo as the new forestry minister in the March cabinet
reshuffle, although some of them say his decision to adopt a new and
little-understood system of forest strip-cutting is a sign of the
government's desperation as it seeks save the industry from its own
excesses.
The idea is to cut long strips of forest - including the smaller trees  -
and leave other, neighbouring strips intact, allowing the logged strip to be
replanted or seeded from the untouched forest and letting in sunlight to
nourish the young trees.
Forestry ministry officials say the strip system will be easier to monitor -
by satellite for example - and they also believe that natural forest growth
will increase from one or two cubic metres per hectare per year to between
eight and 14 cubic metres. 'The productivity will increase eight times,'
says Mr Soekartiko.
Others are sceptical, pointing out that loggers will be tempted to venture
into the supposedly inviolate strips of forest to take the most valuable
trees, and that the open strips might be used as farms by the settlers who
always follow in the wake of the logging trucks.
Implementation of the new method has not yet begun in Indonesia. In the
meantime, high demand for logs from more than 2,800 sawmills and plywood
factories continues to put pressure on Indonesia's forests; the mills and
factories have a capacity of more than 50m cubic metres a year, compared
with the government's official figure for sustainable log output of 31m
cubic metres.
One of the few hopeful signs for Indonesia, as it strives to avoid the
deforestation suffered long ago in western Europe and more recently in
Thailand and the Philippines, is that local inhabitants have become more
vocal in their opposition to state-sanctioned logging in their homelands.
The inhabitants of Yamdena, an island on the eastern side of the
archipelago, and of Siberut off the coast of Sumatra, have won reprieves for
their forests, and even the logging companies of Kalimantan are said to be
concerned about their own future; they may yet heed Walhi's warning:
'At the current level of deforestation, Indonesia's forests will disappear
in the next 30 years.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (12): China sets a gruelling pace - The
Race for Foreign Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANGY dog which ekes out a miserable existence on the steps of the
Investment Co-ordinating Board (BKPM) office in Jakarta gives the potential
investor an unduly dismal impression of the fate awaiting him in Indonesia.
Foreign investment applications have in fact risen steadily in the last
seven years as Asian and western manufacturers take advantage of the
country's abundant and modestly-priced workforce - workers sometimes earn
only a dollar a day - and its large consumer market.
First it was textiles. Much of the international export industry, after
moving from Japan to Taiwan and Korea, has now settled in countries such as
Indonesia, Thailand and China. The value of Indonesian textile and garment
exports rose to about Dollars 6bn last year, about six times the level of
1986.
Then came electronics. Samsung of South Korea and Sony of Japan have started
to export video recorders and audio systems from Indonesia. Exports of
electrical appliances have doubled to about Dollars 1bn a year from Dollars
500m in 1991.
Indonesian officials, however, are worried. They are concerned about
increasing competition for investment dollars from the fast-growing
economies of China, Vietnam and India, and they are dismayed by the sharp
fall in domestic investment over the last three years.
Although the BKPM's foreign investment approvals (which exclude oil and gas
exploration) reached a record Dollars 10.3bn last year, the underlying level
of foreign interest in Indonesia appears to be falling; about Dollars 3bn of
the 1992 approvals total came from two huge projects - a planned oil
refinery in south Sumatra proposed by British Petroleum and C. Itoh, and the
Chandra Asri petrochemical plant in west Java which underwent a
controversial switch from domestic to foreign investment status after the
government sought to limit foreign borrowing by domestic companies.
The figures must also be treated with caution, since historically only about
half of approved foreign projects by value, and a third of domestic ones,
are actually implemented.
'The competition for the investment buck from China and to a lesser extent
Vietnam is quite a lot more serious than we had assumed,' said a foreign
banker in Jakarta.
Companies complain about a number of obstacles to doing good business in
Indonesia: the hopelessly inadequate legal system, excessive corruption and
bureaucracy (especially in the issuing of industrial licences by provincial
authorities), and the tendency of university graduates to choose cushy jobs
in the civil service or the banks rather than work in industry.
The application process for foreign investors can take six months, and there
are restrictions on the level of foreign ownership. An added burden for
companies proposing large projects is the possibility that one of President
Suharto's children will want to take a stake in the business - a
disincentive for foreign creditors who might otherwise be willing to provide
finance.
Shortages of electricity and clean water, a poor telephone service and other
infrastructural problems common to other rapidly expanding Asian economies
also cause difficulties.
'In terms of investment conditions, if you compare it to any country I think
Indonesia is among the least advanced,' said Mr Yohsuke Udaka, director of
PT Teijin Indonesia Fiber Corp, a Japanese-Indonesian joint venture
manufacturer of synthetic fiber and yarn. He compared Indonesia's relatively
restricted investment regime to the incentives on offer elsewhere, including
tax holidays in China and electricity rebates in Thailand.
The point is not lost on BKPM officials. 'A lot of Japanese, Korean and
Taiwanese investment that should have gone to Indonesia has gone to
Thailand,' says Mr Asril Noer, the BKPM's director of overseas promotion. 'I
think they are quite attractive with their incentives.'
From President Suharto downwards, Indonesian officials are aware of the need
to accommodate 2.5m new jobseekers each year and realise that they will have
to improve Indonesia's investment image further.
A package of reforms introduced last year allows foreigners to start with
100 per cent ownership of a project if it has paid-up capital of at least
Dollars 50m, or if it is sited outside the main island of Java and the more
developed parts of Sumatra.
This year, the BKPM's status was raised in the March cabinet reshuffle by
the elevation of Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, the BKPM chairman, to ministerial
rank. The government is expected to ease industrial licensing procedures and
extend land lease titles, perhaps to 50 or 60 years from the current 30 or
35 years. It may also reduce the Dollars 50m limit for 100 per cent initial
foreign ownership.
'I think they have to give a good signal very soon,' said Ms Mari Pangestu,
chief economist at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in
Jakarta.
Investors and government officials are also anxious to establish component
industries so that manufacturers can source more of their materials inside
Indonesia - instead of keeping large stocks of imported products in their
factories - and an Indonesian mission is due to travel to Japan in June to
discuss the issue.
Progress has already been made. PT Teijin Indonesia, for example, uses
purified terephthalic acid (PTA) as one of its principal raw materials to
make polyester fibre and should soon be able to receive supplies from a new
Mitsubishi PTA plant in Indonesia; hitherto it has been obliged to buy PTA
on the international market and to buy the output of Pertamina, the state
oil company, despite its dissatisfaction with the quality and reliability of
Pertamina's supply.
Another concern which the government may seek to address is the falling
level of domestic investment. BKPM figures show domestic approvals falling
to Rp29,342bn in 1992 from Rp41,085bn in 1991 and Rp55,278 in 1990.
The government's 'tight money' policy of restraining credit growth since
1990 is regarded as the main culprit, but nationalist Indonesians have also
complained that the ethnic Chinese citizens who dominate private commerce
and industry have been investing in China at the expense of Indonesia.
Such complaints smack of over-simplification. The Chinese retort that they
are subjected to equally fierce criticism if they invest too much in
Indonesia - on the grounds that they are supposedly monopolising Indonesian
business - and point out that much of the money invested abroad is already
located offshore in Hong Kong or Singapore. Furthermore, the income from
profitable investments in China or elsewhere can be used to fund expansion
in Indonesia itself.
There is, however, widespread concern at the obvious emotional attachment to
China displayed by ethnic Chinese businessmen from Indonesia, although when
a wealthy entrepreneur flies north it is hard to tell if he is negotiating
business deals in southern China or merely gambling in Macao.
With both domestic and foreign investment requiring further encouragement,
it may not be long before the government acts. 'We recognise that on a
competitiveness rating, we are now rather behind, especially compared with
China,' said Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, the finance minister. 'We have to improve
the whole investment climate .. We will do it soon.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (8): Growth, equity and stability - Dr
Saleh Afiff, coordinating minister for the economy and finance / Interview
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR SALEH AFIFF explained his government's policies in his first press
interview since taking his present job. Excerpts follow:
QUESTION: Will the new cabinet change the thrust of economic policy?
ANSWER: There will be no basic changes. We base our development efforts on
the triple objectives of growth, equity and stability. Stability is not only
political stability but economic stability, through prudent fiscal and
monetary management. Trade protection we went through in the 1970s and early
1980s. We don't want to come back to that, because that is a misallocation
of resources.
At that time we became increasingly dependent on oil, because our non-oil
exports were stagnating. It leads to a high cost economy.
Agriculture and food processing are two sectors which remain
highly-regulated. Do you plan any changes?
These sectors have a long history. When our development efforts began in
1965, we were still battling shortages of food, not only domestically but
also internationally. When we went to the aid agencies, what they had was
wheat-flour. Then came the idea of importing wheat grain so we can process
it here. Our first aim was to achieve self-sufficiency in rice, because we
had a comparative advantage. Now we shall have to start to look again at the
flour-mills. I can tell you, we are not finished yet with our deregulation
programme but it has to go step by step. Consensus among ministers and also
with the president takes time.
The privately-owned clove monopoly has received loans of Rp1,000bn from
state banks but has been unable to service its debt. Are you planning any
action?
We have had long discussions about this. It cannot be maintained as it is
but you cannot stop it abruptly also. It will be phased out. It will take a
couple of years to phase out.
Are you planning a deregulation package in order to set out your
credentials?
Yes, I am keen to do it. Not only me but Minister Hartarto, the
co-ordinating minister of industry and trade, because we know that other
countries are deregulating faster. Everybody is now aiming at China. The
Chinese foreign minister is going to Europe with a group of businessmen to
attract investors. We have to compete with them and the only way is by
improving the investment climate. There are bottlenecks in licensing, in
customs and in many others.
Do you consider China and countries such as Vietnam as economic threats?
We consider them threats. We have to compete for funds which are shrinking.
A couple of years ago no-one would go to Vietnam. Ten years ago China was
still small. Suddenly they are in the field and we have to compete.
State-owned high-technology enterprises such as aircraft manufacture are
said to receive up to Rp4,000bn a year in state finances. How exactly are
they funded?
They are mostly funded from the state budget, but not that high. You can see
it in the budget. We do provide them with equity, since 1976, in parallel
with our other development efforts.
We also finance agricultural development, irrigation systems and the
provision of social services in rural areas. The impression I get in the
media is that this (government funding of high-technology) will be jumping
and this (agricultural and rural development) will be left behind. This is
not true.
Are you getting a decent return on your investment in the high-technology
sector?
That is an interesting point, on returns. Look, when I was in Bappenas (the
national planning agency) I allocated funds for a road in Irian Jaya
(connecting an isolated town with the provincial capital). You ask me what
are the returns, because there were no cars at that time? But if we don't
finance it, will Irian Jaya develop without an infrastructure? That is also
with IPTN (the state aircraft construction company). Returns wise, of course
they have lost but in the long run maybe we will gain.
How long is the long run?
They have a plan that at a certain point their equity will be fulfilled and
then they should start with additional financing, not only from the state
budget, but from the state banks, other banks and the private sector.
Are you concerned about state enterprises borrowing from state banks? How
does this affect the budget?
The state banks' capital is separate from the budget. If the state banks
finance state enterprises, it will be from their deposits. As you know the
growth of deposits in the last 10 years was tremendous. They have a lot of
loanable funds. State enterprises are one of their favourites because they
are more sure. If something happens, then the government will take care of
it.
Whilst deposits have risen at state banks, so have their bad debts. How
concerned are you at the level of the state banks' non-performing loans?
I am very concerned about the state banks and the banking system as a whole.
We have to do something. In economics, you decide now and the impact will be
a year or so later on.
I think the banking system plays a crucial role in promoting growth. We will
take steps first to know what is the size of the bad debt. Credit
appraisals, training of management and the quality of services of the banks
(should be improved) so they don't make the same errors.
Some bad loans have been made to politically well-connected people and many
private banks are owned by politically well-connected families. Will you not
have to fight a political battle to impose your will?
Those things happen and we will fight. I will fight, because if we continue
on this basis it will not help the economy at all. Right now the business
community are complaining that it is not the interest rate level which is a
problem but the availability of credit. Why is it not available? Because
they (the banks) are scared. They would rather put money into SBIs
(government bonds) than lend to a business community in which they are not
sure. The risk is too big, perhaps. But this will impede economic growth.
And what does that mean? It means we cannot absorb the new labour force
which is growing at more than 2m a year. The macro implications are quite
substantial. So we have to fight.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (10): Steelworks and paddyfields - The
industrial revolution in East Java
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHERE once there were paddy-fields, rice farmers and water buffalo, there
are now shoe factories, international pharmaceutical companies and
industrial workers. The province of East Java is in the throes of an
economic boom.
West Java and Jakarta have long been Indonesia's main destinations for
investors, but traffic congestion and high land prices in the capital have
persuaded a growing number of local and foreign manufacturers to go east.
The economy of Surabaya, the East Java provincial capital of some 3m
inhabitants, has been growing at more than 12 per cent a year. East Java's
steel plants are churning out reinforcing bars to meet heavy demand for
reinforced concrete from the construction industry.
Property prices and the cost of labour are still relatively modest and the
flat land of the rice-paddies is equally suitable for television plants and
instant noodle factories. Today grey factory walls and bright green expanses
of young rice alternate along the highways; the horse-drawn carts on the
roads are outnumbered by cars and trucks.
Investors from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere - as well as ethnic
Chinese businessmen from other parts of Indonesia - have joined old East
Java companies such as Sampoerna, the cigarette maker established in 1913 by
Liem Seeng Tee, in building their factories around Surabaya.
Other big employers in the area include Kedaung, said to be the world's
largest glass manufacturer, and Maspion, which makes cookers and other
household items. Agricultural processing is another important local
industry; shrimp from farms along the coast are exported to the US and
Japan.
Containers of cigarettes for export to Singapore and Poland can be seen
being loaded outside Sampoerna's Surabaya plant. The tobacco industry,
principally clove-flavoured 'kretek' cigarettes for domestic consumption, is
the second largest employer in the country after the government and is
prominent in East Java; Sampoerna alone employs 14,000 women to hand roll
its kretek products.
Employers say the stolid workers of East Java are often better suited to the
monotony of manufacturing than the more entrepreneurial inhabitants of the
west.
Neither Surabaya nor the rest of East Java, however, have escaped the
infrastructural and social strains common to other fast-developing parts of
Asia.
Road traffic is increasing in volume and its speed is falling; the supply of
electricity cannot keep pace with demand; telephone lines to Jakarta are
congested; prostitution is common; and there are occasional outbreaks of
labour unrest and factory arson.
Most of the problems are being tackled. East of Surabaya, a multi-billion
dollar complex of coal-fired power stations is under construction at Paiton,
and a Dollars 1bn, 1,500-megawatt plant to be supplied by gas pipeline from
a field off Java is being commissioned at Gresik near Surabaya.
Workers can be seen in the countryside assembling the pylons to carry the
electricity westwards from Paiton. In the meantime, companies seem happy to
use their own generators when they have to.
'East Java is going through phenomenal growth at the moment,' says a banker
based in Surabaya. 'The margins are so good in most industries here that the
extra marginal cost of producing your own power is easily containable.'
The shortage of telephone lines can be frustrating, but international calls
are now straightforward and the advent of cellular phones has made it easier
to contact people in Surabaya and in other parts of Indonesia. One executive
says he had no telephone at home three years ago; now he has two telephones
in his house and a mobile device.
A toll road to Gresik is being extended, and there is once again talk of
building a bridge to nearby Madura island to promote its development as a
manufacturing base. Surabaya has an international airport and the city's
Tanjung Perak port was recently upgraded with the completion of a new
container terminal.
Not every project is a success. Surabaya's four-year-old stock exchange is
regarded as moribund, and the magnificently-equipped new shipyard run by the
state-owned PT Pal company under the auspices of the ebullient Mr BJ Habibie
and his research and technology ministry is seen as something of a white
elephant; in the past year it has been employing American welders to build
turbines for power stations rather than ships.
Such setbacks are unlikely to stop East Java's progress up the economic
ladder. An international school catering for the children of the growing
number of foreigners in Surabaya is thriving. Tourism is on the rise, and
several new hotels run by Hilton and other international groups are due to
open in Surabaya soon to provide some much-needed competition for the Hyatt.
Perhaps the most telling sign of the times - apart from the sprouting of
television satellite dishes - is Sampoerna's decision to branch out into
property development with the purchase of a 598-hectare site in the hills
outside Surabaya: the eventual aim of the project is to build luxury housing
for locals and weekend cottages for the wealthy citizens of Jakarta.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (7): The mayor's monument - Nimes,
'a vital, vibrant city - not a museum'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JEAN BOSQUET is not unaccustomed to the frills and formality of opening
ceremonies, having presided over dozens in his dual role as chairman of
Cacharel, the French fashion company, and mayor of Nimes.
But the opening earlier this month of the Carre d'Art, the FFr400m museum
and library designed by Sir Norman Foster, the British architect, was a
special event even for Mr Bosquet. The Carre d'Art, which stands opposite
the Maison Carree, an exquisite Roman temple, is the most ambitious of all
the architectural schemes initiated by Mr Bosquet in his decade as mayor.
When Mr Bosquet was elected, Nimes was a firm fixture on the Mediterranean
tourist trail, thanks to its Roman amphitheatre, the Maison Carree and its
labyrinthine 18th century centre, but it was also a sleepy city with a
dwindling population.
The new mayor decided to put his city, and himself, on the map by making the
most of the new urban planning powers devolved down to regional government
by the socialists' decentralisation strategy. Just as President Francois
Mitterrand embarked upon his grands projets, the monumental modern
architectural schemes in Paris, so Mr Bosquet launched his own petits
projets in Nimes.
Jean Nouvel, the futuristic French architect behind the L'Institut du Monde
Arabe in Paris, was commissioned to build the ship-shaped Nemausus public
housing project. Vittorio Gregotti designed the Costieres sports stadium.
Philippe Starck, the funky Paris designer, dreamed up a new city insignia
and a bus stop.
But the most spectacular scheme of all is the Carre d'Art. It is Sir
Norman's first commission in France and one of his few buildings in an
urban, rather than a rural, context. He conceived it as a contemporary
counterpart to the Maison Carree. The Carre d'Art is a thoroughly modern
monument in glass and steel, modelled on the columns of the original temple.
Inside the Carre d'Art is Nimes' 20th century art collection, which includes
works by Picasso, Richard Long, Julian Schnabel and Marcel Duchamp. It also
doubles as a library, thus fulfilling the same role for Nimes as the Centre
Georges Pompidou for Paris.
There are other petits projets still in the pipeline, notably the
construction of the new university (to accommodate 4,000 students) beside
the 17th century Fort Vauban. But the emphasis of Mr Bosquet's policy is now
moving towards a long-term urban planning initiative intended to redefine
the entire city, by reinforcing its boundaries and fusing the ancient and
modern aspects of its architecture.
'It's a question of coherence,' says Mr Joseph Juvin, head of Nimes Agence
d'Urbanisme. 'We want Nimes to be a vital, vibrant city, not a museum.'
This linchpin of this policy is the creation of a grand axe, a central axis
cutting through the city from the Jardins de la Fontaine in its ancient
centre to the tiny villages on its fringes. The architect is the same as for
the centrepiece of Mr Bosquet's petits projets - Sir Norman Foster.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (6): Film fun goes on - The annual
Cannes festival
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT was back in 1939, on the eve of World War II, that the French government
decided to launch an international film festival in the sunny Mediterranean
town of Cannes.
The outbreak of war forced the government to put its plans on ice. It was
not until 1946 that the newly formed Centre National de la Cinematographie
staged its very first Festival International du Film in the old casino in
the heart of Cannes.
The festival was more like a movie club than an international competition,
given that only 300 people attended and every film went away with a prize of
some sort or other. The organisers were also chronically short of cash. The
festival, intended from the beginning to be an annual event, was scrapped in
1948 and 1950 because of financial problems.
But the organisers determined to continue. In 1949 they launched the Palme
d'Or to be given to the film deemed to be the very best in the festival by a
specially selected jury of film makers and actors. The first winner was
Carol Reed's The Third Man starring Orson Welles.
Cannes has since gone from strength to strength. The festival has been
clouded by controversies from 1968 when it was cut short by les evenements,
the student riots, in Paris, to 1990 when screeching teenagers invaded the
town to mob Madonna, the pop star, when she arrived, clad only in a cream
satin Jean-Paul Gaultier corset, for the premiere of In Bed With Madonna.
But the business aspect of Cannes has become bigger and bigger. The number
of delegates has grown year after year from the paltry 300 at the first
festival in 1946 to a daunting 19,905 last year.
Star spotters are often doomed to disappointment. The big stars jet in for
their premieres, as Madonna did in 1990 and Sharon Stone last year for the
opening of Basic Instinct. But the producers prowling around the bars of the
Carlton or the Martinez, or power-lunching on the cafe terraces along the
boulevard Croisette, are more interested in counting digits on their
contracts than in signing up 'wannabe' starlets on the beach.
Cannes may have lost its lustre over the years, but it is still the annual
film event for the media. The number of journalists and photographers has
risen steadily from a respectable 700 in 1966 to 3,545 (from 1,945 different
publications or television programmes in 54 countries) last year.
The swanky suites in the Carlton Inter-Continental and the Martinez are
booked solid for festival week years in advance. Even lesser hotels are so
packed that most of the big producers and studio executives billet their
lackeys in their villas in Cannes itself or in the hills around the town.
Some delegates 'commute' daily to the festival from nearby Antibes, or even
Nice.
The 1993 festival is now in full swing. The hotels are as busy as ever. The
jury is in session, chaired by Louis Malle, the French film maker, aided and
abetted by Gary Oldman, the British actor who starred in Francis Ford
Coppola's Dracula and Emir Kusturica, the Bosnian director, whose Stories of
the Beehive won the Palme d'Or a few years ago.
As for the Palme d'Or, more than 20 films have entered this year's
competition. The shortest odds are on Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About
Nothing, Jane Campion's The Piano, and the Taviani brothers' Fiorile to win.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (8): Cote d'Azur, take a
sentimental journey - The region's museums and art galleries embellish its
glamorous image
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLING around the Cote d'Azur conjures images of Brigitte Bardot sunning
herself in Saint Tropez during the 1960s, or the packed pavement cafes of
coastal towns in the 1990s.
But there is another aspect to the Cote d'Azur, the tiny museums and art
galleries tucked away in the Provencal hills, or clinging to the cliffs
along the sea. These are the places that give a glimpse of the south before
the Bardot-boom and of the serene lifestyle that attracted some of Europe's
most famous artists - such as Renoir, Matisse and Picasso - to the region.
Musee Renoir is typical. It is a sturdy stone house perched in the hills
above Cagnes-sur-Mer where the painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, lived with
his wife and three sons from 1909 to 1919. The house and its contents have
been left intact. Renoir's wheelchair is still in the studio, as are his
easels, brushes and frames. The walls are hung with his paintings and those
of friends such as Bonnard and Dufy.
The garden is lovely, with ancient olive trees straggling down the hill and
a view that stretches to the Cape of Antibes. But the real appeal of the
museum, as with all France's musees sentimentaux, is that it is impossible
to visit without imagining what it was like when Renoir himself lived and
worked there. (Musee Renoir, avenue des Collettes, Cagnes-sur-Mer. Tel: 9320
6107.)
If Renoir was content with a simple rustic house, Pablo Picasso's taste was
a little more opulent. Picasso spent a long part of his life in the south,
but one of the best collections of his work is at Musee Grimaldi-Picasso on
the Antibes waterfront, where he lived for the summer and autumn of 1946.
Musee Grimaldi-Picasso is a pretty old stone castle with stunning views onto
the sea. The collection, although not as impressive as in the Musee Picasso
in Paris, has a decent selection of oil paintings, ceramics and sculpture,
most of which were completed while Picasso lived there. (Musee
Grimaldi-Picasso, place Mariejol, Antibes. Tel: 9334 9191.)
A little further along the coast from Antibes in the village of Biot is the
Musee National Fernand Leger, the fruit of a donation by his wife, Nadine,
to the French government, which houses one of the most extensive collections
of Leger's work.
The museum, contains many of Leger's most important paintings. The building,
a modernist edifice set in rolling lawns and embellished with Leger's own
brightly coloured friezes, is spectacular. The collection is illustrated by
sketches and photographs which give a glimpse of the gregarious artist's
life. (Musee National Fernand Leger, chemin du Val de Pome, Biot. Tel: 9365
6349.)
The Cote d'Azur also houses a number of private collections. Fondation
Ephrussi de Rothschild on Cap-Ferrat has an air of the Hollywood hills with
its motley assortment of antique treasures - a Grecian column here, a Gothic
doorway there - and its candy-coloured Italianate facade.
The house was built at the turn of the century as a home for the baroness'
collection of art and furniture, which ran from Tiepolo ceilings to Louis
XIV chairs, Beauvais tapestries, Fragonard paintings and the tiny circular
room on the ground floor where she entertained her lovers. (Fondation
Ephrussi de Rothschild, Cap-Ferrat. Tel: 9301 3309.)
A very different collection is lodged high in the hills near the village of
Saint-Paul-de-Vence at Fondation Maeght. This is the gallery bequeathed by
the Maeghts, a family of Paris art dealers, to house their private
collection and temporary exhibitions which include some of the best-known
names in modern art, including Giacometti, Miro, Arp and Zadkine. (Fondation
Maeght, 06570 Saint-Paul-de-Vence. Tel: 9332 8163.)
The village is also home to La Colombe d'Or, the famous restaurant, where
Picasso, Braque, Calder, Miro and Chagall used to eat, paying for their food
with their work. The restaurant, now run by the fourth generation of the
founding Roux family, has been left with an art collection - a Leger frieze
along the terrace, Braques and Picassos hung between the tables - which
would be the envy of many museums.
French foodies are wont to say that La Colombe d'Or's food is not as good as
it used to be - but they tend to say that about almost every restaurant. Its
tables quake under the weight of hearty Provence fare and it still scores a
respectable 12 out of 20 in the snooty Gault Millau guide. (La Colombe d'Or,
06570 Saint-Paul. Tel: 9332 8002.)
Visitors to Saint-Paul should also look in on the Chapelle du Rosaire in the
neighbouring village of Vence, a tiny church designed by Henri Matisse, who
believed that it included his finest pieces of stained glass. (Chapelle du
Rosaire, Avenue Henri Matisse, Vence.)

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (7): Pearls in a cobalt sea - The Spice
Islands' exotic charms and grizzly past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE sun sets over the idyllic island of Banda, the shadow cast by Gunung
Api volcano, with sulphurous fumes rising from its summit, acts as a
reminder of the island's turbulent past.
In the eastern reaches of the archipelago, Banda is one of the original
spice islands which attracted the European powers in the 16th century and
led to more than 300 years of Dutch colonial rule.
The spice islands - described in the florid language of guidebooks as
clusters of pearls resting in a cobalt-blue sea - are now attracting their
first tourists. To greet them in Banda is Mr Des Alwi, the Chief Orang Kaya
(traditional island leader), owner of the Maulana Hotel and much else
besides in the main town of Bandaneira.
Mr Alwi is credited by many, including himself, with rescuing the local
economy. Well-connected to several key figures in the Jakarta government, he
is largely responsible for the arrival of electric power, for improving the
town's roads and the construction of a small airstrip.
The flow of tourists is likely to increase after a British Sunday newspaper
named the Maulana Hotel as one of the world's finest. Its nomination might
be considered fortunate given the lack of hot water, the miserably thin
mattresses and the compulsory fare of fried fish and rice. It is a measure,
however, of the island's and Mr Alwi's charm that beer, cake and a setting
sun can still conjure up a feeling of blissful satisfaction.
Bandaneira town, with its balustraded colonial houses, often in a state of
overgrown ruin, has an unhurried pace of life and an almost unnaturally
peaceful air. Caught in one of many free moments, Mr Alwi responded to a
popularly held theory that Indonesia is a Javanese empire and, by extension,
his island a colonial territory.
Jakarta, 1,500 miles to the west and two time zones away, is so distant as
to rarely enter the island's consciousness, he explained. Instead, if a bete
noire had to be chosen, it would be the provincial government in Ambon, an
island 10 hours by boat to the north.
Five administrative officials sent by Ambon had recently been removed from
Banda on the grounds of corruption, whilst an Ambon civil servant's order
licensing 38 guest houses in Bandaneira had been rescinded after he
intervened, Mr Alwi said.
Whilst too many guesthouses would be as damaging as too few, Mr Alwi is
sensitive to criticism of protecting his near monopoly of the town's tourist
accommodation. There's no pleasing everyone, he says, announcing that the
profits from his hotel are ploughed back into renovating Banda's historic
buildings.
And however great the authority he wields, Mr Alwi is certainly more
benevolent than the Dutch who first visited Banda in 1599 and took the
region by force 22 years later.
Banda and its neighbouring islands were the world's sole source for high
quality nutmeg, an essential ingredient in preserving meat in the years
before refrigeration, whilst to the north of Ambon lie the islands of
Ternate and Tidore, the original source of cloves.
The islands were a source of considerable wealth and the Dutch employed
savage means to impose their rule. In 1621, Jan Pieterszoon Coen arrived in
Banda to take up residence as governor general with an army of nearly 2,000
men, including about 100 Japanese mercenaries.
Interpreting the collapse of a ceiling lamp in the governor's residence as
an assassination attempt, the Dutch extracted retribution by razing villages
and engaging in mass-slaughter.
In one incident 44 condemned prisoners, including eight orang kaya, were
beheaded and quartered by Japanese mercenaries. An eyewitness described the
execution as 'awful to see. The orang kaya died silently without uttering
any sound except that one of them ..said, 'Sirs, have you then no mercy?'.'
Of an estimated 15,000 population on Banda and the surrounding islands, only
about 1,000 survived the massacres.
As with the clove harvest in Ternate and Tidore, the Dutch imposed a trading
monopoly over Banda's lucrative nutmeg crop with the islands' annual exports
valued at the equivalent of Dollars 30m today. But rampant corruption and a
lack of basic financial accounting infected the United East India Company
(VOC) monopoly and in the 1790s it went bust owing more than Dollars 160m in
today's money.
In his book Indonesian Banda, Willard Hanna, a former US diplomat in
Jakarta, blames 'the unworkable principle of monopoly' for the company's
collapse and notes 'the enormously wealthy and powerful VOC may have been a
losing proposition all along'.
How little times change and how hard are the lessons of history won, note
current Indonesian economists. Freed of the Dutch colonial yoke, in an
ironical twist of fate a new, privately-owned, trading monopoly was imposed
on clove farmers two years ago.
Chaired by Mr Hutomo 'Tommy' Mandala Putra, youngest son of President
Suharto, the new monopoly has received moe than Rp1,000bn in mostly soft
credits from state-owned banks. Not only has the monopoly been unable to
service even the interest on the debt, the actual price of cloves, used in
Indonesia's fragrant kretek cigarettes, received by farmers has fallen.
Banda's remaining nutmeg producers might regard themselves as fortunate
their spice has insufficient value to attract a modern-day monopoly. The
comfort, however, will be small with the collapse of the nutmeg trade
pushing the islanders back toward subsistence farming.
Where nutmeg plantations once stood, ubiquitous cassava is now grown and Mr
Alwi may be correct in seeing tourism as the only means of improving the
local economy. But to succeed, the people of Banda must prevent history
repeating itself. They must follow the example of Mr Alwi and, with big
smile and arms spread wide, exploit the wealth of foreign visitors, not
vice-versa.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (6): Achilles Heel of the business
sector - Private banks are paying the price for injudicious lending during
the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING

<TEXT>
PLACED in the corner of the central bank governor's waiting room last
November was the medical apparatus to measure blood pressure. It was a sign,
perhaps, that the banking system, burdened with non-performing loans, was
taking its toll on those assigned to supervise it.
Indonesia is still feeling the effects of financial sector deregulation
initiated five years ago. By the end of 1992 banking sector assets had
almost tripled to Rp123,689bn, while there has been concomitant growth - to
over 200 - in the number of banks.
While the increase in availability of credit helped to develop a new
generation of profitable, export-oriented industries, not all loans were so
well-placed. Indeed, rather than represent the cornerstone of growth, the
sector is now the economy's greatest weakness.
The problems of a rapid expansion in credit combined with ill-trained and
incompetent management were highlighted last December when the government
ordered the liquidation of Bank Summa, one of the country's top 10 private
banks.
Owned by the wealthy Soeryadjaya family, the bank became heavily exposed to
property companies in which the Soeryadjayas held an interest.
After domestic and international property prices fell in 1990/91, the bank's
loans began to turn sour. When Bank Indonesia (BI), the central bank,
finally stepped in, Bank Summa had Rp1,600bn in outstanding obligations and
only a fraction of that in way of collateral.
While BI officials argued that Bank Summa was a unique instance, their
figures for the banking sector's non-performing loans are almost certainly
too low. A week before closing Bank Summa's tills, BI put the sector's bad
debts at less than Rp3,000bn and the total non-performing loans (on which no
interest had been paid for three months and over) at just Rp7,400bn.
Banks have shown an 'extraordinary reluctance to categorise anything as a
bad debt which has been collateralised or which is outstanding to people who
they believe can afford to pay,' says a senior donor official.
And BI appears to have shown naivete in believing the banks' explanations of
their books: collateral may be inadequate or difficult to secure, while the
practice of collateralising interest payments on overdue loans to the
wealthy encourages non-payment.
Given the scale of Bank Summa's debts, the tales of graft within the five
state commercial banks (which account for half the sector's assets) and the
poor credit analysis of most private banks, the scale of problem loans may
be substantial.
Most bankers estimate that 25 per cent or Rp17,000bn of the state banks'
loan portfolios are non-performing. Estimates of the non-performing loans of
private domestic banks range from six to 15 per cent of their portfolios
(Rp2,540bn-Rp6,350bn). In the worst case scenario, the non-performing loans
of the sector would be equal to BI's international reserves.
Of equal concern is the failure of banks to provide sufficiently against bad
debt. Banking analysts say a minimum of 2.5 per cent of productive assets
should be provided for non-performing loans but, in 1992, of Indonesia's top
six listed banks, arguably among the country's best managed, none reached
this level.
Brokers treat with scepticism, therefore, the higher net-profits reported by
most banks last year.
A broker explains: 'If banks provided adequately for their non-performing
loans, most would be running at a loss,' even given the high spreads between
deposit rates of 14-16 per cent and lending rates of 22 per cent and higher.
While the banking sector is fragile, however, it is not necessarily in
danger of collapse. Economists point out that the relative scale of
non-performing loans can be reduced by continued economic growth and natural
expansion in money supply.
The top private banks are currently launching large bond issues to raise new
capital in anticipation of sharp increases in their deposit base and lending
portfolios this year. Whether new loans, however, can be made on a more
prudent basis depends largely upon better supervision by BI and the strict
imposition of banking regulations.
Newly installed cabinet ministers have expressed their determinations to
pull the sector into line. Mr Saleh Afiff, senior economics minister, said
in an interview that the government was 'very concerned about the state
banks and the banking system as a whole. We have to do something ..We will
take steps first to know what is the size of the bad debt.'
Mr Sudradjat Djiwandono, the newly-appointed central bank governor, has a
reputation as a competent, single-minded administrator and the replacement
of BI's board in April has met with the approval of foreign donors.
Bankers also note that steps taken by the last government to improve banking
supervision should soon begin to bear fruit. Banks were told to raise their
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) to seven per cent by the end of last March, a
figure reached by most private banks, and to eight per cent by next year.
BI has also been training-up new teams of auditors. While these have mostly
confined themselves to auditing foreign banks to date, they should soon be
delving into the disorderly books of the private banks. Ministers say they
will insist on the merger or closure of poorly run banks.
Last August the government completed a reshuffle of the state banks' boards
and issued a stern warning that the practice of 'memo-lending' - where banks
lend on the basis of clients' political connections, not their credit
worthiness - must cease.
Concerted efforts are also underway to raise the capital base of the state
banks, which economists estimate needs to be doubled if they are to attain
the government's CAR targets. The World Bank has made a Dollars 300m loan to
inject capital into the state banks and the government has requested donor
permission to convert more than Dollars 1bn in two-step loans being
channeled through the state banks into either tier-two capital or equity.
Consolidation within the banking sector is likely to be a slow and painful
process. Last year the assets of the private domestic banks grew just 1.2
per cent.
A condition of the World Bank loan to the state banks is a limit on loans
growth to less than 15 per cent a year. For Indonesian businesses,
therefore, new lines of domestic credit are likely to remain both hard to
come by and expensive.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (5): An economy that is too big to
ignore - Most Jakarta stockbrokers are in difficulties but look foward to
better times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCKBROKERS in Jakarta, used to the good life of chauffeur-driven cars,
wood-panelled offices and generous housing allowances, are facing the
challenge of justifying their expense. While a few security houses claim a
profit on their trading operations, brokers admit the majority of foreign
and local houses are running at a loss.
Few brokers, however, doubt the long-term potential of the Jakarta stock
market; a presence in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country,
will remain a must for foreign brokerages.
'It fits in nicely with the south-east Asia package security houses offer,'
says Ms Jacqueline Lenterman, head of research for Jardine Fleming in
Jakarta, adding that an active trading department is necessary to service
the profit-making corporate finance operations.
The market is still recovering from the trauma of a boom to bust cycle in
1990-91 when the composite index crashed from 682 points to 225. The result
has been a damaging loss of confidence of local investors in equities.
Company dividends only yield about four per cent, while bank deposit rates
of 14 per cent are still available. Brokers complain local investors have a
poor understanding of capital growth.
Local investors retort that they have seen the value of their shares halved
in the last two years.
Foreign investors, in particular global and regional fund managers required
to have Indonesian exposure, are now the market's key players in terms of
trading volume and in raising finance for new issues. A foreign broker says:
'We technically have a public offering in Indonesia but in practical terms
we pre-place shares with foreigners.'
This has, however, exacerbated the market's illiquidity as foreign
institutions tend to buy large blocks of shares as long-term investments.
Anthony Davies, managing director of Baring Securities Indonesia, says: 'The
foreigners are the long-term players, It's the locals who create the
day-to-day volume which makes a market.'
As a result, trading volume has remained stagnant, averaging just Dollars
13.2m a day last year, compared with Dollars 12.4m in 1991 and Dollars 16m
in 1990.
Although in the last two years 30 new companies have listed - bringing to
158 the total number of listed companies - the market's capitalisation has
fallen from Dollars 24.4bn in 1990 to Dollars 19.3bn at the end of last
year.
One way of improving liquidity would be to mobilise pension funds into
becoming active participants in the market. The two principal state-funds,
Taspen and Astek, held assets equivalent to Dollars 3.2bn at the end of
1991, but only about Dollars 200m in equities, compared withg more than
Dollars 1.9bn in time deposits.
An equally cautious approach to equities has been adopted by private pension
schemes with estimated assets of Dollars 4.5bn, insurance companies with
more than Dollars 800m in assets and five major charitable foundations
chaired by President Suharto with funds of about Dollars 1.5bn.
A new pension law, however, regulating the assets pension funds may hold
should increase their holdings of equities. Brokers say the shift may be
gradual but could lead to pension funds investing a further Dollars 250m in
the stock market within a year.
The government is also expected to support the creation of investment funds,
which would allow small pension funds to pool assets. At least two companies
are planning onshore funds, listed on the Jakarta stock exchange, investing
in equities, bonds and government paper.
Other moves being considered by the government to improve liquidity include:
allowing foreigners to buy more than 49 per cent of a company's listed
shares, the current limit; removing capital gains tax payable by local
investors; and accelerating a move toward scripless trading.
The need for an improved trading system was underlined in March when two
fraudsters sold about Rp12bn of fake shares into the market. Trading in five
of Indonesia's largest and most actively traded companies was suspended
whilst the scam was investigated.
The forged share certificates were of exceptionally high quality, carrying
brokers' stamps, correct identification numbers and passing ultra-violet
tests on water-marks. More worrying, however, was an admission by stock
exchange officials that the printing quality of a third of genuine share
certificates is sub-standard.
The week before the scandal broke the market was in bullish mood with
turnover exceeding Rp500bn. Trading volume in the following week was less
then Rp100bn. But as Mr Davies explains, market illiquidity is not just a
function of a poor trading system, 'it's a matter of there not being enough
shares around'.
This stems from the willingness of Bapepam, the government's capital markets
authority, to allow companies to float just a small minority of shares to
the public, whilst keeping the majority in the founders' hands.
The estimated 'free-float' of shares (those actively traded) for Bank
Internasional Indonesia, the largest listed bank, is 11 per cent; for Gudang
Garam, the dominant cigarette manufacturer, 12 per cent; for Indocement, the
country's largest listed company, 13 per cent. Whilst brokers publish glossy
equity lists recommending investors to buy into companies, in practical
terms the stock is simply not available.
Some brokers suggest the government should insist on the majority
shareholders of existing listed companies further diluting their stake and
demanding that new companies coming to the market have a minimum 'free
float' of 25 per cent.
Such a move, however, could be counter-productive. Owners of private
companies could become wary of going public if the government sets a
precedent of forcing majority shareholders to sell off their holdings.
Brokers still believe Indonesia will follow the path of Thailand and
Malaysia to become a major emerging market with a daily turnover of Dollars
100m plus. They also concede, however, that deep-rooted structural problems
within the market will take several years to overcome.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (5): Swing to right breaks
tradition - Toulouse awaits an upturn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RED and yellow Occitan flag, the symbol of the Languedoc region that
dominated Southern France in medieval times, still flutters above the towers
and turrets of Toulouse.
Toulouse, the centre of the Midi-Pyrenees region, has a long history of
intellectual and political independence from northern France. It began with
the Occitans in the Middle Ages, went on with Jean Jaures, the 19th century
dissident writer who founded L'Humanite, the communist newspaper, and
continued with the left-wing liberalism that infused the city's politics
until the early 1990s.
But this spring's parliamentary elections marked a dramatic break with that
tradition. The centre-right coalition won a sweeping victory against the old
socialist government but nowhere was the scale of the swing from left to
right more extreme than in Toulouse. The city went into the elections as a
socialist stronghold with seven of its eight deputies belonging to the left.
The result of the elections reversed the balance of political power with the
right winning all but one seat.
To some extent, this political shift can be explained by l'effet Baudis, or
the influence of Dominique Baudis, the dynamic centre-right mayor of
Toulouse. Mr Baudis, son of Pierre Baudis, another prominent local
politician, abandoned his previous career as a television presenter to
follow his father into politics and has since revitalised the local scene.
But the right's success really reflects the French electorate's disillusion
with the left after almost a decade of government by the scandal-scarred
socialists and its concern about the impact of the slowdown in the French
economy, particularly on employment levels.
Until recently Toulouse, which has a population of 360,000 in the city
itself and of 650,336 with its environs, was relatively resilient to the
pressures on the rest of the economy. The unemployment level at the
beginning of last year was 9 per cent, slightly lower than the national
average.
Toulouse was, after all, sheltered by its role as a centre for aerospace and
electronics. Aerospace companies converged on the city after World War 1
when many of France's foremost aircraft makers moved there as part of the
government's strategy of basing militarily sensitive sectors as far away as
possible from the German border. Aerospace is still the biggest single
source of jobs in the city because of the presence of large groups including
Aerospatiale, Matra and the Airbus consortium.
The infrastructure of research and training facilities built to service
these groups has also encouraged electronics companies to move to the area,
thereby creating another source of jobs from such companies as Siemens of
Germany, Motorola of the US and France's Thomson.
However Toulouse has, in the past year, fallen prey to the same vicious
cycle of crumbling confidence and rising job losses that has hit the rest of
France. The level of unemployment is now the same as the national average at
around 10 per cent.
The large aerospace groups have remained more or less intact. Aerospatiale,
which two years ago opened its huge new state-of-the-art Clement Ader
assembly plant, has managed to avoid any job losses among its 8,500
employees. But it was forced earlier this year to put one of its factories
on short-time working and has, like its competitors, cut orders to
sub-contractors.
The same pattern has been replicated in electronics, with the big companies
reducing supplies from sub-contractors in order to protect their own
operations. As a result, many of the smaller businesses in Toulouse and the
Midi-Pyrenees region have come under intense pressure.
The future looks more promising. The local economic development units,
Technopole Toulouse and the Bureau Regional d'Industrialisation at d'Acceuil
Midi-Pyrenees, both report that, although companies are cutting down on
investment, the area has maintained a healthy level of job creation.
In the medium term Toulouse is expected to benefit from the decentralisation
strategies now being implemented by a number of state-controlled French
companies. Air Inter, the domestic airline, is opening a data processing
centre in the city this summer which will employ 500 people. Air France will
arrive next summer with another 500 jobs.
The long-term outlook for the aerospace and electronics sectors is also
encouraging. The critical question for aerospace is when the worldwide
market will recover from three years of recession. Aerospatiale says that,
so far, there is no real evidence of improvement apart from a slight
increase in orders from regional airlines, which led the industry into the
slump and so might lead it out.
Meanwhile, many of the local electronics companies are small to medium-sized
concerns operating in specialised, value-added niches of global markets with
strong growth potential.
ATG Gigadisc is typical. It is a medium-sized business with 120 employees
and is a leading European player in the market for optical discs. ATG
managed to maintain sales of FFr109m in 1992, but was forced to reduce its
staff by about 10 people when demand declined. Business has since picked up,
particularly in the US, its main export market, making the company more
confident about the future.
Just as its strength in aerospace and electronics helped Toulouse to prosper
in the buoyant economic climate of the 1980s, so the local politicians hope
that those sectors will haul it out of the doldrums in the early 1990s -
whatever the change in the political complexion of the city.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (4): Coming in from the cold -
There are hopes of a new era of conciliation for Marseille
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG ago Julius Caesar, ruler of the Roman Empire, was waging war against
Pompey. The city of Marseille, forced to choose between the two camps,
plumped for Pompey.
'We chose the wrong side,' says Mr Jean Pellegrino, deputy chief executive
of Marseille city council. 'Caesar defeated Pompey and sent his soldiers to
wreak revenge on Marseille. The city was destroyed.'
Mr Pellegrino, like many others involved in the politics of modern
Marseille, suspects that the theme of political isolation still haunts the
city today. Marseille's socialist city council was shunned by the Gaullist
governments of the 1960s and 1970s. The city stayed out in the cold during
the socialist administrations of the 1980s when Mr Robert Vigouroux, the
iconoclastic socialist mayor clashed with the party establishment in the
Bouches-du-Rhones region.
After the conservative landslide in this spring's legislative elections, Mr
Vigouroux is trying to rebuild links with the region and with Mr Edouard
Balladur's centre-right government in the hope that the change in the French
political climate will herald a new era of conciliation for Marseille.
The city has undoubtedly suffered from its political isolation. It missed
out both on the industrial initiatives of the Pompidou presidency in early
1970s and from the socialists' decentralisation policy in the 1980s. It is
instructive that Marseille is one of the few major French cities without
access to the high-speed TGV rail network. The TGV link comes on stream in
three years.
Marseille is also the victim of its own history. The city, which traces its
roots to 600BC when it was founded by the Greeks, flourished during the
French empire when it was the fulcrum for trade between France and its North
African colonies.
The colonial trade withered when the empire dispersed in the post-war
period. The port fell into decline, as did the factories that had been
making goods to sell to the colonies. The last Marseille soapworks closed
three years ago. The city's problems were aggravated in the late 1950s and
early 1960s by the arrival of 200,000 pieds noirs immigrants from the old
colonies, all searching for housing and jobs.
Marseille slipped into decline. Businesses left the city to move to the
tax-efficient enterprise zones on its fringes. The pieds noirs left, too.
The population fell by 30,000 between 1974 and 1982 and by 80,000 over the
next 10 years. The city, which once had nearly 1m inhabitants, is now
reduced to 800,000.
The situation has been made worse by the the quarrels among local
politicians, and their disputes with Bouches-du-Rhone colleagues, notably Mr
Bernard Tapie, the businessman and former minister who chairs the Olympique
Marseille football club.
There is also the omnipresent threat of racial tension fuelled by the high
rate of joblessness which, at 19 per cent, is almost twice the national
average and reaches 30 per cent in the most deprived areas of the city. The
picturesque, but peeling, facades along the waterfront symbolise the city's
problems. Even the Mafia has fled. The main figures in Cote d'Azur crime
have moved on to richer pickings in Nice.
'We've come to the end of two cycles of historic change - the arrival of the
pieds noirs and the decline of the colonial trade,' says Mr Pellegrino. 'I
hope we are now at the start of a new cycle.'
There are some positive signs. Mr Vigouroux has managed to soothe the racial
tension in the city. The Gulf War was seen as a litmus test. The mayor took
pre-emptive action by inviting all the city's religious leaders to the Hotel
de Ville at the start of the conflict. This display of solidarity seemed to
work. Marseille did not experience one instance of racial hostility during
the war.
The calmer racial climate is also reflected in the fading support for the
extreme right-wing National Front which peaked during the 1988 elections
when it received 23 per cent of the votes. Its share slipped to less than 20
per cent in this spring's poll. The centre-right swept the board, winning
five of the city's seven parliamentary seats from the left, leaving the
socialists and communists with one seat each.
The city has also made some progress in resolving its financial problems.
Marseille incurred heavy debts during the late 1980s, mainly due to the
FFr4bn bill for two subway lines and a water treatment station. The council
has since cut costs and delegated to the private sector some projects, such
as the construction of an underground roadway. The level of debt has already
fallen from FFr11bn to FFr9bn.
Marseille is now in the throes of implementing an economic regeneration
strategy. Mr Jean Clavier, head of economic development, has identified a
number of measures, such as more flexible planning policies, to try to
dissuade companies from leaving the city. He also hopes Marseille will be
able 'to build on its historic strengths' in medicine and the port to
attract new investment.
This is a difficult time to engineer an economic revival. The French economy
is in a delicate state and interest rates are still too high, despite the
recent reductions, for companies to feel confident about sanctioning new
investment. The strong franc could discourage foreign companies from setting
up in France. There is also, of course, tough competition for inward
investment from other cities.
But local officials are cheered by the more conciliatory political mood. 'At
last there is a real will to forget political differences and to build a new
consensus for Marseille,' says Mr Clavier. 'After all, the city needs it.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (4): Exporter will join the importers -
Energy shortages loom for an oil-rich country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE INDONESIAN archipelago is famously rich in sources of energy
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
oil, gas, coal and geothermal and hydroelectric power - but the country
faces some hard decisions about where to invest the billions of dollars that
will be needed to provide more fuel for its economic development in the next
century.
Oil exports have financed Indonesia's rapid industrialisation since the
1960s, and Indonesia has been a member of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries since 1962. But within the next 10 years or so Indonesia
is likely to become a net importer of oil as domestic consumption grows and
production falls.
Latest projections from the central bank in Jakarta show the net current
account contribution of oil dropping to Dollars 930m in the 1993/94
financial year from Dollars 2.19bn in 1992/93. Oil output last year fell to
about 1.5m barrels a day, six per cent below the level in 1991.
In recent years there has been plenty of exploration by the scores of oil
companies operating in Indonesia, but few substantial discoveries.
Whereas the first wave of contracts awarded in the 1960s and 1970s proved to
be remarkably successful - about a dozen out of 55 are still estimated to be
profitably producing today - the more recent results have been miserable; of
more than 130 contracts agreed since 1976, only one is thought to be both
producing and making a profit.
'Clearly the industry has been spectacularly unsuccessful over the last 18
years,' said an oil company executive.
It is rare in any oil-producing country to find a foreign oil company which
would be so rash as to declare itself satisfied with the profit-sharing
conditions of the host government, but there does appear to be a genuine
concern about the high costs and low rewards of operating in Indonesia - a
concern acknowledged by the government's decision to improve incentives
three times in the last five years.
The latest round of incentives announced in September last year were aimed
principally at encouraging companies to look for gas and to explore for
hydrocarbons in deep water and in remote areas, but the response from the
oil companies has been unenthusiastic.
A few companies closed their offices in Indonesia last year or reduced
staff, and others are looking with renewed interest at other prospects in
Vietnam, China, India, the Philippines and the former Soviet Union.
Existing oil producers want Indonesia to scrap its 'ring-fencing' of
production sharing contracts, a change which would allow them to offset
costs in new exploration areas against their earnings but would also
unfairly disadvantage oil companies without any current production in
Indonesia.
For Indonesia, the benefits of such a step - which the authorities have
shown no sign of taking - would be to promote the search for oil and gas in
eastern areas hitherto only thinly explored. With wells in remote, deep
water areas costing up to Dollars 30m each, it is hardly surprising that
about 80 per cent of exploration at present takes place in existing
production areas, mostly in the west.
Gas is as crucial as oil to the wellbeing of the Indonesian economy. The
country is the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG),
shipping about Dollars 4bn worth a year to Japan and other countries, and
the government is keen to promote domestic use of natural gas to reduce
local demand for oil and so free more crude for export.
The largest known deposit of gas in Indonesia - and south-east Asia - is the
Natuna field in the south China sea. Its size presents both opportunities
and problems. Pertamina, the state oil and gas company, and Exxon of the US
have yet to finalise terms on developing the giant field, and even when they
do they will face daunting technical and financial challenges before being
able to make the first LNG shipments eight years later.
Natuna, with an estimated 45 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, represents
about half of Indonesia's known reserves. But 70 per cent of the corrosive
mixture to be extracted from the wells is carbon dioxide, requiring costly
separation and re-injection facilities and special corrosion resistant
materials.
About 700,000 tonnes of steel would be required for the offshore facilities,
and the valves and fittings for the treatment platforms would be among the
largest available. The total cost of the project is likely to be more than
Dollars 16bn.
The more mundane business of developing smaller gas deposits for domestic
power stations and other consumers is less daunting, but not without its own
obstacles; there are at least 79 known fields too small to be exploited for
export.
Oil companies are sometimes reluctant to admit they have found gas because
they fear they will not be able to develop it profitably. The French company
Total has made finds off Borneo, which may help to extend the life of
Indonesian LNG exports, but some scattered gas deposits found elsewhere
years ago have never been developed because they are too small for LNG and
too far from domestic consumers to justify the construction of a pipeline.
The Indonesian government is struggling to develop a coherent domestic gas
distribution policy, but Pertamina is said to be unwilling to give up too
much influence to Perum Gas Negara (PGN), the state gas distributor which is
expected to develop gas transmission systems. Indonesia has complex
bureaucracy as well as complex geology.
'It's becoming urgent because of the high demand,' said a senior PGN
official. 'It's very urgent and I hope that this will be fully understood by
all the bureaucrats in the government.'
Some steps, however, have been taken. After more than a year's delay, a
pipeline from an Arco-operated field off east Java is being built to supply
a new power station at Gresik near Surabaya. Future projects may include
pipelines from south Sumatra gas fields south to energy-hungry west Java and
north to the huge Duri field operated by Caltex - to replace oil currently
burned in making steam which is injected into the reservoir to heat and lift
the heavy crude.
Another strategy adopted to conserve oil has been to increase the domestic
retail price of fuel - which had been below world prices. Most petroleum
product prices were raised by more than 20 per cent in January, and although
the authorities are concerned about the inflationary effects of the
increase, further rises may follow in coming years to suppress growing
demand and promote the use of gas.
The man responsible for the sensitive task of directing energy policy is Gen
IB Sudjana, who is said to have a background in army logistics and no
experience of the oil and gas industry. He was appointed minister of mining
and energy in the March cabinet reshuffle. 'It came as a surprise to a lot
of people, probably including the minister himself,' said a leading Jakarta
businessman.
One energy source he can look to with confidence, both for domestic use and
for exports, is coal. Production is rising fast following the welcome given
to foreign investors in the 1980s. Indonesia has 32bn tonnes of coal and
lignite reserves. Exports doubled last year to 15m tonnes. By 1995,
Indonesia should be producing 35m tonnes, of which about 21m will be
exported.
This year, Indonesia is expected to overtake Colombia as the world's fourth
largest coal exporter, behind Australia, South Africa and the US.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (3): Crime, prosperity and science
 -Nice, the changing face of a not-so-French city
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM time to time Nice-Matin, the daily newspaper for the Cote d'Azur,
produces special supplements on subjects of local interest. Most of the
supplements, like the rest of the newspaper, are published in French, but
these days some are in Italian.
Nice, as its inhabitants are swift to say, is not a French city. It has
belonged to France for just over a century. Previously it was an Italian
state as part of Savoy, the Nicois spoke a local patois, not French, and the
Cote d'Azur was called the Riviera.
For the first half of its 'French' century, Nice's Italian origins were a
burden rather than a boon. Marseille was, after all, well-established as the
main French port for trade in the Mediterranean and with France's North
African colonies. The Nicois, isolated from the newly unified Italy, were
left to adapt to their new nationality.
But since the 1960s, as Marseille has declined with the collapse of its old
colonial trade, Nice has been free to redefine itself as a centre for the
new industries of the future - electronics, information technology and
telecommunications. At a time when other cities are still struggling to
attract investment, Nice's business parks are packed with French and foreign
companies.
The Nice of today has a prosperous air, with the mirror glass towers in the
business parks around the airport and the spruce hotels with their pretty
palm trees along the promenade des Anglais. Affluent expatriates are still
arriving to swell the city's 400,000-strong population and unemployment is
only a little higher than the national average at 11 per cent.
But Nice also has its problems. One issue is the crime rate. Nice is now the
centre for major crime in southern France. A glance at the front page of
Nice-Matin, with its apparently endless tales of drug hauls and sinister
Mafia murders, illustrates the consequences.
On the political front the city is still reeling from the disgrace of Mr
Jacques Medecin, its long-serving conservative mayor and the architect of a
string of successful local initiatives, notably the Acropolis conference
centre and the network of waterfront highways.
Mr Medecin, whose father, Jean, was mayor before him, was the architect of
modern Nice. He initiated a string of public works schemes and drummed up
high technology investment to broaden the base of the local economy. But
three years ago he fled into exile in Uruguay in the midst of a simmering
scandal.
Nice is still in conservative hands. But Mr Medecin's departure robbed it of
its most authoritative political leader. This left a political vacuum which
has undoubtedly helped to fuel the rise of another prominent figure in
Nicois politics, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing
National Front.
Mr Le Pen is not a Nicois (he was born in Brittany) but he has turned the
city into his base for the Front's assault on national politics. He lost his
fight for a Nice constituency in this spring's parliamentary elections. But
his anti-immigration policies, combined with his success in making the Front
respectable by attracting petit bourgeois supporters, have struck a chord in
Nice and the rest of southern France.
The image of Mr Le Pen and his sometimes violent skinhead supporters at
their seafront rallies and marches is a side of Nice that local businessmen
would rather forget. They prefer to dwell on the positive aspects of the
city's cosmopolitan culture - its success in attracting international
investment.
The linchpin of Nice's success is the Sophia-Antipolis science park,
nestling 20km away in the Provence hills above Antibes. The science park was
founded in 1969 but expanded rapidly in the 1980s and now includes more than
900 companies spread over 2,300 hectares.
Cordis, a products company, arrived there in 1984 as the southern European
base for its US parent company. It now employs 150 people, mostly
highly-skilled production workers and researchers. Mr Jacques Le Guillerm,
chief executive, says the availability of skilled labour and good
international air links were the chief criteria for choosing
Sophia-Antipolis. The only disadvantage, he says, is the shortage of local
machinery suppliers, which has raised the cost and time of new product
development.
One of the latest trends in Sophia-Antipolis is the arrival of smaller
international businesses. Tepar is typical. A joint venture between five
multinational oil groups including Elf Aquitaine in France and Texaco of the
US, it is composed of a team of seven international oil executives who are
launching Pan Diesel Card, a pan-European payment card for truck drivers.
Tepar started in offices near Elf's headquarters in Paris, but looked for a
cheaper location for its own small operation and the data processing unit
that services it. Mr Carl Clump, chief executive, says its main requirements
were the availability of multilingual staff for the truckers' help desk and
good air links for the Tepar executives - both of which Sophia-Antipolis
provides.
Other small businesses have chosen cheaper locations in the business centres
around Nice airport. But, despite the recession, more companies like Tepar
are still arriving at Sophia-Antipolis, which is now doubling in size to
accommodate extra demand.
Cote d'Azur Development says that the level of interest in the sunny Riviera
among prospective new investors is still so high that not only are more
small business centres being built but there are also plans for a new,
large-scale business park in the hills above Monaco on the border with
Italy.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (2): Jobs challenge for Freche -
Montpellier has become a dynamic city. But the locals are missing out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGES FRECHE is not a man to shy away from a fight. In his 16 years as
socialist mayor of Montpellier he has clashed with everyone from the gros
elephants, who run the Socialist party, to Jean Bosquet, his conservative
counterpart in the nearby city of Nimes.
So far, Mr Freche's pugilism seems to have paid off. He has turned
Montpellier into one of France's most dynamic cities, with a string of arts
initiatives, social programmes and ambitious architectural schemes starting
with Antigone, the post-modernist development created by Ricardo Bofill, the
Catalan architect, and continuing with the new Port Marianne development.
Montpellier is at a watershed in its development. Mr Freche's reforms have
helped the city attract a steady flow of inward investment, mainly from
hi-tech and pharmaceutical companies. But most of the new jobs have gone to
outsiders, drawn to the south by the lure of a sunny, less stressful life.
As a result, the level of unemployment has stayed stubbornly above the
national average and is now around 14 per cent.
Mr Freche faces the challenge of trying to improve employment prospects for
the locals at a difficult time when the French economy is still in a fragile
condition and the swing to the right in this spring's legislative elections
has left him increasingly isolated in the political sphere.
Montpellier does, at least, have a sound base to build on. Mr Freche, a
former academic, joined forces with a group of like-minded academics when he
became mayor to map out a long-term strategy.
The result, according to Mr Patrick Geneste, director of the Ecole National
Superieur de Chimie in Montpellier and head of the Technopole economic
development project, was a comprehensive policy that embraces every aspect
of life in the city - social, cultural and economic.
Montpellier, which now has a population of 300,000, traces its roots to the
10th century when it was the crossroads for the salt trade and the pilgrim
trail to St James de Compostelle. It has been renowned for its university
since the 12th century and is noted for its expertise in medicine and
science.
The academic tradition was still strong when Mr Freche became mayor in the
late 1970s. Today, one in six of the city's inhabitants are students. Mr
Freche realised the university could be one of Montpellier's main weapons in
the battle for investment against the larger centres of Toulouse and
Marseille which, unlike his city, have long historic links with industry.
One of Mr Freche's first initiatives was to revive the artistic life of
Montpellier by giving subsidies to reopen theatres, renovate museums,
inaugurate festivals and even to launch an orchestra, which now absorbs an
annual budget of FFr14m. He also brought in prominent figures to co-ordinate
activity in particular areas, notably Dominique Bagouet, the choreographer,
as head of dance.
Sport also received additional resources. 'It's just as important to have a
first division football team as an orchestra if you want to persuade people
to come and live here,' says Mr Geneste. The university was expanded. A new
faculty of law and economics is under construction as part of the first
phase of Port Marianne.
The most ambitious of all the Freche schemes was Antigone, a vast
residential and commercial complex covering 40 hectares of land previously
owned by the army, adjacent to the 17th and 18th century heart of
Montpellier. Antigone has been financed by both public and private money,
but the city council has recouped its investment (in building low cost
housing during the first phase of construction) by selling land to private
developers.
Antigone is now completed. The Place du Nombre d'Or, the first phase, is now
a lively square filled with trees and people. But the later phases are
conspicuously quieter with big 'To Rent' signs festooned across empty
offices. Antigone's admirers see it as a paradigm of public sector
development. Its critics complain the sheer scale of the Bofill design makes
it oppressive. 'It is the kind of place that people either love or loathe,'
says a city official.
However it is instructive that Port Marianne, the new development, has
adopted a more eclectic approach to design by commissioning a number of
different architects including Richard Meier, Christian de Portzamparc and
Ricardo Bofill.
Despite the criticism, Antigone has undoubtedly helped to establish
Montpellier as a cultural centre and, in turn, to persuade investors to come
to the city. Montpellier is too small to compete for large-scale investment.
It got on the shortlist for the relocation of Air Inter, the French domestic
airline, only to lose to Toulouse. But it has attracted a steady flow of new
companies, culminating in the arrival last year of Del Computers with 250
employees and a GEC-Alsthom joint venture with 350 jobs.
A high proportion of these jobs have gone to 'outsiders', many of whom have
moved to Montpellier with the incoming companies. Although Mr Freche's
supporters argue that locals have benefited from the availability of
construction jobs and that the arrival of the new investors bolsters the
local economy in terms of increased taxes and providing new business for
services.
Moreover, the influx of new investment will help to cushion the blow of the
forthcoming cuts at IBM, the US computer group which came to the city in the
1960s and is still the biggest single private sector employer. IBM plans to
reduce its workforce from 4,000 to 2,800 as part of its worldwide
rationalisation. Most of the job losses will come from natural wastage but
will still add to the toll of joblessness.
In the meantime, the city council hopes to get to grips with the long-term
unemployment problem by stimulating the local service sector, particularly
tourism, which has increased healthily in recent years thanks to
Montpellier's arts activities.
'We've already put Montpellier on the map,' says Mr Geneste. 'Now we should
turn our attention to the local economy by helping existing companies to
expand and to create new jobs for local people.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (2): An untried team takes the helm -
The economy is basically sound but growth is not fast enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE business community has been alive with gossip since the March cabinet
reshuffle. Businessmen's concerns range from whether the economic ministers
have the political support to push through further deregulation to whether
the cabinet backs deregulation at all.
The new government has taken over a macro-economy in relatively good fettle.
In the last financial year, ending March 31, non-oil exports - such as
textiles, shoes and consumer electronics - grew an estimated 21 per cent to
Dollars 22.98bn allowing the country to maintain a small trade surplus.
The cost of servicing foreign debt, however, resulted in a current account
deficit of about Dollars 3.75bn in 1992/93, but this is a significant
improvement on the Dollars 4.4bn deficit a year earlier.
Not all the indicators are positive. Public and private international debt
(with the latter making up an increasingly large proportion) rose from
Dollars 80bn at the end of 1991 to Dollars 85bn-Dollars 90bn last December,
although there has been a rise of almost equal magnitude in net foreign
assets held by the banking sector.
The debt service ratio remains stubbornly high at about 32 per cent of
export proceeds, exacerbated by the recent appreciation of the yen in which
40 per cent of public foreign debt is denominated. Although Japan remains
Indonesia's principal export market, trade in the four leading products -
oil, liquefied natural gas, plywood and shrimps - is denominated in dollars.
Fears over Indonesia's ability to service its foreign debt have led to
speculation within the business community that the government may decide on
a sharp 'one-off' devaluation of the rupiah.
Such fears are almost certainly unfounded, not least because the government
already has a policy of 'staggered depreciation', lowering the value of the
rupiah against the dollar by about seven per cent a year.
Indonesia also operates a free foreign exchange regime, so that a sudden
devaluation could spur mass capital flight; it would lead to a surge in
inflation - already running at about 10 per cent a year - from higher import
costs; and inflation and the need to protect against capital flight would
result in spiralling interest rates.
The removal, however, of Messrs Radius Prawiro, JB Sumarlin and Adrianus
Mooy, the three main economic technocrats of the last cabinet, has raised
concerns over the government's ability to keep a tight rein over the
economy.
Their replacements - Mr Saleh Afiff, Mr Mar'ie Muhammad and Mr Sudradjat
Djiwandono as coordinating minister for the economy and finance, finance
minister and central bank governor respectively - are largely unproven and
may lack the team-spirit developed by their predecessors.
One safeguard against a dramatic policy swing is the need to placate donors,
such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Indonesia remains
reliant upon donor aid - commitments in 1993/94 are expected to total about
Dollars 5bn when donors meet in Paris on June 29-30 - to cover its current
account deficit.
And in spite of rumours, there is little evidence the new ministers plan
anything other than to maintain prudent economic policies. Indeed, they have
come out with surprisingly strong statements on the need to liberalise
further and faster if Indonesia is to remain competitive with China and
Vietnam, its two main rivals.
While inflows of foreign investment may have peaked - and domestic
investment, particularly from the Indonesian Chinese community, has fallen -
it is difficult to imagine the trend of over six per cent annual growth
being broken under the new administration.
The question facing Indonesia, however, is whether six per cent growth is
good enough. While developed economies would be delighted with growth at
half that rate, Indonesia is not only starting at a low base - average per
capita income is Dollars 620 a year - but it must absorb over 2m entrants to
the labour market each year.
Government ministers say seven per cent is the maximum growth the country
can achieve without the economy overheating. The fact, however, that
Malaysia and Thailand can maintain 8-10 per cent growth, and China is
currently growing even faster, suggests that major impediments still exist
within the Indonesian economy.
It does not take a sleuth to see what the impediments are. Whereas
export-oriented industries operate in a relatively free environment, the
domestic economy remains blighted by public and private monopolies enjoying
a high degree of tariff protection.
Donors highlight the emerging petrochemicals sector as an example of where
the country is going wrong. The government recently introduced a 25 per cent
import tariff on polypropylene resin alongside a 30-40 per cent import
tariff on plastic films with which the resin is made.
Such tariffs allow politically well-connected businessmen to build
petrochemical plants with little regard to minimising cost and still record
handsome profits.
Inefficiencies of this type affect almost every sector of the domestic
economy from telecommunications to food-processing where the government's
control of sugar imports keeps the cost of a key raw material high.
Donors are also concerned at the level of government subsidy to state-owned
high-technology industries such as aircraft manufacturing and ship-building.
Ministers concede the industries make a loss but say finance is limited to
the Rp660bn allocated under the state budget. Donors, and officials from the
industries themselves, say funding is far higher, possibly exceeding
Rp3,000bn a year.
While the government officially operates a balanced budget, donors say about
Dollars 1.5bn of revenue and expenditure (about five per cent of the total)
is received and distributed each year off-budget. The extra money, from such
sources as higher than anticipated oil-revenues, may be well spent but a
lack of transparency is no incentive for efficient financial management.
Deregulating the domestic economy and disbursing state revenue more
efficiently will become increasingly important if the rate of growth in
non-oil exports begins to decline. Battling with well-connected business
monopolies and cash-hungry government enterprises, however, will require
firm political will.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (3): Armed forces hold the key - Suharto
tightens his grip but time is against him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Suharto's election to a sixth five-year term of office last March
came as no surprise. Not only was he the sole candidate for the post, backed
by both opposition parties and the ruling Golkar party, he also had a direct
say in appointing more than half the 1,000-member electoral college.
Instead, Mr Suharto saved the surprises for the cabinet reshuffle. Out went
20 of his 35 ministers including the three leading economic ministers, the
home affairs minister and the minister of defence.
It is too early to pass judgment on the new cabinet but Mr Suharto appears
to have further tightened his already strong grip on the country's political
affairs.
Looking to the past, the depth of his personal power has ensured political
stability and provided the environment for economic growth.
Facing up to the future, with Mr Suharto turning 72 next month and no clear
successor in sight, doubts are increasing over whether a smooth transition
to the post-Suharto era can be achieved.
Much will depend on the armed forces (known by their Indonesian acronym
Abri), which enjoy a fifth of the seats in the national assembly and have a
political role enshrined in the constitution. Abri is seen by the business
community as a source of stability. 'The smooth transition from the old
generation military leaders to the new generation is complete,' says the
head of one Indonesian conglomerate.
But Abri does not always act as a homogeneous force; and certain groupings
within Abri may not see eye-to-eye with Mr Suharto over who should be the
next president.
The depth of Mr Suharto's personal power ensures the political scene remains
a mostly closed affair and the tensions within government rarely break
through a veil of obfuscation. A decision, however, by Abri to nominate
General Try Sutrisno, armed forces commander until early this year, for
vice-president several weeks before the March election caused a stir.
Many Indonesians interpreted the move as a way of manoeuvering Mr Suharto
into a corner and avoiding a recurrence of the 1988 election when Mr Suharto
nominated State Minister Sudharmono, a trusted legal adviser, against the
wishes of several Abri officers.
Whilst Gen Sutrisno is a former personal aide to Mr Suharto, the latter may
not wish him to be the next president. As one western diplomat explained,
Gen Sutrisno is 'surrounded by Abri and dominated by them. He's not a
particularly strong man.'
Political opponents say Mr Suharto has already exacted retribution on Abri
by removing General Benny Murdani - previously seen as an important
counter-balance to the president - as defence minister and reducing the
number of military officers in the cabinet.
General Edi Sudrajat, recently appointed Abri commander, and General Ida
Bagus Sudjana, the new oil minister, are 'regarded by Abri as their only
real representatives in the cabinet,' notes a diplomat. Abri is now pushing
to retain its influence by having an officer head the ruling Golkar party.
Mr Suharto, himself a former general, has been promoting within Abri
officers more to his liking - a military background and Islam as a religion
are almost certain pre-requisites for the next president. At the top of the
list is General Wismoyo Arismunandar, the army chief who has the added
benefit of being Mr Suharto's brother-in-law.
But Gen Arismunandar is thought to have a weak power-base within Abri,
perhaps because of his first-family connection, and is regarded by many
officers as a soldier-politician.
The concern of some Abri officers is that Mr Suharto's choice of successor
will be made on the narrow grounds of who will best protect his family after
he has gone.
Should he harbour any desire to step down, Mr Suharto's influence over his
possible replacement remains strong. For instance, if Mr Suharto were to
stand for a seventh term of office in 1998, push through his nomination as
vice-president and retire shortly after, his favoured candidate would
automatically assume the presidency.
The likelihood is that Mr Suharto and senior officers will negotiate a
compromise and a smooth transition will follow, although, as the regime's
opponents point out, this assumes popular support for such a deal.
While there is very little open political dissent - the United Development
and Indonesian Democratic opposition parties usually support the government
to maintain political consensus - the few dissidents who do speak out hold
strong views.
'If Sukarno breached the constitution in one act (by being elected president
for life), Suharto has done it in installments,' says a dissident from his
musty Jakarta office.
Mr Suharto's critics fear that he may override his better judgment in his
determination to leave an indelible legacy by moving towards a more
nationalistic - and risky - economic policy.
Mr Suharto's March reshuffle of the cabinet - removing three economic
ministers - strengthened the hand of Mr BJ Habibie, the energetic minister
for research and technology, who backs a policy of nurturing industries such
as aircraft manufacturing, shipbuilding and weaponry. Supporting these
industries treads a fine line between costing Indonesia dear and
accelerating industrial development.
Donors say funding to state-owned high-technology industries is running at
about Dollars 1.5bn a year, a figure unlikely to decrease if plans such as
the construction of 12 nuclear power stations are pushed through.
Mr Suharto's supporters say the president will back Mr Habibie but not to
the detriment of the economy. They say controlling inflation, keeping a
balanced budget and limiting offshore borrowing are guiding factors for Mr
Suharto in setting his political agenda.
Such is the business of maintaining the status quo in Indonesia. Extending
the status quo, however, to beyond his own reign will be Mr Suharto's
toughest task. Accommodating the interests of the Indonesian populace,
satisfying the demands of Abri officers and providing for the future
wellbeing of his family could stretch the president's political skills to
the full.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (1): The sun, sea and politics -
Thousands of visitors head to the south of France each year for its stunning
landscapes and sunny lifestyle. But behind the scenes the area has been torn
apart by political feuds and economic recession
</HEADLINE>

THE TINY fishing port of Saint-Tropez is a picturesque place with narrow
streets, a yacht-filled harbour and gaudy cafes stretched along the beach
where Brigitte Bardot, its most famous resident, frolicked in her prime as
the star of Roger Vadim's 1956 film, And God Created Woman.
But Saint-Tropez is also a political powderkeg as Mr Alain Spada, its former
mayor, discovered in this month's municipal elections. Mr Spada, an
independent conservative, was forced to call elections two years ahead of
schedule after all 28 of his fellow councillors resigned and a troop of
Tropeziens protested against him by carrying a black-draped coffin through
the streets.
Mr Spada, who was criticised by his constituents for allegedly towing away
too many illegally parked cars and for banning Ms Bardot's dogs from
urinating on the beach, lost the elections to Mr Jean- Michel Couve, the
Gaullist whom he had ousted four years before. But the defeated mayor did at
least have the consolation that Mr Bernard d'Ormale, one of his fiercest
critics who is Ms Bardot's husband and a close friend of Mr Jean-Marie Le
Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, withdrew his candidacy
before the vote.
The Saint-Tropez storm, which provoked the village priest to tell his Easter
congregation that he had 'never seen scandal-mongering pushed to such
lengths', could be dismissed as a Cloche- merlien saga of local protest. But
the theme of an icono- clastic mayor at loggerheads with his fellow
politicians, and his constituents, is reflected across the south of France.
Southern France is a vast region stretching from Perpignan in the
Midi-Pyrenees on the Spanish border to the city of Nice by the Italian
frontier in Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. Its population expanded rapidly in
the 1980s as people flocked from the chilly north towards the sun, sea and
sand of the coast and to the serenity of the unspoilt parts of Provence.
The region is a study in contrasts. Toulouse is a prosperous, industrial
city trading on its historic strengths in aerospace and electronics.
Montpellier is still building on its ancient academic laurels and its recent
reputation in the arts to establish itself as a liberal technopolis. Nimes
is now trying to follow suit. Marseille is struggling to come to terms with
the demise of its traditional manufacturing base in the post-colonial era.
Nice is flourishing, thanks to the successful science parks hidden in the
Provence hills around the city and to its traditional trading links with
Italy.
The south has not been spared the pain of the French recession. Marseille
has probably suffered most of all as current pressures have aggravated its
longer-term economic problems. The toll of joblessness has reached 19 per
cent for the whole city (double the national average) and 30 per cent in the
most deprived areas.
But other cities are suffering, too. Montpellier made great progress in
generating new jobs during the 1980s by capitalising on the publicity
produced by the ambitious arts and architecture schemes initiated by Mr
Georges Freche, its dynamic socialist mayor, notably Antigone, the vast
post-modernist development designed by Roccardo Bofill, the Spanish
architect. But most of the new jobs went to outsiders. The level of
unemployment is still 14 per cent.
Even Toulouse and Nice, with their well-established industrial bases, have
felt the effects of the economic squeeze. Toulouse remained resilient until
a year ago, but the rate of joblessness has since risen to 10 per cent,
mainly due to the pressure on the small and medium-sized companies working
as sub-contractors for the large aerospace and electronic groups. Meanwhile,
Nice has been hit by the construction slump and by the local impact of the
worldwide cuts in information technology.
Rural areas have also been affected. The grape growers of the Languedoc are
still trying to adapt their crop to make higher quality wines, thereby
reducing their dependence on cheap table wines. Similarly, the old family
farms of the Provence hills are struggling to come to terms with the
consequences of the European Community agricultural reforms.
These economic pressures could not have come at a worse time for the
southern cities that spent heavily in the 1980s, notably Marseille, Nimes
and Montpellier. All three are now trying to repay the heavy debts that they
amassed by initiating ambitious architectural schemes and public works
programmes in the last decade.
The chilly economic climate was one of the chief catalysts for the political
swing to the right across the south in this spring's parliamentary
elections. Some cities, notably Nice, have long been under conservative
control. But the RPR-UDF coalition also swept the board in such traditional
socialist strongholds as Marseille and even Toulouse, long regarded as a
bastion of French radicalism.
The trend to the right may have made the politics of southern France more
homogenous in terms of party affiliation, but the political mood of the
region and the relationships between individual politicians are as
tempestuous as ever, as Saint-Tropez illustrates.
Even conservative Nice is still shaken by the scandal over Jacques Medecin,
its long-serving mayor, who three years ago fled from France for Uruguay to
avoid corruption charges. Perpignan is now spoiling for a fight between the
two conservative factions, the RPR and UDF, over who will succeed Mr Paul
Alduy, the veteran UDF mayor.
The opening in Nimes earlier this month of the Carre d'Art, the spectacular
museum and mediatheque designed by Sir Norman Foster, the British architect,
was clouded by a row between Mr Jean Bosquet, the conservative mayor, and Mr
Simon Casas, the high profile director of the city's bull ring who was fired
three days after the parliamentary elections.
The bust-up with Mr Casas is only the latest in Mr Bosquet's battles. One of
the running dramas of his decade as mayor of Nimes has been his feud with Mr
Freche in Montpellier over which of their cities has the right to be the
contemporary cultural centre of the south.
It is testimony to the tangled nature of Marseille politics that Mr Robert
Vigouroux, its mayor, although nominally a socialist, has crossed swords so
often with the party establishment in the Bouches-Rhone region, that his
supporters suspect that the city's best chance of drumming up political
support is with Mr Edouard Balladur's new centre-right government.
These political rows make for great spectator sport and add to the colourful
character of the region. But the feuds and friction between different cities
has undoubtedly made it harder for the south to make the most of its
logistical advantage in being the geographic centre of southern Europe and
the hub of the Mediterranean.
Montpellier and Nimes have at times seemed to expend more effort and energy
on battling against each other than on raising their profiles to the outside
world. At one point, they even scheduled arts and literary festivals at the
same time, to scupper the other's efforts. The feud between them is now
officially over, but the old competitiveness still surfaces from time to
time.
Moreover, the schisms within the political establishment have accelerated
the rise of the extreme right-wing National Front. The influx of pieds noirs
immigrants from the old French colonies in north Africa wrought dramatic
changes to cities such as Nice, Marseille and Montpellier in the early
1960s, leaving a residue of racial tension for the Front to exploit.
Mr Le Pen failed in his bid to win a Nice constituency in the parliamentary
elections and the Front's 12 per cent share of the first round of the
national vote was slightly below the 14 per cent it achieved in last year's
regional elections. But the Front is still a powerful force in French
politics with the potential to reassert itself, particularly in the racially
splintered south.
National Front extremism is undeniably one side of life in southern France,
but it is the side that most of the region's visitors choose to miss.
The wealthy owners of the Cap-Ferrat villas, the young zonards heading for
liberal Montpellier on the European hippy trail, the multinationals setting
up subsidiaries in Nice, and the thousands of tourists pouring onto the Cote
d'Azur beaches or into Provence hill villages come for the south's stunning
landscapes and sun- ny lifestyle, not for its politics.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (1): Everything to play for - President
Suharto's election for a sixth term of office has muted discussion of
Indonesia's political future. Concern now focuses mainly on the economy as
domestic consumption increases while output of oil, the main currency
earner, declines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE installation in March of President Suharto for his sixth term of office
as Indonesia's undisputed leader has temporarily dampened the long-running
debate about who should succeed him - he is 71 - and about how the country
should engineer a peaceful transfer of power.
A more urgent topic of discussion these days among apprehensive Indonesians
in the capital Jakarta, and in booming industrial towns like Surabaya in
East Java, is the future of the economy.
For the past 25 years Indonesia has successfully followed a pattern common
to several fast-growing south-east Asian economies, absorbing foreign aid
and investment and exploiting its own natural resources to finance the
creation of labour-intensive export industries.
With oil production falling and domestic energy consumption rising,
Indonesia may become a net importer of oil in the next decade, but textile
factories, shoe companies and television plants, springing up on what were
once Java's rice-fields, are replacing lost revenue.
The Dollars 5bn of manufactured goods exported annually is now on a par with
gross exports of crude oil. Poverty is declining and last year Indonesians
continued to enjoy real economic growth of almost six per cent.
Yet just as Indonesia faces the need to spend tens of billions of dollars on
industry and on the infrastructure projects required for further growth -
power stations, roads, ports and telecommunications, not to mention schools
or the Dollars 16bn plan to develop the offshore Natuna gas field - it is
meeting some unwelcome competition for investment funds from China, India
and Vietnam.
Foreign investment flows to Indonesia appear to have peaked and domestic
investment has fallen sharply, prompting officials from President Suharto
downwards to promise improved incentives and new measures to cut through
Indonesia's notorious red tape.
Mr Saleh Afiff, the senior minister who oversees the economy and finance,
acknowledges that Indonesia's rivals are economic threats. 'We have to
compete for funds which are shrinking,' he says. 'A couple of years ago,
no-one would go to Vietnam. Ten years ago China was small. Suddenly they are
in the field and we have to compete.'
Some of Indonesia's problems are geographical. With about 187m inhabitants -
more than the other five members of the Association of South East Asian
Nations (Asean) put together - it is the world's fourth most populous nation
and has plentiful supplies of cheap labour to tempt investors.
The territory ruled by Jakarta, however, extends nearly 5,000km across more
than 13,000 islands.
Indonesia encompasses the intensely Islamic people of Aceh on the northern
tip of Sumatra, the densely populated main island of Java, the tourist
resorts of Bali, the island of Flores (where more than 1,200 residents were
killed by an earthquake and tidal wave in December last year), the
Christians of East Timor (the former Portuguese colony where Indonesian
troops shot dead at last 50 supporters of separatism at a funeral in 1991),
and the primitive tribes of Irian Jaya in the east.
Even if investors confine themselves to the relatively manageable logistics
of Java, as most do, they cannot avoid nationwide problems of bureaucracy
and corruption which earn Indonesia a reputation for some of the highest
hidden business costs in Asia.
Another, related deterrent for investors is the tendency of the President's
children to seek and win lucrative contracts and monopolies, for everything
from toll roads in Jakarta to orange trading in Kalimantan, and to take
stakes in joint ventures against the better judgment of the other partners;
foreign entrepreneurs and ethnic Chinese businessmen wince at the mere
mention of the companies controlled by the President's children.
It is not just that such corporations may make only limited contributions in
the form of expertise or capital; critics say their presence could actually
make it more difficult for a venture to raise finance because of the
reluctance of foreign banks or international financial institutions to lend
to politically influential figures over whom they have no leverage.
The latest transaction to arouse concern was the quiet privatisation,
without open tender, of part of Indonesia's state satellite communications
business. It emerged that a business headed by the president's second son
had acquired 60 per cent of Satelindo, a new holding company, with two state
telecommunications bodies holding the rest.
Another concern among the economic 'technocrats' who have steered Indonesia
down the road of export-led growth is the power of Mr BJ Habibie, the eager
minister of research and technology. He and his nationalist, 'technologist'
supporters are thought to have gained influence in the sweeping cabinet
reshuffle announced in March; the fear is that Mr Habibie's state-owned
aircraft, shipbuilding and armaments industries will continue to consume
hundreds of millions of dollars of government money each year without making
adequate commercial returns. Mr Habibie argues that high technology and
trained professionals will be vital for Indonesia's future industrial
development.
Indonesia's economy is also burdened by public and private foreign debt  -
which, swollen partly by the recent strength of the yen against the dollar,
has risen to more than Dollars 85bn, and by the poor health of many domestic
commercial banks.
None of these problems is insurmountable; indeed many countries would be
proud if they could emulate Indonesia in balancing their budgets, repaying
their foreign debt obligations on time and maintaining economic growth
averaging nearly seven per cent a year for a quarter of a century.
But the uncertainty about the investment climate, about the shenanigans of
the president's children, about the ambitions of Mr Habibie and the fragile
state of the banking system is compounded by a lack of transparency and a
lack of public debate which is out of step with the increasing
sophistication of Indonesians.
Reporting by the media remains constrained by government pressure. Rumours,
whether about the bad debts of state banks or the number of people allegedly
killed in a recent riot at a rock music concert, are the stuff of Jakarta
dinner party conversations.
Late last year, people in Jakarta learned that Moslem radicals had launched
a series of attacks on Christian homes and churches in east Java and
Sumatra. Many Indonesians fear such incidents could revive tensions between
the Moslem majority and the Chinese minority (many of whom are Christians).
Tens of thousands of Indonesian Chinese were killed in the turmoil
surrounding the fall of Sukarno between 1965 and 1967. In Indonesia as in
other south-east Asian countries, a small number of ethnic Chinese citizens
dominate commerce and industry and are resented for it, a situation often
used to justify the economic favours granted to Mr Suharto's children and to
Mr Habibie.
Today the ethnic Chinese, having been criticised for dominating local
business, are being accused of disloyalty for investing in China instead of
in Indonesia, although much of the money channelled to projects in China is
already held offshore in Hong Kong or Singapore.
In the immediate future the task of reconciling the various groups with
vested interests in the Indonesian economy will fall on the newly-appointed
Mr Afiff and his ministerial colleagues; he has promised a robust pursuit of
free market policies. In the longer term the stability of Indonesia still
seems to depend on Mr Suharto. A former army general, he has held the
country together and guided it towards prosperity since replacing Sukarno,
but he is as reluctant as ever to name a successor.
Opponents of his authoritarian style believe he should act soon to arrange
an orderly succession and lessen the risk of a power struggle. As one
dissident intellectual put it: 'What good is the success of economics or
whatever else they may have achieved, if it's put in jeopardy because you
never know what will happen next?'

<TEXT>
Oil majors, particularly Shell Transport, performed strongly as investors
bought on hopes of asset disposals. There was also a feeling that US
investors, who have been keenly picking up domestic bulk chemicals shares
with a view to cyclical recovery, are now moving further afield.
About 20 per cent of Shell's asset base is in chemicals, although NatWest
Securities argues that most of the company's exposure is in Europe where the
industry's problems are far from over. The shares gained 11 to 592p on
turnover of 11m. BP, dragged up by the price of its US traded ADRs and its
rival's perfomance, rose 7 1/2 to 316 1/2 p on hefty turnover of some 14m
shares.
HSBC moved ahead 19 to 606p in response to a strong Hong Kong market.
Rothmans International improved 13 to 661p on the back of a steady dollar
and a realisation that the company was not greatly exposed to US tobacco
price wars.
Turnover in international trading group Lonrho jumped to 12m on continued
speculation of impending disposals and a strong metals sector. The shares
gained 6 at 114p. One view is that South African group Gencor may wish to
lift its stake in Lonrho's platinum mining interests in South Africa in
which it currently holds a 27 per cent interest.
Building materials group Redland improved 13 to 506p as UBS upgraded profits
and earnings forecasts on the basis that the UK construction industry
appears to be recovering faster than expected.
The results season in the drinks sector got into preliminary swing with
Greenalls Group reporting figures at the bottom end of market forecasts. The
shares, which have performed well in recent weeks, declined 13 to 414p.
Kleinwort Benson moved from a buy to a hold.
Whitbread was the subject of profit-taking ahead of its results expected
next week, the 'A' shares shedding 9 1/2 to 495p. Good figures from LVMH,
the French luxury goods group, lifted Guinness 14 to 489p. The two companies
have a 25 per cent cross-holding.
Transport Development Group eased 8 to 241p after several brokers trimmed
forecasts following a meeting with the company. UK airports operator BAA
firmed 5 to 755p after reporting a 4.8 per cent increase in traffic for the
month of April compared with the same period a year earlier.
A positive annual meeting boosted TI Group and the shares improved 12 to
337p. A warning of an operating loss for the first half at Simon Engineering
sent the shares tumbling 26 1/2 to 73 1/2 p.
Recommendations from Salomon Bros and Smith New Court were said to have been
the reason for a rise in BICC of 11 to 375.
A sense of relief greeted results from Body Shop, the anticipated fall in
profits to Pounds 21.5m from Pounds 25.2m at the top end of forecasts. The
shares, which have underperformed recently, rose 6 1/2 to 204 1/2 p.
Edible oils group Acatos and Hutcheson jumped 8 to 219p in late trading as
it was announced that a major shareholder had sold its entire 16.8 per cent
stake.

FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nervousness ahead of today's annual meeting of the board with City analysts
upset Rank Organisation shares, which tumbled 14 to 696p, although volume
was weak. One leading securities house also took the opportunity to turn
negative ahead of the meeting, believing that some poor overseas trading
news was likely to be disclosed.
This is likely to include continuing concern over the Japanese photocopier
market. One dealer said that the shares' decline yesterday had been
triggered because a line of stock was on offer at 700p a share and buyers
were unwilling to commit themselves ahead of the meeting.

FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Shares in aero engine group Rolls-Royce leapt forward in the last few
minutes on news that Continental Airlines, which recently emerged from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, had placed a Dollars 4.5bn order for 92
Boeing aircraft, including a high proportion powered by Rolls-Royce engines.
The firm order includes 25 Boeing 757s (with an option on another 25) to be
powered by Rolls-Royce engines, and the company put the potential value to
the British aero engine group at Pounds 375m.
The shares started moving ahead just after lunch, although analysts
initially ascribed interest to a positive presentation from the company at
its industrial power division on Tuesday. However, there were suggestions
that the early demand may have come from US buyers already aware of the
impending contract announcement.
With delivery set to begin in 1994, analysts expect a spate of upgradings of
Rolls-Royce profits for next year. The shares closed 5 better at 138 1/2 p.
Turnover was 3.7m.

FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sainsbury hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Final results from J. Sainsbury came in at the bottom end of the market
range and this, together with a swathe of moderate downgrades, led the
shares down. Food retail specialists' attention was also focused on the
level of earnings growth the supermarket group was likely to achieve in the
next 12 months.
After a sharp increase in recent years, Sainsbury, in common with other
supermarket groups, has shown a marked slowdown. Bears of the sector regard
this as a major sea change, with food retailing in a mature stage and
unlikely to repeat the recent earnings growth success. One cautious analyst
concluded: 'Sainsbury shares are in for a dull time.'
However, the stock still has its supporters. Mr Andrew Burnett at NatWest
Securities, which reiterated its positive stance yesterday, said the company
had the potential for continued growth through its dominant position and its
ability to 'turn the screw on the competition'. Sainsbury shares ended 14
down at 467p in turnover of 6.7m. Most brokers brought their forecasts back
to around Pounds 830m for next year.

FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca pricing dominates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWAN song for ICI in its existing form, marked yesterday by the pricing
of the Pounds 1.3bn demerger rights issue, saw investors apparently moving
away from Zeneca, the new bioscience operation which is being spun off.
While the existing ICI shares progressed gracefully, this performance masked
some brisk position-taking.
Turnover in the existing shares of the company was, at 6.4m, far larger than
normal but the share price rise of 22 to 1285p merely countered the previous
day's fall.
The unofficial market, sanctioned by the stock exchange and now involving 17
marketmakers, saw a shift of emphasis. ICI-ex demerger shares were actively
bought up from 569p to 609p on turnover of 6.1m. Zeneca ex-rights were sold
down 18 to 664p with 5.1m traded and the Zeneca nil-paid shares fell 20 to
66p with volume of 3.8m.
The Zeneca side of the trading had prompted some confusion because the
original 'grey market' set up by Salomon Brothers on April 26 had been
trading Zeneca cum-rights rather than ex-rights. Consequently, the heralded
Zeneca price of 600p a share seemed more generous to some than it actually
was.
There were also some cynical comments that the idea of a one-for-three cash
call had been so thoroughly floated by lead broker SG Warburg that when the
terms came in at five-for-16 the relative benefits encouraged buyers.
Ultimately, the consensus was that new buyers were not the chief factor in
the market yesterday. Marketmakers, arbitraging between the old and new
prices, and institutions hedging underwriting commitments were more
influential in the day's dealings.

FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate hopes spur fresh gains in shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATE cuts in Germany and elsewhere in Europe provided a favourable
background for a UK stock market featured yesterday by the successful
reception for the pricing of the Zeneca rights issue which triggers the
demerging of ICI. Last-minute fears that the Zeneca issue might bring
surprises proved unfounded and the terms and size of the rights offer were
comfortably in line with the market's original expectations.
Equities were in good form from the opening, helped by Wall Street's
strength overnight and led forward throughout by a good premium on the FT-SE
100 Index June future contract. A larger cut than expected in the
Bundesbank's 14-day repurchase rates, widely regarded as the precursor to a
reduction in Lombard and discount rates next week, strengthened hopes that a
beleaguered UK government can be bounced into lowering domestic base rates.
The FT-SE 100 closed 24.7 points ahead at 2,860.8, just below the best of
the session. In late trading, London brushed off a sluggish opening to the
new session on Wall Street, which was 5.2 Dow points off in London hours.
Trading volume increased to 773.6m shares, swollen by good but not frenzied
activity in the various ICI/Zeneca instruments - conventional ICI shares,
and grey market dealing in post-merger ICI, in Zeneca ex-rights shares and
in Zeneca nil-paid rights. Investors appeared to be moving towards the
conventional ICI shares rather than Zeneca, the bioscience and
pharmaceutical company to be demerged shortly.
The rest of the market was relieved to see the ICI/Zeneca rights deal out in
the open safely, but must still brace itself for the sale of further BT
shares by the British government and also the monthly funding of government
bonds.
Although some trading houses reported a healthy input of overseas cash into
the London market yesterday, others were not completely convinced. This week
has seen a successful rally in UK stocks, in part because investors hope
that the poor electoral showing of Mr John Major's government in last week's
local and by-elections will encourage it to cut base rates.
However, even after yesterday's performance, the Footsie remains about
half-way through what has been identified as the current trading range and
may not face a final test of confidence unless it clears the 2,900 mark.
Second-line stocks, which suffered much less in last week's sell-off, have
also fared better than the Footsie shares this week.
Yesterday, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 13.7 points at 3,145 and is now
within 10 points of its all-time peak.
Retail, or customer, volume in equities, which is regarded by fund managers
as the most convincing guide to the market's health, has remained
satisfactory, if not exciting, over the past week. On Tuesday, Seaq trading
of 676.8m shares was worth Pounds 1.29bn in retail business.
Strong performances among bank and oil shares led the blue chip sectors
ahead yesterday. Selective US demand was seen, although London traders
somewhat over-anticipated this during the first half of the session and were
caught out briefly when Wall Street proved slow to follow through after its
25-point gain on the previous day.

FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REDUCTION of interest rates in several European countries led to good
buying in the derivatives, sending the futures contract sharply ahead and
boosting volume in traded options, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June FT-SE 100 future contract was struck at 2,851
and buying said to have come from NatWest Securities and UBS drove it
forward in the first hour. A slight lull then followed before the surprise
announcement of a cut in the Bundesbank's 14-day 'repo' rates once again
propelled it forward.
The interest rate reductions in the Netherlands and Belgium in the afternoon
only served to increase demand, which eventually led to a slight squeeze.
The day's high of 2,880 was reached just before the market close at around
4pm, and following some profit-taking June ended at 2,877, up 33 from the
previous close and some 11 points above its fair value premium to cash of
about 5. Turnover was 11,306 lots.
Volume in traded options rose to a hefty 40,729 contracts. Dealings in the
FT-SE 100 option were particularly heavy, reaching 15,160 lots, but that in
the Euro FT-SE option was a modest 2,668. Glaxo was the busiest stock option
with 3,833 trades, followed by J. Sainsbury at 2,188. Dealings began in
seven new stock options: Royal Insurance and NatWest were particularly well
received, trading 1,886 and 1,403 respectively.

FT  13 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Historic Dow peak on
futures-linked buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
IN SPITE of a big fall in bond prices, which was triggered by bad inflation
news, late buy programs linked to stock index futures trading lifted blue
chip stocks into record territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.56 stronger at 3,482.31,
surpassing its previous all-time closing peak of 3,478.61. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, was only 0.44 up at 444.80, while the
Nasdaq composite lost 1.37 at 681.69. Trading volume on the New York SE
amounted to 256m shares, and declines just outnumbered rises by 946 to 944.
After Tuesday's solid gains, equities were expected to advance further
yesterday morning. Some unexpectedly bad news on inflation, however, meant
prices opened lower. The news came in the form of a 0.6 per cent rise in the
April producer prices index. Not only had analysts expected an increase of
only 0.2 per cent in the PPI, but the 'core' measure of producer price
inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also
worryingly strong at a 0.4 per cent rise.
The bad inflation figures upset the bond market, where the benchmark 30-year
issue quickly fell by almost  3/4 point, pushing the yield up to 6.87 per
cent, although it recovered slightly later. This increase in bond yields,
and a fear of rising inflation, depressed equities for most of the day. But
late program buying, linked to a rise in stock index futures, gave shares a
boost at the close.
Retailers were in the spotlight after some of the industry's biggest groups
reported quarterly earnings. Wal-Mart moved ahead Dollars 1 to Dollars 27 in
volume of 4.6m shares after announcing first-quarter profits of 20 cents a
share, up from 17 cents a year earlier. The company also said that
first-quarter sales rose 19 per cent to a record Dollars 13.9bn.
In contrast, Woolworth slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29 after the company
announced disappointing earnings of only a cent a share, down from 13 cents
at the same stage of 1992. Federated Department Stores, however, fared
better, rising Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 21 1/4 on news that first-quarter net
income, before extraordinary items, was slightly higher than a year ago.
Philip Morris, which posted strong gains last week on the news that its main
rival in the domestic cigarette market was no longer offering discounts on
its cheap brands, ran into further profit-taking and receded Dollars 1 1/2
to Dollars 50 in volume of 4.4m shares.
Chevron climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 88 on news that it has already
booked initial reserves of 1.1bn barrels of oil from its Tengiz venture in
the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.
Canada
TORONTO finished higher in heavy trading after a sharp rise in the price of
gold bullion sent gold-related shares surging.
The TSE 300 index gained 16.2 at 3,796.5 and advancing issues outnumbered
declines by 392 to 333 after volume of 65.7m shares. Nine of the 14
sub-groups ended firmer, with the golds sector rising 5.9 per cent. Gold
bullion gained USDollars 4.90 an ounce in New York.

FT  13 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Brussels is punished for speculative
rally - After a very strong first quarter equities face a difficult year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Brussels bourse was among the best performing European equity markets in
the first quarter of 1993, the Bel-20 index rising by nearly 12 per cent.
But at the same time, Belgium's other financial markets - government bonds
and currency, in particular - were experiencing unprecedented turbulence.
Investors took fright after a series of unsettling domestic political and
economic developments, starting with the Belgian parliament's approval of
the first in a line of wide-ranging constitutional reforms, which will turn
the country into a federal state.
That provoked largely unjustified fears that a continued process of
federalisation would exacerbate the country's looming budget deficit.
Finally, in the last weeks of March, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime
minister, tendered his government's resignation after the coalition failed
to agree how to reduce the deficit.
Within a week, however, he had managed to broker a deal between coalition
partners and the 'mini-crisis' was over, returning a semblance of calm to
bond and money markets.
Equities, on the other hand, moved into reverse. Since April 7 the Bel-20
index has slipped 5.4 per cent in spite of yesterday's gain of 10.26 points
to 1,201.04.
This is not simply a belated reaction to the unstable political situation.
Two emergency interest rate rises in as many months, although quickly
reversed, have unsettled investors; but the decline in April has been more
of a punishment for earlier speculation.
The gradual reduction in German interest rates, for example, revived the
slightly dog-eared theory that the cyclical stocks which dominate the
Brussels bourse were set for recovery.
For those which have bitten the bullet and carried out painful restructuring
over the last two years, that may be true. For instance, Bekaert, the wire
and steel cord producer, returned to profit last year and more than doubled
its net dividend.
But recession is still the dominant economic factor in continental Europe.
Results from other cyclicals and, in particular, their gloomy predictions
for the rest of 1993, have punctured the optimists' forecasts of an upturn
within nine months.
For example, Arbed, the Luxembourg steelmaker, was the best-performing stock
of the first quarter, with a 61 per cent increase on the beginning of the
year. But it lost LFr2.9bn (Dollars 88m) in 1992, and warned last month that
it would be unable to pay a dividend in 1993.
Belgium's exporters - which means almost all its large companies - have also
suffered from the strength of the Belgian franc against recently devalued
European currencies. Glaverbel, the glass-maker, complained publicly that
'competitive devaluation' last year had allowed some of its rivals, such as
Pilkington, of the UK, to undercut prices.
Chemicals and steel producers have experienced similar price competition,
exacerbated by cheap imports from eastern Europe.
Speculation on individual large stocks has also failed to bear fruit. The
hardy Brussels perennial - possible divestment of holdings by Societe
Generale de Belgique - has yet to flower, and widespread rumours of a
takeover bid for Petrofina, the oil and gas producer which is Belgium's
largest industrial company, have been cut down by the most likely suitor,
Elf-Aquitaine, of France, and the group's principal shareholders. The shares
now stand at BFr8,160, having touched BFr9,750 a month ago.
In the near future, then, the outlook for the bourse must be gloomy, with
investors waiting until the September results season for solid evidence of
trading conditions.
The exchange has a new president - Mr Henri Servais of brokerage firm
Dewaay, Servais - who has pledged to attract some of Belgium's extensive
individual savings towards the bourse and away from government bonds. In the
current climate, he may find that he has his work cut out.

FT  13 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixed performances after rate
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reduction in German money market rates, which sparked a fresh round of
interest rate cuts on the continent, was also taken to indicate that the
Bundesbank will ease the Lombard and discount rates soon, writes Our Markets
Staff.
The cut did not surprise strategists, who had been expecting an acceleration
in the process by the middle of the year. Mr Andrew Bell, of BZW in London,
noted that there had been signals from the Bundesbank that it was to step up
the pace of cuts and said that the next few months would see a continuation
of the process. 'Rate cuts are a necessary damage limitation exercise owing
to the state of the economy in continental Europe, not a bonus,' he said.
He now forecasts German interest rates of 4.5 per cent by next spring.
However, this should be accompanied by a spate of sharply reduced company
earnings forecasts over the next quarter, a further indication that 1994 is
unlikely to provide the hoped for 'bounce' in growth.
PARIS paid little attention to the base rate cut, turning instead to a raft
of mixed first quarter sales figures. The 1 per cent rise on the day in the
CAC-40 index, which gained 18.15 to 1,872.67, was also assisted by strong
activity in the futures market. Turnover was some FFr2.9bn.
Alcatel fell FFr9 to FFr618 in turnover of FFr450m on speculation that it
might be looking to increase its stake in Framatome.
News that Chargeurs was to cut its workforce sent the shares down FFr60 to
FFr1,015.
FRANKFURT saw an upswing in futures and short covering in the cash market as
the morning's repo rate cut put more pressure on the bears. Volume eased
from DM6.6bn to DM6.5bn as the DAX index closed 13.31 higher at 1,629.46.
Sector and individual share price performance was mixed. Volkswagen fell
another DM3 to DM317.50; but MAN recovered DM8.40 to DM274 as analysts said
that this company had come to its crisis, whereas others were seeing their
recessionary troubles deepen.
The big three chemicals all rose, Bayer putting on DM4.70 to DM261.30 on a
FDA recommendation of a drug produced by its US unit, Miles Inc, for
treatment of children with HIV. Mr Horst Greven of Merck Finck in Munich
said that the sector gains reflected a yield orientation among equity
investors.
MADRID's general index fell 0.36 to 241.85 but the session was enlivened by
the first day of trading in Argentaria, the newly privatised bank, which
closed at Pta4,230 against an intraday peak of Pta4,375 and an offer price
of Pta3,800.
Mr Pedro Echeguren of NatWest Securities said that the price action compared
with initial analysts' forecasts of Pta4,100 and subsequent upgrades to
Pta4,200 or Pta4,300 after the success of the flotation. He added that a
weaker opening for the stock in New York explained the decline from the
day's high.
MILAN adopted a positive trend after falls earlier in the week with renewed
buying by funds and small investors. The Comit index rose 2.47 to 534.09,
with options expiry having only a limited influence.
This resilience in the absence of a rates cut surprised some analysts who
believe that the Bank of Italy is awaiting progress on supplementary budget
before it moves.
Fondiaria gave up some of Tuesday's 4.7 per cent rise in further response to
the sale of its stake in AMB: the shares fell L429 to L31,153.
ZURICH edged lower after profit-taking in recently firm blue chips and a
weaker dollar weighed on late business. The SMI index fell 0.7 to 2,191.9.
Nestle bearers added SFr10 to SFr1,120 although a 6 per cent rise in first
quarter sales was less than some expectations.
Motor Columbus added SFr50 or 8.5 per cent to SFr635 in further response to
the energy and communications group's forecast on Tuesday of a big
improvement in 1993 results.
AMSTERDAM was supported by the cut in domestic rates with the CBS Tendency
index gaining 0.4 to 109.1. Aegon, which reported a rise in first quarter
profits, improved 90 cents to Fl 85.10. Polygram moved up Fl 1.30 to Fl
48.90 after a brokers upgrade.
STOCKHOLM saw record turnover of SKr2bn, encouraged partly by Ericsson's
positive first quarter results, the B shares advancing SKr19 to SKr310. The
Affarsvarlden general index gained 19.4 to 1081.7.
DUBLIN remained strong, the ISEQ overall index rising 20.38, or 1.3 per cent
to 1,543.31.
Mr Adrian O'Carroll of Dillon Read commented that the Bank of Ireland's 5
per cent gain preceded today's results.
VIENNA advanced, taking its lead from Frankfurt and news that bankers had
valued the 20 per cent of OMV that is to be privatised at well above its
market price. The ATX index gained 8.05 to 777.18.
ISTANBUL returned to record levels with the 75-share index up 140.43 or 1.8
per cent at 7,952.71 on strong demand, particularly in cement issues.

<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average retreated 1.5 per cent in the absence of market-moving
news as heavy sales of futures contracts and subsequent arbitrage activity
fuelled a broad sell-off, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed 325.17 lower at 20,615.20, after moving between
20,416.12 and 20,939.87. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost
26.89 at 1,608,94, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.19 to
1,244.41.
Volume was estimated at 580m shares, compared with Tuesday's 696m. Declines
overwhelmed rises by 796 to 284, with 110 issues unchanged.
Brokers attributed the day's fall to technical dealings, resulting in the
unwinding of long positions by arbitrageurs.
Mr Norio Okutsu, a manager of futures and options trading at Nikko
Securities, said the rapid selling of futures contracts carried over into
the cash market. The Nikkei's decline accelerated further once investment
trusts, individuals and dealers joined the selling spree and relinquished
some of their shares, he added.
An analyst at a UK securities company said some western-based investors sold
shares on speculation that the dollar may strengthen further against the
yen.
Large-capital electrical issues moved into negative territory. Toshiba
slipped Y25 to Y711 and Hitachi Y21 to Y890. Profit-taking pushed consumer
electronics lower: Sony shed Y150 to Y4,780, TDK Y60 to Y3,940 and Pioneer
Electronic Y20 to Y2,630.
NEC receded Y20 to Y1,000, Fujitsu Y22 to Y760 and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Y17,000 to Y944,000.
Securities firms also lost ground on profit-taking: Nomura was down Y50 to
Y2,160, Daiwa Y50 to Y1,300 and Nikko Y40 to Y1,070.
In contrast, Shionogi, the pharmaceutical company and the most active issue
of the day, climbed Y60 to Y1,100.
In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 379.62 at 22,772.62 in volume of
24.3m shares.
Roundup
POLITICAL AND corporate developments helped some of the Pacific Rim markets
to higher levels.
HONG KONG punched through the 7,000 milestone for the first time on
continued optimism after Tuesday's Sino-British agreement on land sales in
the coming year.
Mr Johathan Dennis of HG Asia said the agreement was seen by the market as
further evidence that China did not want to undermine Hong Kong in the
longer term.
The Hang Seng index added 160.63, or 2.35 per cent, at 7,002.60 after
Tuesday's 103-point rise. Turnover swelled to HKDollars 5.69bn from
HKDollars 4.24bn.
The index has climbed 25 per cent since October 7 when Governor Chris Patten
unveiled the political reform proposals that sparked a bitter row with China
and caused the market to dive.
Cheung Kong topped the active list and rose 90 cents to HKDollars 28.20.
Hongkong Land was also 90 cents stronger, at HKDollars 14.70. Henderson Land
advanced HKDollars 1.30, or 6.4 per cent, to HKDollars 21.60 on news that it
is considering spinning off its China operations for a separate listing.
SINGAPORE also closed at a record high, with strong institutional demand
taking the Straits Times Industrial index 34.54 ahead to 1,828.58.
The market moved ahead strongly from the opening, led by demand for
Sembawang Shipyard shares and warrants on news of its tentative agreement to
help build a power plant in Suzhou in China. Sembawang shares and 1994
warrants each put on 70 cents at SDollars 12.60 and SDollars 6.80
respectively.
AUSTRALIA saw the All Ordinaries index rise 8.3 to 1,695.7 in ADollars
417.35m turnover.
News Corp, which announced a 133 per cent jump in net profits for the three
months to end-March, appreciated 37 cents to ADollars 7.77.
Westpac finished 11 cents weaker at ADollars 3.66, but there were worries
that the stock would drop further after Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press
Holdings agreed to sell its 10 per cent stake to Lend Lease at ADollars 3.50
a share.
BANGKOK moved strongly ahead as gains by leading property groups and finance
and brokerage companies spurred demand. The SET index advanced 15.30, or 1.8
per cent, to 865.65. JAKARTA ended higher across the board in active trade
after foreigners bought blue chips and local investors sought speculative
shares. The official index rose 0.86 per cent to a 10-month high of 319.12.
TAIWAN moved forward in moderate trade on hopes of a cut in official
interest rates. The weighted index gained 39.72 at 4,718.23.
SEOUL was marginally lower in moderate trading in spite of institutional
buying which clawed back much of an early loss. The stock index ended 1.28
easier at 700.08.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Surprise repo rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROMARK futures rose sharply across the board yesterday after the
Bundesbank surprised financial markets by cutting its repo rate more
aggressively than had been expected, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank lowered the repo rate, which sets the cost of lending
short-term funds to commercial banks, by 11 basis points to 7.60 per cent on
both 14-day and 28-day maturities
With German call money hovering at around 7.73 per cent at the start of the
day, there had been little expectation of a significant easing in policy,
since official interest rates and market interest rates were more or less in
line.
However, yesterday's move by the Bundesbank raised new expectations that the
official discount rate, which sets the floor for money market rates, will be
cut at the central bank's next council meeting on May 19.
German call money yester-day fell to a close of 7.68 per cent, putting it
back to the level at which it stood before German unification.
One London-based dealer suggested yesterday that pressure will come on the
lower rate floor once the cost of overnight money has fallen to 7.50 per
cent. The betting in some banks yesterday was that, if this was the case,
the discount rate would be cut by 25 basis points on that day.
The cut raised expectations that the Bundesbank is easing policy more
aggressively than had been expected. The June Euromark contract rose 8 basis
points on the day to finish at 92.91. This assumes that there are another 29
basis points to come off three-month money in the next four weeks.
French franc futures rallied even more strongly in the belief that
yesterday's move opens the way for more cuts in France's official interest
rates.
The June Pibor contract was up 18 basis points on the day to stand at 92.66.
The September contract climbed 17 basis points to end at 93.40.
Sterling markets were quiet following several days in which speculation has
spread that there will be another cut in UK base rates this year.
Three-month money was a fraction tighter on the day, finishing at 5 15/16
per cent from a previous close of 5 7/8 per cent. This was partly due to
difficulties removing a shortage of Pounds 600m in the discount market, for
which there was late assistance of Pounds 210m. The overnight rate was at
6.50 per cent at one stage of trading.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar firmer on inflation data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR remained firm against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday
after US inflation figures turned out to be higher than expected and the
Bundesbank again eased monetary policy, writes James Blitz.
The US currency has been in the throes of a good recovery since the start of
the week, after the market took the view that last Friday's non-farm payroll
figure was not as bad as some dealers had anticipated.
Yesterday, the dollar peaked at DM1.6135 after it was announced that US
producer prices rose 0.6 per cent in April, against market expectations of a
0.3 per cent gain. It later closed in London at DM1.6115, up 30 basis points
on the day. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.6105.
The higher inflation figure underlined the belief of some dealers that US
short-term interest rates have bottomed out at about 3 per cent, and that
the Fed Funds rate could rise before the end of the year.
Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS in London, believes that
today's US retail sales figures for April will be watched closely. 'We need
a good retail sales figure to show that, by June, there will be a rundown of
the large inventories made in the first and second quarters of this year,'
he said. The market's forecast is for a rise of around 0.6 per cent on the
month.
Mr Chertkow believes that increasing signs of a pick-up in the US economy
will set the scene for a rise in the Fed Funds rate of  1/2 percentage point
after the summer. His three-month forecast for the dollar is DM1.72.
The Bundesbank yesterday surprised dealers by cutting its repo rate by 11
basis points to 7.60 per cent for both 14-day and 28-day funds.
The move helped to alleviate pressure on the Danish krone in the run-up to
Tuesday's referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The krone closed yesterday at
minus 46 percentage points of divergence against its central Ecu rate,
compared to around minus 50 percentage points at the start of the week.
However, sterling lost some of the ground that it had made against the
German currency on Tuesday, finishing a pfennig weaker on the day at
DM2.4700.
A dealer at one of the major London counterparties said there had been
strong selling of the pound by the Bank of England at DM2.4800. The UK
authorities still need to build up reserves following the expulsion of
sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism last September.
The peseta also came under very strong selling pressure in Europe yesterday,
although the Bank of Spain again appeared able to hold the exchange rate
through intervention.
There were reports that Spanish banks were acting as proxies for the
authorities, by selling dollars and buying the D-Mark to help build up
Spanish reserves. The peseta closed at Pta73.56 to the D-Mark from a
previous Pta73.35.

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLOODWATERS NOW cover about half of the arable land in the Province of
Buenos Aires, Argentina's prime farming region, according to government
officials. The heaviest rainfall in the province's recorded history has
flooded some 4m hectares of farmland, cut off towns and villages, and washed
roads away.
Officials estimate the damage at about USDollars 400-500m. Earlier this
week, the government said it was Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.9m).
Most of the damage has been concentrated in the north-west and south-west of
the province, but waters are now slowly spreading across the flat Pampas to
the south-east.
Mr Felipe Sola, federal agriculture and fisheries secretary, said yesterday
that much of the province's soyabean output had been lost.
He added that Banco de la Nacion Argentina, the government-owned commercial
bank, and the Central Bank would refinance farmers' debts over four years
with subsidised interest rates.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drumming up interest in
Sakhalin crude - A fresh tender is to be held for foreign operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN Government has announced the second tender in two years inviting
foreign companies to develop offshore oil and gas fields on the continental
shelf of the far eastern island of Sakhalin.
The committee organising the tender, chaired by the academician Mr Farmen
Salmanov, held its first meeting in Moscow on April 19.
The Russian authorities plan to hold up to five more tenders in the vicinity
over the next few years, holding out the possibility of the Sakhalin waters
becoming one of the largest offshore oil and gas regions in the world.
The second Sakhalin tender will cover fields with confirmed deposits and
other areas where little geological data is available, in 23,000 square km
(8,880 square miles) in the Sea of Okhotsk, east of Sakhalin, and 17,000 sq
km in and around the Bay of Sakhalin in the North West of the island.
In May last year the MMM consortium consisting of Marathon Oil Company,
McDermott International, and Mitsui &amp; Company emerged as eventual winners in
a tender contested by six groups of international companies.
The consortium is now known as MMMMS, having been enlarged to include Royal
Dutch Shell and Mitsubishi Corporation.
Since winning the tender, MMMMS has spent Dollars 80m on a feasibility study
of the Lunskoye and Piltun-Astokhskoye fields, which have combined reserves
of 400bn cubic metres of gas and 730m barrels of oil. The consortium is now
negotiating with representatives of the Russian Government in Houston,
Texas, about details of the deal, including profit sharing. Development
costs will be in the region of Dollars 10bn making it the biggest foreign
investment under discussion in Russia.
One factor absent from the second tender will be the forceful personality of
the former Governor of Sakhalin, Mr Valentin Fyodorov, who almost
single-handedly took on the Russian government in June 1992 when he refused
to acknowledge MMM as the winning consortium. His intervention led to a
highly publicised struggle between Sakhalin and Moscow over which side owned
the rights to the natural resources of the continental shelf.
President Yeltsin named a new governor of Sakhalin, Mr Evgeny Krasnoyarov,
on April 8 following a virulent campaign by the local soviet to remove the
former governor.
Mr Keith Holmes, general manager of Shell Development Sakhalin said:
'Fyodorov fought hard to get extra benefits for the island and took on the
might of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the Moscow access that leads
to. But as a direct consequence of his actions the project is probably a
year behind schedule.'
The administration of Sakhalin now appears to acknowledge the priority
rights of Moscow. According to Mr Nikolai Arsenyev, vice governor of
Sakhalin: 'Unfortunately we are not in the same position as Alaska, where
all the natural resources belong to the local state.'
The Russian authorities hope to raise the profitability of future
developments by sharing infrastructure costs among the various projects. But
some foreign oilmen are doubtful about the feasibility of such an
arrangement.
'Shell would not want to build a pipe line big enough to carry gas from
future projects, even if they later turned out to be ours,' Mr Holmes said.
'If Shell knew 25 years ago what it knows now about the North Sea it might
have achieved optimal efficiency. But life is not like that.'
Ground rules for the new tender will be announced as soon as the final deal
with MMMMS is signed - which may be as early as June.
Presentations are expected to be held in Sakhalin and Houston, Texas, and
packets of geological information will be sold to interested companies.
Mr Peter Sadovnik, chairman of the Sakhalin Regional Committee of Geology
and Mineral Resources, refused to indicate what the possible scale of
recoverable reserves might be. 'All the areas look promising, or we would
not be holding a tender,' he said.
He said that the tender zone would be divided into several blocks with
varying quality of data, ranging from those where deep drilling had taken
place to others where no preparation for drilling had been done.
Russian oil companies have made exploratory drilling of two fields inside
the tender zone Kirinskaya, which contains mostly gas deposits, and
Arkutunskoye, which contains mostly oil. The fields covered by the MMMMS
negotiations are in the region of the tender zone, but will be excluded from
the tender.
The Japanese State owned Sakhalin Oil Development Company (Sodeco) holds
development rights for the Chaivo and Odoptufields under an agreement signed
in 1975.
A Dollars 277m feasibility study of the fields carried out by Sodeco in 1976
concluded that further development would not be economical under the
conditions of the time.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc concentrates shortage
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S HUGE surplus of zinc concentrates, the raw material used by
smelters, will swing into a big shortfall in the next two to three years,
warns a study by consultants Brook Hunt &amp; Associates.
The shortfall could rise to 1.2m tonnes by 2000 and 2.8m tonnes in 2005.
Brook Hunt says the problem is being caused by today's low prices and
smelters' high treatment charges which have made about half the western
world zinc mine capacity uneconomic and caused the closure so far in 1993 of
400,000 tonnes of mine capacity.
The study identifies those smelters that might lose their concentrate
supplies because of mine closures and says several companies which today
rely on their own mines may be forced into the custom concentrate market in
future.
The Zinc Concentrate Market to 2005. Pounds 8,000 from Brook Hunt, 11 London
Street, Chertsey, Surrey, KT16 8AP, UK.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway to streamline gas policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY yesterday announced sweeping reforms to gas policy designed to give
foreign oil companies greater influence over their natural gas reserves and
to facilitate more efficient gas resource management.
Speaking in Oslo to delegates of the Seventh European Gas Conference, Mrs
Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, said that foreign oil
companies would be allowed representation in gas sales negotiations with
potential buyers. Hitherto, gas sales negotiations have been conducted
solely by the Gas Negotiating Committee (GFU), comprising Statoil, the state
oil company, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum, the other Norwegian oil
companies.
Mrs Brundtland said although she was pleased with the achievements of the
GFU, adjustments were necessary to gas policy. The changes would enable
closer links between resource management and sales activities to be forged
in order to accommodate a more efficient system for gas disposal, she
explained.
She also unveiled a new system in which gas fields would be designated as
sources of supply for contracts under negotiation. Under the new scheme the
energy and industry ministry would decide which gas fields would supply a
given contract before its conclusion, instead of after.
Mr James Allcock, head of gas purchasing at British Gas, said he was pleased
by Norway's announcement. 'The GFU itself was formed to deal with some
unsatisfactory elements in the negotiation relationships and now we see its
structure evolving in the light of experience. As gas buyers we welcome the
decision covering the sources from which contracted gas will come and we
believe this will assist our negotiations,' Mr Allcock said.
British Gas is at present negotiating with the GFU on contracting annual
Norwegian gas supplies of 5bn cubic metres. Gas price renegotiations between
Norway and Germany covering supply from the giant Norwegian North Sea Troll
field have become protracted and arbitration could be used to resolve the
issue. Ruhrgas, the big German distributor, has contracted 14bn cu m of gas
from the Troll field and has an option that must be exercised by 1995 to
take on an additional 7bn cu m.
The GFU is calling for higher prices because of the advantages of gas over
competing fuels.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kamchatka prepares to open
competition for gold mining rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The local administration of Kamchatka, in the far east of Russia, is
preparing to open competition for gold mining rights in the southern part of
the Kamchatka peninsular, writes Hugh Fraser.
The tender will mark the first occasion on which foreign companies have been
invited to bid for rights to mine precious metals in Russia. It will be held
in conjunction with the Russian Federation's geological committee.
The three deposits contain about 90 tonnes of gold held in quartz.
Interested companies will be able to buy packets of geological data this
summer.
The Russian government holds a purchasing monopoly on all gold produced in
the country. If a foreign company wins the tender the government will pay 25
per cent of the purchase price in hard currency and 75 per cent into a
rouble account inside Russia.
The criteria for judging the tenders have yet to be announced but the
administration says environmental safety is its top priority.

A higher than expected rise in the April US Producer Price index helped to
steady London GOLD and SILVER prices and lift early Comex prices. Gold
bounced from an early dip on good physical business in London, dealers said.
The market was still digesting the recent Goldsmith Newmont Mining shares
sale and awaiting the return of physical demand, dealers said. COPPER
continued to rally away from recent 5 1/2 -year lows on the LME, with
sentiment becoming slightly more positive when the technical rally lifted
three-month metal above Dollars 1,820 a tonne. Three-month NICKEL fell below
Dollars 6,000 a tonne. Dealers said the LME's warning over the
November-December premium had taken some of the steam out of the market,
although a Dollars 10-Dollars 30 backwardation remained in place. New York
ORANGE JUICE futures were sharply higher at midday, spurred mostly by
speculative buying. The market is still strong technically, one analyst
said, pegging resistance at the 105 cents for the July contract. Traders
were waiting for the latest 1993-94 Brazilian crop estimate.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian wool market started rising last week, with the market
indicator rising above 407 cents following a low point the week before of
381. This week the rise accelerated, and by yesterday (May 12) 442 had been
reached, with the day's increase at 25 cents. Demand has been relatively
greater for Merino categories. At this stage of the season, and with
stockpile wools not at present in the equation, the need to cover anything
oversold has become pronounced. There is a corresponding improvement in
market activity in wool processing and consuming countries.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait to push for Opec quota
boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT IS expected to push hard for a higher production ceiling at the next
meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a move that is
causing tension between ministers and could shake the oil market out of its
current balance.
Mr Ali Ahmed al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister, has this week been stressing
the emirate's demands for a higher quota with his claims that output will
reach between 2.2m and 2.4m barrels a day by the end of June. Industry
experts dispute Kuwait's capacity growth figures, saying production should
reach 2m b/d by late June, but that level is significantly higher than
present output of 1.75m b/d.
Opec has successfully managed to fine-tune the market in the past two months
by trimming its output to 24.1m b/d in April (according to the International
Energy Agency, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's
oil market monitoring body). Although this is some 500,000 b/d above its
overall production ceiling it is in line with demand, which has been rising
slowly.
However, producing countries are now delivering their opening gambits before
next month's ministerial meeting while traders watch nervously, ready to
push prices downwards at any sign of increased tension.
'The apparent stability in the market is due to totally confused signals
that are being given out by different sectors,' said Mr Vahan Zanoyan,
senior director at Petroleum Finance Company, the oil consultants in
Washington.
Oil demand is growing, particularly in the Far East. The IEA said in its
April oil report that it expected demand to rise by 1.5 per cent or 500,000
b/d in the second quarter.
That is tempered, however, by continuing news from Russia of declining
production. The latest reports in Russian newspapers have pointed to a drop
in output in the first quarter of 15 per cent to 610.7m barrels from 718.4m
barrels in the corresponding period of last year.
Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS, believes that Russia will have to begin
cutting back on exports to the west this year as output declines further. He
expects exports to drop to an average 1.1m b/d from 1.4m b/d last year.
On the back of an increase in demand and continuing falls in production in
Russia, Opec will be able to justify an increase in its ceiling to about
24.6m b/d at its June meeting. That would represent a rise of about 500m b/d
compared with the present output level.
Kuwait will argue for a substantial share of that increase as it continues
its recovery from the Gulf war, but its demands will be strongly countered
by Nigeria and Iran which are also looking to raise output. Improved
relations between Kuwait and Tehran have led to rumours of a deal being
arranged between the two to carve up any increased quota, but Saudi Arabia
would also want its share of any rise in the ceiling.
Mr Daniel Yergin, head of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, says the
market is still dominated by Opec's 'triangle of contention', between Saudi
Arabia, Iran and Kuwait, all of which are anxious to capture market share
before Iraq re-enters.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank pleases with
bigger-than-expected repo rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT bond markets rallied across Europe in the wake of a
bigger-than-expected cut in the German repo rate.
The 11 basis point cut to 7.60 per cent was not only a pleasant surprise in
itself, but also raised hopes that the Bundesbank Council might reduce
official interest rates at next Wednesday's meeting. The repo is now only 35
basis points above the discount rate and 90 basis points below the Lombard
rate.
The move was seen as confirmation that the Bundesbank was accelerating the
reduction in interest rates. This was particularly good news for the short
end of the market, and the yield curve took a step nearer normalisation with
two-year stock starting to yield less than five-year stock.
Further out along the curve, 10-year bunds, which had suffered the biggest
losses in the recent sell-off, found some demand again. The yield fell by
about 5 basis points to 6.72 per cent. But this area is still seen as
vulnerable if the Danes vote Yes to Maastricht, lessening the safe-haven
motive for holding longer-dated bunds.
The June bund futures contract rose from 94.83 to 95.15 during the day.
The Dutch and Belgian central banks followed the German move with bolder
cuts of 25 basis points in their key rates - another factor giving the
Bundesbank scope to ease next week. Both their government bond markets
benefited.
Dutch state loans continued to surge, with the yield falling to 15 basis
points less than that on bunds. The question was being raised as to whether
it was time to take profits.
France outperformed the German market slightly and the yield spread between
the 10-year benchmarks went back through the 40 basis point barrier.
IN the UK, trade in government bonds was comparatively quiet. Without any
stimulating economic data to mull over, most thoughts were trained on the
likely gilt auction announcement by the Bank of England tomorrow.
However, the pre-auction aversion that had attached to 10 to 15-year stock
relented to some extent. The 8 per cent gilt due 2003 gained about  3/8 of a
point and the 8 1/2 per cent 2013 was nearly  1/2 point up.
US Treasury prices fell across the board yesterday after a
bigger-than-expected rise in the April producer prices index revived fears
of inflation.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was off its lows but
still down  21/32 at 103 5/16 , yielding 6.859 per cent. At the short end of
the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 1/8 to yield 3.791 per
cent.
Prices began falling after the Labor department announced that the PPI rose
0.6 per cent last month, a much bigger increase than expected and the
largest in more than two years. Analysts had forecast a rise of only 0.2 per
cent in the index. To make matters worse, the 'core' measure of producer
price inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4
per cent in April, a worryingly big rise.
Analysts said the figures confirmed their view that inflation is on an
upward course, but warned against over-reacting to the data. The big fall in
bond prices, however, was partly to blame on the timing of the PPI report.
Coming in the middle of a huge refunding round, bad news on inflation could
only have made a market facing a large injection of fresh supply even more
nervous.
In particular, dealers were worried that the PPI news would scupper the
afternoon auction of Dollars 10.75bn in 10-year notes. The auction, however,
went off relatively well considering the market conditions, and the notes
were sold at an average yield of 5.96 per cent - in line with prior
expectations.
IN THE absence of fresh economic news, the Japanese government bond market
continued to float downwards as technical factors and negative sentiment
dominated trade.
The background has been the growing belief that economic recovery is on the
way, as reflected in the recent positive mood towards equities (with
yesterday's fall in the Nikkei stock market index seen only as a normal
daily fluctuation). This week's softness of the yen against the dollar has
also removed a prop for government bonds.
In the cash market, the benchmark No 145 bond due March 2002 underperformed
again, its yield rising from 4.51 per cent to 4.57 per cent in Tokyo
trading.

<TEXT>
ARGENTARIA, the state-controlled Spanish banking corporation which has
issued 25 per cent of its shares on the domestic and international markets,
traded briskly on its opening day yesterday when its share price rose by
more than 11 per cent in Madrid.
The shares rose sharply from Pta3,800 to Pta4,305 before easing to Pta4,230
amid heavy trading. Analysts said the trading indicated that Argentaria had
struck a correct balance in its share price by offering a sufficient premium
to investors.
Heavy demand for Argentaria meant domestic retailers were limited to maximum
investments of little more than Pta280,000 (Dollars 2,370) against the
original Pta8m limit outlined in the share offer.

SALOMON Brothers plans to start making markets in UK equity options on Liffe
next month, as part of its expansion of its European equity market
operations.
Salomon will act as an assigned market maker in at least 20 options on the
most internationally traded UK stocks, but will not trade FT-SE options.
Mr Paul Varcoe has been hired from Swiss Bank Corporation to head a small
team of equity options traders.
Poor trading volume in UK equity options has failed to revive following the
much-vaunted merger of the London Traded Options Market with Liffe last
year, but the market has managed to attract a fresh supply of market makers,
now numbering eight. Salomon 'intends to add liquidity' to the market,
according to Mr Andrew Barret, head of European equity trading.

FT  13 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Italy lays down a path for a return to
the Eurodollar market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Italy surprised investors yesterday with a plan to swap
Dollars 9.15bn of its existing Eurobonds into two new issues in an attempt
to pave the way for its return to the Eurodollar bond market.
Italy has not launched a Eurodollar bond since January 1991. Issues in other
currencies have also been limited due to growing concern about the economy
and the budget deficit.
Hopes of capitalising on a successful return to the markets after a DM5bn
bond in January were hit by the intensifying corruption scandal - which
exacerbated the mood of political uncertainty and led to a sharp decline in
the value of the lira - along with downgradings of Italy's credit rating.
The timing of the latest deal, managed by Morgan Stanley, suggests the
treasury and its advisers may believe the mood towards Italy has now turned,
and that political reform will gain momentum under the new government of Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former central bank governor.
Yesterday's deal allows investors to exchange outstanding Republic of Italy
Eurodollar bonds for one of two new issues. Investors in any of five issues
with maturities from 1993 to 1997 will be able to swap into a 5.625 per cent
five-year bond. An initial Dollars 500m tranche of the new bond was
yesterday fully subscribed by Morgan Stanley and a pool of other banks.
Holders of two outstanding Italy bonds with maturities in 1999 and 2001 will
be able to exchange their paper for a new 6.625 per cent 10-year bond.
However, holders of at least Dollars 300m of bonds will have to come forward
for this transaction to take place.
Investors taking advantage of the offer will receive a new bond in exchange
for their old issue, along with accrued interest due and cash adjustment
amount based on the price difference between the old and new bonds.
The deal will offer existing bondholders the chance to swap into much more
liquid paper, as many of the existing issues are relatively illiquid,
without having to buy new paper.
The transaction has several advantages for the Republic of Italy. It will
enable the treasury to gain a much better assessment of its investor base
and establish benchmarks for possible future Eurodollar bonds.
The treasury indicated in January that it would like to borrow between
Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn on the Eurodollar markets this year to reduce
its dependence on the domestic bond market and extend maturities on its
existing debt. That ambition, scotched by political events soon after, may
now have been revived.
Bankers believe the treasury had been planning a very substantial Eurodollar
bond, estimated at up to Dollars 5bn, to follow the D-Mark transaction.
Assuming the swap offer is well received, it will now be better placed to
price any new deal.
The treasury may also be keen to assess the impact on the market of last
week's downgrading to A1 from Aa3 in Italy's creditworthiness by Moody's,
the US debt-rating agency. Some officials suggest that the tightening of
spreads on existing paper which accompanied yesterday's exchange offer
suggests investor confidence in Italian paper is actually higher than
Moody's rating suggests.
Eurobond dealers in London commented favourably on certain aspects of the
exchange arrangement, pointing out that some investors will probably be keen
to swap into a more liquid bond issue, especially since some existing
Eurodollar debt is trading well over par. 'It's a good idea to try to clean
up existing issues because of the various distortions in the market arising
from tax exemption' said one syndicate head.
But many houses had reservations about the offer. For a start, Italian
investors who hold tax-exempt paper are unlikely to swap into the new,
taxable issue, while those investors who are asset-swappers are unlikely to
want to unwind their swaps.
'Those investors who bought Italian paper at a yield spread of around 30
basis points in the last year will probably be unwilling to sell it at 60
basis points,' said one European banker.
Another syndicate manager questioned how many investors will want to
increase their duration by exchanging their bonds.
The bonds were reoffered at the issue price of 99.52 but were quoted at
99.24 by late afternoon for a yield spread of 65.5 basis points, according
to Morgan Stanley.
While Italy grabbed the market's attention, there were a clutch of other
interesting deals. The International Finance Corporation, the private sector
affiliate of the World Bank, made its debut in the Euroyen sector with Y40bn
of 4.375 per cent, five-year bonds.
The deal was seen as aggressively priced with a yield spread of 17 basis
points over the No 111 JGB, and some rival houses suggested a yield spread
of 24 basis points would have been more appropriate. The IFC issue was
priced to yield 10 basis points more than an existing World Bank Euroyen
bond, the 4 1/2 per cent due 1997, and the deal held its spread, according
to Nikko, the lead manager.
The proceeds were swapped into dollars and the borrower is expected to
achieve 'substantially sub-Libor' funding of at least 30 basis points below
Libor.

FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: S African Breweries boosts
income 6%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH African Breweries, the country's largest consumer industrial company,
increased attributable income by 6 per cent, from R779m to R825m (Dollars
260m) in the year to March.
A good performance from the group's core beer interests - SAB is the
seventh-largest brewer in the world - with attributable earnings rising by
16 per cent to R541m, was offset by a 10 per cent fall in earnings from
non-beer activities to R284m.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations. Most of the non-beer
interests, including clothes retailing, textiles, furniture, electrical
appliances, and non-alcoholic beverages, performed better than expected. OK
Bazaars, however, the supermarket chain, made a R45m attributable loss of
which about R31m was attributable to SAB.
Mr Meyer Kahn, executive chairman, said the prolonged recession - a fall in
GDP for 14 quarters - 'had devastated consumer spending and placed
unprecedented pressure on SAB's widespread consumer goods interests'.
Mr Kahn said the damage to the economy would take a considerable time to
repair, with no real growth in consumer spending until well into 1994. But
he predicted increased earnings and operating cash flows for the year ahead.
Group turnover rose by 24 per cent to R21.8bn with 16 per cent coming from
inclusion of the Plate Glass group for the first time. Trading profit rose
by 21 per cent to R2.3bn, but higher tax held growth in after-tax profits to
15 per cent.
With a higher number of shares in issue following the Plate Glass
acquisition, earnings per share rose to 304 cents from 290 cents. The
dividend was increased to 137 cents from 130 cents.

JAPANESE corporate culture regards conformity as a virtue. It is a virtue
that will be in ample abundance over the next few weeks when the majority of
Japanese companies announce dismal results for the year to March.
Manufacturers, service companies and financial institutions are expected to
report reduced profits for the third year running.
Brokers have forecast that companies listed on the first section of the
Tokyo stock exchange will report profit falls of 20 to 30 per cent.
The reason is the weakness of business and consumer confidence between April
1992 and March this year.
Despite an emergency government spending package of Y10,700bn (Dollars
96bn), announced in August, business confidence worsened throughout the
year. The Bank of Japan's diffusion index, which measures short-term
economic prospects, fell from minus 5 in February 1992 to minus 49 by
February this year in the manufacturing sector and from a positive
indication to minus 33 in the non-manufacturing sector.
The dramatically-altered business environment forced companies to adjust
their strategies. As a result, the fall in profits in fiscal 1992 will
reflect not only the effects of lower demand but restructuring charges as
companies positioned themselves for recovery.
Consumer confidence declined not only because of the sagging economy but
also because of indications that the system of lifetime employment, long
taken for granted, is no longer sacred.
Personal consumption actually rose 0.8 per cent in fiscal 1992, according to
estimates by BZW, the securities company. But this is a low figure for
Japan, where growth in consumption had been running at 3 to 4 per cent in
previous years.
A seemingly insatiable thirst for material goods in the years of asset
inflation in the late 1980s has been replaced by a mood of frugality.
Motor manufacturers suffered a sudden halt to demand for luxury cars, just
as they had invested in new plants and state-of-the art automation to meet
expected strong demand.
Electronics manufacturers discovered that minor redesign of existing
products no longer lured consumers into replacing TV or audio sets.
Meanwhile, the fall in business confidence led to a sharp drop in capital
spending, notably by financial institutions.
BZW estimates that capital expenditure in fiscal 1992 was down by 5.7 per
cent, in contrast to high growth in capital investment in the so-called
'bubble' years, when companies competed to invest in new manufacturing and
communications equipment.
The decline in capital expenditure was reflected in a fall in machine tool
orders in 1992 of 35 per cent, according to the Japan Machine Tool Builders
Association. Computer manufacturers, telecommunications and office equipment
manufacturers were all affected by the drop in capital spending.
The slowdown of the Japanese economy means companies that are not
competitive overseas and are dependent on domestic demand will be hard hit,
says Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at BZW.
Another feature will be the negative effects of restructuring and
cost-cutting measures by Japanese companies.
Many managers conclude they have more employees, notably white collar, than
they need or can afford.
A recent government survey found that 80 per cent of major companies in and
around Tokyo set about restructuring to cope with the recession.
Companies ranging from NKK, the steel manufacturer, to Japan Airlines and
IBM Japan, have introduced voluntary early retirement programmes to
encourage staff to look for a second career. Such measures are being
supplemented by transfer of staff to subsidiaries and sometimes to
unaffiliated companies.
The extent of the restructuring is reflected in the number of industrial
sectors applying for government employment adjustment subsidies. These can
be used by companies to pay staff while production is halted or while they
are on temporary secondment.
But the recent strength of the stock market, up 26 per cent since January,
will bring windfall profit gains or, at least, lower valuation losses on
corporations' stock holdings.
Yet, despite difficult times, it is unlikely many companies will reduce
dividends to reflect lower profits. They are desperate to avoid this because
it would undermine their ability to tap the equity market for funds, Ms
Matsui says.
The consensus is the outlook for this fiscal year is better, but not
dramatically so.
There is a growing optimism about recovery towards the end of this year. But
opinion is divided on the extent of it and how soon it is likely to be
reflected in corporate earnings.
Estimates for the recovery in earnings of non-financial companies listed on
the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange range from a moderate 5 per
cent increase, from BZW, to a more upbeat 14 per cent, from Salomon
Brothers.
The impact of the yen's appreciation against the dollar is also of concern,
although here opinion is again divided. The only certainty seems to be that,
while more pain in adjusting to the new reality is on the horizon, fiscal
1993 cannot be worse than 1992.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S large integrated electronics companies and consumer electronics
manufacturers are preparing to humble themselves before their shareholders
again as they report disappointing results for fiscal 1992.
Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics manufacturer, saw the
sudden departure of its president in the wake of poor performance, and
scandal caused by a financial subsidiary and by its own defective
refrigerators.
NEC expects to report a Y40bn (Dollars 359m) pre-tax loss, while Fujitsu is
likely to announce a Y20bn deficit, its first loss since it was listed on
the Tokyo stock exchange.
The immediate outlook for most companies in the sector is not bright.
Consumer demand is unlikely to rise strongly until later this year, and
there are few consumer items on the market capable of leading the industry
out of the doldrums.
However, computer sales are expected to improve, while semiconductor sales
are reflecting strong US demand.

<TEXT>
SEGA Enterprises, the amusement centre machines and video games
manufacturer, bucked the expected trend of the Japanese corporate results
season yesterday by reporting a 64 per cent increase in profits.
Sega said pre-tax profits in the year to March were up to Y55bn (Dollars
494m) from Y33.4bn after revenues rose 63 per cent from Y213.3bn to
Y346.9bn.
Sega, whose video games are popular internationally, notably its games hero
Sonic the Hedgehog, is expected to provide one of the brighter spots in the
Japanese results season as most industries suffered a sharp downturn.
Sega has been extremely effective in competing with its main rival,
Nintendo, in the US and Europe, where it has increased its market share to
about 40 per cent, according to industry analysts.
Sega saw a 91 per cent rise in export revenues to Y210.9bn, compared with a
23 per cent fall in domestic sales to Y19.3bn in its consumer products
division.
Sega is forecasting revenues of Y400bn and pre-tax profits of Y63.3bn for
the current fiscal year.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE shipbuilders had full order books last year, although new orders
fell, while steelmakers were bruised by a drop in private construction
orders and softer demand from the car industry.
Kobe Steel is likely to have the honour of reporting higher net profits than
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker. While Kobe's net profits are
forecast to fall from Y29bn to Y12bn, it will beat the Y4bn forecast at
Nippon, and better than other leading makers, which expect to break even.
Kobe is fortunate that its diversification programme began long before the
peak of steel demand in the mid-1980s, when other Japanese makers were
inspired to pursue projects in electronics, theme parks and bicycle
building. Steel accounts for about 48 per cent of sales, machinery 30 per
cent, and aluminium and copper 22 per cent.
The returns at Kobe and other steelmakers would have been worse but for a
quadrupling of export orders to China for the year.

THE LATE 1980s 'bubble' gave many Japanese institutions ambitions beyond
their means. Mitsubishi Bank made mistakes then but kept tighter control on
lending than most competitors.
It is expected to announce non-performing loans of Y400bn (Dollars 3.6bn) at
the end of March - about 1.3 per cent of outstanding loans and lower than
the 3 to 4 per cent at other leading institutions. Fund management returns
are higher on falling interest rates.

TURNER Broadcasting System, the Atlanta-based cable television group
controlled by Mr Ted Turner, yesterday reported higher revenue and income
for the first quarter.
Net income totalled Dollars 20.14m, against Dollars 731,000, although the
1992 figure reflected costs associated with Winter Olympics coverage.
The income figure for the latest period was struck before a charge of
Dollars 286m following the adoption of the FAS 109 accounting standard on
income tax.
Revenue rose 9 per cent to Dollars 398.4m.
Mr Turner said: 'The overall tone of the advertising market has been
healthier.'
Operating profits for the entertainment division, which includes TBS
SuperStation and Turner Network Television, rose to Dollars 46.5m from a
depressed Dollars 16.1m.
Revenue advanced 11 per cent to Dollars 189m, due to increased subscription
and advertising revenue.
In the news division, which includes CNN, operating profits rose 23 per cent
to Dollars 52.15m on revenue 15 per cent higher at Dollars 144.2m.
The syndication and licensing division suffered an operating loss of Dollars
5.95m, against a Dollars 2.74m profit, due to a shift in the revenue mix
from higher to lower margin businesses. Revenue fell 8 per cent to Dollars
50.33m.
Losses in the sports division rose from Dollars 3.98m to Dollars 4.87m, on
revenue of Dollars 1.17m, against Dollars 1.14m.
On Wall Street, Turner shares were unchanged at Dollars 20 1/8 .

FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Recovery at Woolworth stalls
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY at Woolworth, the US retail group, stalled in the first quarter of
the current financial year, when the company recorded earnings of just
Dollars 1m after tax on sales of Dollars 2.13bn.
In the same three months last year, Woolworth reported a Dollars 17m
after-tax profit, on sales slightly lower at Dollars 2.09bn.
Woolworth - which takes in several specialty chains, such as Foot Locker, as
well as the namesake stores in the US - said operating profits in the three
months to May 1 reached Dollars 26m, compared with Dollars 59m in the same
period a year ago.
The first-quarter profit translates into earnings per share of 1 cent, down
from 13 cents in the first quarter of 1992. On Wall Street, Woolworth shares
were down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 29 - close to the 52-week low - at the
close.
Within the group total, Woolworth said that its foreign operations, which
range from Australia to the Netherlands, had slumped to an Dollars 18m
operating loss, compared with a Dollars 2m profit a year earlier.
Domestic operating profits were down from Dollars 57m to Dollars 44m.
Mr Harold Sells, chairman, admitted the results were 'disappointing', and
blamed 'weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence in the
principal markets in which we do business'.
However, he suggested that the group's major store redeployment programme
should still help in the longer term.

WAL-MART Stores, the expansion-minded US discount store group and the
nation's top-selling retailer, yesterday eased some of the concerns over its
growth prospects, with a 16 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits.
It said it was 'on track' to meet sales and earnings targets for the rest of
the year.
Wal-Mart's after-tax profits in the quarter to end-April totalled Dollars
450.6m, up 16 per cent on the Dollars 387m in the same period of 1992. Sales
rose to Dollars 13.9bn, a 19 per cent improvement over the Dollars 11.6bn in
1992.
At the per share level, earnings increased to 20 cents from 17 cents.
Wal-Mart shares rose Dollars 1 to to close at Dollars 27. They have been
trading close to 52-week low, as Wall Street has questioned whether
Wal-Mart's growth rate would slow. There have also been doubts over the
potential for the US 'warehouse club' sector - high-volume, deep-discount
outlets. Wal-Mart, with 277 Sam's Clubs stores, is one of the biggest
'warehouse' operators.

CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier which recently emerged
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, is placing a Dollars 4.5bn order with
Boeing to update and simplify its fleet. The order could be worth more than
Dollars 600m to the UK's Rolls-Royce, which will supply some of the engines
for the aircraft.
In total, the Continental deal covers firm orders for 92 aircraft, to be
delivered between January 1994 and the year 2005, with options for another
98.
However, a portion of the purchase agreement - for 50 Boeing 737s and 25
Boeing 757s - essentially reinstates an order placed by Continental before
it went into Chapter 11, and which was then cancelled by the carrier while
it was in bankruptcy.
The new element is Continental's decision to acquire 12 wide-body 767-300ER
aircraft, with options for another 18, and five of the new 777s, with
options for a further five.
The Continental 777s will be the longer-range B model of that aircraft.
Continental also announced for the first time that the new fleet of twinjet
757s will be powered by Rolls-Royce engines.
In addition to the 25 firm orders for this aircraft, it has options on a
further 25, and Rolls-Royce said the potential value of the order could
exceed Dollars 600m.
The first delivery date for the 757s is May 1994, and the final deliveries
would be made in March 1997. Delivery dates for the optioned aircraft begin
in 1995 and continue through to 1998.
The first 777s, meanwhile, are due to be delivered in August 1997, and the
final delivery date on the firm order aircraft is April 1998. Continental
said the airliner, carrying GE engines, would be used to replace 747s on
longer-haul international routes.
The firm-order 767s are due to be delivered between 1995 and 1999, and will
also appear in Continental's fleet for the first time.
The most numerous part of the order is for the 50 737s, with engines made by
CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric in the US and
France's Snecma, with options of another 50. The firm orders will be
delivered between January 1994 and July 1997.
The US airline said the overall size of its fleet - currently about 325
aircraft - should not change substantially over the next three years.

CASCADES, the international packaging and fine paper group, has put eight
North American boxboard plants, valued at CDollars 300m (USDollars 235m), up
for sale.
The cigarette packaging and converting plants, which employ 1,250, were part
of Cascades' acquisition of Paperboard Industries in 1992.
Paperboard, which is 63 per cent owned by Cascades, now includes all the
Cascades group's European and North American boxboard interests. It went
public last year.
Mr Laurent Lemaire, Cascades chairman, said the eight plants, some of which
are unable to use recycled material, did not fit into the company's
long-term strategy. There were five or six potential bidders for the plants,
he added.
Cascades Paperboard recorded a loss of CDollars 5.1m, or 13 cents a share,
in the quarter to March, against a profit of CDollars 443,000, or 2 cents.
Mr Lemaire said that Paperboard sales and profits should improve later this
year.

The company warned it was considering lowering its 1993 dividend. The 1992
payout was an unchanged at DM10.
Profits for the year to December 31, 1992 fell to DM50m, from DM52m the
previous year on sales up by 9 per cent to DM2.4bn, reflecting the merger of
the automotive battery activities of Varta and Bosch, the German engineering
group. First-quarter sales in Germany decreased by 7 per cent and abroad by

The sharpest fall in first quarter sales was recorded in industrial
batteries with a 21 per cent decline. Sales of automotive batteries fell by

from Dollars 80.3m to Dollars 82.9m. The after-tax figure in the current
year was struck after a Dollars 3.54m extraordinary item related to early
debt repayment.
Mr Allen Questrom, chairman, described the first quarter as 'moderately
good' and in line with expectations. He noted the weather had not been
generally helpful, and consumers appeared to have lingering doubts about the
economy.

FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Further loss at Trustco ahead of
takeover

<TEXT>
ROYAL Trustco, the Canadian financial services group controlled by Toronto's
Bronfman family, has recorded another large loss as it limps towards a
takeover by Royal Bank of Canada.
The first-quarter loss was CDollars 75m (USDollars 58.8m), or 57 cents a
share, against earnings of CDollars 24m, or 6 cents, a year earlier. RT
posted losses of CDollars 852m in 1992.
Investment income dropped 30 per cent, to CDollars 474m. RT said falling
deposits and the repayment of borrowings curtailed lending and investment
activity. Margins were squeezed by higher non-performing loans, a smaller
equity base and a lower yield on its securities portfolio. Loan loss
provisions jumped to CDollars 61m from CDollars 21m.
RT is negotiating the details of the CDollars 1.6bn sale of its operations
to Royal Bank.
Under the deal, RT will be left with a portfolio of mostly real-estate loans
with a book value of CDollars 4.3bn and is likely to change its name. Its
assets stood at CDollars 22.5bn on March 31.
Royal Bank, Canada's biggest financial institution, will gain 146 branches
in Canada, as well as 15 overseas units.
Mr Allan Taylor, RBC's chairman, said recently the acquisition would enable
the bank to 'expand quickly in four profitable high-growth markets where our
own presence is relatively small'.
The acquisition will raise the proportion of consumer deposits in RBC's
total funding from 61 per cent to 68 per cent, against an average of 48 per
cent for other Canadian banks.
Brascan, a key Bronfman holding company, lifted first-quarter income to
CDollars 136.7m, or CDollars 1.49, from CDollars 7.3m, or 2 cents, due to a
CDollars 210m gain from the sale of its 47 per cent interest in John Labatt,
the brewing and entertainment group. Improved operating results from London
Life, an insurance group, were offset by RT's loss. Natural resource
earnings were down due to the loss incurred by Noranda on the sale of its
stake in MacMillan Bloedel, the forestry company.

NOVO NORDISK, Denmark's leading biotechnology company, reported
first-quarter pre-tax profits down by 14 per cent to DKr405m (Dollars 65m)
from DKr470m.
The group, whose leading products are insulin and other healthcare products
and industrial enzymes, pointed out that it had an exceptionally good first
quarter last year.
Group sales were ahead by 3 per cent to DKr2.75bn from DKr2.66bn last year.
The increase was achieved despite the fact that appreciation of the krone
reduced the average value of invoicing currencies by about 3 per cent, said
Novo.
Net profits fell 6 per cent to DKr304m from DKr324m, and earnings per share
to DKr8.11 from DKr8.74.
Healthcare sales rose 6 per cent to DKr1.83bn, while sales by the
bio-industrial division were down by DKr5m to DKr814m.

CASCADES, the international packaging and fine paper group, has put eight
North American boxboard plants, valued at CDollars 300m (USDollars 235m), up
for sale.
The cigarette packaging and converting plants, which employ 1,250, were part
of Cascades' acquisition of Paperboard Industries in 1992.
Paperboard, which is 63 per cent owned by Cascades, now includes all the
Cascades group's European and North American boxboard interests. It went
public last year.
Mr Laurent Lemaire, Cascades chairman, said the eight plants, some of which
are unable to use recycled material, did not fit into the company's
long-term strategy.
There were five or six potential bidders for the plants, he added.
Cascades Paperboard recorded a loss of CDollars 5.1m, or 13 cents a share,
in the quarter to March, against a profit of CDollars 443,000, or 2 cents.
Mr Lemaire said that Paperboard sales and profits should improve later this
year, though the North American and European markets remained generally
depressed.
A boxboard plant in Duffel, Belgium, will be closed temporarily and
converted to use recycled materials.
Air Canada is raising USDollars 190m by selling five Airbus 320 aircraft to
a group of international banks in a long-term leasing deal.

CYPRESS Semiconductor, a Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer, to sell
its microprocessor subsidiary, Ross Technology, to Fujitsu of Japan for
about Dollars 23m.
Ross is a producer of Sparc microprocessors, designed by Sun Microsystems.
Sun, the largest user of Sparc chips, recently chose a different version of
the microprocessor, produced by Texas Instruments, for its latest
workstation and server computers. Ross recorded a pre-tax loss of Dollars 3m
in the first quarter.
Cypress said the sale was a better alternative than closing or contracting
the Ross unit.
The acquisition ensures Fujitsu continued supplies of Ross' Sparc chips to
ICL, and other parts of its computer operations. Fujitsu will also gain
Ross' microprocessor design capabilities. The sale is subject to US
government approval.

<TEXT>
FOX, part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, and Tele-Communications, the
largest US cable television operator, are to create a cable television
service.
The agreement guaranteed Fox slots on cable systems serving TCI's 10m
customers while providing the cable operator with good programming, analysts
said yesterday.
Mr Murdoch said he expected the channel to be profitable in about 2 1/2
years, 'depending on our success in rolling it out'. He said the service
needed to reach 40m homes to break even.
The service is expected to be launched between early October and the end of
January.
Mr Christopher Dixon, an analyst with securities house PaineWebber, said the
arrangement was the first in what could be a variety of joint ventures in
response to complex new regulations from the Federal Communications
Commission.
As part of the arrangement, which is for five years and subject to execution
of final documents, Fox will allow TCI to retransmit Fox-owned and operated
stations' broadcast signals.
TCI will pay Fox Dollars 0.25 per subscriber and Fox will pay its affiliate
stations Dollars 0.075 out of each Dollars 0.25. Mr Murdoch said affiliates
could also choose to receive Dollars 0.05 per subscriber plus a small amount
of the equity of the new channel.
He said 25 per cent of the equity was being reserved for the affiliates. TCI
is not taking an equity position.
Fox was still negotiating with the affiliates over the arrangement and talks
were going well, Mr Murdoch said.
Mr John Malone, TCI president, said: 'The agreement redefines the
relationship between broadcasters and cable operators.'
Fox has agreed to provide some original programming for the new channel,
which will show mainly entertainment.

ORTIZ, the French food group behind Miko ice cream, suffered a rapid decline
in net profits to FFr12.7m (Dollars 2.35m) in 1992 from FFr53.5m in 1991
because of the squeeze on consumer spending.
The group, which produces Vivagel delicatessen products, has, like other
food companies, been badly affected by high interest rates and rising
unemployment on the French consumer goods market.
Consolidated sales fell by 1 per cent to FFr5.31bn in 1992 from FFr5.38bn in
1991. The 1992 figures were also affected by a number of structural changes
within the group.
Ortiz said net profits had been depressed by heavy marketing expenditure for
both the Miko and Vivagel brands and the cost of reorganising its
distribution system.
Ortiz said that, in spite of the fall in 1992 profits, it was confident
about its future prospects, notably because of the impact of the cost
cutting implemented in 1992, which should have a positive effect on this
year's results.
Canadian-based John Labatt has sold the Tuscan division of Johanna Farms to
Dairy Enterprises. The purchase price and other details of the transaction
were not disclosed, Reuter reports from Toronto.
The Tuscan dairy division consists of Tuscan Industries in New Jersey and
New York, which operates out of two plants and employs 660.
Dairy Enterprises is a newly formed company in which James Schreiber,
Michael Marcus and affiliates of the Steinhardt Organisation are investors.

<TEXT>
CHARGEURS, the French textile and media group, yesterday warned that its
industrial activities would make a loss in the first half of this year
because of the cost of a rationalisation package involving 1,000 job losses.
The group, which is a prominent player in the international wool textile
industry and a significant shareholder in BSkyB, the UK satellite television
service, plans to close a wool processing plant in Argentina and to reduce
its manufacturing capacity in France.
Mr Jerome Seydoux, chairman, said the job losses, which would reduce
Chargeurs' workforce by more than 10 per cent, would aggravate the problems
of the industrial division during the first half, but should contribute
towards an improved performance in the second half.
The media division is expected to produce similar results to last year when
the group as a whole saw net profits almost double to FFr724m (Dollars
134m), after a FFr410m surplus on the sale of its stake in the UTA airline
to Air France, from FFr366m in 1991.
Chargeurs' sales fell by 16 per cent in the first quarter and by 12 per cent
last month.

THE Midwest stock exchange, the second-largest stock exchange in the US
after New York, will return to its original name, the Chicago Stock
Exchange, from July 8. Members voted for the change in the hope that the
Chicago name would carry a higher profile than 'Midwest'.
The 111-year-old stock exchange took the Midwest name in 1949 when it
acquired stock exchanges in Cleveland, St Louis, Minneapolis and, later, New
Orleans.
'We operate in a very competitive environment and want to build the identity
of our exchange locally, nationally and internationally,' said Mr Homer
Livingston, exchange president. 'We believe the name 'Chicago' is key to
strengthening that identity, given the Chicago exchange's reputation for
creative products, innovative technology and focus on service.'

ZURICH Insurance, Switzerland's biggest insurer and one of the largest in
the world, reported that both life and non-life business contributed to a
13.8 per cent rise in 1992 net profits, Reuter reports from Zurich.
The company posted group net earnings of SFr491.4m (Dollars 327.6m) against
SFr431.8m in 1991.
It said non-life insurance business had contributed to the increase in spite
of the increased burden from natural catastrophes, but that the bigger
contribution came from growth in its life insurance business.
At the same time, investment earnings rose 10.8 per cent to SFr4.1bn.
Zurich reported a 10 per cent increase in its gross premium income -
equivalent to turnover in other sectors - to SFr21.5bn, although it noted
that some two fifths of the increase stemmed from acquisitions.
The company will give fuller details of its 1992 performance at its annual
news conference on June 2.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR SILVIO Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, is today expected to
announce the flotation of the Silvio Berlusconi Editore publishing operation
in an attempt to raise cash for his Fininvest holding company.
Precise terms of the deal remain unclear, amid some uncertainty as to
whether Fininvest will float SBE independently, or as part of a more complex
transaction involving its majority-owned Mondadori publishing operation,
which is listed on the stock market.
The signs are the deal will take place through a reverse takeover of
Mondadori by SBE, combined with a share swap for Mondadori shareholders into
SBE. That will be followed by a placing of up to 49 per cent of SBE's stock.
Terms of the transaction will be announced after a SBE board meeting and
extraordinary shareholders' meeting today.
It marks a turnabout for Mr Berlusconi, who has not hidden his distaste for
having outside investors. However, the need to raise cash for Fininvest has
increased as acquisition-led expansion has been halted and debts have
mounted.
SBE publishes Italy's best-selling magazine, TV Sorrisi e Canzoni, and has
recently launched Noi, a new mass-market weekly.
The company, which also has substantial commercial printing activities, made
net profits of L29.7bn (Dollars 19.4m) on sales of L320bn last year.
Mondadori is Italy's biggest publisher, with a range of book and magazine
interests.

AEGON, the Netherlands' second-largest insurance group, said first-quarter
net profit rose by nearly 20 per cent to Fl 230m (Dollars 128m) on turnover
up 11.4 per cent at Fl 4.93bn.
The company, which described the results as a 'promising' start to the year,
said the first-quarter performance confirmed its optimism about 1993, adding
that it stood by earlier predictions that full-year operating profit would
show a slight increase over 1992.
Operating profit after tax in the first quarter rose by 6.7 per cent to Fl
200.3m. Aegon's realised profits on investments showed an even stronger rise
to Fl 29.6m from Fl 5.3m the year before. The company noted that investment
results tended to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
Life insurance, Aegon's single largest business, posted a 17.8 per cent
increase to Fl 205m.

protest vote

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kay Whitmore, chairman of troubled Eastman Kodak, yesterday promised
investors a sharply improved performance and forecast record 1994 earnings
per share, yet was met with a substantial protest vote by dissatisfied
shareholders at the annual meeting.
The meeting was held against a background of rising concern by some of
Kodak's largest institutional investors over its lacklustre financial
performance.
This anxiety was reinforced late last month when Kodak's share price fell
sharply after Mr Christopher Steffen, the company's new chief financial
officer, quit after only 11 weeks, because of differences with Mr Whitmore
over the best way to restructure the business.
Three Kodak directors up for re-election yesterday won overwhelming support
from shareholders, getting 96.2 per cent of votes cast, but investors sent a
strong message of dissatisfaction by casting 42 per cent of ballots in
favour of a proposal to make the entire board stand for re-election every
year.
The College Retirement Equities Fund (Cref), the single largest managed
equity fund in the US, announced it had withheld support for the three
directors because of its conviction that 'Kodak has continued to delay
restructuring and effective management decisions'. It distrusted the
company's willingness to make 'long overdue changes'.
Mr Whitmore, trying to convince shareholders the company had changed its
spots, told the meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, that Kodak would
generate substantially more cash flow between now and 1995 than the
previously stated target of Dollars 1bn, which was now only 'a fraction of
what we intend'.
He repeated that he expected a solid increase in 1993 earnings, compared to
1992, and predicted record earnings per share in 1994.

FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Profits at Italian energy group
plunge to L126bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGIP, the Italian upstream oil and gas group controlled by the Eni state
holding company, suffered a steep fall in profits to L126bn (Dollars 82.6m)
last year from L1,188bn in 1991.
The drop at the company, due to be partially privatised by the end of this
year, will come as a blow to plans to float Agip's shares and reflects the
heavy additional burden of Agip's stake in the loss-making EniChem chemicals
operation.
Agip gave no indication of how deeply it had been affected by EniChem's
losses, which more than doubled to L1,560bn last year. Agip owns 49.6 per
cent of Sci, a holding company owned with other Eni group operations, which
in turn controls almost 60 per cent of EniChem.
Among other factors accounting for its profits fall were higher interest
charges and exchange rate factors. Overall, Agip had to set aside L2,622bn
in amortisation and L933bn for taxation.

FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nestle offers rights issue to US
institutional investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE is arranging for US institutional investors to participate in its
imminent rights issue. It is a pioneering initiative which is likely to be
followed by other large European companies.
Nestle, the world's largest foods company, is invoking a 1990 US Securities
and Exchange Commission rule which permits non-US registered companies to
make offerings to 'qualified institutional buyers'.
Rule 144A has been used to enable non-US registered companies to float new
debt and equity issues in the US. Nestle is the first to use it for a rights
issue.
Nestle believes 15 per cent of its shares are held by US investors, most of
them institutions. Until now, these investors have not been allowed to
participate in the group's rights issues because of US legal restrictions on
fund raising by non-US-registered companies.
'This was not very fair and it depressed the market for the rights,' Mr Reto
Domeniconi, finance director, said at the group's annual press conference
yesterday.
Mr Helmut Maucher, the chairman, told the meeting that first-quarter group
sales rose 6 per cent to SFr13.5bn (Dollars 9bn). Only 1 per cent of the
growth was volume, with another 1 per cent from monetary effects and the
rest from acquisitions.
However, Mr Maucher was confident that the group would have 'a decent profit
and sales increase this year'. In 1992, Nestle net income was SFr2.7bn on
sales of SFr54.5bn.
Mr Domeniconi said the extension of the rights issue to US institutional
shareholders would be done in the guise of a private placement lead managed
by Lehman Brothers International. Individual US Nestle shareholders still
cannot exercise their rights.
The rights issue was launched following last year's FFr13.3bn (Dollars
2.5bn) takeover of the Perrier mineral water group which has been financed
by short-term borrowing. The rights will be on a 1-for-25 basis at a price
to be set after May 27.
Mr Domeniconi said the issue would raise more than SFr1bn. The Perrier
acquisition was largely responsible for the sharp rise in the group's net
debt to SFr9.9bn at the end of last year, 67.7 per cent of total capital,
from SFr4.5bn at the end of 1991.
However, imminent sales of some Perrier subsidiaries would bring the final
acquisition cost down to about SFr2.3bn.
Nestle is one of a few big European companies considering applying for a
listing on the New York stock exchange. However, Mr Domeniconi argued that
meeting SEC disclosure requirements would require a 'tremendous effort'
without giving shareholders better information than they get now.

FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: EC reforms hurt agrochemicals -
Schering's mooted deal with Hoechst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's announcement that Schering, the German bioscience group, is
negotiating a possible merger of its agrochemicals business with Hoechst,
the German chemicals giant, raised more than a few eyebrows.
It was the choice of partner rather than the merger itself that caused the
surprise. A deal would create a new number two in the world agrochemicals
league after Ciba of Switzerland: but the geographical synergies between the
two companies is minimal.
Rationalisation is clearly necessary in this Dollars 27bn industry,
involving fungicides pesticides and insecticides, though not fertilisers.
The sector has been severely battered in recent years, enduring an unhappy
combination of rising costs and falling demand.
Costs are on the increase because of rising development overheads - a direct
consequence of increasing government demands for safer and more
environmentally friendly products.
Demand is tumbling almost wholly because of the reforms last year of the
European Community's Common Agricultural Policy that involved setting aside
15 per cent of farmers' land.
Estimates of the impact of the reforms vary. Allan Woodburn Associates, the
Edinburgh-based agrochemical market research specialists, estimates that the
EC market last year fell between 10 per cent and 12 per cent. Wood
Mackenzie, the agrochemicals analysts, estimates that it dropped 13 per
cent.
'About half the fall in west Europe was due to the reforms and about half
due to the weather,' says Mr Allan Woodburn. He expects the market to fall a
further 8 per cent to 10 per cent over the next two to three years.
The US market is also struggling. BASF at one point cut the price of
products for soyabeans by 30 per cent in America last year.
Monsanto has been cutting the prices of Roundup, its best-selling herbicide,
after its US patents expired last year.
Zeneca, ICI's bioscience division, estimates the world market declined
between 2 per cent and 3 per cent last year because of the reforms and price
competition in the US.
'The agrochemicals market is clearly stagnating,' admits Professor Klaus
Pohle, Schering's chief financial officer and deputy chairman.
'The CAP reforms have really changed the conditions of life. The lower
subsidies mean farmers are unwilling to increase purchases of agrochemicals.
At the same time, demands for increasing environmental performance mean
higher R&amp;D costs. We have to adapt to a smaller market,' says Professor
Pohle.
Schering has been particularly hit by the EC reforms. The group has 60 per
cent of its sales in the region, according to Mr Woodburn.
Sales fell 16 per cent last year.
During the first quarter of this year, its agrochemicals division's turnover
collapsed 22 per cent, a fall that Professor Pohle partly attributed to
changing buying patterns. The division is no longer offering discounts at
the beginning of the year to encourage wholesalers to take early stock, and
aims to cut staff by 20 per cent by 1994.
The impact of the reforms has been exacerbated by Schering's product mix.
Cereal herbicides can be used on some set-aside land, but no fungicides, and
it is this product area that had been hit harder than any other. Schering's
strength is in cereal fungicides and sugar beat herbicides which have not
been affected.
If it comes off, the merger between Schering and Hoechst would link the
world's 12th and eighth largest agrochemicals businesses and put the new
group ahead of the operations at Bayer of Germany and Zeneca, according to
Mr Woodburn.
Last year, Schering's business had a turnover of about Dollars 820m; Hoechst
agrochemicals sales were Dollars 1.29bn.
Rhone-Poulenc of France has already linked its agrochemicals business to
that of Sumitomo, while Shell and American Cyanamid are understood to be
negotiating a potential combined venture.
Schering almost merged its business with that of Sandoz until the Swiss
company also mooted a merger of its pharmaceuticals operations.
However, although there is some synergy between the products of Hoechst and
Schering - the former is strong in cereal herbicides and insecticides and
has only limited exposure to fungicides - the geographical arguments for a
link are not overwhelming.
Both are strong in the European market. Mr Woodburn estimates 48.5 per cent
of the new combined group would be in west Europe, 16.5 per cent in North
America, 13 per cent in Latin America, 12 per cent in eastern Asia, and 10
per cent elsewhere.
'This deal will do almost nothing to reduce the two companies dependence on
the rapidly weakening European market,' says Mr John McDougall at Wood
Mackenzie.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Bibby hit by recession in Spanish
construction sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EFFECTS of deepening recession in the Spanish construction sector has
left J Bibby &amp; Sons, the industrial and agricultural company, with sharply
lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.5m, against Pounds 17.3m, for the six
months to March 27.
The sharp decline, on sales 48 per cent higher at Pounds 416m, appears to
have cast a shadow over the future of the dividend following a 30 per cent
cut in the interim to 2p.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, said a final payment 'will need to be
considered in light of the circumstances prevailing at the time'. Earnings
per share dropped from 9.16p to 2.06p.
Bibby's profits were depressed by a Pounds 6.9m pre-tax loss in the capital
equipment division, which comprises Finanzauto, Spain's only Caterpillar
distributor, and Stet, its Portuguese subsidiary. Bibby, 79 per cent-owned
by South Africa's Barlow Rand group, purchased Finanzauto last summer for
Pounds 86m after a hostile six-month-long bid battle. The acquisition of
heavily indebted Finanzauto has also resulted in a sharp rise in interest
charges from Pounds 2m to Pounds 8.2m.
Mr Mansell-Jones said the immediate outlook in Spain remained gloomy.
Although Finanzauto had been restructured, the beneficial effects had been
masked by a further decline in the construction equipment market.
Mr Mansell-Jones also warned on the group's outlook in the second half,
saying recession in continental Europe and the Far East had made prospects
uncertain. However, he was more optimistic about the US.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Greenalls cautious despite 10% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENALLS GROUP, the pubs and hotels operator, lifted interim profits by 10
per cent but said it was still waiting for 'tangible evidence of a real
recovery that will be sustained.'
Though economic indicators were showing signs of an upturn, the trading
background remained challenging, said Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman and chief
executive.
'Trading in the hotel sector generally has not improved and although
occupancy is increasing, room rates remain under pressure throughout the
industry.'
Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 26 moved ahead from Pounds 23.4m
to Pounds 25.7m - below market forecasts; the shares lost 13p to 414p.
Operating profits of the group's pubs rose 7.7 per cent to Pounds 22.2m.
Drink sales were 4.4 per cent higher and food sales rose 20 per cent.
Spending on acquisitions and refurbishment totalled Pounds 11m in the first
half and expenditure of Pounds 27m is planned during the rest of the year.
The 109 Premier House branded pub restaurants and lodges lifted operating
profits from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 3.45m, helped by growth of 44 per cent in
accommodation income and 34 per cent in food sales. Spending on acquisitions
and development in the first half totalled Pounds 9m and a further Pounds
16m will be spent this year.
De Vere hotels maintained profits at Pounds 6.1m. Occupancy rose from 53 per
cent to 62 per cent but achieved room rates fell 12 per cent to Pounds 44.
The group will open a new four-star hotel, Oulton Hall, near Leeds, shortly.
'Overall, we look forward in the second half to stable trading conditions,'
Mr Thomas said.
Off-licence operating profits improved from Pounds 1.81m to to Pounds 2.31m,
reflecting a full contribution from the Blayneys chain, acquired last year.
In contrast, drinks and services operating profit fell 26 per cent to Pounds
2.53m, mainly due to depressed volumes and a decline in contract packaging
in the soft drinks market.
Manufacture and distribution of Del Monte products will begin later this
year.
Gin and vodka production was 15.4 per cent higher and increased volumes of
own-label products helped raise the group's share of the UK white spirits
market to 12.9 per cent.
The interim dividend goes up from 4.84p to 5.08p, payable from fully diluted
earnings per share of 11.12p (10.65p).

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Frederick Cooper US growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREDERICK COOPER, the metal finishing, architectural hardware and electrical
products group, is expanding its US coating operations through the Dollars
6.98m (Pounds 4.56m) purchase of Florida-based Spectra Metal Coating.
The move gives the group a manufacturing base in the US for its Cooper
Coated Coil subsidiary.
Parallel with the agreement to buy Spectra, Cooper has entered into a sales
agreement with Spectra Metal Sales, controlled by Mr Thomas Snell, a
shareholder of Spectra Metal Coating.
Spectra Metal Sales has been taking over 70 per cent of the Metal Coating
output, but Mr Ed Kirk, chairman of Cooper, said this proportion would drop
as the metal coating company expanded sales.
Cooper is financing the deal by bank borrowings to raise gearing to 60 per
cent, from 21.9 per cent at end January.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Time to change the window display - The way
forward for the Roddick family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'BODY SHOP', says the taxi driver at Littlehampton station, more a statement
than an enquiry as to destination.
It is a fair assumption that anyone getting off the London train at the
south coast seaside resort-cum-retirement home and seeking a taxi is heading
for Body Shop International's new head office at Watersmead.
'Anita and Gordon,' says the taxi driver on the return journey, referring to
the Roddicks, managing director and chairman respectively of Body Shop, 'are
the biggest employers in Littlehampton. But everyone slags them off'.
Littlehampton does not like the slogans on the lorries, he says, and worse
still 'you saw that naked lady on the grass? Littlehampton doesn't like it.'
The naked lady needs a little explanation. Body Shop's 20 acre site,
containing head office, factory, warehouse, shop and creche, is littered
with witty, life size figures. A cleaning lady continually mops the floor of
the reception area.
In front of the office - a green roofed pagoda - are two groups of figures
which on inspection reveal themselves to be tableaux of paintings. One,
Seurat's bathers, the other Manet's Dejeuner sur l'Herbe, including the
aforementioned naked lady.
The naked lady, it transpires, is a metaphor for Anita Roddick. 'Anita's
blatant. She has an idea and she tells everyone, and she's blunt and to the
point'.
The Littlehampton mentality is shared by some in the investment community.
While Body Shop was generating phenomenal growth 'the dinosaurs', as Anita
calls stockbrokers and fund managers, could swallow the principles - even
applaud them as a good marketing ploy.
But Body Shop broke faith with the City last autumn, making a profit
warning, admitting in effect that the phenomenon could not go on for ever.
The shares plunged.
Now there is a story going around that Body Shop is giving up its principles
and becoming a 'normal' company. With the usual Body Shop fervour this was
denied when the group reported annual profits for the year to February down
from Pounds 25.2m to Pounds 21.5m.
'Some of the less friendly observers, and Body Shop watchers, have
determined that we will abandon our principles and reveal ourselves as
shallow cynical exploiters. We must disappoint them,' the company said.
It is clear that the non-meeting of minds between Anita and the City
continues. She makes no concessions to the dinosaurs' point of view, nor do
they, she believes, to hers. She finds finance boring.
Her passion is searching the world for jungle juices to incorporate into
Body Shop products.
'Direct sourcing,' she says, 'a lot of effort goes into that but the
institutions are just not interested. Financial science is what grabs their
goolies'.
Asked about childcare at Watersmead, she scorns to make a commercial
justification for it, mentioning almost in passing that Body Shop's staff
turnover is under 3 per cent - an amazingly low figure for a retailer.
'We got in because it was morally right not because we viewed it
economically', she affirms. 'We don't put profits into Lear jets or a
chairman's Rolls Royce', implying that questions ought to be asked of
companies which do.
'The creche and the environmental issues we've done early. Others will have
to follow and it will cost them more.'
Even Anita, just off a 10 hour overnight flight from Brazil, where she has
been arranging supplies of Brazil nut oil, admits to being too tired to cope
with her colleagues' excitement about her trip. She has escaped to her
husband Gordon's office and does not intend to interrupt.
Her hair - so wild in the press photos - is neatly tied back; the car park
is full of cars, not bicycles; the writing on the lab wall 'it is obscene to
test something so unimportant as a moisturiser on an animal' is not crazy.
But it is Gordon that gives the Body Shop game away. There is a commercial
company behind the image.
He does not attempt to disguise the problems Body Shop has met. They are
typical of small companies which have grown rapidly.
'It has grown to a dimension where you get the illnesses of giantism. When
it was small you could drop an idea in one end and it would reach the other
end in two weeks. It got to the point where it took two years.'
An example he gives is a window display design created for the whole group.
'People would say it won't work in Australia because its winter there and
they don't want spring posters. There would be three months of arguing
ending up with a compromise.'
Those compromises went into every area of the business. Shops in Sweden and
Hong Kong would be supplied with the same shampoo range regardless of the
different hair types.
'We had to change all that. The only way to change was for the whole
business to be fragmented into areas that made some sense.' These are UK
retail, international retail - subdivided into US and the rest of the world
 -and the supply company. Now the group will produce market specific ranges.
The first, designed for the US, is based on blue corn (to the uninitiated, a
blue version of sweetcorn) and the second is a tea tree range for Australia.
Another concern was that Body Shop 'had become production led rather than
retail led. The UK and international business will be headed up by
retailers,' Gordon stresses.
Mr Geoff Marshall, a respected retailer, has been hired to run the UK side,
and Mr Michael Ross, for eight years a franchisee of Body Shop, has been put
in charge of international retailing.
Body Shop has reached maturity in the UK, Gordon admits. But he reckons to
attract more people into the shops through increasing the range of goods,
and to become a more aggressive promoter.
With about half the group's profits made in the UK, maturity there
inevitably means a slowing of the group's profit growth.
But Gordon expects that overseas expansion will be strong. Anita butts in:
'When you think how big the planet is we are not a speck in the eye'.
Body Shop will open its 1,000th store this year, and only a quarter of them
will be in the UK. But, the sceptic asks, retailers who venture abroad have
a low success rate.
Gordon has evidently been asked that many times. 'The evidence is we have
controlled it quite well.' He puts the success down to franchising. Each
country is run by a head franchisee. 'They are all individual entrepreneurs,
all keen to be successful. If we'd tried growth overseas in any other way I
honestly believe we would have failed. Boots pulled out of Canada after
years there. Body Shop is trading very well in Canada,' he says.
He puts the group's profit fall last year down to the poor economic climate
in the UK, the overheads at Watersmead where the factory is running at only
25 per cent of potential capacity, and the costs of relocating the US head
office.
These should be temporary problems. Similarly, Gordon asserts, the group's
borrowing levels will fall as capital spending, Pounds 20m last year,
reduces.
He has no anxieties about the share price. 'We are not in the arena to do
acquisitions or raise cash to do anything'.
And he is relaxed about relations with the City. 'They hate heaps of the
things we say. I view it as their problem.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff improves 28% to Pounds 4.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PITTENCRIEFF, the natural resources and communications company embroiled in
a hostile bid for USM concern Aberdeen Petroleum, yesterday reported a 28
per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.5m for the year to December 31.
Sales were 83 per cent ahead at Pounds 18.7m.
Mr Terry Heneaghan, the chief executive who warned last week that annual
profits would not meet analysts' expectations of Pounds 5.5m, said the lower
than expected return was entirely due to difficulties in integrating the 13
communications businesses acquired for Dollars 23m (Pounds 15m) last year.
'We had a bit of indigestion trying to take on those 13 acquisitions,' he
said. However, the problems had been tackled and the group was currently
making savings of more than Dollars 100,000 a month from measures
implemented since the year-end.
The communications division, which will be floated in the US this summer,
saw a rise in monthly revenues from Dollars 1m to Dollars 2m. Oil and gas
production rose by 9 per cent in 1992. Mr Heneaghan said the group expected
to spend Dollars 2.8m this year on capital expenditure in this division.
Net debt rose from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 11.7m. Mr Heneaghan said the group
had more than adequate banking facilities to finance its offer for Aberdeen,
which includes a cash alternative valuing the target at Pounds 8.7m.
The final dividend is increased from 3.5p to 4p, for a total of 7p (6p).
Earnings per share fell 5 per cent to 15.63p.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Dull performance in UK behind 15% decline
at Body Shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL PRE-TAX profits from Body Shop International, the natural toiletries
and cosmetics group, fell 15 per cent from Pounds 25.2m to Pounds 21.5m in
the year to end-February.
The decline matched forecasts, however, and the shares rose 6 1/2 p to 204
1/2 p.
Despite the reduction in earnings per share from 8.8p to 7.4p, the
recommended final dividend is increased from 0.92p to a recommended 1.02p,
to give a total of 1.7p, up 6.25 per cent after an unchanged interim.
Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said the rise reflected underlying confidence
and showed the board's 'view of the business on more than just a one year
basis'.
The profit fall was attributed to lower like-for-like sales in the UK, down
6 per cent for the year after a 3 per cent fall in the first half; the
Pounds 1.3m cost of moving the US headquarters, and the increase in
overheads from the move to a new UK head office, production and warehouse
site.
Mr Roddick said a 'major operational reorganisation' would 'have a crucial
effect on our future strategy'.
Group turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 168.3m. However, including
franchisees' retail sales, turnover was up 18 per cent to Pounds 363m.
The group opened 173 shops, taking the total to 900, of which 233 (210) are
in the UK. It plans another 150 in the current year, with only a few in the
UK.
UK operating profits fell from 16.5m to Pounds 11.2m. A new head of the UK
retail business has been appointed, and more aggressive advertising is
planned.
In the US, profits rose from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2.1m, despite the Pounds
1.3m relocation cost. Retail sales were up 53 per cent, 3 per cent in
comparable stores.
Mr Roddick said that Chicago and Los Angeles, cities which had each had two
stores and two new ones opened, had seen sales in the older stores fall 15
to 20 per cent. But he said each city would eventually support far more
shops, and this was a short term effect. Profits from elsewhere in the world
rose from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 11m. Like-for-like sales growth was 6 per
cent.
Mr Roddick said gearing had fallen from 43 per cent to 35 per cent, as debt
reduced to Pounds 28.5m at the year end. Working capital had been cut. A
Dollars 45m (Pounds 29.2m) 7 year loan note had been privately placed in the
US allowing the overdraft to be repaid.
Capital expenditure of Pounds 20m last year would fall to Pounds 12m in the
current year, he said. Spending will be on new information systems, the
cosmetics manufacturing side, and in the US.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Time Products advances 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE chairman of Time Products, the watch and jewellery distribution
group, talks about the luxury end of his market he really does mean luxury.
Some of the watches which Mr Marcus Margulies' group handles sell for
several hundred thousand pounds each.
Although Time Products also owns the mass-market Sekonda brand of watches,
it is on the top end of the market that the group is becoming more focused.
Yesterday Time Products reported a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 9.3m for the year to January 31, even though overall sales dipped
from Pounds 51.1m to Pounds 49.6m.
About Pounds 1.3m of the profits increase was non-recurring, comprising
property profits and a released provision.
Earnings per share rose to 12.6p (9.74p). A final dividend of 5.2p makes a
7.95p (7.5p) total.
Mr Margulies said: 'The group's strategy in recent years has been to
concentrate increasingly on the distribution of luxury branded goods both in
the UK and overseas. This policy has been successfully implemented, with a
growing proportion of turnover being in very high quality markets.'
Time Products has exclusive agencies for several luxury watch brands - such
as Blancpain, Longines and Vacheron Constantin. In March the group paid
Pounds 2m for a 5 per cent stake in Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker
which specialises in highly technical and luxurious pieces.
The group recently moved into a new product area with the Dollars 17m
(Pounds 11m) acquisition of the business of Judith Leiber, an American who
designs luxury designer handbags.
The group said the effects of recession were keenly felt in the distribution
of its mainstream product lines. The Sekonda brand - which accounts for
about 12 per cent of all UK watch sales - suffered from problems within the
retail volume jewellery industry, in spite of a successful advertising
campaign. Longines, which sells watches in the Pounds 200 to Pounds 1,000
bracket, maintained turnover.
Last year Time Products closed Remex, its Hong Kong-based watch movement
manufacturing operation. Yesterday's figures included an extraordinary
profit of Pounds 1.2m, because the closure provision of Pounds 6.5m taken at
the start of the period proved too pessimistic.
Mr Margulies' family controls 20 per cent of the company.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: US offer accepted by holders of 51% of TIP
Europe
</HEADLINE>

   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric Capital, the US financial services company bidding for
trailer rental company TIP Europe, has announced that it had received valid
acceptances representing 51.3 per cent of TIP's shares by the first closing
date yesterday.
The offer has been extended until May 26, by which time an environmental
study of TIP's European sites will be completed.
The acceptances do not include a 9.9 per cent stake held by HAL Investments
(UK). HAL has said it will accept the offer unless a higher bid is made.
TIP's board has recommended the 42p a share cash offer. But earlier this
week two large shareholders with 9 per cent rejected the offer.
The two shareholders were Itel Corporation of the US and Tiphook, which is
TIP's main competitor. They said they believed that they were supported
privately by other shareholders.
Their intervention may have prompted some institutions to delay acceptance
in the hope of a higher price.
TIP's board said yesterday that shareholders should accept the offer now
rather than wait for potential longer term recovery.
GE Capital said it had the backing of 59.6 per cent of TIP's shareholders
holding 86.5m shares.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Oriel shows downturn to Pounds 74,000 loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORIEL GROUP, the USM-quoted insurance broker, announced pre-tax losses of
Pounds 74,000 for the year to end-December compared with profits of Pounds
2.44m in the previous 12 months.
The group also announced the acquisition of a used car breakdown warranty
company for an initial Pounds 8.71m, funded by a Pounds 3.5m placing with
partial clawback.
Oriel is paying Pounds 4.77m for Warranty Holdings' total share capital. It
will pay one of the remaining shareholder-directors Pounds 200,000 in
advance of a deferred payment scheme. It will also advance Warranty a total
of Pounds 3.74m to settle debt.
Exiting shareholders will receive Pounds 3m, mostly in cash, while remaining
shareholders will be paid Pounds 650,000 in ordinary shares and Pounds 1.12m
in unlisted convertible redeemable shares of 10p each.
Mr Peter Head and Mr David Latimer, the principal vendors, will continue as
managing and sales directors respectively.
They stand to gain a further Pounds 5.92m in deferred consideration, payable
in 1996, depending on profits.
Warranty made pre-tax profits of Pounds 183,000 (Pounds 725,000) in 1992. At
the year-end, it showed a net deficiency of assets of Pounds 4.46m, of which
Pounds 4.47m related to goodwill written off following a management buy-out.
Oriel said the acquisition would consolidate its strategy of developing
businesses which control their own distribution networks focused on a high
volume of low value transactions.
The acquisition will be funded by a bank loan and a Pounds 3.5m placing with
the Oman National Insurance Company at a premium price of 100p per share.
Shares in Oriel climbed 6p to close at 84p.
Qualifying Oriel shareholders will be able to subscribe for about half the
new issue on an 8-for-1 basis at the same price.
Oriel's turnover dipped to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 12m). The board proposed a
final dividend of 3p (3.2p), giving an unchanged total for the year of 5p.
Losses per share were 5.8p (earnings 11p).

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: LWT drops restriction on stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Weekend Television yesterday removed restrictions preventing anyone
owning more than 10 per cent of the company.
The restriction, insisted on by the old Independent Broadcasting Authority
to prevent takeovers of ITV companies in mid-franchise, has not been a
requirement since the beginning of this year.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT Holdings, said after yesterday's
annual meeting that the board took the view that it could no longer hide
behind the restriction and that it was an anachronism.
' This should not be seen as an exhortation or inducement to bid,' Sir
Christoper said.
LWT's largest shareholder, Mercury Asset Management, holds about 18 per cent
of the ITV company. The shareholding was not caught by the 10 per cent
restriction because it is spread across several funds.
LWT is believed to be the first of the ITV companies to vote to remove the
10 per cent restriction.
From next January ITV companies can be taken over on the Stock Exchange,
subject to the approval of the Independent Television Commission.
The annual meeting also approved a special payment of Pounds 375,000 to Mr
Marcus Plantin, former LWT director of programmes who is director of the
central ITV network.
The LWT money was half of what Sir Christopher described as 'the cost of his
departure.' The other half of the Pounds 750,000 payment, which was intended
to compensate Mr Plantin for his loss of LWT share options, was paid by the
ITV system.
There was no sign of a shareholder revolt against the management share
scheme that should net more than Pounds 55m gross for 44 managers and create
15 LWT millionaires.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fine Art up 16% to Pounds 34.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINE ART Developments, the mail order and greetings card company, continued
to buck the trend in the retail sector and yesterday unveiled a 16 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits in the year to March 31.
The record pre-tax outcome of Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 29.7m) was struck on
turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 311.5m (Pounds 287.3m).
The mail order side was the main engine of growth, contributing operating
profits up 10 per cent at Pounds 22.8m from turnover of Pounds 171.1m
(Pounds 150m). Both profits and turnover in the cards and paper products
division grew by 2 per cent - to Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 19.3m) and Pounds
140.5m (Pounds 137.4m) respectively.
Sales at Express Gifts slipped 5 per cent to Pounds 89m, as did they did in
the charity trading business to Pounds 22.1m, due mostly to the
recession-driven decline in average order values. However, sales in the
hampers business rose 24 per cent to Pounds 19.6m and overseas sales more
than doubled to Pounds 23.6m.
Tom-Wat, the loss-making charity mail order services company acquired for
Dollars 1m last May, is now breaking even.
In cards and paper products, wholesale sales slipped 1 per cent to Pounds
58.3m as retailers reduced stock levels towards the year-end. As leases
reverted to the group, Papertree, the retail chain, expanded to 90 outlets,
although Mr Keith Chapman, chairman, said last May that he wanted to reduce
the then-80 outlets to less than 70. However, the chain was, for the first
time, in the black at the operating level.
Interest charges fell by Pounds 2.57m to Pounds 7.69m because of lower rates
and also because borrowings (including finance leases) declined to Pounds
39m (Pounds 48.3m).
A final dividend of 9.75p (8.3p) is proposed, to make a total of 12.75p
(11p), payable from earnings of 30.26p (25.36p) per share.
COMMENT
As and when the recession recedes Fine Art should reap the rewards of the
capital investment it has made during the slump. A thorough-going redesign
of the cards, an increase in the retention of agents, and these
better-than-expected results all augur well. Moreover the management has
said that Fine Art's constituent businesses are running smoothly enough for
it to explore expansion possibilities. A US manufacturing acquisition or a
greenfield start-up there could be on the cards, as could an attempt to
offset the UK mail order side's Christmas bias. Although the shares - up 6p
at 552p - stand at a not undeserved premium to the sector, they may not have
too much upside, possibly limiting acquisition options.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Time Products clocks up 22% advance to
Pounds 9.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE chairman of Time Products, the watch and jewellery distribution
group, talks about the luxury end of his market he really does mean luxury.
Some of the watches which Mr Marcus Margulies' group handles sell for
several hundred thousand pounds each.
Although Time Products also owns the mass-market Sekonda brand of watches,
it is on the top end of the market that the group is becoming more focused.
Yesterday Time Products reported a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 9.3m for the year to January 31, even although overall sales
dipped from Pounds 51.1m to Pounds 49.6m.
About Pounds 1.3m of the profits increase was non-recurring, comprising
property profits and a released provision.
Earnings per share rose to 12.6p (9.74p). A final dividend of 5.2p makes a
7.95p (7.5p) total.
Mr Margulies said: 'The group's strategy in recent years has been to
concentrate increasingly on the distribution of luxury branded goods both in
the UK and overseas. This policy has been successfully implemented, with a
growing proportion of turnover being in very high quality markets.'
Time Products has exclusive agencies for several luxury watch brands - such
as Blancpain, Longines and Vacheron Constantin. In March the group paid
Pounds 2m for a 5 per cent stake in Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker
which specialises in highly technical and luxurious pieces.
The group recently moved into a new product area with the Dollars 17m
(Pounds 11m) acquisition of the business of Judith Leiber, an American who
designs luxury designer handbags.
Mr Margulies said of Judith Leiber: 'Its products have not been actively
marketed outside North America and I am confident that there is a
substantial potential for developing the brand on a worldwide basis.
'The name has also been largely unexploited on merchandise other than
handbags and, in time, this will offer considerable scope for broadening the
product range.'
These most recent investments came together when Time Products was awarded
the North American agency for Audemars Piguet, having distributed its
watches in the UK for a number of years. A luxury watch showroom is now
being developed at the premises of Judith Leiber in New York.
The group said effects of recession were keenly felt in the distribution of
its mainstream product lines. The Sekonda brand - which accounts for about
12 per cent of all UK watch sales - suffered from problems within the retail
volume jewellery industry, in spite of a successful advertising campaign.
Longines, which sells watches in the Pounds 200 to Pounds 1,000 bracket,
maintained turnover.
Last year Time Products closed Remex, its Hong Kong-based watch movement
manufacturing operation. Yesterday's figures included an extraordinary
profit of Pounds 1.2m, because the closure provision of Pounds 6.5m taken at
the start of the period proved too pessimistic.
Mr Margulies' family controls 20 per cent of the company.

MR GUS Macdonald, managing director of Scottish Television, was paid a total
of Pounds 319,700 last year, making him the highest paid director of the ITV
company.
The sum included a bonus of Pounds 131,166 for winning the franchise, based
on one's year salary at the 1991 rate.
Scottish retained its franchise with a bid of just Pounds 2,000 a year in
the 1991 tenders.

FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Lessor will have a tough fight
to rebuild its global reach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING about its financial trouble could have been more galling for GPA
than to have arch-competitors picking over its back yard.
Aer Lingus, Ireland's national carrier and the airline that helped Tony Ryan
launch GPA 18 years ago, has just taken delivery of its latest Boeing
737-500 - leased long-term from GPA's biggest competitor, California-based
International Lease Finance Corp (IFLC).
While GPA has been fighting to prevent the collapse of its finances, ILFC,
which is backed by the American International Group, has been going from
strength to strength.
GPA has also been increasing the number of leases, although the
creditworthiness of some of its operators has deteriorated.
Last year it leased 203 aircraft worth more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn)
and has taken a dominant position in rapidly expanding markets such as
China.
All this it managed in its straitened financial circumstances. The question
is can it rebuild its global power?
GPA is probably the largest distributor of aircraft after Boeing. It prides
itself on marrying financiers and manufacturers with airline operators. The
company has not always leased to the strongest customers and last year, in
particular, it faced a debilitating level of early-terminating leases after
the Gulf war.
But GPA still has the greatest reach among airline leasing companies. In
spite of the rise of ILFC, GPA still leases twice as many aircraft around
the world as its rival.
GPA's size has also provided manufacturers and airline operators with a
flexibility they have cherished since the mid 1980s.
Lessors have offered aircraft manufacturers more secure order books by
enabling the airlines to keep the aircraft off the balance sheet.
Airlines have also been able to take aircraft for considerably shorter
periods than the lifetime of the aircraft.
This flexibility is likely to be even more valuable in the next 20 years.
With the latest generation of aircraft designed to last for 30 years,
leasing is forecast to be an increasingly popular form of aircraft finance.
Unfortunately, in providing this flexibility, GPA has taken much of the
operational risk on to its own shoulders which, lacking financial muscle,
have proved inadequate for the task.
If GPA, with GE's help, fails to rebuild its strength, there would be a rush
of perhaps better financed pretenders to fill the hole.
'There is still very attractive core financing to be done on aircraft,' says
Sir Michael Bishop, head of British Midland Airlines. 'Residual values of
the leases should increase in the next few years as supply becomes tighter.'
There is also one other consideration. As an intermediary - or marriage
broker - GPA's main assets are its experienced staff.
Without implying any disrespect to Mr Ryan's west of Ireland base, if the
GPA team is prepared to work out of Shannon it could work out anywhere - and
for anyone.

FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Manoeuvring and intrigue in
battle for control - The board's loyalty to founder Tony Ryan quashed the
middle managers' coup attempt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF GPA Group's executives have likened the political infighting going
on at their Shannon headquarters in the Irish republic to a Shakespearean
drama.
'There has been so much manoeuvring and intrigue at the top,' said one of
the group's advisers, 'that I am sometimes surprised that the executives
have any time for the restructuring at all.'
The wrangling came to a head recently when the middle management launched a
putsch to have Mr Tony Ryan, the group's founder, replaced as chairman by Mr
Gerald Greenwald, a non-executive director and key figure in rescues as
diverse as Chrysler and Olympia &amp; York.
The coup failed when the board rallied behind Mr Ryan. But the fight over
GPA's top job is by no means over.
Some of the group's biggest lenders have been concerned for several months
that a gulf has developed between middle management, which is effectively
running the operations, and senior directors involved in the restructuring,
which to date has failed to meet most of its object-
ives.
Angry about the lack of progress on the restructuring, two key middle
managers, Mr Patrick Blaney and Mr Phil Bolger, wrote to the board asking
for Mr Ryan to be replaced by Mr Greenwald.
However, the rest of the non-executive directors, who include Sir John
Harvey-Jones, the former chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, Lord
Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Garret FitzGerald,
the former Irish Prime Minister, gave their unequivocal support to Mr Ryan.
Three of the non-executives were already on record as citing Mr Ryan as the
main reason why they joined the board and they were not about to let him
down when he needed help.
As one of the non-executives put it: 'We are all very close to Mr Ryan, who
has been doing a splendid job in very difficult circumstances. We did not
entertain the thought of replacing him: there will be no more management
changes.'
In the event, Mr Blaney was promoted to the board as chief operating office
in charge of the restructuring, named Project Rebound.
Other members of middle management had already moved into key positions.
These include Mr Bolger, who is in charge of leasing, Mr Mike Dolan,
responsible for the negotiations with bondholders as managing director of
GPA Capital, and Mr Steve Johnson, who is the company's general council.
According to one banker the four 'young turks' no longer have confidence in
Mr Ryan's leadership. He believes they will resume their battle for control
of the company even if a refinancing is completed.
But it would be a mistake to write-off Mr Ryan. A deal with GE Capital would
have the effect of strengthening his position as chairman.
Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital, has assured Mr Ryan of his
continued support should the financial services arm of General Electric take
up a stake in GPA.
Nor is Mr Ryan adverse to making sudden board changes to strengthen his
hand. Last September he surprised some of his directors when he abruptly
took over as chief executive from Mr Maurice Foley.
There has been speculation that Mr Ryan may be willing to accept an honorary
post such as life president. But Ireland's best-known entrepreneur is
unlikely to go in the immediate future unless he is pushed.

FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Banks count their debt exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRONTLINE casualties in GPA's fall from grace are its shareholders,
whose shares have fallen to less than Dollars 1.
Many investors have written off their entire holdingstake in the company.
Their stakes will be heavily diluted by GE Capital's investment but the deal
gives them hope of recouping some of their losses.
The biggest current shareholder is Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, the
Japanese bank which owns 12 per cent of the ordinary shares.
Other big shareholders are Air Canada, with 10 per cent, and Mr Tony Ryan,
GPA's founder, who owns 100 per cent of a special class of shares and 8 per
cent of the ordinary shares. Some of these are pledged as collateral for a
Dollars 35m (Pounds 22.7m) personal loan from Merrill Lynch International
Bank, the European arm of the biggest US securities firm.
The next most important shareholders are Irish Life and Aer Lingus, which
have about 10 per cent between them.
Citicorp, the biggest US bank, paid Dollars 78.8m at the peak share price of
about Dollars 34 for its shareholding. Citicorp also has substantial debt
exposure to GPA, although it recently said its loans to GPA are 'less than
Dollars 250m'.
Nomura International, GPA's global co-ordinator during its ill-fated attempt
to raise equity via a public flotation, bought 1.36m shares at an average of
Dollars 20 a share. But the loss to Nomura's reputation is arguably greater
than the loss on its investment. The run-up to the flotation was a public
relations disaster for GPA, and some of the group's executives blame the
resulting fiasco of the aborted share sale on its advisers.
GPA was also irritated that Nomura was only able to meet one of its three
commitments made when it won its mandate in 1991 as the group's lead
adviser.
It provided liquidity for existing shareholders by buying 1m of their shares
and later bought out shareholders who refused to agree to a lock-up before
the flotation was due to go ahead.
But it failed to raise Dollars 250m through a convertible redeemable
preference share issue and did not underwrite any of the share issue. GPA
believed Nomura had given it an undertaking to underwrite Dollars 500m,
although this was disputed by Nomura.
A total of 138 banks provided loans to GPA. Those with substantial exposure
are Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, which said it had provided a credit line
of Dollars 191m. Its Japanese rival, Sakura, provided credit estimated at
more than Dollars 110m.
Toronto Dominion Bank of Canada is also understood to have substan-tial
exposure, as has Swiss Bank Cor-poration, with loans of more than Dollars
100m.
UK banks with the biggest exposure are National Westminster, with about
Dollars 70m, and Barclays, with less than Dollars 50m.
In total, North American banks have provided more than a third of GPA's bank
debt, the contribution of European banks is about 30 per cent and slightly
less has been provided by the Japanese.
GPA estimates its total indebtedness at some Dollars 5.5bn, consisting of
Dollars 3.5bn in bank debt and Dollars 2bn in bonds and other forms of
publicly traded debt. This will likely still need to be restructured under
the GE plan. However, according to one lender, 20 per cent of bank debt is
off balance sheet. So banks' total exposure to GPA is more than Dollars 4bn.
Assessing the likely losses on this is difficult. Almost all of this debt is
fully secured on GPA's fleet of more than 300 aircraft. About 90 per cent of
this fleet consists of stage three or modern aircraft, whose value has held
up relatively well during the recession in the aircraft industry. The
weighted average age of the group's fleet is 3.8 years.
Mr Jack Hersch, director of research at MJ Whitman, an investment firm
specialising in trading bank debt, estimates that bank loans to GPA are
worth 66 cents for every dollar lent. That would imply losses for banks of
substantially more then Dollars 1bn. Some banks say, however, the losses
should be less. On the other hand, the bonds have recently been trading at
between 15 and 20 per cent of their face value. The GE deal will lessen
these losses.
For aircraft manufacturers the picture will also improve if the GE financing
can be completed. GPA had placed orders with them to purchase Dollars 11.9bn
of aircraft before the end of 2000 and had options covering the purchase of
a further Dollars 9.1bn of aircraft.

FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Bankers share the blame for
debacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS no mean feat for a company to come so close to seeking protection from
its creditors within less than 15 months of reporting profits of Dollars
279m (Pounds 181m).
But GPA is no ordinary undertaking; and the fact that it rose so far and
fell so fast owes as much to the bizarre decisions of its bankers as to the
mistakes of the man-agement, headed by the founder, entrepreneur Mr Tony
Ryan.
GPA took off on the basis of a classic market opportunity.
In the recession of the early 1980s, after the huge increase in fuel prices
that followed the second oil shock, airlines were financially stretched.
In the US their problems were compounded by deregulation. Aircraft
manufacturers found their order flow shrinking at an alarming rate.
For GPA and other companies in the operating lease business, this meant that
aircraft were available cheaply and airlines welcomed new sources of
off-balance sheet finance.
Mr Ryan and his Shannon-based team seized the opportunity just in time for
the economic upturn.
What might have been a viable operation in the long run then became
something altogether more dangerous, as Mr Ryan's ambition coincided with
the urgent need of big international banks to find new clients.
In the aftermath of the Latin American debt crisis, the banks found their
credit ratings were lower than those of their big corporate clients, who
promptly decided to cut out the banking middlemen and go direct to the
markets for funds.
In their search for replacement business, the banks turned to higher-risk
lending in areas such as leveraged takeovers, property and aircraft leasing.
At the same time, the Japanese banks, which came to account for 38 per cent
of GPA's credit facilities by 1990, were seeking to internationalise their
operations.
Aggressive accounting (whereby profits on the sale and leaseback of aircraft
were taken immediately instead of being spread over the term of the lease)
combined with a veritable cascade of bank money, helped GPA's pre-tax
profits rise from Dollars 17.4m in 1985 to Dollars 279m in 1992, an
astonishing figure for a business that employed little more than 300 people.
But the risks were mounting phenomenally, as the fleet of aircraft owned by
GPA rose from 40 to 400 in the same period.
Among those risks were:
Operational gearing in the market itself.
Analysts estimated at the end of the 1980s that every 0.5 per cent variation
in the growth of demand for aircraft between 1990 and 2000 would lead to a
variation in the worldwide fleet, needed to satisfy that demand, of 700
aircraft - this on a total jet fleet at the time of 8,300.
Given that GPA's profits and solvency hinged substan-tially on making sound
judgments about the balance of supply and demand in the aircraft market, the
impli-cit leverage was potentially lethal.
Mismatching of costs and revenues.
GPA's operating leases with airlines mainly ran for five to seven years,
which was much less than the life of the aircraft. If the leases fell in, or
were terminated when demand was weak, GPA, the owner, could find itself
paying financing and other costs on aircraft that were not producing
revenue.
Weak residual values of aircraft.
Since GPA became increasingly dependent for its profits on the sale and
leaseback of aircraft, any decline in values was threatening. It would also
reduce collateral for further finance and deter investment demand.
Lack of creditworthiness of many airlines, both in the US and the Third
World.
With so many inherent hazards in the business, GPA needed a substantial
cushion of equity to help minimise risks.
Instead the banks permitted a degree of financial gearing that looked absurd
long before the company ran into trouble.
In the five years before the abortive attempt to float the company last
year, GPA's liabilities soared from Dollars 892m to a stunning Dollars
5.3bn.
Share capital and reserves in 1992 of Dollars 1.2bn were dwarfed by firm
commitments to buy aircraft in future years of Dollars 9.4bn, plus options
to purchase a further Dollars 8bn more.
GPA thus found itself trying to make an international offer of equity shares
last year with a prospectus that baldly stated that 'there can be no
assurance . . . that adequate sources of capital will be available to fund
the group's aircraft purchase commitments.'
This was, in short, a spectacular banking aberration.
Rarely can so much have been borrowed by so few, on the basis of so
insubstantial a balance sheet.
Yet the principles involved bear some similarity to those that prevailed in
the British fringe banking fiasco of the mid-1970s.
Then, the Bank of England instructed the clearing banks to reduce their
lending to an overheated property market. But the banks simply lent more to
the secondary banking system, which promptly ploughed money into speculative
developments at the peak of the market. The clearing banks thus suffered
huge provisions and write-offs when property prices fell and the fringe
collapsed.
By the same token, the existence in the 1980s of aircraft leasing companies
 -specialist fringe financiers - made it easier for the banks to convince
themselves that they were not exposing themselves to the obvious risks of
the overstretched airline companies. They took comfort from residual
aircraft values at the end of the lease. Yet the risks have come home to
roost nonetheless.
One of the more remarkable things in all this is that GPA's management has
succeeded in keeping the proportion of non-revenue earning aircraft in its
fleet to surprisingly low levels, given the weak market.
Yet the immensity of the financial burden has made a nonsense of the effort.
And GPA's financial crisis is now compounded by the fact that its business
is so structured that any slow down has penal consequences.
Large discounts and credits received from aircraft manufacturers become
repayable where GPA goes back on its purchase commitments.
In selling aircraft to in-vestors, it has guaranteed to meet a proportion of
any shortfall against stipulated values on subsequent sale of the aircraft.
And since many investors bought aircraft from GPA on the basis of
undertakings that the leasing company would remarket the aircraft in due
course, GPA's ability to sell aircraft will be substantially damaged if
investors conclude that its survival, and its ability to fulfil the
undertakings, are threatened by the present financial upheaval.
The American humourist Ogden Nash once remarked that bankers are like
everyone else, except richer. As one City wag remarked: Should he have said
stupider?

FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Purchase policy that led to
scramble for equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Starting with Dollars 50,000 in 1975, Tony Ryan built GPA Group into the
world's largest aircraft lessor. But over-ambition, a flawed financial
strategy and recession brought GPA to the verge of collapse. Last night, at
the eleventh hour, Ryan pulled off the deal of his career but he was forced
to cede control of the group
SEVEN YEARS after Mr Tony Ryan founded GPA Group he made a decision which
appeared inspired but which eventually brought the aircraft leasing group to
its knees.
Instead of only leasing used aircraft, Mr Ryan ordered 100 aircraft direct
from the manufacturers, telling his directors 'to ignore the price of
aircraft and look at the logic of what we were doing.'
By 1986 GPA was positioned to exploit the world-wide aircraft shortage that
developed in the late eighties.
But as Mr Craig Jenks, head of the New York-based Airline/Aircraft Projects
Consultancy, says: 'GPA's appetite for low credit and high margin deals
expanded as swiftly as the availability of finance allowed.'
Its success promoted a further round of explosive orders and in April 1989
it committed itself to a total of almost Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11bn) in
options and firm orders.
As the market turned against GPA it suffered a significant deterioration in
the credit quality of its lessees. Some defaulted, such as VASP, the
Brazilian Airline, forcing GPA to repossess aircraft; others rescheduled
lease rentals, and American West Airlines, filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
Faced with Dollars 12bn of firm orders from aircraft manufacturers to the
end of decade and more than Dollars 5bn of total debts the company decided
at the beginning of 1992 to raise equity via a global flotation. The
question was at what price should the shares be valued.
The fate of GPA was determined largely by its inability to raise that
equity, which it has tried to do on many occasions over the past year.
Had GPA put a lower valuation on its stock during these attempts they might
just have succeeded.
The problem was not that GPA ever refused to accept that its shares were
worth less than it had hoped. It was more that each time the company was
ready to price its shares more competitively, investors took the view that
they were worth even less - a suicidal game of beggar my neighbour.
After a public row with advisers, Mr Ryan agreed to sell the shares at
Dollars 20 each, instead of the Dollars 30 he believed they were worth.
But the issue was pulled at the last minute on June 18 because of lack of
support from institutions. Some of the biggest, including Alliance Capital,
which manages about Dollars 60bn of pension and mutual fund assets in the
US, complained that the shares were significantly overpriced.
GPA did not give up, it simply changed its strategy and opted for something
less complex than a global issue.
A few weeks after it was forced to abort its flotation, Nomura, the group's
main adviser, approached a number of outside investors in an attempt to
place up to Dollars 500m of new shares. Discussions centred on the shares
being offered for sale at about Dollars 12.
But by then the market took the view that the value of the shares had fallen
further, in line with the decline in the value of aircraft and the
deterioration of the credit quality of GPA's lessees.
In September the company appeared to have accepted this when it asked some
of its biggest shareholders to support a Dollars 350m preference share issue
with a conversion price of Dollars 8.
Yet by now the ordinary shares were being quoted on the Dublin grey market
at between Dollars 6 and Dollars 8.
The issue was shelved as the group was forced to begin negotiations with
banks on its borrowing arrangements.
Earlier this year the company went back to its shareholders for the last
time, offering them new shares at just Dollars 1. As one of its bankers said
at the time: 'This was the last throw of the dice'.
If investors declined to take up their rights in the new preference share
issue they would be saying something about the perceived price of the shares
that the banks did not want to hear.
By writing down the value of their shares to less than Dollars 1 many
shareholders confirmed the banks' worst fears.
Mr David Kingston, chief executive of Irish Life, said GPA was probably the
worst investment ever undertaken by the company.
That view was echoed by many other shareholders, who have declared that they
have no intention of reinvesting at any price.

FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Protection available under
Irish procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF GPA fails to strike a deal soon with its creditors, it is likely to turn
to the Irish courts for protection while it works out a financial
restructuring.
By asking the courts to appoint an examiner, the GPA board could remain in
control of the company during the negotiations. As such, the Irish system is
much closer to Chapter 11 insolvency procedures in the US than
administration in the UK.
Examination was brought to the statute books three years ago in an emergency
all-night session of the Irish parliament. It was designed to provide a
last-minute insolvency option to prevent Mr Larry Goodman's beef empire
passing into receivership.
Typically the directors request the courts to approve the appointment of an
examiner. It is believed GPA has already lined up a candidate. Creditors can
also request an examiner to be brought in.
If creditors instead attempt to appoint a receiver, the directors may lodge
an appeal with the courts to have the receiver removed and an examiner
appointed.
The examiner has wide powers including the right to apply to the court to
have directors removed from office. He or she receives a statement of
affairs of the company from the directors, and has up to 21 days to make a
report to the court. This will cover its financial position, the reasons for
insolvency, and a summary and assessment of any restructuring proposals.
During that period, the company may seek new loans from banks, which become
preferential creditors.
More recently since the introduction of the procedure, the Irish courts have
been granting interim examination orders lasting seven days.
If a judge allows the process to continue, the examiner has a further three
months to make proposals to a creditors' committee. Any decision taken must
be ratified by the court.

FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Lessor with the biggest reach
may have its wings clipped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS GPA enters a critical week, it can be no comfort that the vultures are
already picking over its back yard.
Aer Lingus, Ireland's national carrier and the airline that helped Tony Ryan
launch GPA 18 years ago, has just taken delivery of its latest Boeing
737-500 - leased long term from GPA's biggest competitor, California-based
International Lease Finance Corp.
While GPA has been fighting to prevent the collapse of its finances, ILFC,
which is backed by the American International Group, has been going from
strength to strength.
GPA has also been growing the number of leases, although the
creditworthiness of some of its operators has deteriorated.
Last year it leased 203 aircraft worth more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn)
and has taken a dominant position in rapidly expanding markets such as
China.
It would be a strange financial restructuring that did not, however, clip
GPA's wings and its ability to fund the business.
So what would the airline industry miss if GPA was forced to shrink and who
would fill the gap?
GPA is probably the largest distributor of aircraft after Boeing. It prides
itself on marrying financiers and manufacturers with airline operators. The
company has not always leased to the strongest customers and last year, in
particular, it faced a debilitating level of early-terminating leases after
the Gulf war.
But GPA still has the greatest reach among airline leasing companies. In
spite of the rise of ILFC, GPA still leases twice as many aircraft around
the world as its rival.
GPA's size has also provided manufacturers and airline operators with a
flexibility they have cherished since the mid 1980s.
Lessors have offered aircraft manufacturers more secure order books by
enabling the airlines to keep the aircraft off the balance sheet.
Airlines have also been able to take aircraft for considerably shorter
periods than the lifetime of the aircraft.
This flexibility is likely to be even more valuable in the next 20 years.
With the latest generation of aircraft designed to last for 30 years,
leasing is forecast to be an increasingly popular form of aircraft finance.
Unfortunately, in providing this flexibility, GPA has taken much of the
operational risk on to its own shoulders which, lacking financial muscle,
have proved inadequate for the task.
If GPA were to go into examination, the Irish equivalent of Chapter 11,
there would be a rush of perhaps better financed pretenders to fill the
hole.
'There is still very attractive core financing to be done on aircraft,' says
Sir Michael Bishop, head of British Midland Airlines. 'Residual values of
the leases should increase in the next few years as supply becomes tighter.'
There is also one other consideration. As an intermediary - or marriage
broker - GPA's main assets are its experienced staff. Without implying any
disrespect to Mr Ryan's West of Ireland base, if the GPA team is prepared to
work out of Shannon it could work out anywhere - and for anyone.

FT  13 MAY 93 / News Corp doubles net profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS Corporation, the Australian-based media group, yesterday reported
doubled net profits of ADollars 668m (Pounds 310m) for the nine months ended
March, following a strong third quarter.
Lower interest costs and strong performances from associates were the main
reasons for the improvement, while the bulk of the group's core businesses
made steady gains. Revenue rose by 3 per cent to ADollars 8bn.
Associated companies, mainly BSkyB - the UK-based satellite broadcasting arm
in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake,
Ansett Transport Industries, the Australian airline, and Pacific Magazines,
the Australian publisher, turned round their contribution from a ADollars
76.8m loss to a ADollars 112m profit.
News Corp said BSkyB's weekly revenues were exceeding Pounds 7m and weekly
operating profits more than Pounds 1.7m at the end of March compared with
break-even a year earlier. Ansett had moved from loss to profit with better
yields on improved passenger numbers.
The group said continued debt reduction and falling interest rates cut total
interest expense by 22 per cent to ADollars 567.8m.
News Corp continued to derive the majority of its earnings in the US where
operating income rose from ADollars 654.9m to ADollars 686.6m.
The Fox television businesses increased earnings almost 20 per cent, but
earnings from the Twentieth Century Fox Film division fell significantly.
Magazine and inserts operations lifted earnings by 17 per cent, profit from
TV Guide rose 27 per cent, but the HarperCollins book group had an earnings
fall in the period in spite of a slightly improved latest quarter. UK
activities lifted their operating income from ADollars 275.3m to ADollars
313.6m.
BSkyB now has 2.3m homes subscribing to at least one of its services.
The company says the numbers of homes receiving Sky channels is increasing
at an average rate of more than 20,000 a week through satellite dishes and
cable television.
In the autumn BSkyB will scramble all its channels and offer a 'basic
package' of at least 10 channels for around Pounds 4 a month.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Sainsbury moves ahead 16.7% as sales top Pounds 10bn:
Chairman says gains due to aggressive trading and cost control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. SAINSBURY, Britain's biggest retailer, yesterday reported a 16.7 per cent
increase in full year pre-tax profits, writes Paul Taylor.
The results of the group, whose sales exceeded Pounds 10bn for the first
time, compare with the 6.5 per cent profit gain posted by its rival Tesco.
Sainsbury's pre-tax profits in the year to March 13 increased to Pounds
732.8m from Pounds 628m the previous year on sales that grew by 11.6 per
cent to Pounds 10.27bn (from Pounds 9.2bn) including Pounds 584.2m of VAT
and US sales taxes.
The profit improvement, which was nevertheless at the low end of market
expectations, was underpinned by a small increase in like-for-like sales
volumes in the group's UK supermarkets and Savacentre hypermarkets, and by
higher operating margins and a 0.7 percentage point gain in UK market share
to 11.3 per cent.
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said the 'extremely strong' results had been
achieved in 'very competitive market conditions'.
He attributed the gains to the group's aggressive trading position and
improved price competitiveness, enhanced quality and controlled costs.
On prices Mr Sainsbury said: 'We have either maintained or improved our
price position against all our major competitors with the exception of Asda
which has been sharpening up its pricing quite significantly.' He brushed
aside the threat from discount chains like Kwik Save saying: 'We have traded
alongside them very successfully for years.'
In the UK, supermarket and Savacentre sales increased by 12.6 per cent to
Pounds 8.9bn with 23 new stores contributing 8.8 percentage points of the
gain - the largest contribution from new space for 10 years. Eight stores
were closed and like-for-like sales rose 3.8 per cent which, with price
inflation of 2.5 per cent, resulted in a real volume gain. Another 23 new
stores are due to open this year at an average cost of Pounds 17m each and
14 stores will close.
The foodstores' operating profits were 19.1 per cent higher at Pounds
752.2m. Sunday trading at 160 supermarkets was only marginally profitable.
The Homebase DIY store operations managed a 16.3 per cent increase in
profits to Pounds 17.8m on sales which grew by 9.8 per cent - 2.6 per cent
on a like-for-like basis - to Pounds 282.8m.
However Sainsbury's US supermarket subsidiary, Shaw's, suffered from the
continuing recession in the New England economy. Sales increased by 2 per
cent to Dollars 1.85bn (Pounds 1.2bn) but operating profits fell by 11.9 per
cent to Dollars 31.5m.
Earnings per share were 28.47p (up from 25.69p) and an increased final
dividend of 7.30p (against 6.35p) per share makes a total for the year up
14.3 per cent to 10p (from 8.75p).

FT  13 MAY 93 / ICI prices Zeneca rights at 600p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries yesterday set the terms of its demerger and
fund-raising, pricing the rights issue for its Zeneca bioscience offshoot at
600p.
The price was at the top end of expectations, but the issue was cut from the
expected 1-for-3 basis to a 5-for-16 offer, involving the issue of about
225m new shares, raising Pounds 1.3bn. This brought some relief to the
shares, with existing ICI shares rising 22p to 1285p yesterday.
Documents relating to the rights and listing of the demerged shares showed
the chief executives of the two new companies are to receive pay rises.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, who is adding deputy chairman to his title of chief
executive officer at new-ICI, will be paid Pounds 425,000, up from Pounds
340,840. Mr David Barnes of Zeneca will get Pounds 325,000, up from Pounds
285,000, and from a previous Pounds 257,340 before a pay rise he received in
January when the demerger took effect operationally. Each will have a
three-year contract.
Mr Hampel's retirement date was set for September 30, 1995, and he will get
a bonus of between 50 and 100 per cent of his final-year salary.
Brokers said the issue was tightly priced. However, shareholders recorded
general satisfaction with the Zeneca deal, noting that the underwriters had
to achieve a pricing at a time of turmoil in the US pharmaceuticals market.
Last week, institutions who gave firm commitments to underwrite their
allocation at roughly Pounds 6 per share were promised additional
allocations.
At the rights price, the Zeneca shares yield 5.7 per cent on the forecast
dividend of 27.5p for the year. The p/e is 13.3 historic on pro-forma
earnings per share of 45p. 'The pricing was sensible,' said one shareholder,
noting that at 600p the prospective p/e will be roughly 12. This compares
with multiples of 14 and 15 for other pharmaceutical stocks.
On the grey-market, which opened trading in the new-ICI, Zeneca ex-rights
and Zeneca nil-paid shares yesterday afternoon, investors switched from
Zeneca to new-ICI.
Zeneca ex-rights fell from a first price of 682p to 664p, little more than a
10 per cent premium to the rights price, where they yield 5.2 per cent. That
compares, institutions said, with a yield for Glaxo of 3.5 per cent or
Wellcome of 2.5 per cent.
The nil paid fell from 86p to 66p. New-ICI shares rose from 569p to 609p.

FT  13 MAY 93 / GE Capital poised to win control of GPA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP, the troubled aircraft leasing company, is to cede control to GE
Capital, General Electric's financial services arm, under an agreement
signed in principle last night, writes Roland Rudd.
GE Capital has an option to acquire 60 per cent of GPA's equity, rising to
80 per cent under certain conditions by March 1997. GPA refused last night
to disclose how much GE was paying to take control.
GE will also help GPA meet its funding commitments by purchasing 23 aircraft
from GPA's existing portfolio and 22 to be delivered next year, worth a
total of Dollars 1.35bn.
GPA said some of its existing shareholders and bankers would provide
additional loans if the deal went ahead.
The agreement is contingent on the banks agreeing to the restructuring of
the group's Dollars 5.5bn of debt. However, it was not clear whether the
deal will prove acceptable to all of the group's lenders.
While GPA's lead banks are firmly behind the agreement, some of GPA's
lenders have voiced their opposition to any deal involving the sale of the
company's most valuable aircraft in exchange for GE Capital taking control.
GPA will tell its bondholders, when it meets them today in New York that it
plans to meet interest payments in May and June.
GPA had a temporary waiver on its banking covenants until May 17 when more
than Dollars 50m of bonds mature. A further Dollars 170m bonds mature by the
end of June.
A GPA banker said failure to support the deal would force GPA to ask
bondholders for a payment moratorium.
One of the group's biggest lenders said: 'The only way to avoid a moratorium
with bondholders - which would inevitably lead to examination (the Irish
equivalent of administration) - is to back GE's decision to take control of
GPA.'
However, one of its bankers said: support the 'I do not want GPA to end up
as a liquidation trust unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay off
all its creditors.'
The talks have been led by Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital and
Mr Tony Ryan, GPA's chairman and founder.
Mr Wendt, a former non-executive director of GPA, is understood to have
assured Mr Ryan of his continued support as chairman if the deal goes
through.
Mr Ryan recently fought off an attempt by two of GPA's executives to have
him replaced
GE Capital owns Polaris Aircraft Leasing, one of GPA's big competitors with
more than 400 aircraft on lease.
It once owned a 22.7 per cent stake in GPA but sold it in the mid 1980s for
a profit of more than Dollars 50m.
GPA's financial pressures stem from its over-ambitions in the late 1980s
when it ordered large numbers of aircraft in anticipation of continuing
rapid growth of air travel. Recession, however, brought its weakened balance
sheet to the point of collapse.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Loss at Simon will breach bank deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMON Engineering, over-shadowed by bad news for more than a year, yesterday
announced it will incur a first-half loss in the six months to June 30,
thereby breaching one of its banking covenants.
The company confirmed the loss would breach a covenant on its US private
placement borrowings which states that interest cover should be two times or
greater.
Simon's banks were being kept closely informed and were 'fully supportive'.
No other covenants were in danger of being breached, the company said.
Sir Philip Foreman, who took over as interim chairman last month following
the death of Mr Roy Roberts, told Simon's annual meeting yesterday that the
company's paper engineering and petroleum technology businesses had seen
trading 'deteriorate materially'.
He said Simon, which has reported profits falls since 1990, would incur a
first-half operating loss. SG Warburg, the company's broker, changed its
full-year forecast from a Pounds 12m profit to a Pounds 2m loss. Warburg
also forecast Simon will pay no dividend. The dividend was sharply cut last
year from 15.7p to 5p.
Sir Philip also said Simon's borrowings have continued to increase, in spite
of about Pounds 30m of proceeds from disposals. Gearing is thought to have
gone past 100 per cent and net borrowings are thought to be nearly Pounds
110m, against Pounds 101.2m at the year end.
The company's shares, which collapsed last year from 301p, yesterday fell 26
1/2 p, more than 25 per cent, to 73 1/2 p.
'The situation looks extremely serious,' an analyst said.
Simon said its paper engineering business would report 'significant'
first-half losses. Mr Derek Davies, in charge of Simon's process engineering
division and responsible for a loss-making paper contract in Florida, has
resigned from the company with immediate effect.
Simon Petroleum Technology is also expected to incur losses because of
recession and proposed changes to petroleum revenue tax which have affected
North Sea oil exploration activities. Simon has four deep-sea vessels which
are thought to be losing money rapidly.
The US private placement, arranged in 1991, was for Dollars 125m (Pounds
81m) of loan notes with a fixed coupon of 9.32 per cent.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Anglo American rejects Gencor unbundling lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO American Corporation, South Africa's largest company, said yesterday
it would not be following Gencor's policy of unbundling into smaller units.
It said that while unbundling might make sense for some groups, it did not
believe that its current structure required it.
Anglo's statement follows Tuesday's announcement by Gencor, the country's
second largest mining house, that it will be distributing all its non-mining
assets to shareholders, so halving its size.
Anglo, with its complex corporate structure, has long been considered by
both politicians and analysts as a likely candidate for unbundling.
Yesterday's statement makes clear that South Africa's other large corporates
will not necessarily be following Gencor's lead.
Since the issue of unbundling was first raised three years ago, Anglo has
vigorously defended its size. It says it is a mining finance group 'with
different levels of holding and operating companies, many of which are
listed, with separate though overlapping shareholders'.
Without mentioning Gencor, Anglo stressed its structure has neither a
controlling company (Sanlam in Gencor's case) 'nor any pyramid structures
designed purely for holding purposes' (Gencor's Genbeheer). It also said
more than 50 per cent of its shares were held publicly.
Anglo said its size helped it undertake large capital projects while its
diversity of assets conferred contra-cyclical benefits.

the entire sub-underwriting. Last week, institutions who gave firm

FT  13 MAY 93 / Italian public sector chief charged: Iri state group
chairman linked to illicit political funding scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Franco Nobili, chairman of Iri, Italy's biggest state holding company,
was yesterday arrested by Milan magistrates and transferred to the city's
San Vittore jail on charges of corruption.
Mr Nobili, 62, holds the most prominent position in the Italian public
sector. Until now, the Iri group has only figured in a minor way in the
15-month investigations by Milan magistrates into illicit funding of the
political parties, mainly through kickbacks paid on contracts.
The chief executives of the Italian subsidiaries of two foreign companies
operating in the lucrative telecommunications sector - Sweden's Ericsson and
the UK's GEC - were also arrested on charges of alleged corruption. The
arrests relate to a developing line of inquiry by Milan magistrates into
kickbacks allegedly paid for a share in Italy's large telecommunications
sector.
Mr Nobili has been Iri chairman since 1990, having been appointed to this
post, traditionally controlled by the Christian Democrat party, by his
friend Mr Giulio Andreotti, who was then prime minister.
The operations of Iri are unlikely to be affected since Mr Nobili was
effectively forced into a representational role last August when Iri's
status was changed to a joint stock company. The running of Iri and
strategic planning has been in the hands of Mr Michele Tedeschi, the
managing director.
Within the past two months, the management of the country's three main
state-run industrial groups have all become implicated in the corruption
scandals.
In March, Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the chairman of Eni, the state oil concern,
was arrested along with the heads of the group's four main subsidiaries on
charges of allegedly falsifying accounts. Since then, a complex picture of
illicit funding of political parties, has emerged from Eni companies,
believed to have been worth L27bn (Pounds 11.5m) since 1989. At the same
time, Mr Mauro Leone, deputy chairman of Efim, the industrial holding placed
in liquidation last July, was arrested on charges of alleged fraud. The
allegations of corruption in Mr Nobili's case are understood to refer both
to his time as Iri chairman and during the period from 1978-89 when he ran
Cogefar, a leading construction company.
The magistrates are reportedly mainly concerned with his activities in
Cogefar, before its merger with Fiat's Impresit in 1989. The alleged payment
of bribes by Cogefar-Impresit to obtain contracts has been the main account
on which magistrates have been questioning Fiat executives over the past
year.
Mr Nobili's arrest is linked to a fresh questioning of Mr Enzo Papi, former
managing director of Cogefar-Impresit, arrested last May and held for 55
days before admitting the payment of bribes.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Local authority watchdog warns on government grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAIRNESS of standard spending assessments, used to distribute government
funds of Pounds 40bn per year to local authorities, is called into question
today in a report published by the Audit Commission.
The commission, a watchdog of local government spending, says the system
means 'neither central nor local government accepts responsibility for
decisions on particular services'.
It also says that a failure to adjust the SSA system before local government
reorganisation is brought fully into force would would 'risk triggering
significant levels of public protest'.
A formula set by the Department of the Environment produces a standard
spending level for local authorities, which is used to set the grants they
receive from central government, more than 80 per cent of total council
spending. The 'cap' by which government limits their spending is also
derived using the SSAs.
However, the commission questions the All Ages Social Index, which
calculates an area's deprivation using social and demographic, not economic,
factors. This formula shows Cambridge to be more deprived than Hartlepool,
and Cambridge therefore has a higher SSA.
According to the commission, 'the complexity of the formula hides underlying
key political choices, obscuring decisions and who makes them'.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said the report contained a
'most serious warning' for ministers, and called for an independent
commission to allocate grants to councils. He said: 'An independent
commission is the only answer. No one trusts these ministers any more to act
fairly.'
The Department of the Environment said the report would be studied as part
of its continuing review of SSAs. It said: 'Standard spending assessments
are based on detailed research evidence and calculated according to general
principles applied to all authorities.'
The department said decisions reached using SSAs were 'fair and reasonable',
and said their next revision would be helped by 1991 census data.
The Associations of County Councils, District Councils and Metropolitan
Authorities all welcomed the report and criticised 'the government's use of
SSAs to cap local authorities'.

FT  13 MAY 93 / UK poised to retaliate against California tax rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government is expected to announce today that it will retaliate
against US companies if the long-running dispute over California's unitary
taxation system is not resolved by the end of the year.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to announce that the UK will
cancel a tax break given to US companies on the dividends they receive from
their British subsidiaries. This would cost them about Pounds 250m a year.
The retaliation would come the day before the US Supreme Court is expected
to decide whether to hear the case brought by Barclays Bank, the UK clearing
bank, against California's unitary tax system.
Under this system, California may assess tax on a proportion of the
worldwide profits of a group, calculated by the size of its payroll, sales
and property in the state, instead of only taxing profits actually made in
the state.
Foreign businesses say this conflicts with the method used in almost all
other countries, and exposes them to paying tax twice on the same profits.
The UK passed legislation authorising the government to retaliate against US
companies in 1986, but that law has never yet been implemented. Although the
UK Treasury had wanted to wait to see if the Supreme Court settled the
matter in Barclays' favour, Mr Lamont and Mr John Major, the prime minister,
have been heavily lobbied by backbench members of parliament and by British
companies such as Guinness, SmithKline Beecham and BAT, who argued for
immediate retaliation.
The European Community has also threatened retaliation, although any EC
action is likely to be much later. The UK Treasury declined to comment.
The Barclays case has been making its way through the courts for more than
10 years, but the Supreme Court is Barclays' last chance of reversing a
ruling by the California supreme court in favour of the state.
Previous US administrations have sided with Barclays against California. But
President Bill Clinton earlier this month decided not to file a brief on
Barclays' side, motivated principally by worries about the possible
financial loss to the almost bankrupt California treasury.
California estimates that if it lost the suit, it would have to refund about
Dollars 520m (Pounds 337.6m) of tax and interest and would miss out on
another Dollars 350m of taxes it has not yet collected. Another Dollars
3.1bn could be at stake if it also lost a connected suit brought by
Colgate-Palmolive. For Barclays, the case involves over Dollars 30m.
The cancellation of advance corporation tax credits to US companies - which
might be backdated two years - would raise the tax rate paid by their UK
subsidiaries from 28 per cent to the standard 33 per cent.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Delors orders study into EC's unemployment crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission has opened a wide-ranging study of unemployment in
the EC in response to fears that Europe is losing the battle to remain
competitive with the US and Asia.
The study is expected to tackle the politically sensitive question of
whether Europe's welfare state is indirectly contributing to low growth,
rising unemployment and the failure to create new jobs.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has ordered 'dozens of papers' on
Europe's unemployment crisis, according to Community officials involved. The
aim is to produce a report at the EC summit in Copenhagen next month, along
with the EC's modest 'growth initiative'.
More than 17m people are out of work in the EC. Mr Delors' study into the
causes of unemployment and his search for potential remedies reflects his
concern about political instability in Europe, but also a nagging worry
about the EC's long-term competitiveness.
The EC created 9.4m net new jobs between 1983 and 1990, partly in
anticipation of the 1992 single market. But since 1990 it has lost a net
1.4m jobs. The short-term economic outlook is bleak, with the EC unlikely to
grow more than 1 per cent this year and probably less than 1.5 per cent next
year.
Senior EC officials yesterday described the Delors study as a 'medium to
long-term' study of the EC economy, leaving no areas untouched.
The areas it will attempt to assess include:
the competitive impact of floating exchange rates in the US and the UK
the potential counterweight of a future single European currency
trade practices in the US and Asia
industrial policy
the use of applied research as a tool for generating jobs
the role of the welfare state in Europe.
The most controversial area is the role of the welfare state. Mr Delors has
left colleagues in little doubt about his support for social policy; but his
call for fresh thinking means the study is likely to tackle the automatic
right to social security and the commitment to minimum wages.
One issue intriguing Brussels officials is whether Mr Delors' intellectual
curiousity will lead him to re-examine the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty which strengthens workers' rights and is the subject of controversy
in the UK. The ruling Conservative government won a treaty opt-out on the
social chapter, arguing that it would hurt UK companies' competitiveness.
Mr Delors has already won support from Sir Leon Brittan in tackling the
issue of European competitiveness. In an interview, Sir Leon said German
industry's complaints about the costs of employment in western Europe showed
the issue was 'creeping up the agenda'. The Commission could play an
important role in opening public debate, without necessarily legislating, he
said.
Commission officials stressed yesterday that the Delors study was an
academic exercise only, and there was no desire to create a US-style society
in Europe, with minimum social provisions. 'But we do recognise that there
may be problems with excessive non-wage costs, particularly among the
lower-paid,' said one official.
The Delors study was commissioned a few weeks ago amid concern about
management weaknesses in DG-5, the social policy directorate. Mr Sigismundo
Crespo, the Spanish director-general, was unable to communicate in English
with his boss, Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish commissioner. Mr Crespo resigned
his post last week.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At least Body Shop International is now fighting back. Whether the company
will succeed in re-establishing its brand position in the UK is another
matter. The problem is not only doubt over whether the fashion for
environmentally friendly cosmetics is passe and over Body Shop's ability to
attract older customers. It is also one of whether margins can be
recaptured, given the competition from Boots and others. Body Shop will try
very hard to convince consumers that its products are of superior quality,
but persuading them to pay premium prices could prove an uphill struggle in
an age where customers appear more concerned with value than brand image.
Without a solid base in the UK, international expansion, which is seen as
the main engine of growth, would be all the harder. Like for like sales
growth of 6 per cent in overseas markets outside the US is encouraging, and
US operating profits more than doubled after stripping out the cost of
moving the head office to North Carolina. But competition in the US is
growing. While Body Shop is not doomed to fail, it is not doomed to succeed
either. Given that uncertainty, an historic multiple of nearly 28 looks
stretched. Perhaps that is why Body Shop is touting the interest in its
shares which has surfaced in the US. Its new ADR facility could prove a
source of demand, although US investors are every bit as fickle as the
British buyers of pineapple facial wash.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is curious how little attention the currency markets paid yesterday to
the jump in US producer prices. Perhaps one reason is that the dollar has
already risen more than three pfennigs over the past week. Another is that
the figures were distorted by higher tobacco prices. But the over-riding
factor is continuing uncertainty over the degree to which the recovery is
accelerating again after the disappointing first quarter. Last week's
employment data failed to provide conclusive evidence one way or another.
Today's retail sales data may prove a better pointer. Reasonably strong
figures would imply a boost for industrial production later in the quarter
as inventories are rebuilt.
Until confidence in the recovery returns, though, the dollar's scope for
appreciation will remain limited, which gives the Bundesbank more room for
manoeuvre. That is just as well when German bond markets face heavy supply
of public sector paper and Mr Theo Waigel's future as finance minister is
uncertain. Yesterday's reduction in the Bundesbank's money market repurchase
rate makes a cut in the official discount rate - now a mere 35 basis points
below money market rates - more likely next week. Whatever happens in the
Danish Maastricht referendum, the bank will at least be able to say it did
its bit for Europe.

FT  13 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: J. Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the real world of groceries, J. Sainsbury maintained its serene progress
last year, registering a 17 per cent advance in annual profits. In the
unreal world of finance, Sainsbury's shares have fallen by a similar
percentage since the start of the year, making it the sixth worst performing
FT-SE 100 stock. The company's de-rating owes much to the normal turn of the
investment cycle. At this stage of the game, defensive food retailing stocks
go out of fashion as investors chase recovery situations and overseas
earners. Much the same happened in 1982 when the UK last emerged from
recession.
The important question this time round, though, is whether something more
than cyclical forces are at play. Does the aggressive growth of the
discounters and the maturity of the superstore operators' development
programmes presage an end to the sector's remarkable earnings gains?
Although such concerns may be pressing by the end of the decade, Sainsbury's
latest figures suggest a pessimistic conclusion would be premature.
Respectable sales volume growth, continuing productivity gains and the
addition of new space at an annual rate of around 8 per cent points to
maintained earnings momentum for the next few years at least. The retailer's
best friend - inflation - may also return to lend a hand. The market may
soon warm again to the sector's virtues of steady earnings increases and
solid dividends, especially if the broader recovery disappoints. By the
second half of the decade, the big food retailers' ratings may depend upon
their success in diversifying. Sainsbury's efforts may then have to be on a
far grander scale if it is to sustain a premium status.

FT  13 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: ICI's leap in the dark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial engineers who dreamed up the Zeneca rights issue as a way of
paying off ICI's debt may be a little disappointed. Splitting a
pharmaceuticals company with a fancy rating from dowdy ICI may have made
financial sense when Hanson spotted the opportunity two years ago. Now the
demerger has cranked through the system, it looks like yesterday's idea -
particularly since it also involves dumping a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue on
the worst performing FT-A sector in 1993. Sir Denys Henderson, ICI's
chairman, has always argued for demerger on industrial, rather than
financial, grounds. But the notion that nothing less than fission of the
company is enough to change ICI's culture is a tacit admission of management
failure.
That severed management is now faced with the same job it had before -
getting performance out of the parts of ICI. Greater focus may result in the
ICI bulk side being rationalised more quickly. Petrochemicals operations
such as ethylene may be sold to oil companies which seem increasingly likely
to dominate the sector. ICI will have to specialise in those niche markets
where it has a technological edge or market dominance - and hope that those
niches do not become tombs. Zeneca may be freer to generate the hard
marketing edge which characterises other drugs companies. But the financial
resources of a combined strong balance sheet will be lost. That limits the
flexibility of either company to develop into new capital intensive markets
in future. The corollary of greater focus is that neither company can afford
to slip. In the short term, shareholders will doubtless be attracted by the
guaranteed yield. Further out, the case for the great experiment remains
unproven.

FT  13 MAY 93 / They're picking up bad vibrations: The music industry is
resigned to an inquiry into the cost of UK compact discs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the recent House of Commons inquiry into the price of compact discs,
Mr Gerald Kaufman, national heritage committee chairman, complained that one
interrupting witness appeared to be performing a duet with him.
Both the UK music industry and its critics have stuck doggedly to their
tunes during the debate on CD prices, without being distracted by the
singing of the other party. Many listeners, however, have come away with
little more than a headache - and no clear answer to the question: are UK
music companies cheating consumers?
Yesterday, the heritage committee published its report, condemning CD
producers for charging too much and criticising retailers for failing to use
their size to insist on price reductions. Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general of fair trading, is expected within the next few days to
announce whether he intends to recommend a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
investigation into the music industry. Music companies are resigned to an
MMC inquiry.
Both the committee and Sir Bryan stressed the importance of examining
restrictions on parallel imports. The restrictions, contained in the
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988, allow the holder of a copyright
to prevent the import of his or her work. This means that while the company
which holds a copyright can import CDs, it can prevent independent companies
from doing so.
To many in the public gallery, the committee inquiry was an unimpressive
affair. One observer, Mr John Preston, chairman of BMG Records (UK), who
describes himself as a socialist, says that neither Labour nor Conservative
committee members seemed to understand how a free market worked. They had
difficulty accepting industry executives' assertions that production cost
should not be the only determinant of CD prices and that companies could
legitimately consider what consumers were prepared to pay.
For their part, several industry witnesses retreated into resentment when
confronted with the all-party onslaught from Labour's Mr Kaufman and
Conservative colleagues such as Mr Toby Jessel.
Music industry executives say they cannot understand why they have been the
focus of such intense criticism, when the publishing industry is permitted
to fix prices openly through the Net Book Agreement. They also point out
that, unlike CDs, books are exempted from value-added tax. The publishing
industry has argued that VAT on books would be a tax on learning. 'Why is
Barbara Cartland more educational than Mozart?' one music industry official
asks.
Mr Preston adds that, unlike the far less successful British film industry,
music companies have never asked for government money or special tax
treatment.
For all the discomfort the attacks have caused the industry, none of the
critics has, until now, been able to point to anti-competitive practices by
the music companies. An earlier OFT inquiry by Sir Gordon Borrie, Sir
Bryan's predecessor, concluded last year that there were no grounds for an
MMC inquiry because there was no evidence of any collusion between
companies.
Sir Gordon said there appeared no good reason why CDs should be more
expensive than cassettes when production costs were the same - a point
stressed in yesterday's heritage committee report. But Sir Gordon added:
'Producers and retailers have taken advantage of the willingness of
consumers to pay a higher price for the perceived higher quality of a CD. In
other words, the prices of CDs have settled around a level which, on the
whole, the market appears willing to bear.'
Sir Bryan told the committee last month, however, that lower CD prices in
the US had persuaded him that the issue needed to be looked at again. Most
worrying for the industry, he said he would look at a specific trading
practice - restrictions on parallel imports.
The heritage committee conceded that relaxing import restrictions could put
the UK at a disadvantage to countries like the US which have tight controls.
The UK would be open to US imports while the American market would remain
closed. The committee recommended, however, that the Department of Trade and
Industry re-examines current copyright legislation. A change to the
copyright laws, permitting a flood of cheap imports, is what UK music
companies fear most.
Mr Nic Garnett, director-general of the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry, which represents music companies worldwide, says
unrestricted cheap imports could damage the UK industry by depriving
companies of the profits needed to invest in new, often risky, talent.
Mr Maurice Oberstein, chairman of the British Phonographic Industry, says
the pricing debate has focused on the effect of cheaper CDs on large
companies such as PolyGram, Thorn EMI, Sony and WEA/Warner. The BPI has 150
members, however, many of them small, and lower profit margins could drive
them out of business, he says. Leading companies such as Virgin Music
started out as independent producers and it is the smaller UK labels which
have traditionally found new talent. If profit margins become so small that
independent companies can no longer operate, new acts will find it even
harder to gain recognition, he argues.
Mr Garnett adds that a more liberal copyright regime could result in imports
of pirate CDs. He agrees that legislation could be drafted to allow only
lawfully produced CDs to be imported, but says this will prove difficult in
practice. 'What if the CDs are made in the Ukraine where there are no
copyright laws at all?' he asks.
The Consumers' Association pointed out to the committee that imports could
be permitted from countries which have signed intellectual property
conventions and which enforce them properly.
Mr Garnett argues that this would not necessarily result in lower prices.
Japan, which has no copyright controls, has some of the highest CD prices in
the world, while the US, with strict restrictions against parallel imports,
is regarded as having the lowest.
In any event, he says, EC countries such as Denmark and Ireland have no bar
to parallel imports, and the situation in France, Portugal and the
Netherlands is unclear. There is no legal bar to UK companies importing CDs
from these countries without the permission of the copyright holders.
Nevertheless, the British Phonographic Institute estimates, based on figures
provided by Gallup, that only 0.3 per cent of UK CDs are currently imported
by independent distributors - the companies that might be expected to
undercut the prices of the biggest groups.
But if parallel imports do not take place at the moment, even though they
are legally possible, and there is no evidence that they would result in
lower consumer prices, why is the industry so strongly opposed to them?
Mr Garnett says a possible reason prices do not fall when restrictions are
lifted is that independent importers fail to pass on the benefit of their
lower costs and simply enjoy higher profit margins. This would damage the
mainstream industry without resulting in a significant benefit to the
consumer. He says he does not know why parallel imports do not occur at
present - possibly because even with cheap imports, selling CDs is not
sufficiently profitable to make it attractive to independent distributors.
The problem with changes in copyright law is that the outcome is difficult
to predict, Mr Garnett says.
An MMC inquiry would provide an opportunity to examine copyright rules in
greater detail. It appears, however, that critics of the music companies
would be unwise to regard an increase in parallel imports as a panacea.
When pressed privately about why UK prices are higher than in the US, music
industry executives say that British consumers are prepared to pay more than
their American counterparts. The national heritage committee report argues
that UK companies could substantially increase the size of the CD market if
they charged less; in 1991, each American owner of a CD player bought 15
discs, compared with only 7.8 in the UK.
But the UK industry is not doing badly. Delivery of CDs to UK retailers grew
12.2 per cent last year to 70.5m units, despite the recession and the
availability of cheaper cassettes. In the first quarter of 1993, CD sales
rose 32.4 per cent. Reams of paper will no doubt continue to pour from the
offices of MPs and consumer groups. For all the irritation they cause,
however, CD companies pay more attention to what comes out of music lovers'
wallets.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Personal View: The ABCs of a sensible testing policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER SMITH and DAVID HART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's education secretary, John Patten, has decided to simplify national
curriculum testing next year. Has he paved the way to solving the immediate
dispute? Will the main classroom teacher unions suspend their boycott, and
will they lose the sympathy or support of governors, heads and parents if
they do not?
Commentators are right to suggest that Mr Patten would have been wise to
have gone the last hundred yards and suspend this year's tests, or find a
political euphemism for doing so by declaring them consultative. Realists
may accept, however, that his room for political manoeuvre was very limited.
In practice it is very unlikely this year's tests will proceed as Mr Patten
would like. So he must decide whether to go on the attack over a short-term
problem and risk extending it, or accept the inevitable as philosophically
as he can.
A long-term solution must be found. The government is right to emphasise one
over-riding imperative - to raise standards of UK education and training.
Failure to do so will lead to harsh economic and social consequences.
Mr Patten acted sensibly in commissioning Sir Ron Dearing, the recently
appointed chairman of the new School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, to
conduct an urgent review of the national curriculum and testing
arrangements. Some will argue that Mr Patten has now pre-empted the outcome
by his Commons statement this week.
Many more will appreciate that he has increased the likelihood of Sir Ron's
success by early public acceptance that the pointless complexity of national
testing can be simplified only if it is restricted to the core subjects. It
was always a nonsense that seven-year-olds should be assessed in English,
maths, science, technology, history, geography, music, art and physical
education.
Teachers and parents should welcome the commitment that tests for
11-year-olds in the core subjects will be mandatory only after a full year's
trial. Postponing history and geography tests for 14-year-olds until Sir Ron
has completed his review makes good sense too.
Everything turns on that review, and Sir Ron has made a good start. He has
entered into immediate talks with teachers and the organisations which
represent them. They, together with independent school bodies, have
submitted their views on a framework for progress.
Sir Ron's decision to listen to teachers gets his review off on the right
foot, but does not guarantee success. It does not reconcile one absurdity -
that there is not merely one body that advises Mr Patten but three, all
acting independently of one another.
The School Teachers' Review Body recommends on pay and conditions. Ofsted is
a field force of inspectors who see the impact of government policies and
police school performance. It is vital that Sir Ron seeks the assessments of
the review body and Ofsted on the human resource, management and quality
implications of his review.
It must explore three crucial issues. First, how much teaching time should
be dedicated to the national curriculum irrespective of the elements which
are tested.
Second, what should testing seek to achieve? For children and parents the
principal purpose is obvious: to provide confident information about how
children are performing in comparison with their age group and in terms of
their individual potential. It does not follow that testing every child is
necessary or will even indicate whether the national investment in education
is paying off.
Nor does it follow that such test results, published in league table form,
could in reality inform parental choice among schools. The government's
fixation with league tables ignores the lack of consumer interest in them,
as opinion polls have shown. Perhaps even more important, it disregards the
essential imperfection of the school market where, in reality, the consumer
has restricted choice. Parents may be far more interested in how individual
schools are competing against their own past performance.
Third, the review needs to consider the fundamental tension in government
philosophy between central regulation and local manager autonomy. Schools
can now manage themselves however they like, provided that they do it Mr
Patten's way. But school managers must be freed to manage, and not be
hamstrung by Whitehall. Corporate direction which throttles should give way
to local initiative which liberates.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Leading Article: G7's Russian roulette
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW US administration, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's referendum
victory, and the messy disintegration of Yugoslavia, appear to have
persuaded the G7 that last year's charade cannot be repeated: Russia's
reformers need aid and they need it soon. But no western government can be
under any illusion. The game is worth playing, but the risks are high.
The G7 feels brave enough at last to leap over the International Monetary
Fund's orthodoxy and recognise that western aid is a precondition for
Russian reform, not a reward. To demand tight budget discipline and low
inflation before aid is released, as the IMF did last year, is to risk mass
bankruptcy and social unrest. Such a strategy was more likely to impede,
rather than speed, the process of privatisation and democratisation in
Russia. In the event, it was never tried.
Handing over billions of dollars in budget support to a Russian government
which, after 18 months of reform, still allows an inflation rate of 20 per
cent a month, or more, is a gamble. Handing aid to a government that has
still not swung decisively behind stabilisation, over two weeks after a
referendum endorsing the president and his policies, is bound to look
foolhardy.
Yet if there is even a chance of promoting reform and enabling the
government to establish financial discipline, the west must grasp it. For it
cannot be denied that Russia is special by virtue of its strategic
importance. Moreover, the risks of a collapse of reform are great, while the
obstacles to economic change - the distorted state of industry and the lack
of a technically sophisticated bureaucracy - will take time to remove.
It is regrettable that the G7 has chosen to jeopardise the reputations of
both the IMF and the World Bank in the process. Both are now bound to lend
on terms much looser than they would choose, primarily because G7
governments prefer to hide their expenditures behind an institutional
smokescreen. A second Marshall Fund - run, but not funded by the IMF and the
Bank - would have been preferable.
The G7 owes it to the international institutions, as well as to western
taxpayers, to ensure that the minimum standards it sets will be rigidly
enforced. Western budget support should be provided on a monthly basis. IMF
officials must be stationed within the central bank to ensure that aid is
halted if ceilings on credit creation are exceeded. The G7 should also
encourage systemic change by biasing aid towards privatised companies. It
should ensure that general budget subsidies are cut, while specific
subsidies to state enterprises are time-limited and tied to restructuring.
Last year's response to Russian pleas for help was torpid. But the G7's new
activity is a gamble. The onus now shifts to the Russian government to show
that it is, and remains, serious about reform.

<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office, still wincing over the escape of Asil Nadir, may
take solace from knowing that its Swiss colleagues have let not one, but two
big fish slip through their fingers recently.
Werner K. Rey, head of the Omni conglomerate that collapsed two years ago
with debts of SFr2bn, fled to the Bahamas early last year and has been
island hopping ever since to keep one step ahead of the rather
inappropriately named Beat Schnell, Bern's public prosecutor.
Then there is Jurg Heer, the colourful former credit director at Rothschild
Bank in Zurich who last summer admitted defrauding the bank of some SFr30m.
He disappeared in November and was last reported to have changed his name to
Giorgio Bonomi and taken out an Italian passport. He even managed to shift
all his goods and chattels, including a couple of highly valuable vintage
cars, out of his homes in Zurich and Klosters.
Unlike Britain, a suspicion lingers in Switzerland that, in Heer's case at
least, the Swiss authorities would be just as happy if he did not return.
His wild accounts last year of dodgy doings at Rothschild have damaged the
image of the entire Swiss private banking community, and the gnomes do not
like to be reminded of it.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to companies in distress, 57-year-old Gerald Greenwald is
getting a name as the right man to call. However, he seems to have learned
that it is best to stick to what he knows.
Greenwald first made his mark helping to spearhead the revival of Chrysler
in the early 1980s. Then he tried his hand heading Olympia &amp; York's
debt-restructuring effort.
But he is given higher marks for his performance at Chrysler than his
10-month stint as president of O&amp;Y, the property developer which emerged
from bankruptcy protection earlier this year.
He has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Tony Ryan, chairman of
the troubled GPA aircraft leasing group. But his latest chairmanship  - at
the suffering Czech truck-maker Tatra - looks a safer bet.
As his fellow GPA director Sir John Harvey-Jones knows to his cost,
trouble-shooters have to be particularly choosy about the companies they
sign up with if they're not to risk shooting themselves in the foot.

Meanwhile the law according to Parkinson looks to be exerting its grip in
Bonn, where worries about the future of the Transatlantic Relationship have
inspired the ever active Bertelsmann Foundation to spend at least DM4m on
research into same. The study, it was announced, would be carried out by a
20-member Euro American strategy group.
Its first session yesterday was attended by eight Germans, 12 Americans, two
Brits, and one each from Hungary, Sweden and Switzerland. So even without
the French member, kept away by illness, the group has already expanded
itself by 25 per cent.
The driving force behind the project is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's long-time
confidant Werner Weidenfeld, a professor at the University of Mainz. His
team includes Helmut Schmidt's erstwhile economic adviser Horst Schulmann
now on the Bundesbank council, and Bob Zoellick who was deputy chief of
staff to George Bush, not to mention the FT's Edward Mortimer.
The plan is to commission searching studies into relations between Europe
and North America with the aim of producing some resounding conclusions,
possibly in televised form, in four years. Let's hope the alliance is still
around to benefit.

<TEXT>
Observer's 'Clean Breast' award for chairmanly frankness goes to former
Consolidated Gold Fields director David Lloyd-Jacob. Since April 1991 he has
been heading the UK's lesser known Butte Mining, whose London quote was
suspended at 1 1/2 p last August compared with a Pounds 1 flotation price
five years before.
Here's how he spells out his future plans in the company's annual report:
'Management intends to rebuild net worth in the next few years, primarily by
litigation.'
He has hired a New York contingent-fee law firm to sue some of Butte's
former directors, advisers and investors in the US. But it is not only the
lawyers who'll be banking on the Montana court granting the damages claim of
about Dollars 1bn in full.
Lloyd-Jacob and two other executives are also in for a slice of the action.
He will get 3 per cent, and finance director Graham Andrews 1.5 per cent of
the gross proceeds over Pounds 15m. The president of Butte's US operations
Chuck Tatman is booked for  3/4 per cent of the gross.
The reason, the annual report explains, is that the trio 'have critical
expertise without which the company and the lawsuit would not have been
viable'.
What's more, with Butte living from hand to mouth, all have cut their
incomes and are now paid only as part-time consultants. Indeed,
Lloyd-Jacob's own salary from the company has been halved to a mere Pounds
50,000 a year.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Leading Article: High-cost TV
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS tend to get misty-eyed when they contemplate high-technology
projects. But those with misty eyes rarely have clear vision. Such has been
the case with the European Community's programme to push high-definition
television. Earlier this year, it looked as though the programme was set for
a merciful death. But, following a gasping attempt this week by EC ministers
to resuscitate the project, it may linger on for a little longer.
Europe's HDTV failure stems from the government-backed 'techno-imperialism'
of companies such as Philips and Thomson. The idea was that a home-grown
standard would help Europe's industry outflank Japan's.
The snag was that the plan did not take account of the market. Broadcasters
were reluctant to make programmes in the new standard and it was doubtful
whether consumers would be prepared to buy expensive new TV sets. The irony
is that Europe has been overtaken not by Japan but by the US, where
development has been more market-driven.
The EC would do well to bury its project. Unfortunately, the Commission and
most countries seem determined to press ahead with a slimmed down scheme to
subsidise production of TV programmes. Even Britain, which has criticised
the strategy, seems willing to go along.
It is understandable that Britain is thinking of compromise, since other
countries have moved substantially in its direction. Proposed EC funding for
the plan has been cut from Ecu850m to Ecu285m and may fall further.
If the HDTV initiative were an isolated case, there would be something to be
said for waiving it through in the interests of being communautaire. But it
is not. Similar white elephants in the past include Jessi, which aimed to
build a strong European semiconductor industry, and others could be in the
pipeline. Only last month the Commission proposed spending Ecu13.1bn on
research and development by 1998.
Subsidised R&amp;D is not the answer to Europe's weaknesses in high technology.
Philips is ailing despite an excellent record in R&amp;D. The problems are that
European companies have often been bad at turning research into
money-spinners, and other sectors of the economy have been slow to absorb
the benefits of technology.
It is not simply that such subsidies are a waste of taxpayers' money. Aid is
also counter-productive because it is almost invariably channelled through
big companies which have close links with government officials. This delays
necessary adjustments in what are often industrial dinosaurs, while nimbler
companies - which may have a better chance of profitable innovation - are
unfairly discriminated against. Europe's technology policy should
concentrate not on pushing technologies against what the market demands but
on facilitating the dissemination of technology in vigorously competitive
markets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE MUST build a new accountability fit for the 21st century - a new
accountability that goes directly from those who run public services to
those who use them.' Admirable sentiments, expressed with characteristic
clarity by Mr John Major in February. However, accountability for the
provision of local services has become less direct in recent years,
according to a report published today by the Audit Commission.
The commission says that the scope for councils to vary spending on services
in line with local preferences has been shrinking. Standard Spending
Assessments, used by the government to allocate grants to local authorities,
prescribe what councils should spend to provide a standard level of service.
But they are also used to control council spending. Local authorities which
spend too much over their SSA are forced to cut their budgets.
Using such assessments to allocate government grants inevitably leads to
arguments over the needs of particular areas. It also creates anomalies,
rating Cambridge as more deprived than Hartlepool, for example. Worse, using
them to cap council expenditure undermines the accountability of local
authorities to their electorates. Councils that provide poor quality
services can blame the government for setting SSAs which are too low for
their area's needs and for capping their spending.
The view that these assessments are objective is strengthened by ministers
who encourage councils to spend up to SSA. Birmingham City Council, for
example, has been pilloried for spending less than SSA on education.
Increasingly it looks as if central government decides what councils spend,
through the SSAs, rather than the locally elected council. The result is a
confusion of accountability; neither central nor local government accepts
responsibility for decisions on particular services.
At the heart of the problem is the fall in the proportion of local
government income which is raised by local taxes. In 1989-90, more than half
of local government income came from local taxes; this year they account for
about 20 per cent. Councils which depend for 80 per cent of their income on
government grants can only be weakly accountable to the local electorate.
And as long as Whitehall provides the bulk of local authority income,
ministers will want to interfere in how town halls spend it.
Restoring local accountability requires an increase in the discretion which
local government can exercise. That means providing local authorities with a
stable tax base which can finance a much higher proportion of their
spending. The simplest step towards this would be to return the business
rate to local authority control, with safeguards to limit increases which
might damage competitiveness. Efficiency and effectiveness will be easier to
achieve if local taxpayers know that their councils exercise real power over
local services.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Letter: Policies to lure capital back home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WOLFRAM SCHRETTL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf, in his most useful article, 'How to encourage flight
capital to go back home' (May 4), does not mention two important aspects of
the issue.
First, most advocates of 'shock therapy' (for Russia as well as for other
economies in transition) do not demand full legalisation of capital flows -
that is, capital account convertibility. Rather, they recommend either that
free two-way capital flows be completely excluded from liberalisation or
that only capital inflows, not outflows, be 'allowed', or that capital
account liberalisation be postponed until the very end of the reform
sequence.
These restrictions rather reduce capital inflows and, at the same time,
contribute to the 'crippling outflow', as Mr Wolf rightly notes. However, it
should be acknowledged that not only 'gradualists', but 'shock therapists'
as well, are to blame for this.
Moreover, part of the capital flowing out of Russia is likely to be of a
criminal origin (corruption). Therefore, even with the removal of standard
reasons for capital flight (such as interest rate spreads, confiscatory
taxation, etc), at least some of the flight is unlikely ever to return home,
contrary to what Mr Wolf seems to assume. In order to generate a full
reversal of the outflows, policies need to over-compensate for the
generically irreversible part of capital flight.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Letter: Lloyd's: relief for Names only way forward to a
bright future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAIN MITCHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Anyone concerned with the future of Lloyd's and the contribution it can
make to the financial well-being of the country, must welcome the new
business plan for its realistic appraisal of needs for the future based on
far greater frankness about the mistakes of the past ('The Lloyd's business
plan', April 30).
The tacit or explicit admission of those mistakes, however, highlights the
need to address the problem of those who are already victims of them. While
losses still mount, precise figures are impossible, but it appears that the
500 or so Lime Street Names now face losses in excess of Pounds 1.196bn for
the years 1988-91. This is effectively 1.8 per cent of the membership
carrying nearly 24 per cent of the losses.
It is perhaps inevitable that, while the battle for survival rages,
attention is more closely concentrated on the conduct of the fight than on
care for the desperately wounded; nevertheless, it would be immoral for
future prosperity to be built on lessons learned from the mistakes of the
past without the consequences of those mistakes also being put right.
On practical, as well as moral, grounds, the issue cannot be ducked either;
it must become increasingly clear from each further revelation that the
claims of much of the litigation are well founded and, anyway, most of the
Lime Street losses (averaging Pounds 2.3m a Name) could not be met even if
the Names were to abandon all claims. For every reason, therefore, Lloyd's
cannot expect to march forward to a bright future over the bodies of those
cut down without giving them proper relief.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Letter: Mission statements that are too often short on
reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr STEVE TIBBLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Men with a mission' (Management, May 10) was a very
timely and appropriate comment on the state of the mission statement in
British corporate life.
There are three fundamental areas in which British companies fail to give
mission statements the value and credibility they need:
They are all too often written in 'management speak'; this may suit
individuals at board level, but the further down the line one goes, the less
relevant it is. It also has the effect, in most cases, of making a statement
which is bland to the point of anonymity.
The acid test must be that the company is still capable of being readily
identified even if one crossed its name off the mission statement:
surprisingly few of them pass that test at the moment.
They are often sent out in a single form to all staff, and all staff are
expected to relate to them in the same way (which, of course, is almost
entirely impossible).
They are not set out in a way which means that employees can relate them to
their everyday tasks, and if they fail that test, it means that employees
will have great difficulty in relating to the mission statement at all.
British management seems to have accepted the idea of the mission statement
without necessarily being able to turn it into a reality. A mission
statement is a beginning and not an end.

   From MEHMET ARIF DEMIRER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial comment: '. . . the government of northern Cyprus should
not think that welcoming him (Asil Nadir) with open arms is a cost-free
decision. It is precisely such behaviour which will prevent it receiving the
recognition it craves' ('Jumping bail', May 6), raises two questions. First,
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) was proclaimed nine years
ago. Mr Nadir was a very important man in the UK then. Why did the UK not
recognise the TRNC, say, in 1985? Second, how many times did the TRNC
receive fugitives from British justice with open arms to justify the British
diplomatic non-recognition?
One final comment. Your usage of the word 'crave' instead of 'expect' or
'demand' implies a touch of unnecessary ugliness not becoming to the FT.

TOWERS OF DEBT
By Peter Foster
Hodder &amp; Stoughton
Pounds 19.99, 312 pages
In the 1980s, the international business world put Paul Reichmann on a
higher pedestal than such icons of the era as Donald Trump and Michael
Milken. Here was a man who had not only amassed billions of dollars, but had
done it the old-fashioned way.
Courtly in manner and unassuming in lifestyle, Mr Reichmann masterminded the
growth of Olympia &amp; York into the world's biggest property developer.
Bankers and politicians lionised him and tenants flocked to O&amp;Y's
well-managed buildings. Business negotiations with the company were
invariably taxing, but that only served to compound the impression that any
Reichmann deal must be a good one.
The Reichmann reputation has taken a battering, however, since O&amp;Y succumbed
to its USDollars 11bn (Pounds 7bn) debt a year ago. During nine arduous
months of debt-restructuring talks, creditors discovered one reason after
another to change their minds about Paul Reichmann and his two brothers and
business partners, Albert and Ralph. They were furious last April when they
found out that Mr Reichmann had briefed the media on his restructuring
proposals the weekend before he presented them to the banks. What is more,
the data given to the banks were out of date, and failed to disclose just
how desperate O&amp;Y's plight had become.
The creditors became angrier as the full story emerged of how the vast
Reichmann family business had been managed. O&amp;Y had always assured its
lenders that each of its buildings was a separate financial entity. But the
creditors discovered, too late, that as the property downturn deepened, the
Reichmanns had funnelled rents from profitable buildings in New York to
their tottering empire in the UK and Canada.
'The seeds of destruction lay in Paul Reichmann's unquenchable ambition,'
writes Peter Foster in his book on the rise and fall of Olympia &amp; York.
'(His) fatal flaws were excessive belief in his own powers, corporate
acquisitiveness and a penchant for larger and larger gambles.'
Those attributes were evident in Mr Reichmann's comment in 1988 on Canary
Wharf, the London Docklands project which was meant to be O&amp;Y's crowning
glory but ended up dragging it down. 'This is not a risky project,' Mr
Reichmann is quoted as saying. 'Doing one building there would be risky.
Doing a dozen is not.' Such bravado, delivered in the Reichmanns'
convincingly low-key style, impressed lenders, journalists and politicians
in the heady years when real estate values were soaring.
The Reichmann brothers' success story began with the parcel of New York
office buildings which they bought in the depths of the city's fiscal crisis
in 1977, in the words of one developer, just '20 minutes before the real
estate market turned around'. The family's reputation was cemented by a bold
decision to begin construction of the imposing World Financial Centre in
lower Manhattan as the property boom of the 1980s was lifting off.
But these achievements were only one side of the Reichmann story. Towers of
Debt tracks the family's mistakes back to 1981 when O&amp;Y moved away from the
business it knew best to take control of Abitibi-Price, then the world's
biggest newsprint producer. Four years later the family bought a 60 per cent
stake in Gulf Oil's Canadian subsidiary for CDollars 2.8bn, in the biggest
corporate takeover in Canadian history.
The Reichmanns diversified several more times. Though hostile takeovers were
not their style, O&amp;Y precipitated a messy struggle in 1986 for control of
Hiram Walker, the drinks and resources group.
Mr Paul Reichmann again showed poor judgment by backing the mercurial
Canadian entrepreneur Mr Robert Campeau during Mr Campeau's over-ambitious
takeovers of two of the US's biggest department store groups. Mr Reichmann
came to regret his backing of Mr Campeau even more than he did his
involvement in the Canary Wharf project.
Foster, a Canadian business writer, covers all the main episodes of the O&amp;Y
story. But his book lacks the immediacy and fresh detail which distinguish a
riveting corporate history from a passable one. While criticising
journalists for being blinded by the Reichmann aura, Foster relies heavily
on newspaper reports to tell his story. There is scant evidence of original
research, such as first-hand interviews, with the notable exception of his
accounts of the Gulf Canada and Hiram Walker takeovers (which are reproduced
from one of his earlier books).
In his preface Foster takes pride in having had two long interviews with Mr
Paul Reichmann in 1990. But his access to O&amp;Y insiders seems to have been
more limited in the crucial two years that followed.
In particular, Towers of Debt gives only a cursory - and mostly second or
third-hand - account of O&amp;Y's relations with the banks, arguably the most
important players in the saga after the Reichmanns themselves. Foster notes
in passing that two banks, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and
Bank of Montreal, received more data on O&amp;Y than other lenders. A little
more digging might have unearthed the annual ritual in which O&amp;Y invited
about 20 bankers to its offices to peek at an abridged version of its
financial statements, which they were not allowed to take away.
The book also fails to elucidate the full story of the tensions which
erupted between O&amp;Y and some of its biggest lenders (and among the lenders
themselves) after CIBC refused to put up more money for Canary Wharf in
early 1991.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Letter: Champions aim to unify export efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From RICHARD NEEDHAM MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader of April 26 ('Mr Heseltine's magic lantern') commented that
'government selection of 'national champions', even in the limited context
of bids for export contracts, is a tricky game'. In fact, we are not going
back to the bad old days of government picking winners. What we are doing is
working with industry so that British companies are unified against foreign
competition in export markets rather than squabbling among themselves. These
efforts will be headed in each important sector by a senior figure. That is
what I mean by a national champion.
There is enormous strength in British industry which we can exploit
effectively overseas if we all work together. What we are about is backing
winners.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Collective panic will not help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The great British historian, Thomas Macaulay, knew 'of no spectacle so
ridiculous as the British public in one of its periodical fits of morality'.
There is, however, one almost as ridiculous: the Tories in one of their fits
of collective panic.
The near hysteria with which many MPs, ministers and, above all, the Tory
media, have reacted to the shock government by-election and local election
defeats in mid-parliament, were to be predicted. But the phenomenon is all
too familiar. Unfortunately, my memory goes back to the losses of Torrington
and Orpington to the Liberals under Harold Macmillan. Such results tell us
nothing about the result of the next election. Forecasting the next election
is as unreliable an activity as forecasting the timing of economic 'green
shoots'.
How far do economic factors explain what has happened? Not nearly as much as
supposed. Various indicators have been tried to explain government
popularity. All have succumbed to Goodhart's Law; as soon as a measure is
used as a policy target, it lets us down.
The least unpromising is real personal disposable income because it is
comprehensive, taking in benefits as well as pay, and allows for taxes and
inflation. It has proved remarkably steady in the medium term. The average
annual increase has fluctuated at about 2 1/2 to 3 per cent - from which
between a  1/4 and  1/2 per cent should be deducted to get disposable income
per capita.
Straight-laced economists have often regarded these increases as too high,
because they have not left enough over for investment and exports.
Nevertheless, when real personal income growth has been much below these
rates it has tended to bounce back, while much higher increases have proved
unsustainable.
The achievement of relatively high rates of growth of this variable has
never been a sufficient condition of government re-election. The first
Wilson government was defeated in 1970 in spite of an above-trend increase
in its last full year of office. The Heath government was defeated in 1974
in spite of an extraordinarily high increase of 6.4 per cent in its own last
year, and an average of 5 per cent over its whole term. Lord Callaghan was
defeated in 1979 in spite of an even more extraordinary growth rate of 7.7
per cent in real incomes in 1978.
One is tempted to say that a reasonably good growth of real income is not a
sufficient, but a necessary, condition of re-election. Even this comes up
against the fact that John Major was re-elected last year in spite of a  1/2
per cent fall in disposable incomes in the recession year of 1991.
A mechanical analysis might say that the present prime minister benefited
from the achievement of the normal 2 1/2 per cent a year average real income
growth over the 1987-92 parliament. But it is more realistic to suggest that
he benefited both from distrust of Labour and the widespread feeling that
there had already been a change of government when he took over from Lady
Thatcher. At any rate a recovery to 2 1/4 per cent in disposable income
growth in 1992 - well ahead of general economic recovery - did not prevent
the political losses of a week ago.
There is one negative feature of which one can be confident: the futility of
cliche populist reactions such as a cabinet reshuffle or replacing the
chancellor. The problems remain the same; the officials analysing them
remain the same. There is just Whitehall gossip about the new occupant,
whether he reads his briefs, rewrites speeches and so on.
The odds are that a new chancellor - after an initial period of
tough-sounding reassurance of the financial markets - would be more tempted
than Norman Lamont to make gestures in the direction of cheap money and
plenty of it, and avoiding the fiscal changes required to eliminate the
structural budget deficit. The present chancellor has everything to gain and
nothing to lose from sticking to sound money policies. The time for a
symbolic change at No 11 has gone.
None of this means that we should pass over in silence the handling of
Britain's membership of, and departure from, the exchange rate mechanism -
which remains abysmal, whether one was a supporter or an opponent of
membership. Incompetence by one's own side is less forgivable than
incompetence by the other. Nor is it made more tolerable if one shared as a
bystander in some of the mistakes.
But simply putting a new face in the Treasury would achieve less than
nothing. What is needed is a public inquiry into the full chain of events,
covering prime minister as well as chancellor, officials as well as
ministers, Bank of England as well as Treasury.
Any inquiry would have to go back at least to the choice of entry parity in
1990 without properly consulting the German authorities; the failure to
rethink the parity when a combination of events made it less appropriate;
the ignoring of the warning signals given by the divergence indicator - when
the government refused either to raise interest rates or to realign; the
conduct of the notorious Bath finance ministers' meeting; the failure of
communication with the Bundesbank in the days before Black Wednesday last
September; and the official surprise at the extent of the run on sterling in
a foreign exchange market with a daily turnover running into hundreds of
billions.
A model might be the Franks Committee investigation of the events leading up
to the seizure of the Falklands in 1982. Although this had anodyne
conclusions, the narrative was revealing and accepted by both opponents and
supporters of the Falklands war.
Meanwhile, the biggest obstacle to the improvement of UK economic policy is
the failure of free-market and sound money Conservatives to understand the
arguments for institutional reform and for more use of rules rather than
government discretion. This was a cause central to Friedrich Hayek, who died
just over a year ago and whom such leaders claim to revere.
(The proceedings of a conference held to commemorate the first anniversary
of Hayek's death will be published by Macmillan in spring 1994. S F Frowen
(ed) Hayek: The Economist and Social Philosopher; A Critical Retrospective.)
At a recent lunch I heard the go-go New Zealand finance minister Ruth
Richardson take legitimate pride in a 1 per cent inflation rate - the lowest
in the OECD, and which was at last being accompanied by healthy growth. She
did not fail to pay tribute to one of her Labour predecessors, Sir Roger
Douglas, for establishing the independent Reserve Bank, which had made this
achievement possible.
A British cabinet minister was present, one of the few with untarnished
reputation. Instead of inquiring further how an independent central bank can
fit into a British-type parliamentary democracy, he just asked why it was
necessary if the government displayed enough will-power.
How can one begin on the fallacies in this simple question? Who knows where
this minister will be in a year or two, and whether his will is going to
prevail or not? Heroic acts of will-power are an unreliable, and even
undesirable, basis for constitutional democracy. All the great exponents of
limited government, from John Locke to the founders of the US Constitution
and onwards, have called for institutions which will do least damage when
manned by people of common-or-garden ability and morality.
The point about an independent central bank is not that its governors are
better or cleverer or more heroic than parliamentarians, but that, given the
right constitution or contract, they have every incentive to achieve stable
prices. Parliamentarians rightly have a multiplicity of objectives and time
horizons. The quality of Conservative thinking was better in the 1970s -
when reacting to Labour in office - than today, when the leaders squabble
about which of them are to be the masters.

After Honeymoon In Vegas, Indecent Proposal: and the evidence is mounting
up. The only place Hollywood sees as more corrupt than itself is Las Vegas.
There, blazed by lights and buzzed by helicopter shots, people who hazard
their money end up losing their souls and/or spouses.
Our last trip to the Nevada sin-bin saw Nicolas Cage lose Sarah Jessica
Parker to gangster James Caan. This time Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore are
the couple in straitened circs and Robert Redford is the flashing teeth with
the overflowing wallet. One million dollars he offers to Mr and Mrs
Harrelson for a night with Demi. Afterwards the lovebirds can rebuild their
recession-racked nest - he an architect, she an estate agent - and forget
about one benighted fling with Mr Goldenhaired Mephistopheles.
Or can they? The first and far livelier half of Indecent Proposal is
directed by Adrian Lyne with the paparazzo relish he brought to Fatal
Attraction. Lyne turns every close-up into a flashbulb snap of the exposed
soul, as hero and heroine wander a casino where guilt-edged insecurity is
the name of the game and where a magnifying camera turns even the roulette
wheel's bumping silver ball into a boulder from hell. Also from hell, but
the suaver section, is Mr Redford: slipstreamed into the story in a series
of glancing-eyed reaction shots, a debonair Devil in a dinner jacket.
But as a movie story, Indecent Proposal has a built-in-flaw. It is over with
the delivery of its moral punchline. 'Can money buy love?' Yes. End of
story. But obliged to fill a two-hour running time, Lyne and screenwriter
Amy Holden Jones pretend that the pay-off is merely a premise. They then
stretch the plot for a further hour, turning one night's sex-for-hire into a
flimsily overextended romance between fallen wife and Faustian billionaire.
The truly interesting question - does the damage to a marriage linger even
after the interloper has loved and left? - is squashed by the homewrecker's
continued presence as romantic threat. A potentially many-sided moral
conundrum becomes a humdrum emotional triangle.
The cast compounds the sense of bathos. Fatal Attraction had Glenn Close
using the whip on an equally short-distance plot idea, but who could
begrudge the extra show-gallops from a mad Medusa with peroxide mane?
Indecent Proposal has dull Woody Harrelson and three-faces Demi Moore
(winsome, more winsome, lachrymose). And though Redford spellbinds when
proposing the hellish bargain - a golden boy turned tarnished angel - even
he blands out under the obligation to canter endlessly round the same
whimsical-romantic course.
*****
Jean-Claude Lauzon's rude, funny and anarchic Leolo is a portrait of the
artist as a mad young fantasist. 'People think I'm French-Canadian' narrates
the title teenager (Maxime Collin), Lauzon's fanciful sketch of himself as a
boy; 'but because I dream, I'm not.' No, in his dreams he is Sicilian. His
mother conceived him from a crate of tomatoes (sic) which caught a stray
peasant's flying seed.
Now Leolo lives in Montreal with a lustful Grandpa who schemes to seduce a
young neighbour, a weakling older brother taking body-building lessons and a
mother from whom Leolo conceals his own delinquent tendencies. These include
masturbating into pieces of liver - clearly no part of the food-chain is
safe from this family's reproductive habits - and concocting schemes to
murder grandpa. These include a noose-and-pulley apparatus designed to drag
the old boy out of his bathtub and hang him. (It fails to work.)
Writer-director Lauzon's artistic noose-and-pulley system is at work
dragging Fellini, Philip Roth and several others out of their bathtubs.
Where his last film Night Zoo was a dry-run film noir, inspiration in Leolo
is a matter of violent, splashy raids. Here some raw sex from the
Jewish-American bildungsroman tradition; here some Amarcord-ish family
caricature; and as coup de grace - or dis-grace - a group cat-raping scene
which may have entire audiences fainting clean away.
Creative energy and taboo-bashing, though, have a history of honourable
fellowship in cinema. Leolo makes our mouths gape with the spectacle of the
forbidden and then crams more dubious goodies into the defenceless jaws. The
film's chief fault is its determination to find glamour and comedy in
madness. (The family's visits to asylum-penned Grandpa become awaydays to
Arcady.) Its virtue is its honesty about the myths of boyhood innocence.
Not even Leolo, though, had a family life quite like that depicted in
Braindead. Have you ever watched your loved ones turn into zombies, mutants
and man-eating multiple amputees - and then felt bound to add to the
carnage? Such is the destiny of young Lionel (Timothy Balme) in this black
comedy cum splatter epic from New Zealand's Peter Jackson of Bad Taste and
Meet The Feebles.
One moment Lionel's mother is the life and soul of the local WI, the next
she is bitten by a rare monkey and comes apart at the seams. The boy's duty
is plain. Glue back that cheek-flap. Staunch that fountaining abscess. And
when Mum, plus most of the town, turn into deformed and slavering cannibals,
wield everything from a horse hypodermic to a rotary mower to stop them
running amok.
Holding a handkerchief to your mouth, you should marvel at the special
effects. The call-sheet of consumer durables on this production, claim the
press notes, included pork fat, polyfoam, human hair, ultra-slime (sic) and
'hundreds of litres of maple syrup'. It makes The Evil Dead look like Mrs
Miniver. And it is horrendously funny. Once again the cinema looks squarely
at the forbidden and proves that with enough jet-black comic propulsion,
nervous laughter can launch itself into liberating hilarity.
Mistress, a comedy about movie-making, gives us different monsters. Called
film financiers, they batten onto innocent film-maker Marvin (Robert Wuhl),
who is hoping to resuscitate a long-neglected script about a suicidal
painter. Thanks to a producer friend (Martin Landau), Marvin's backers soon
include a mad Jew (Eli Wallach), a sleaze merchant from Outer Sunset (Robert
De Niro) and a big ego from Little Italy (Danny Aiello). And their
girlfriends. These must all have leading parts. Hence this film's title.
But we have seen it all in The Player, and director Barry Primus, alas, is
no Robert Altman. Mistress advances on stepping-stones of well-worn
Tinseltown apercus to lower, ever more lacklustre things. The comedy needed
more fizz, the malice more momentum.
These commodities are plentiful in Alexandre Rockwell's In The Soup. But
this lissom lampoon will be seen only by three men and a dog at the National
Film Theatre. Rockwell proposes a young Italian-American film-maker (Steve
Buscemi) embroiled with an older producer (Seymour Cassel). Since Cassel's
life is in hock to the Mafia, he furnishes wilder and more interesting
material than the boy's script. But as the Mob keep knocking on the door,
when does stimulating source material turn into serious life-endangerment?
Rockwell shows Olympic skill in jumping from mood to mood, from batty
vignette (singing Italian landlords) to even battier vignette (TV quiz game
called The Naked Truth in which contestants are quizzed au naturel). The
film may get - cross fingers - a wider release later in the year.
Finally, Wild West: an example of that noble British genre that we might
call Ethnic Muddying. See My Beautiful Laundrette, Sammie And Rosie Get Laid
and company. Take a Yorkshire-born director (David Attwood), add an
Anglo-Indian screenwriter (Harwant Bains), then stir in two Asian-British
juvenile leads, Naveen Andrews and Sarita Choudhuri as star-crossed
Southall-dwellers aspiring to be Country singers. Result: a comical dish
with a mixed, tangy, rebellious flavour that can be poured over the heads of
racial purity theorists. Modestly made - neither the sound-recording nor the
photography will win Oscars  - but funny, charming and laudably interracial.

Over 30 years ago two American film makers produced a documentary about life
in the 'well of death', a slum area of Palermo, capital of impoverished
Sicily. Among those whose life was examined was Angela, 23 years old and
already expecting her fourth child. Now the son of one of the original
cameramen goes back to discover what happened to Angela. At one level life
has improved. The slum has been torn down and she lives free from squalor
and imminent hunger. At another level the family is still wracked by
deprivation of another kind, by crime, ill health and lack of education.
(True Stories, on Channel 4 at 9.35). Another peep into a foreign culture on
BBC 2 at 9.40. Under the Sun follows two young Nigerian girls undergoing the
Iria ceremony through which they learn about marriage by being confined in a
room for six weeks where they are fattened up and taught feminine wiles.
Not a bad night for comedy. It's a pity the repeats of Keeping Up
Appearances, (BBC 1 at 8.30) with Patricia Routledge, clash with Just a
Gigolo, (ITV) in which the Tony Slattery has a good line in double takes.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Arts: Paris theatre takes on a mirror image of today's world
 -Parisian theatregoers continue to benefit from the Jack Lang years, with
new productions from Peter Brook, Jerome Savary and Luc Bondy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE HILL

<TEXT>
Bolstered by nearly a decade of ex-arts minister Jack Lang's lavish and
liberal policies, Paris has in the last few years been making a bid to
become Europe's theatre capital.
Compared with London, subsidy is a major element of its theatrical budget,
either as direct grants to theatres and companies, indirectly through
co-production with France's rich panolply of regional subsidised theatres
and companies, or through the funding of an individual production,
particularly if it concerns that rarity, a worthwhile new work. Even the
Parisian commercial theatre received a direct FFr23m (Pounds 2.7m) from the
state for 1993. But France's recent major government cast changes are likely
to see a severe curtailment of such largesse, therefore placing in jeopardy
the French capital's present high theatrical profile.
But for this season at least, Parisian theatregoers can continue to benefit
from the legacy of les annees Lang. Skimming the top off the creme de la
creme of the hundred or so plays that have opened in and around the capital
during the past ten weeks, Peter Brook's name is inevitably written large.
After deftly retailoring the Debussy/Maeterlinck opera into Impressions de
Pelleas, Brook now brilliantly mutates the eminent neurologist Oliver Sack's
book, The Man who thought his Wife was a Hat, into a singular theatrical
experience.
Premiered at the atmospheric old music hall, the Bouffes du Nord, where
Brook founded his Centre International de Creations Theatrales some 20 years
ago, L'Homme qui is a series of Sack's medical case histories: genetic tics,
involuntary reactions, waking dreams, false blindness, are acted out by four
of Brook's most penetrating disciples, with amazing insight, sensitivity,
simplicity and a disturbing verity.
MC93-Bobigny, an important suburban cultural centre, rounds off its present
theatre season with a perceptive and immensely entertaining revival of
Marcel Pagnol's Les Marchands de Gloire - which against a characteristically
Pagnolian provencal backdrop strikes out against war and political
corruption by amusingly bringing a dead hero back from the grave. This is to
be followed by Sans titre, an untitled work by Federico Garcia Lorca, which
accuses the theatre of acting out lies to distract from the surrounding
reality.
Unbuttoned enjoyment has little place in this season's programme at the
Colline, Paris' newest, most user-friendly and outspoken national theatre,
which under the enlightened artistic direction of Jorge Lavelli admirably
fulfils its mission as a stage for contemporary theatre. Currently, Terres
Mortes, a French production of Bauern Sterben by German playwright Franz
Xaver Kroetz, is spilling its 20th century entrails over the studio theatre.
Now, it is a French production Stalin by the Chilean-born Gaston Salvatore,
who writes in German and lives in Italy, that is spelling out its potent
social message.
Demain une Fenetre sur rue, in the Colline's main theatre, goes one step
beyond the watching of war live on television, and imagines a family
observing, through their window, a civil war bent on exterminating the poor.
Not a spoof on CNN's recent exploits, the play was inspired by TV coverage
of Biafra and written in 1968 by Jean-Claude Grumberg, one of France's most
socially alert playwrights.
Parisian theatre is playing to the full its role as a mirror image of
today's world. However, a gimmick-ridden, much-heralded French production of
Edward Bond's Jackets, distorted beyond recognition the English playwright's
already poorly defined reflection on children as victims of society. In
complete contrast, La Compagnie Des Hommes, Bond's pin-hole view of the
world of big business, was beautifully crafted into a dazzlingly glossy
production when, at the start of the season, it was world premiered, also at
the Theatre de la Ville.
Jerome Savary continues to cock a snook at the establishment, now from the
inside, as artistic director of the palatial Chaillot national theatre. His
penchant is to take a hallowed classic and turn it into a circus act,
reminiscent of those that he put together in the 1960s as founder of the
Grand Magic Circus. The latest old master to be framed by Savary is
Goldoni's The Boors. Translated into Les Rustres it becomes a hilarious
romp. For classical purists it is a travesty, for the rest of us it is a
laugh-a-minute British panto with a strong Franco-Italian accent.
Les Rustres, chased from the Chaillot in the full flight of success by
Savary's new production of The Taming of the Shrew, is now at the Mogador,
dark since the premature closure of a disastrous French production of Kiss
Me Kate. This was the latest in a long line-up of international hit musicals
to bite the dust once they touch French soil.
Sell-out success was virtually guaranteed for a revival of Jean Cocteau's
Les Monstres Sacres at the Bouffes Parisiens. Who could resist the chance to
see Michele Morgan and Jean Marais in harness together for the first time.
Themselves monstres sacres of the French cinema, no matter if the play,
about two stage stars at their height, and written in 1937, is beginning to
show its age - or that the octogenarian Marais is a shade too mature for the
role.
Revivals of Alfred de Musset's On ne badine pas avec l'amour and Il ne faut
jurer de rien, both directed by Jean-Pierre Vincent, are a disappointment.
One has come to expect the unexpected from this remarkable director, whose
talents made him an eminently suitable successor to Patrice Chereau as
artistic director of the Amandiers, a vast theatre complex in the university
suburb of Nanterre. Despite the heady presence in On ne badine pas . . . of
Emmanuelle Beart, who gained international acclaim in the film Jean de
Florette, the Musset duo merely glows with professionalism, but never burst
into flames of great theatre.
That elusive tingle factor is to be found in a new French adaptation of
Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman. Directed by Luc Bondy, a name increasingly
known in operatic circles, and starring Michel Piccoli, it is set against a
series of magnificent, megalomaniac decors by Erich Wonder. The production
comes to the Odeon-Theatre de L'Europe from the Vidy-Theatre, Lausanne.
A French revival of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion at the Arts Hebertot, is
playing to full houses, thus taking the wind out of the stormy reviews it
received. The scene stealer is Sophie Marceau as Eliza Doolittle, whose
irreproachable performance dispels for ever her image as a cinema nymphet of
little consequence.
For some time, the Comedie Francaise has been resting on its laurels as
France's most historic and prestigious national theatre. A double bill of
Moliere's Les Precieuses Ridicules and L'Impromptu de Versailles, the latest
revival to enter its current repertoire, continues to display the complacent
mediocrity that has attracted forceful criticism from the media. Audiences
remain undauntingly loyal, although when the curtain comes down a lot of
them are caught napping.
A green shoot at the start of the season was a French revamp of Goldoni's La
serva amorosa. Not a particularly memorable production, it nonetheless has
just won for the Comedie Francaise a Moliere for this season's best play in
the subsidised sector(the Molieres are France's most important theatre
awards.)
Temps contre Temps - Ronald Harwood's Another Time - at the Bruyere, was
voted best play in the commercial sector. Its success rests squarely on the
seemingly frail shoulders of Laurent Terzieff, who directs and plays the
lead.
In recent years, the dearth of new French plays has seen an avalanche of
foreign imports, particularly from among New York hits. All too often their
adaptation into French has a castrating effect, which strips them to their
quintessential raunchy appeal One to survive with its dramatic genitalia
almost intact is David Mamet's Speed the Plow, as Partenaires, at the
Michodiere.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Arts: Reimann's 'Das Schloss' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY ANDREW CLARK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aribert Reimann's Kafka opera, Das Schloss (The Castle), could hardly have
made a more auspicious start in life. Its premiere at the Berlin Festival
last September has been quickly followed by two other productions, most
recently in Berne. And yet the work cannot be described as 'popular'.
It makes extreme demands on an audience's concentration and the resources of
a provincial theatre. On that basis, the Berne ensemble can be proud of its
achievement - even if its courage sometimes outweighed its mastery of
Reimann's music.
In Berlin, Das Schloss came across as a bleak, three-hour parable of
xenophobia and bureaucracy, draped in music of elaborate invention. I found
myself admiring it a lot less in Berne. Kafka's novel about K - the figure
who arrives in a wintry village with a commission to work as land-surveyor
at the Castle - does not lend itself easily to the theatre.
K himself does not have any personality (in the novel his speech is all
indirect): we simply see him reacting passively to the rebuffs and betrayals
of a succession of colourful, heartless characters. Nor is there much
dramatic development: K's predicament at the end is the same as at the
start. Reimann organises his material into nine 'frames' capturing
situations in the novel - but music and dialogue offer no more than
different slants to the same picture.
Eike Gramss' production, designed by Eberhard Matthies and Renate Schmitzer,
placed the work somewhere between Theatre of the Absurd, black comedy and
philosophical fable - with a few Expressionist touches thrown in for good
measure. The permanent set consisted of a bare white room, with mysterious
side entrances and a backdrop opening up to reveal sky and snow. Distantly
visible in the first and last scenes was the Castle itself, looking more
like a motel than a Kafkaesque tower. Costumes were 20th century
middle-European, with K resembling a cross between a shaven-headed Dutchman
and the universal hobo.
Jan Frank Danckaert missed the air of weary puzzlement essential to the role
(memorably created by Wolfgang Schone in Berlin), but the supporting cast,
led by Gottfried Driesch's farcical Mayor, Elisabeth Hornung's witch-like
Landlady and Uwe Schonbeck's enigmatic Burgel, offered a collection of
richly contrasted character-portraits.
The orchestral performance under Andreas Delfs would have benefitted from
greater textural clarity and more incisive brass perorations - but the
chamber-music sophistication of Reimann's instrumental writing (the
opposite, as in so much of this opera, to Lear) was faithfully recreated.

FT  13 MAY 93 / People: Hillsdown's US accent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bridget Macaskill, president and chief operating officer of US mutual fund
manager Oppenheimer Management Corporation, is joining the board of
Hillsdown, the poultry to upholstery group, as its third non-executive
director.
Sir John Nott, who has recently taken over as executive chairman, says that
'90 per cent of our ultimate customers are women, but that is not why she
was selected.' Rather, she emerged as the strongest candidate after a search
by headhunters.
Macaskill, 44 and English, spent ten years with Unigate until 1982, latterly
as marketing director for St Ivel, with responsibility for chilled products,
liquid milk and fruit juice.
She had made an early mark by suggesting to an initially highly sceptical
boss that Unigate should deliver orange juice on the daily milk round. Not
much later she was running the new fruit juice division.
In 1982 she then moved with her husband, who works for Bankers Trust, to New
York, and picked up a job as vice president of marketing for Oppenheimer,
then part of Mercantile House.
Moving onto the general management side, she had risen to chief operating
officer by the time Oppenheimer bought itself out from the collapsed British
&amp; Commonwealth empire. Oppenheimer Management Corporation currently manages
Dollars 22bn of assets with annual sales running at Dollars 4bn.
Macaskill believes that her awareness, as a consumer, of American trends in
the food business - salads, prepared foods - will justify her presence on
the Hillsdown board. Now sporting a distinctly American accent, she adds
that her experience of running a US business may also prove useful.
Sir John, who acknowledges that Hillsdown has been 'light' on non-executives
since he took on the role of executive chairman and Tony Brice, a former
Hillsdown executive, retired at the agm, says that the group will probably
be looking for another non-exec. 'It has not finally been decided whether
Sir Harry Solomon (the co-founder of Hillsdown who has recently stepped down
from the chairmanship) will be seen as a true non-executive director.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Technology: Trap set for the office time waster - Hours are
lost tinkering with the PC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN CONSTANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far from making the modern office worker more productive, the personal
computer has become a highly expensive time waster. Playing with on-screen
graphics, tinkering with layouts and experimenting with fonts is an
international obsession - and a costly one - according to new studies.
The average PC user wastes 5.1 hours every week, reports SBT Accounting
Systems, the US software house. Its survey revealed that 5bn hours may be
lost in the US each year; based on the average white-collar wage this
equates to Dollars 100bn (Pounds 67bn), or 2 per cent of its GDP.
Placing so much power on the desktop can be counter-productive. In the US,
white-collar productivity increased by just 0.2 per cent a year during the
1980s, despite having the world's highest number of PCs per head.
In Japan, however, efficiency levels are matched by one of the lowest
desktop investments in the developed world, according to Barry Graham of
Xephon, a UK consultancy. Last year PCs accounted for 37 per cent of
Japanese hardware expenditure, compared with 53 per cent in the UK and 47
per cent in Germany. 'The reason is cultural. Managers in Japan and Germany
often consider it beneath them to be seen at a screen,' explained Graham.
On-screen time wasting now accounts for up to 25 per cent of a PC user's
time, estimates Xephon, which concludes that however unfashionable, the
mainframe may still be the most secure and cost-effective option. And yet
many managers continue to download applications on to the desktop, unaware
of the expenses that will be incurred. Before they do so, they must consider
the consequences, advises ICL's corporate systems business manager Peter
Slavid.
'PCs, Unix systems and mainframes all have an important role to play as part
of the system. But where people go wrong is making radical changes in any
direction just because the hardware looks cheap,' he says.
A survey by KPMG Management Consulting revealed that the total price for
owning a PC, including 'hidden' costs, could be as high as Pounds 5,900 a
year. Even by Xephon's more conservative estimate, networked PCs cost
businesses between Pounds 10,300 and Pounds 15,500 for every end-user over
five years. By comparison, the mainframe works out at a mere Pounds 6,000 to
Pounds 6,750 per user.
Managers are losing control, concludes KPMG. It has discovered that 'over 90
per cent of total workstation ownership costs are not being actively
managed'. This includes what KPMG terms 'local workstation gurus'. These
people are to be found in every office, and are well-versed in PCs. Every
time a less-experienced user has a problem, it is the 'gurus' who are called
upon to help, distracting them from their own work. 'Unless management
recognises and actively manages this resource, there is a grave danger that
a significant degree of the organisation's resources will continue to run
out of control,' warns KPMG.
Such findings are seen by Xephon as proof that downsizing is not the
cost-effective solution many businesses assume it to be. Computer suppliers
such as ICL argue that cost is not the only issue. 'All this proves is that
you can't just dump PCs on people's desks and hope to get an efficient
system out of it,' says Slavid.
'The objective is an effective system, and you need to avoid being seduced
into restructuring by the availability of cheap power on the desktop. It's
only cheap if people make good use of it.'
Graham agrees, but insists that even if the cost issue is ignored,
mainframes still make more sense. By acting as a centralised point of
control they can even offer a solution to the time-wasting temptation.
'Mainframes eliminate the time taken to make back-up copies, for instance,
because this is done automatically, and they can also control access to
data,' he says.
'This can restrict the amount of time a clerk has the information, so they
have no choice but to get the job done efficiently. If they exceed the time
limit, questions will be asked.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Technology: High-speed information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Internet is the precursor of the high-speed 'information superhighways'
that President Bill Clinton hopes to see built in the US to enable
businesses and individuals to transmit data at speeds of up to a gigabyte
per second.
Although these highways are not yet in place, the Internet is providing a
glimpse of what can be expected in the 21st century.
In recent congressional testimony, Vinton Cerf, president of the Internet
Society, compared this emerging 'information infrastructure' with the
transportation system: 'The computer is the automobile of this emerging
information infrastructure. Laptops are the sports cars; desktops are the
sedans; supercomputers are the Formula One racing engines; and gigantic
mainframe data storage systems are the 18-wheelers. The local access
networks of the Internet are the neighbourhood streets; high-capacity
computer networks are the highways; switching systems form the complex
interchanges.
'Just as vehicles on the road can be filled with an endless variety of
people and products performing a multitude of services, software
applications fill the empty computing vessels to create the new products and
services of the information infrastructure.'
Cerf offered examples of how the Internet is already being used:
A professor at the University of Southern Louisiana offered to teach a class
through electronic mail on the Internet; 15,000 people asked to join the
class.
When President Clinton and Vice-President Gore visited Silicon Valley to
launch their technology policy, the audio and video - as well as the text -
of their speeches were 'multicast' on the Internet to hundreds of sites.
Wellington, New Zealand, is using Internet to promote its tourist industry.
A blind student uses Internet to access libraries around the world that can
provide on-line versions of Shakespeare's plays which can be converted to
speech by his desktop computer.

FT  13 MAY 93 / People: Blunt-talker at Hartstone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone Group, the hosiery and leather goods company which has seen its
share price tumble from 272p in March to a low of 86p last night, has
appointed Shaun Dowling, a non-executive director, as deputy chairman.
The announcement comes just weeks before the company is expected to report
its annual profits for the year to March 31. About two months ago, Hartstone
warned of expected exceptional charges of Pounds 8.5m relating to the
restructuring of its recently acquired Franch and Spanish hosiery companies.
Dowling, aged 59 and reported to be a blunt-talker, is a former director of
Guinness and holds directorships at ML Holdings and Enterprise Computer,
among others.
He is expected to give greater focus to the group's operational development,
an area in which the recently acquisitive Hartstone has come under close
scrutiny.
Dowling has been a non-executive director of Hartstone since September 1991.
The City welcomed the appointment although some analysts speculated that
Dowling's post was the result of institutional pressure for changes
following the sharp decline in the share price.
However, a company spokesman denied that the group had come under pressure
from shareholders.

FT  13 MAY 93 / People: Arthur Shaw
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new calm at ARTHUR SHAW, the Willenhall, West Midlands, building
products group, was ruffled yesterday when it was announced that John
Walmsley, the chief executive, had left the company.
But his departure apparently has nothing to do with the boardroom rows which
had led to rebel shareholders demanding extraordinary general meetings, the
movement of chairmen in and out, and High Court proceedings about who should
be a director. Those proceedings were only settled last month.
The reason simply was that Walmsley prefers Sweden to Willenhall. Finance
director Lindsay Melvin explained that Walmsley married a Swede two years
ago and bought a house in Sweden at the beginning of this year and, aged 54,
is now retiring.
Consequently, Brian Phillips, a former managing director, and chairman since
March, is assuming the role of chief executive as well and the company will
be looking for another non-executive director.
Apart from Phillips and Melvin, the only other board member is Ian Tickler,
who, with his family and friends, controls 49 per cent of the Arthur Shaw
equity.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Technology: Caught in the Internet - Electronic message
systems that span the globe could be as useful as the telephone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International electronic mail systems are no longer the plaything of hackers
and bug-eyed computer enthusiasts. They are emerging as credible business
tools that enable individuals and companies to communicate cheaply and
efficiently around the globe.
Like the in-house electronic mail networks that have become a fact of
business life in many companies, these systems provide a means of sending
and receiving messages via personal computers or computer terminals. With
global electronic mail services, however, messages can be sent across the
world or across town.
For evidence of the rising popularity of electronic mail, a look at the
business cards collected from clients or contacts lately should be enough.
The chances are that some of them include electronic mail 'addresses', along
with telephone and facsimile numbers.
The advantages of electronic mail are numerous. It can eliminate hours of
frustrating 'telephone tag' and enable people to communicate across
timezones with ease. It also sidesteps busy facsimile machines that spew out
piles of paper which are often misplaced or misdirected. With electronic
mail, the message appears directly upon the computer screen on the desk of
the individual being contacted.
The biggest roadblock to the success of electronic mail in the past has been
the lack of a 'critical mass' of users. Although dozens of personal computer
electronic mail services are available, until recently they were not linked.
This meant that to reach somebody it was necessary to subscribe to the same
electronic messaging system.
Over the past couple of years, however, many electronic mail systems have
started 'talking' to one another. The mechanism for this is 'Internet' - a
low-cost and efficient link between electronic mail services worldwide. The
Internet links an estimated 1.5m computers over 10,000 networks in 50
countries, serving about 6m users.
Internet enthusiast Brendan P Kehoe - whose popular guide to using the
Internet, 'Zen and the Art of the Internet' (Prentice-Hall), is a
'must-read' for all new users - describes the Internet as a large 'network
of networks'. He points out that there is no single network. 'Regional
networks like SuraNet, PrepNet and NearNet are all inter-connected or
inter-networked together,' he says. 'And all this activity takes place in
real-time.'
The Internet resembles a computer network co-operative. There is no central
authority that oversees it and rules are largely informal. Its roots lie in
a US Defence Department project begun in the early 1970s to enable US
universities, national laboratories and government agencies to share
information.
Over the past 20 years it has mushroomed to include regional, corporate and
public networks, including commercial electronic mail systems. 'People
conduct their love life over the Internet, their hobbies and their
interests. They argue politics and engage in all kinds of business,' says
Mitch Kapor, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, which promotes awareness of the on-line world.
'Internet is doubling annually in users, networks, computers and traffic,'
says Vinton Cerf, president of the Internet Society, a volunteer secretariat
that helps administer the network. 'It is growing faster than any other
telecommunications systems ever built, including the telephone network.'
Commercial users now outnumber academic and government Internet users and by
1998, Cerf predicts, the system will serve over 100m users.
Despite the anarchic nature of its structure, the basics of using Internet
communications are simple. All that is needed is a computer modem, a
communications software package and a subscription to an on-line information
service linked to the Internet. Public access to the Internet is provided by
popular services such as Compuserve, MCI mail and Applelink.
Subscription costs range from about Dollars 9 (Pounds 5.80) to Dollars 20
per month, depending upon the service and varying according to the
information services offered. Once a subscription to one of these services
is obtained, the charge for sending an electronic messages is generally only
a few pennies, depending upon the message length and the time it takes to
transmit. In most places a local telephone call will connect you to the
system.
A subscription to Compuserve, one of the most widely used on-line
information services, costs Dollars 8.95 per month. Compuserve users simply
dial a local access number with the modem, log on and type GO MAIL to enter
the message system. The charge for reading or sending Internet messages is
15 cents for the first 7.5KBytes (about 900 words) and 5 cents per
additional 2.5KBytes (about 300 words) after that.
The key to sending an Internet message lies in the Internet address. A
typical Internet address might be: jsmith@cix. compulink. co. uk. The
elements of the address are not particularly cryptic - the name of the
recipient is J Smith and he is a subscriber at (or @) CIX, the full name of
which is Compulink. The last two designations show that Compulink is a
company, rather than an educational establishment or government agency, that
resides in the UK.
One drawback is that it is not always easy to find Internet addresses.
Although some systems offer international directories of their electronic
mail users, there is no central directory. Critics say the Internet,
originally designed for use in scientific and education applications, does
not have security and ease-of-use features that commercial users want. At
peak business hours, promptness of service on the Internet can also be a
problem.
Despite its limitations, the Internet is an inexpensive way of sending and
receiving electronic messages. Doing business without access to such
electronic mail systems is soon likely to be as rare as the office without a
telephone.

FT  13 MAY 93 / People: Glaxo cures R&amp;D gap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Concerns about the enormous responsibilities of Dr Richard Sykes, Glaxo's
research and development director and recently appointed chief executive,
were partly met yesterday when Dr Goran Ando was appointed R&amp;D director of
Glaxo group research, the UK research arm and the company's largest research
arm.
Analysts had believed that it was impossible for one man to cope as chief
executive and be responsible for R&amp;D. Glaxo last year spent nearly Pounds
600m on R&amp;D - more than any other pharmaceutical company. It has research
sites in the UK, US, Italy, France and Spain and employs more than 6,800 R&amp;D
specialists.
Dr Ando, who joined Glaxo in 1989 as medical director, was made deputy R&amp;D
director in March last year. He was responsible for co-ordinating all
development, medical and regulatory functions in the company's international
pharmaceutical development programmes. He retains responsibility for
world-wide drug development.
A 44-year-old Swede, Dr Ando was previously at Astra, the Swedish group,
where he was president of the group research centre. Before that he held
positions at Pfizer and Bristol-Myers.
Dr Sykes retains the chairmanship of Glaxo group research as well as
responsibility for R&amp;D on the Glaxo board.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Design industry on
show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's Designers and Art Directors Association - familiarly known as D&amp;AD
 -has acquired a sorry reputation for mismanagement in recent years. Still
Britain's premier design trade body, it is now trying to polish its image.
D&amp;AD's relatively new chairman - Anthony Simonds-Gooding has been in place
for just a year - and president - Aziz Cami, of the London design agency The
Partners - are concerned that industry has forgotten the importance of
design as a core activity.
Cami's and Simonds-Gooding's efforts to raise D&amp;AD's profile come together
in an important London event next week.
Billed as 'London's first festival to communicate to the business community
and the general public the real value of creative excellence,' D&amp;AD will be
hosting a variety of lectures and exhibits in a 20,000 sq ft marquee in
Bedford Square. Touche Ross is one of a number of sponsors, which between
them have chipped in Pounds 250,000.
It will be 'a festival for green shoots, aimed at clients and at catching
their imagination, to convince them of the importance of design excellence
in the businesses, as well as a chance for ordinary consumers to see the way
in which design is present throughout their lives,' says Simonds-Gooding.
Visitors will be able to sample selections of the best in advertising and
design from around the world. Some exhibits will then go on a 12-city global
tour to promote the export potential of British design.
For Cami the festival has a dual purpose: 'For years Britain has been seen
as a centre of excellence in design and advertising. To keep that position
we must be more aware of the competition, to stop us resting on our laurels.
And the design industry needs to articulate to business the UK's home-grown
talent, which needs to be exploited more by industry.'
Tickets and further details are available on 081 862 0202.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Vimto woos the home
front - A soft drink's campaign to widen its appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few brands achieve international status without first securing a leading
position in their national market. Vimto, a fruit drink made by
Manchester-based JN Nichols, is one of them.
Dwarfed by Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages and Britvic - the industry
leaders - the Vimto brand has a mere 2 per cent of the UK market. With the
bulk of sales still in northern England and Scotland, it is probably better
known in Saudi Arabia and the Sudan than it is in Surrey and Sussex.
As this month's new television advertising campaign underlines, however,
Nichols is intent on better exploiting at home the potential which has so
long been realised abroad.
British troops sent to the outposts of the empire in the 1920s and 1930s
were among the first distributors of Lancashire herbalist John Noel
Nichols's concoction of blackcurrant, raspberry, grape and other fruit
juices, and herbs.
Since then a glass of Vimto and a handful of dates has become the
traditional nightly sustenance during the Ramadan fast in many Middle East
countries - where the same family firms have acted as agents since the early
1930s.
Across Africa, from the Gambia and Ivory Coast in the west to Kenya and
Uganda in the east, demand for Vimto is still growing. It has recently been
launched in Egypt and revived in Mozambique; shipped into Canada and Guyana;
and distributed in new markets in South Africa, Cyprus and Spain.
The brand remains a firm favourite in India and Pakistan. Vimto reaped the
benefit of its early presence in overseas markets, such as the Middle East,
as local consumer spending power began to increase in the 1960s and 1970s.
The company's UK bottling and canning plants could barely keep pace with
export demand for the company's cordial and carbonate products.
By 1980 when Nichols bought Solent Canners - the company's packager for the
Middle East market - exports accounted for nearly 70 per cent of volume
sales.
Nichols first turned its attention to the development of its home market
after several overseas agents, which had long handled marketing and
distribution, began to make the drink locally from concentrate shipped from
the UK. As a result Nichols found itself with spare packaging capacity and,
as managing director John Nichols, a grandson of the company's founder, puts
it: 'We had a brand that was international but still had a long way to go
nationally.'
With an enlarged sales force, expansion proved relatively easy in the rest
of northern England and Scotland. Moving the brand south has been more
difficult. 'Multiple grocers saw Vimto as a regional brand and have taken a
lot of persuading to put it on their shelves throughout the country,' says
Nichols.
But persistence is paying off. The company has improved Vimto's appeal as an
alternative to the ubiquitous colas by redesigning its cans and cordial
labels, which had been largely unchanged for decades. It has introduced diet
and low-sugar versions of the drink and a variety of pack sizes.
The company has also formed a distribution alliance with AG Barr, the
independent producer of Tizer and Irn-Bru; and entered the vending machines
market.
National visibility has been raised by advertising on BSkyB and Channel 4,
as well as on regional television. Sponsorship and promotional campaigns
have been widely used in the push to extend market boundaries.
Over the past five years, Vimto has been one of the fastest- growing soft
drinks brands. Carbonate sales have risen at more than three times the
growth rate of the market; and cordial sales have risen twice as fast.
Although Nichols admits the drink is a little too sweet for his taste, the
company may soon have the national status to match its reputation abroad.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Accountancy Column: TV education market proves a blackboard
jungle - A bitter and as yet unprofitable battle for market share between
two rival companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BITTER battle is brewing over control of the accountancy television
education market. The quiet world of the profession is being shaken by the
vulgarity of aggressive competition.
The sleeves are being firmly rolled up on the arms of Accountancy Television
(ATV) and Television Education Network (TEN) as the two organisations fight
for the audience for videos and broadcast programmes.
Both services are beginning to reflect each other's tactics in their
attempts to grab market share. Both say that the future looks promising.
Neither has yet shown the profits to match the rhetoric.
The story began early last year. Three organisations decided to launch a
weekly programme on BBC Select, the broadcasts made late at night on
television and which can only be watched with the aid of an electronic
decoder. They were the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales, the BBC itself - through BBC Investments - and BPP, a quoted
financial training company.
But it seems a decision was soon taken that the channel would have more
credibility if it included the other principal UK professional accountancy
bodies, of which there are six. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance
and Accountancy would not take part. The others did: Pounds 250,000 in
shares came from the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, Pounds
100,000 from the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, and Pounds
25,000 each from the chartered accountancy institutes for Scotland and
Ireland.
The original three backers stumped up Pounds 350,000 each, bringing the
total support to Pounds 1.4m - a figure which some say was still
unrealistically low.
Bringing in the extra organisations may have provided extra funding, but it
also helped stoke squabbling. A demonstration tape shown to the backers
annoyed the Certified Accountants because there was no mention of it or its
representatives.
More fundamentally, the associations tried to influence the focus that the
programmes should take. Market research commissioned by the BBC had
suggested that the principal audience would be accountants in industry and
commerce.
But the associations - conscious of their own constituencies - wanted a more
wide-ranging focus which would appeal to their members in public practice.
This was reflected in a fight over the name of the service. The market
research supported those arguing for the name 'Business Account'. The
associations insisted on 'Accountancy Television'.
The BBC had initially offered substantial extra backing in-kind by
advertising the service during normal television hours. It all but withdrew
after an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the
practice of advertising Radio Times on the air when rival listing magazines
had no such option.
This forced ATV - under tight time pressures to meet its launch date - to
spend more than Pounds 300,000 on alternative forms of marketing. This has
made the organisation about three months behind its original business plan.
Meanwhile, a rival company was preparing for action. TEN had been founded by
Robert Clemente, an Australian entrepreneur who had developed a business
selling educational videos to the professions and decided to export the
idea. TEN was already running a service for lawyers. Last summer it launched
the Accountants' Education Channel, a monthly video subscription service. It
had planned to respond to subscribers' reactions and later re-launch the
service, but brought forward this date to coincide with ATV's initial
programmes in November.
The first ATV broadcasts were not without problems. Difficulties with the
encoding technology and viewers' failure to understand how it worked meant
the company had to send out copies of its programmes on video.
Both companies' programmes include a short news bulletin and segments
including interviews on subjects ranging across current financial reporting,
tax and accounting themes. They are accompanied by documents providing
further details.
Experience since has clearly borne out the BBC's market research. Despite
the insistence of the accountancy bodies on marketing and focusing
programmes partly at their members in public practice, nearly all the
subscribers have been from industry and commerce.
Shortly after the launch, ATV proudly announced that more than 11,000 people
had expressed an interest in subscribing. In fact, so far only about 800
have done so. TEN said last month that its accountancy videos had 6,000
viewers. But since it estimates an average of seven to 10 people watch each
one, the number of subscribers is also correspondingly lower.
That still leaves the assessment of how viewers are split between the
different subscription rates. ATV claims the average rate - based on number
of viewers - is significantly higher than expected at Pounds 1,780. TEN says
about three-fifths of its subscribers are for the 'level 1' tapes charged at
Pounds 495 a year, and less than a fifth at the higher-end service at Pounds
1,495.
To boost demand, ATV recently began selecting the bits of the weekly
broadcast programmes which are most relevant to accountants in public
practice, and sending them out as monthly segments on video under the name
'Professional Focus'. It says it now has more than 300 subscribers for the
service.
Using videos mimics the medium chosen by TEN, which, in turn, is just about
to start slicing into ATV's core market by extracting highlights of its
tapes most relevant to accountants in industry and commerce, and sending
them out each month under the label 'Corporate Briefing'.
The message of competition for viewers has not come simply through the
medium, however. An accountant recently wrote to ATV alleging that during a
sales pitch a TEN representative had questioned ATV's financial status and
how long it would continue offering the video service.
That led to an ATV solicitor's letter demanding that TEN dissociate itself
from the comments. TEN says it is not aware that such remarks had been made,
and stresses - as does ATV - that it wants to compete on quality rather than
on remarks against the opposition.
Both companies make great play of the quality of the service they provide,
and stress that customers should choose between them based on their
programmes and supporting material. Yet finances remain a crucial question.
Neither company wants to talk too openly about its performance - arguing
that will only give sensitive information to its rival.
TEN says it expects the accountancy service to be in profit by the end of
its current financial year. Its latest accounts, for the period to December
31 1991 show losses for all operations of Pounds 435,000. The directors'
report stresses that projections until December 1993 show the company may
need additional funding.
ATV's accounts for the first year of operation will not be filed for many
months yet, although it says it hopes to be making a profit by the end of
its next financial year in 1994.
In late March, BPP wrote off its Pounds 350,000 stake, calling the
investment 'a high risk venture whose future must be regarded as uncertain
during this early critical period'. Burying the note in its accounts, the
Certified Accountants did the same with its Pounds 250,000. The other
backers are holding the shares at their original value this year.
Quality is all very well, but - as the accountants on the programmes
produced by both companies might say - they will need to see quality
translated into additional subscriptions before long if they are to survive.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: The prime minister looks for
friends in need - Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has time on its side. Mr John Major does not. That thought
should guide the prime minister's response to last week's electoral
catastrophe. If it does not, his friends fear he will be in trouble.
The contradiction is more apparent than real. The government has at least
three, at a pinch nearly four, years before it must face the electorate. The
catalogue of errors during the past 12 months has come conveniently early in
the parliament. The economic cycle is on the government's side.
It is that perception which has informed the stance of those in his cabinet
 -let us call them the sanguine tendency - who have been urging Mr Major to
sit tight.
He can brush off the Newbury and county council election defeats as
early-term blues, the argument runs. If he sticks to his agenda, economic
recovery (and the mediocrity of the Labour opposition) will rescue him.
But the view from No 10 is decidely different. Mr Major is operating on a
shorter timescale. Before he can face the voters in another general election
the prime minister must satisfy another electorate - the Conservative MPs at
Westminster - that he has a fair chance of winning it.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's brutally frank assessment that the Conservatives are in
a 'dreadful hole' was not merely a reflection of his likeable honesty. It
was an inadvertent admission of real shock at the depths of the electorate's
disenchantment.
His judgment is much closer to the prevailing mood on the backbenches than
that of his colleagues in the sanguine tendency. In a party where panic has
replaced unity as the most powerful reflex there is little inclination to
trust in the healing balm of time.
The lesson being drawn by his friends is that Mr Major has 12 months - until
next year's European elections - to restore his authority. If his party's
fortunes have not improved by then the prime minister will be under serious
threat.
The concern is reinforced by the corrosive influence of another Conservative
tendency - the Militant opponents of the Maastricht treaty.
Operating, like their leftwing antecedents on the Labour benches, as a
party-within-a-party, the 25 to 30 irreconcilable opponents of all things
European have now set as their objective the destruction of Mr Major.
The new Militant has no credible candidate to replace him. But, egged on by
those in the patrician tendency who swear allegiance still to Lady Thatcher,
it will seize on any chance to precipitate a challenge to the prime
minister.
It is this sense of urgency that explains the concern of those around Mr
Major that he should move quickly to replace Mr Norman Lamont.
The prime minister's close political associates believe that Mr Lamont
should be replaced as chancellor by September at the latest. Some would like
Mr Major to make the change as soon as the Whitsun recess at the end of this
month.
They are briefing semi-openly against Mr Lamont not out of malice but in an
attempt both to buttress Mr Major's resolve and to persuade the chancellor
not to make a fuss.
The prime minister's friends are under no illusion that a new face in No 11
will solve his problems. They are convinced that without one there is little
prospect that he will be able to confront the government's most dangerous
weakness: the perception, as prevalent among its supporters as among its
enemies, that it is incompetent.
Mr Major is said to be conscious of the need to restore coherence and, above
all, consistency to the government's agenda. It cannot afford to pick fights
 -as with the miners and teaching unions - it has no chance of winning.
It must choose its ground more carefully. The government's critics are not
alone in wondering why it seems hellbent on privatisation of British Rail,
or why deregulation of London buses is such a priority.
Some of his friends are reminding the prime minister that practical and
pragmatic policies are not by definition an admission of weakness: witness
the relative tranquillity in Scotland secured by a post-Thatcherite policy
of rule by consent.
Mr Major is being urged to devote less attention to the ideological
leftovers of the 1980s and more to policies which emphasise the break with
the past. A credible industrial strategy and high-class public services must
be near the top of his list.
The government cannot avoid harsh decisions in the summer public spending
round. But an enthusiastic assault on the welfare state will not win the
prime minister friends on the Tory backbenches or in the country.
And Mr Major needs friends.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Anger at water sell-off proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELEGATES yesterday left the government in no doubt that they want it to
abandon any idea of transferring the ownership of Scotland's water industry
to the private sector.
Speakers in the opening debate at the Scottish Conservative party conference
in Edinburgh were warmly applauded as they urged ministers to drop outright
privatisation from the options they are considering for the restructuring of
the water industry.
Mr John Young, a former Tory leader of Glasgow district council, said the
government should 'show the red card' to privatisation.
Scottish Office ministers are drawing up a scheme for restructuring the
water industry when local government moves in 1996 from a two tier to a
single tier system under a scheme whose details have yet to be finalised.
The water and sewerage industry needs to be restructured because it is
currently run by the nine regional councils which are to disappear under
local government reform. Ministers want to bring in private capital to fund
Pounds 5bn of improvements, half of it to be spent bringing standards into
line with EC directives, without recourse to public funds.
Tories are acutely aware that the privatisation of water is highly unpopular
with Scots, with 98 per cent opposing it in a recent opinion poll. Ministers
are thought to favour some form of franchising or other ways of bringing in
private capital rather than outright privatisation. Flotation would anyway
be very difficult to achieve within the lifetime of this parliament.
Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish local government minister, denied opposition
claims that the government had decided on privatisation, in his reply to the
local government debate. It would take account of the responses to the
consultation paper. It was examining all the options.
He said nothing in favour of water privatisation. 'Our task is simply to
face up to reality, it is not a question of ideology. Our task is to ensure
the most sensible structure to raise the financial resources available,' he
said.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister heads off revolt on
shipping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY BACKBENCHERS last night shied away from confronting the government over
help to the shipping industry after a Treasury minister agreed to meetings
to discuss the sector's problems, David Owen writes.
The undertaking - by Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury -
persuaded the potential rebels to withdraw a proposed change to the Finance
Bill aimed at giving the shipping industry 100 per cent first-year capital
allowances.
Pressed to a vote by Labour, the proposals were defeated by 279 votes to
244.
Mr Nelson, describing shipping as 'something of a hardy annual in finance
bill debates', promised to listen to the industry's arguments but said it
would be wrong for him to raise hopes that the government would be swayed.
Costing the proposals at between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m a year in terms
of tax revenue forgone, he defended the government's record on shipping,
saying it had enacted measures to help the merchant navy over successive
years.
Spearheading the calls for more government assistance, Sir Giles Shaw, a
member of the powerful executive of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, said the
shipping industry was entering a 'phase of decline' which could be terminal
if action was not taken.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scottish Tories meet in upbeat mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVES gathering in Edinburgh yesterday were more cheerful
than they usually are on the first day of their party conference.
Usually the mood on the first day is nervous and tentative, with delegates
conscious of being an unpopular minority which does badly in elections.
But after last year's general election in which, against all predictions,
the Tories won two seats and slightly increased their share of the vote in
Scotland, there was a feeling that they were no longer an imperilled
species.
They found it difficult to comprehend fully the scale of anxiety sweeping
their party at Westminster after the Newbury by-election and the drubbing
the Tories suffered in the county council elections. There were no local
elections last week in Scotland.
For the first time in years a Conservative administration at the Scottish
Office is not looking beleaguered. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary,
enjoys apparently effortless supremacy over his opponents in the Commons.
The political storms which have shaken the government have largely passed
Scotland by. Scotland has suffered recession, but not nearly as badly as the
south. Its unemployment rate is still 9.6 per cent but, unprecedentedly,
that is lower than in any other region of the UK except East Anglia.
Yet important warnings were delivered to the ministers sitting on the
platform yesterday.
Apart from disquiet over Scottish water, speakers complained about the
imposition of value added tax on home heating bills in the Budget, and on
changes to petroleum revenue tax which are likely to reduce spending on
exploration in the North Sea.
Mr Adrian Shinwell, Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association
president, referred to these criticisms when he said: 'There are certain
policies and proposals which have caused disquiet among our membership, and
as your president I would be failing in my responsibilities if I sought to
deny that or ignore it.'
The VAT increase will particularly affect Scotland because of its cold
climate, while north-east Scotland depends heavily on the North Sea oil
industry.
Mr John Young, a Tory councillor from Glasgow, pointed out that the first 8
per cent tranche of the imposition of VAT would come next year just before
elections for the European parliament, in which there are no Scottish Tory
MPs.
The second tranche would come the following year when elections might be
held for new single-tier councils.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler fires salvo at PM's critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIERCE attack on the sniping at Mr John Major by the country's 'Patrician
Tendency' was launched yesterday by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative
party chairman.
But in speeches to the Scottish Conservative party conference in Edinburgh
both Sir Norman and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, offered implicit
acknowledgements that the government must provide a more coherent framework
for its policies.
Mr Clarke, who earlier this week admitted that the government was in a
'dreadful' hole, called on the Tories to re-assert a political agenda based
on 'common sense, self-discipline and order'.
Those values would ensure that the police and the courts could contain
criminals and protect the public. They would underpin an approach in the
social services and in education which would ensure that people were treated
fairly but which also promoted self-discipline and respect.
In foreign affairs they would guide a strategy designed to promote relations
with the rest of Europe that promoted Britain's self-interest.
Sir Norman, in a move designed to unite the party around the prime
minister's leadership, accused many of his critics of being motivated by
'pure snobbery'.
Referring to a recent newspaper article by Lord Rees-Mogg, he said the
criticisms had 'symbolised everything that brought this country low in the
years before 1979 - class division, prejudice and a wholly blinkered and
outdated view of the world'.
With some Tory MPs questioning the prime minister's style and authority, Sir
Norman told the Scottish activists that Mr Major would lead the fight back
after last week's defeats. Reminding the party that Mr Major had secured the
party its 1992 general election victory against all predictions, he
described him as 'robust, determined and unwavering'.
Sir Norman acknowledged, however, that the message from last week's
elections was that voters expected the government to deliver sustained
economic recovery during the next 12 months.
Its priority, therefore, was 'to make the economic recovery stronger, more
widespread and more visible to all our people'.
Offering a foretaste of one of the central themes of Mr Major's speech to
the conference tomorrow, Sir Norman emphasised the new importance of
manufacturing industry in the government's strategy.
He told the party activists: 'We must be conscious in every decision
government takes of the needs of industry, building on the success of the
measures already taken'.
Today, Mr Lang delivers his keynote address and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, is expected to make a strong defence of government EC policy in
the debate on Europe.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, and Mr John
McGregor, the transport secretary, will speak tomorrow.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht bill abstention set
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S leadership last night decided that the party's MPs should abstain
when the Commons next week reaches the final stage of the Maastricht bill
before it goes to the House of Lords.
Next Thursday's third reading has been deliberately arranged to take place
two days after the second Danish referendum - and will be cancelled by the
government if the Danes vote no.
Labour's decision means that the government should be able win Commons
approval with relative ease.
The official reason for Labour abstaining, in spite of its pro-Europe
stance, is that Britain is still excluded from Maastricht's social chapter.
But it is also the only strategy that has a chance of uniting Labour's pro-
and anti-Maastricht factions.
However, the number of Euro-sceptic Labour MPs who defy the party whip and
vote against the bill is likely to run well into double figures.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour slams 'sneaky' tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SNEAKY' TAX increases such as the freezing of personal allowances and the
limiting to 20 per cent of tax relief on mortgage interest will yield the
Treasury as much as Pounds 2.7bn in 1995/96, Labour said yesterday, David
Owen writes.
As the Finance Bill implementing the spring Budget started its third day in
committee, Mr Nick Brown, a Labour frontbench Treasury spokesman, accused
the government of 'scouring the Treasury files' for ways of raising taxes
without anybody noticing.
Mr Brown argued that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, hoped people would
not notice the tax relief adjustments because mortgage rates had come down.
Labour objected 'very strongly' to the government's enactment of tax changes
that were 'noticeably regressive.'
There was support for Labour's stance from Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal
Democrat Treasury spokesman, who argued that the government's extension of
the 20 per cent band of income tax was not a measure to help the lowest paid
but to raise more revenue.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, retorted that
allowances should not be looked at in isolation from other Budget changes.
The additional burden to be imposed by the Budget package was being 'fairly
shared' right across the income scale.
A Labour amendment clearing the way for personal allowances to be uprated in
line with inflation was defeated by 277 votes to 236, a government majority
of 41.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Review to consider structure of NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ability of the National Health Service management structure to satisfy
the requirements of public accountability are to be examined in a review
announced by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday.
The review, due to be completed by July, will take place at a time when MPs
are raising severely critical questions about mismanagement and mishandling
of public money in parts of the service.
Mrs Bottomley said in February that she was reviewing NHS structure above
local level, to ensure that the internal market introduced by the 1991
reforms was able to work to full effect. Since then, however, highly
publicised financial problems have added to pressure on the health secretary
to widen the scope of the review.
Sir Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive, has faced critical questioning from
the Commons public accounts committee over inadequate management controls in
the West Midlands and Wessex regional health authorities. The committee has
been told that management problems in the West Midlands led to expenditure
of at least Pounds 10m for which little or no value was received, while in
Wessex at least Pounds 20m was wasted. Four people face conspiracy to
defraud charges arising from Wessex computer contracts.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown rules out pact with Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, leader of the Liberal Democrats, yesterday stepped up the
pressure on Labour leaders to accept that their party has little prospect of
winning the next general election on its own.
He again ruled out any formal pact with Labour, and left open the door for
co-operation with the Conservative party should a continuing decline in its
electoral fortunes open the way for a broad-based coalition.
Highlighting the key lesson of the outstanding success achieved by the
Liberal Democrats when Mr David Rendel captured Newbury from the
Conservatives in last week's by-election, he said the results showed that
'we reach the votes that the Labour party cannot reach'.
Responding to questions at a Parliamentary press gallery lunch, he refused
say whether his party would be more likely to support a government led by Mr
John Major for the Conservatives or by Mr John Smith for Labour.
He said that without knowing the political climate before the next general
election it was impossible to make that kind of prediction.
Mr Ashdown warned the Liberal Democrats against 'triumphalism' in the wake
of the successes achieved at Newbury and in the county council elections.
He called on the 'modernisers' in the Labour party to gain the upper hand by
ending its domination by the trade unions through the introduction of one
member, one vote, and securing support for ending the first-past-the-post
electoral system.
He suggested that the need for co-operation between the parties at local
level in councils where no single party had a majority could set a pattern
leading to 'partnership in power' nationally.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, had a foretaste yesterday of the scale of
opposition within his party to electoral reform.
At a private Parliamentary Labour party meeting, MPs were divided over the
conclusions of Labour's internal inquiry into electoral reform under
Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton University.
Mr Smith is expected to say next Wednesday that Labour must back the
principle of change - but will try to unite his party around a pledge that
reforms will depend on winning approval in a national referendum.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers defend bus deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT ministers yesterday launched a spirited defence of their proposals
to deregulate London's bus services - and rejected widespread criticism from
local authorities and London transport that the move will lead to road
congestion and fare rises in the capital.
Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, told the transport
committee that plans for deregulation would proceed in spite of the
criticism, since this was the only way 'to offer the services people want'.
The government intends to introduce the issue into the next parliamentary
session, to bring London into line with bus services outside the capital,
which were deregulated in the mid 1980s.
Nevertheless, responding to criticism that bus deregulation elsewhere had
contributed to road congestion and falling numbers of bus passengers, Mr
Roger Freeman, the transport minister, conceded that some fine-tuning might
be necessary in the future.
Traffic commissioners and Local Authorities could be given greater powers to
prevent over-congestion on profitable routes. At the same time, the level of
funding for 'bus priority measures', such as special bus lanes, would be
raised.
He insisted that 'social reasons', rather than deregulation, had been the
main reason for the falling number of bus passengers in the past.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: NatWest claims curb on job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank has managed to avoid a large number of compulsory
redundancies among its 93,000 employees this year despite its intention to
shed 4,000 jobs, Lord Alexander, the bank's chairman, said yesterday.
Lord Alexander told the Commons employment committee that only 97 staff had
been made compulsorily redundant in the first four months of the year, and
another 221 had accepted voluntary redundancy. Other jobs were being lost
through natural wastage.
He said that the net loss of 15,000 jobs between 1988 and last year had been
caused by a combination of technological change and the sharper than
expected dip into recession.
Lord Alexander said there had been 'negligible' recruitment of
school-leavers in the past three years as the bank tried to combat the surge
in its recruitment in the late 1980s.
The bank disclosed that it anticipated a cut of 25 per cent - from 815m to
602m - in the number of cheques it will clear this year compared to 1988.
Lord Alexander said the switch towards electronic forms of payment was
eliminating jobs.
Mr Leif Mills, general secretary of the Banking, Insurance and Finance
Union, said that NatWest had made 1,500 staff compulsorily redundant last
year, but unions had reached an agreement which would reduce the number this
year.

FT  13 MAY 93 / The swan song of a Tyneside shipyard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TYNESIDE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOWN BY the River Tyne yesterday Swan Hunter workers wisecracked about
renaming one of the Navy frigates they are completing HMS Receivership. But
their hearts were not really in the joke.
In the Commons, Labour MPs were not in a mood for jokes either. They blamed
the government for the possible closure of Swan Hunter after the shipyard's
failure to win a vital defence contract, and spoke of a 'betrayal' of the
workforce by the government. They also jeered at possible measures to help
employment in Tyneside put forward by Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister.
Yesterday Dr David Clark, Labour MP for South Shields and shadow defence
secretary, said the government took the decision knowing that the shrinking
size of the Navy meant four warship yards were no longer needed. 'They've
decided to close Swans down - it makes life easier for them,' he said.
The government's announcement of an enterprise zone and other aid, in the
event of 'substantial' job losses, and silence from Swans' management -
believed to be in crisis talks with its bankers - only deepened Tyneside's
sense of doom.
As workers digested the news that Swans had lost the fight for a helicopter
carrier the 2,000 employees were trying to work normally, but the mood of
pessimism about the shipyard's future was palpable.
There was bewilderment and anger that the company was so dramatically
underbid - by more than Pounds 50m - by its rivals VSEL and Kvaerner Govan.
Mr Eddie Darke, leader of the union campaign to win the order, said: 'It's
like asking for a Ferrari and getting a Lada.'
The unions have called for an inquiry into the tender gap.
But Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, rejected claims there
had been unfair competition between Swan Hunter and VSEL. He said: 'We were
watching out for any unfair subsidy or unfair undercutting; we have to say
we don't believe that was the case.'
But no one questioned the severity of the economic impact that closure of
Swans would have on the area. Estimates put direct and indirect job losses
at 6,000.
Mr Sainsbury's announcement that Newcastle and South Tyneside travel-to-work
areas would retain development area status, even after the review of the
assisted areas map, brought little cheer.
As Mr Stephen Clark, chief executive of South Tyneside council, pointed out,
development area status could hardly be removed from an area that already
has Britain's highest mainland unemployment with 28 per cent of men jobless.
Mr Sainsbury announced a Pounds 2.5m development by English Estates at
Walker Riverside, in East Newcastle, an additional Pounds 2m for the Tyne
and Wear Development Corporation, and a new enterprise zone in an
unspecified location.
Mr Clark said that South Tyneside already needed an enterprise zone to help
it compete against other nearby zones and to cope with the effects of the
mothballing and effective closure last Friday of the Westoe colliery.
Mr Sainsbury's Commons argument about the benefits of moving 'excessive
dependence on the old industries of coal, shipbuilding and steel to a more
diversified economy with vehicles, pharmaceuticals and electronics providing
employment that will last' struck a hollow note.
Dr Clark said: 'How does a working class town of 100,000 people come to
terms with there being no work when the whole culture is based on work?'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Regions give clearest sign yet of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALES, THE west Midlands and south-east England are leading manufacturing
industry's recovery, says the latest regional trends survey from the
Confederation of British Industry and the economic consultancy Business
Strategies.
The survey found that manufacturing output rose in seven of the UK's 11
regions in the four months to April while orders were higher in six of the
regions. Orders rose sharply in Wales and the west Midlands with smaller
rises reported in the south-east, Northern Ireland and north-west England.
Mr Richard Holt, an associate director of Business Strategies, said the
survey was 'the clearest signal yet that the recovery is here'.
Manufacturers in all regions expect increased output and orders in the next
four months.
Companies in the west Midlands are the most optimistic about production
prospects, followed by those in Northern Ireland, East Anglia, the north and
north-west England. Manufacturing output in Yorkshire and Humberside is
expected to rise more slowly than in other areas, while production in the
south-east may be constrained by high stocks of finished goods. Scottish
manufacturers are less optimistic than others about orders in the coming
months.
Mr Holt said the revival in industry's fortunes partly reflected improved
export prospects following the devaluation of sterling since September. But
he said that the recovery was not confined to exporters. While the upturn in
the west Midlands and Wales was largely export led, industry had also
recovered in the south-east and East Anglia, which were less export
dependent.
Business Strategies estimates that manufacturing employment will fall by
30,000 to 4.28m in the current quarter compared with the first three months
of this year and will be 194,000 lower than in the second quarter of last
year. While the current quarter is expected to see a halt to job losses in
the west Midlands, northern England and Northern Ireland, employment levels
in these regions will still be substantially below last year's levels.
Scotland's recovery was likely to be slower than the rest of the UK because
it was later into the recession and investment had slowed in the offshore
oil sector. Mr Holt said the government's pit closure plans could be
contributing to the relatively muted production prospects in Yorkshire and
Humberside.
Companies in Yorkshire and Humberside, as well as in East Anglia, the
south-west, Wales and the west Midlands still plan to increase investment.
But many manufacturers in Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside, as well as in
Northern Ireland, the south-east and north-west England, complained that a
shortage of company-generated finance could limit expansion.
The survey of nearly 1,300 companies between March 26 and April 14 found
increased concern among manufacturers in East Anglia, the west Midlands and
the north-west that political and economic conditions abroad might limit
their ability to win export orders.

FT  13 MAY 93 / DTI aims to sharpen export campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday produced his
expected shake-up of his department's export promotion activities, which
cost the taxpayer Pounds 170m a year.
The main change is the separation of export promotion from trade policy in
the Department of Trade and Industry. Previously, individual civil servants
had responsibility for promoting exports and dealing with trade issues such
as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those tasks will be
separated, with an extra 60 officials assigned to promoting exports.
Mr Heseltine said: 'It has become increasingly clear to me that we have to
sharpen the focus of our export promotion effort and extend its coverage.'
Responsibility for bilateral trade would be brought together in a separate
new division.
A new post of director-general of export promotion has been created. It will
be filled by Mr Ray Mingay, at present the UK consul in Chicago. He will
work with the Foreign Office and up to 100 businessmen seconded from the
private sector to help with export promotion. About 28 have been seconded to
date.
In addition, export strategies are to be drawn up for the UK's top 80 export
markets. At present the list extends only to the top 50.
Export promotion will be split into two divisions, one covering Europe and
the Americas and the other the Asia Pacific region, including the Middle
East and Africa.

FT  13 MAY 93 / CBI seeks block on rise in pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HOWARD DAVIES, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
last night urged the government not to let sterling gain in value and to cut
public spending.
Speaking at the annual dinner of the Institute of Materials in London, Mr
Davies said that UK financial conditions would have to be tightened as
economic recovery gained strength. To achieve this, the government could
either cut expenditure or let the pound rise.
Echoing widespread concern in industry about recent gains in sterling's
value, Mr Davies said allowing a further strengthening of sterling would be
'the wrong response' and would do nothing to correct the UK's large current
account balance-of-payments deficit. Mr Davies also called for a prolonged
period of 'lower interest rates' to stimulate investment.
However, in a separate report published today, the Chartered Institute of
Marketing said that business investment is proving to be one of the
strongest elements in Britain's economic recovery.
It said there were signs that UK business investment would recover to 16 per
cent of gross domestic product by 1995, which would be the third year of
recovery from recession. Following the 1979-81 recession, it took five years
for investment to reach that level.
The marketing institute forecast that by 1995 investment in Britain would
take a larger share of GDP than in the US or the other big European
countries.
However, it would still be well below the 20 per cent figure typical for
Japan or the 30 per cent to 35 per cent investment share of GDP recorded by
economies in south-east Asia.
Mr Douglas McWilliams, the institute's economic adviser, said that economic
recovery in Britain would continue slowly after a quick start. This would
mean a more sustainable recovery than in the 1980s.
But the recent improvement in the level of unemployment would not be
sustained and 'depressingly high unemployment levels' would remain for most
of this decade, he warned.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Heseltine summons industry 'round table': Why the 'knights'
of business are to gather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS OF the demise of the National Economic Development Council, the
tripartite economic policy forum terminated by the government last year, may
have been exaggerated.
A slimmed-down, 1990s version of the council is being launched - with
neither public fanfare nor the involvement of trade unions - later this
month by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
Mr Heseltine has asked 19 top industrialists to a meeting on May 25 to talk
about the economy and the long-term framework for industry. The 'round
table' is expected to meet once or twice a year, backed up by a committee of
representatives from the same companies who will feed Mr Heseltine's
officials with economic data.
Few outside a small circle of officials and business people know about the
gathering, and the guest list has not been broadcast. The DTI says the
meeting will be a private exchange of views, part of the effort by Mr
Heseltine to seek a partnership with business.
Although no one at the DTI is claiming this, many will see the initiative as
part of an attempt by Mr Heseltine to reduce the Treasury's dominance in
economic policymaking. While the Treasury says it welcomes Mr Heseltine's
group, its existence may be construed as threatening the already fragile
power base of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
Many of those invited to the meeting are guarded about what to expect. Mr
Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, said: 'I welcome the
initiative but am still unclear about what it is all about. The government
is doing some useful things to help industry but I worry that it lacks
intellectual drive and seems to be surviving day-to-day.'
Mr Ken Coates, chairman of engineering group Meggitt, said: 'No one expects
the government to do much more than create economic stability and make sure
there is a level playing field between the UK and overseas. But if the
government keeps buggering about as in the last 18 months (over economic
policy and the exit from the European exchange rate mechanism) then life
becomes difficult.'
The analogy between Mr Heseltine's 'round table' and the NEDC is underlined
by the involvement in the new scheme of Mr Walter Eltis, the last director
of the National Economic Development Office who is now Mr Heseltine's
economic adviser. The NEDO, also wound up last year, acted as the
secretariat for the NEDC.
Like the council, Mr Heseltine's gathering is intended to bring together
representatives from the top tier of UK industry. Invited are the chairmen
or top executives of 19 large companies, including Marks and Spencer, Racal
Electronics, Rover, Grand Metropolitan, the Post Office, J. Sainsbury,
National Westminster Bank, International Computers, Mercury Communications
and Barclays Bank.
The Treasury is sending a representative in the shape of Mr Robin
Mountfield, who is in charge of its industry division.
The aims of Mr Heseltine's group are obscure. The DTI is keeping quiet about
any detailed agenda. They will, however, be far less ambitious than those of
the NEDC, which examined different parts of industry in detail.
Mr Heseltine's round table - the 19 'knights' - will spend part of the time
discussing the short-term outlook as Britain struggles to emerge from
recession. This discussion is expected to give Mr Heseltine useful views on
economic fluctuations to supplement data from the Treasury and other
sources.
The first meeting will discuss a report drawn up from a parallel group of
representatives from the same 19 companies - the 'scouts' - which met for
the first time last month and will focus on the economy.
The scouts, mainly at the level of finance director or senior economist, are
likely to meet every four months. At their first gathering they discussed
the signs of fragile upturn, drawing on indicators from their companies to
either support or depress hopes that recovery will be sustained.
A strong conclusion from last month's meeting was the risk that recovery
could be blown off-course by the serious slowdown in continental Europe. The
scouts also agreed to send to Mr Eltis, as often as every month,
confidential sales data which might give extra clues about the nature of the
recovery.
The knights are also expected to discuss longer-term questions about how the
government can best lay the ground for industrial prosperity. This fits in
with Mr Heseltine's plans to change Whitehall's culture to fit in with
business thinking. He sees himself as a 'friend in court' to industry
leaders, providing a helping hand rather than producing grandiose plans
involving dollops of state intervention.
One item on the agenda later this month may be the report drawn up by Mr
Heseltine's officials detailing how much of UK industry is lagging in
management and technology behind industrial rivals. The trade and industry
secretary is concerned that Britain, in spite of some progress in the 1980s,
lies 18th in the 24-nation OECD league of competitiveness.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Formula for council funding attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMBRIDGE is more deprived than Hartlepool, if the government's assessment
of councils' spending needs is to be believed.
As a result the government pays Cambridge council more funds per head. This
is one of the most striking anomalies highlighted by the Audit Commission in
a report on standard spending assessments (SSAs) published today.
One of the effects, the commission says, is that 'neither central nor local
government accepts responsibility for decisions on particular services'.
Local authorities will have different SSAs according to their level of
deprivation. This is decided by a formula derived from the All Ages Social
Index, which takes into account how much various social factors (illustrated
in the graph) differ from the national average.
This is done in the interests of fairness. However, 'the complexity of the
formula hides underlying key political choices, obscuring decisions and who
makes them'.
The formula does not include economic factors such as the level of
unemployment in an area, because these factors do not impose direct spending
obligations on local authorities. The formula does, however, include social
and demographic factors that could increase spending because of deprivation.
These factors include the proportion of single-parent families and people
sharing accommodation, and the proportion of people with household heads
born in the New Commonwealth and Pakistan - this is, controversially, held
to be a sign of deprivation.
Cambridge's large number of students sharing accommodation and the low
proportion of immigrants in Hartlepool combine to produce the surprising
result that the north-eastern town is deemed to be less deprived.
The commission suggests that SSAs will need to be reformed but does not
support any particular alternative. It says the pressures on SSAs have
increased since they were introduced, because of four factors:
The 'gearing' effect of SSAs has increased because the proportion of local
authority expenditure coming from central government has increased from
about half to the current level of more than 80 per cent. This means that
small proportionate changes in SSAs have a bigger effect on local government
spending than they did before.
SSAs are now used by the government for 'capping' local authority budgets,
or limiting their expenditure, which increases their impact on a council's
spending decisions.
Pressure is growing for councils to set spending on each service according
to the SSA for that service. The government projects how much will be
earmarked for different services, but at present no restrictions are placed
on how councils apportion the total amount of money paid to them.
The Citizen's Charter intends using SSAs to compare the performance of
different councils.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Squabble delays training revamp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OVERHAUL of the education and training of young people, which would
result in all 16-to-19-year-olds working towards a recognised qualification,
is being delayed by a squabble between government departments, the Training
and Enterprise Councils said yesterday, Diane Summers writes.
Tec leaders said that they had expected Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment
secretary, to publish a white paper on the issue this spring.
A working party - drawn from Tecs, the Department for Education, the
Employment Department and the Further Education Funding Council, submitted a
report to Mrs Shephard towards the end of last year, at her request.
The Engineering Employers' Federation yesterday urged a narrowing of the gap
between academic and vocational training, suggesting a new national
qualification that would be awarded to those who achieved three Level 3
National Vocational Qualifications, or three A-levels, or equivalent units
of AS examinations and/or vocational qualifications.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Pleas grow for late-bill interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAMBERS OF commerce yesterday added their voice to the lobby which is
calling for the government to give businesses a statutory right to interest
on unpaid bills.
This formed part of a package of measures intended to change the payment
culture of business announced by the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce at its annual conference in Leeds.
Mr Richard Brown, the chambers' policy director, said: 'The stubbornness and
complexity of the problem of late payment clearly indicate there is no
single simple solution. Every effort to tackle the problem must focus on
changing the payment culture.
'Consultation within the chamber of commerce movement has revealed that the
voluntary process of exhortation is not working.'
The chambers called for:
The compilation of 'white lists' of good payers which would be kept for
inspection in local chambers.
The extension of the requirement for large companies to disclose their
payment practices in their annual reports to cover all public limited
companies.
An investigation by the Lord Chancellor's department of the German system of
warnings to late payers which uses standard reminder forms and avoids full
court proceedings.
The requirement for sub-contractors on government contracts to pay their
suppliers within 30 days. At present only main contractors are expected to
do this. The 30-day requirement to be extended to contractors and
sub-contractors working for local authorities.
More funds for late payment advice 'hotlines', which should be developed
into a payment arbitration service.
The government has refused to introduce a statutory right to interest on
late payments, saying it would create more red tape.
For many years it relied on exhorting companies to pay on time but over the
past two years has funded pilot 'help-lines,' introduced a requirement -
still to be implemented - for large companies to report their payment
record, and simplified county court procedures for claiming debts.
The lobbying campaign for a statutory right to interest has been headed by
the Forum of Private Business, which has been joined by Intrum Justitia, a
debt collection company, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business information group.
Recently support has come from two clearing banks, National Westminster and
Midland.

FT  13 MAY 93 / 1,000 Lloyd's Names face Pounds 300,000 call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 1,000 Names could eventually be asked to pay an average of up to
Pounds 300,000 each because of far heavier-than-expected losses from the
storms, explosions and oil spills that hit Lloyd's underwriters in the late
1980s.
Many of the Names - the individuals whose assets back the insurance market -
already face financial ruin.
The Names were members of Rose Thomson Young syndicate 255, one of the
leading underwriters of catastrophe reinsurance business in the late 1980s.
Even before yesterday's projections the syndicate was known to face some of
the worst losses at the insurance market and was one of nine syndicates
whose losses have been subjected to independent investigation by Lloyd's.
A report to be published this week on syndicate 255 concludes that there
were 'errors of judgment' and the lack of 'a full appreciation of the
market' in which it was operating. The report, prepared by Mr Timothy
Boatman, of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says there was no malpractice.
Syndicate 255 closed at the end of 1991 and RTY appointed new managers last
year. Following an extensive examination the new team reported yesterday
that cumulative losses between 1988 and 1990 would be at least Pounds
145.7m, Pounds 60m worse than feared. These losses could eventually rise to
a maximum of Pounds 362m. By contrast, the syndicate's capacity (capital
base) amounted to Pounds 27.9m in 1988, Pounds 34.14m in 1989 and Pounds
13.06m in 1990.
Names, who have already been asked to pay more than Pounds 130m, will face
an additional cash call of 62 per cent (Pounds 6,200 for each Pounds 10,000
traded) for 1989 and 136 per cent for 1990 in July. Further cash calls of 19
per cent for 1988, 66 per cent for 1989 and 12 per cent for 1990 will follow
in January next year.
Names who have been unable to fund cash calls to date will be asked for more
to cover exchange losses and interest charges (17 per cent for 1988 and 50
per cent for 1989). Mr Vernon Ashford, RTY finance director, said: 'We are
not expecting the Names that do pay claims to subsidise those who do not.'
Mr Stephen Edwards, underwriter, said the syndicate had been forced to
create additional reserves because some reinsurance policies had been
exhausted or proved to be deficient.
In addition, claims from the European hurricane of 1987, three large
petrochemical explosions and hurricane Hugo in 1989 had been heavier than
expected.
Claims from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 could also be higher because
Exxon is seeking to recover a further Dollars 700m (Pounds 446m) under
policies reinsured at Lloyd's.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Conviction rate of SFO rises to 71%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONVICTION rate of the Serious Fraud Office rose to 71 per cent of cases
brought last year, it was announced yesterday.
Mr George Staple, the SFO's director, said when introducing its annual
report that in spite of 'unbalanced' media reporting 1992-93 had been a good
year for the department, which was dealing effectively with fraud that
previously went uninvestigated and unprosecuted.
The rise in the conviction rate from 66 per cent in 1991-92 had been
accompanied by an increase in the number of guilty pleas by suspects. More
than 40 per cent of defendants pleaded guilty to offences last year compared
with about 33 per cent in 1991-92.
Mr Staple said the increase in guilty pleas not only saved court time and
expense, but demonstrated that the SFO's 'Section 2' powers, which remove a
suspects' right to silence when being interviewed, were proving effective.
'We are able to use these powers to demonstrate to defendants that the game
is up and this is leading to pleas of guilty,' he said.
In an an unusual move for a government body the SFO criticises media
coverage of itself as 'unbalanced' because of its concentration on a few
high-profile cases.
The office lists all but four of its 57 current cases - including those at
their early, and most sensitive, investigation stages.
Companies under investigation in such cases, include: the Baron Group
(allegations of obtaining property by deception), Durnford Ford (alleged
shortfall in client account of a firm of solicitors), European Leisure PLC
(share dealing), Landhurst Leasing PLC (allegations that it misrepresented
the adequacy of security in relation to sums borrowed), Letap
Pharmaceuticals Ltd (allegations of fraudulent trading), London United
Investments PLC (alleged offences concerning insurance and reinsurance), MTM
(allegations of falsely inflated profits), Norton Group (regarding
acquisitions by the company), Payroll Services Ltd (allegations of
misappropriation of client funds) and Richmond Oil and Gas (allegations
relating to share deals).
The report repeats the SFO's calls for a formal system of plea-bargaining to
be introduced as the single most effective way of shortening complex fraud
cases.
'A system could be introduced which would encourage guilty defendants to
enter pleas, while at the same time protecting them from improper pressure
to do so,' he said.
SFO's budget rose from Pounds 17.7m in 1991-92 to Pounds 21m last year
largely because of the high costs of the Robert Maxwell and Bank of Credit
and Commerce International affairs.

BRITISH Nuclear Fuels yesterday announced plans to cut 270 jobs. The
announcement follows the splitting of the site at Capenhurst, Cheshire, into
two separate companies - with Urenco continuing uranium enrichment while BNF
decommissions old plant on the site.
The 570 BNF workers on the site will have less to do as the decommissioning
work progresses, and the company says it aims to cut the workforce to 300 by

MR ARTHUR Scargill, the president of the National Union of Mineworkers,
plans to visit the picket line outside the Timex factory in Dundee on Monday
to show his solidarity with workers who have been on strike there for three
months, Robert Taylor writes.
But his plan will be criticised tomorrow by Mr Bill Jordan, president of the
AEEU engineering union. He regards it as an unwelcome interference in a
difficult and lawful dispute that does not involve any of Mr Scargill's
members and one which will do nothing to produce a settlement.

FT  13 MAY 93 / City police revise guidance on bombs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES IN the City must prepare for the constant threat of bombings such
as those at St Mary Axe a year ago and Bishopsgate last month, City of
London police told security and building managers at a meeting on
contingency planning last night.
Chief Inspector Peter Moore said that the scale of the attacks had changed
the rules for dealing with bombs.
Police no longer recommend evacuating a building in any alert. With acres of
glass poised to fall the street was not necessarily the safest place.
Internal evacuation to a building's core or basement should be considered.
Businesses should liaise over their plans, added Mr Moore. One security
manager said such an exercise in his part of London showed every company
planned to assemble staff in Embankment Gardens - 30,000 people in one small
park.
The police also suggested setting up second locations for all businesses,
fitting shatter-proof film to glass and storing security video tapes.
The possibility of a pager system to alert all City companies to a threat
simultaneously was being considered, he said.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Unions back Labour links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of six of Britain's largest trade unions stressed yesterday that
they want to avoid any confrontation with Labour leader Mr John Smith at
this autumn's party conference over the issue of union-party links.
They met yesterday in an attempt to hammer out an agreement on principles
for the relationship between the unions and the Labour party. The leaders
represent the Transport and General Workers, the GMB general union, the
Public Employees, MSF the technicians union, UCW the communications union
and RMT, the main rail union.
The union leaders do not accept one member, one vote for the selection of
Labour parliamentary candidates. They are meeting again next week to try to
find an alternative.
All agreed to back a demand by Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU's general secretary,
for the publication of a joint union statement emphasising why the union
links are essential for the Labour party.
Other union leaders, however, are concerned about a draft of the proposed
statement Mr Morris wants to have approved at today's executive meeting of
Trade Unionists for Labour (TUFL), the party's trade union funding body.
The draft statement says 'Labour's individual membership is small' and those
that belong to the party are 'unrepresentative of Labour voters as a whole'.
The draft says it is 'the affiliated unions that give the party a much
broader, more representative base and a wider appeal among electors'.
The number of women joining unions in Britain rose last year as union
membership fell to less than a third of the employed workforce, statistics
published yesterday in the Employment Gazette show.
In 1992 female union membership rose by 20,000, taking it to 3.7m. Male
membership fell 382,000 to 5.8m.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Administrators call on Nadir to help strike deal on assets:
Stalled efforts to sell Polly Peck businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck yesterday called on Mr Asil Nadir to
co-operate with their efforts to realise assets for creditors and
shareholders of the group.
Mr Richard Stone, one of the joint administrators from accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, said: 'We would hope that he would facilitate negotiations
currently under way to ensure a good deal goes through. Before Mr Nadir can
ever regain his credibility he has got to give some pretty good
explanations. We have been waiting three years for those.'
His comments came as negotiations continued for the stalled sales of Polly
Peck's Cyprus and Turkish assets. The plan is to concentrate their marketing
efforts on Turks and Turkish Cypriots in the region and in the UK and US.
Discussions with the northern Cypriot finance minister were well advanced
for permission to sell the businesses, before they were put on hold by Mr
Nadir's decision to break his bail conditions and leave the UK. The book
value of the local assets has been put at about Dollars 40m (Pounds 25.9m).
But disputes over ownership and control are likely to frustrate sales at
least in the short-term.
A brochure distributed before PPI entered administration in October 1990
from Nadir Sirkeler Grubu - the Nadir Group of companies - shows properties,
including the Nicosia print works of AN Graphics, in which Mr Nadir is the
75 per cent shareholder, and the Olive Tree Holiday Village company, owned
by Mrs Bilge Nevsat, Mr Nadir's sister. There are three hotels and the
Sunzest fruit business, which records show are all owned by PPI through
Voyager UK.
But in the self-declared state of northern Cyprus, only recognised by
Turkey, PPI is not registered as a company. Only the group's logo is
authorised - by the local trademark office.
PPI's accounts list three subsidiaries in Cyprus: Sunzest Trading, Unipac
Packaging Industries, the cardboard box plant in the Famagusta freeport, and
Voyager Kibris, the hotel holding company.
But records of incorporation at the finance ministry show Voyager Kibris is
owned 99 per cent owned by Voyager Mediterranean, a mainland Turkish
company.
Sunzest is owned 99 per cent by Unipac, while Unipac is owned by PPI through
Voyager Ltd, an intermediary company on the Isle of Man. The administrators
have also laid claim to ICP, owned by Inter Channel Pharmaceuticals,
believed to be held through Jersey.
Mr Nadir has said publicly that the companies are owned by PPI. But the
company's lawyers have obstructed all efforts by the administrators to gain
control of the assets through a series of court injunctions.
As a result the administrators have not been able to change the board of
directors, a first step before any decision can be made on disposal. The
authorities have also not registered the companies in PPI's name. Mr Nadir
is still a director of the northern Cyprus companies.
The only PPI asset in new hands, the Kyrenia View Hotel, was requisitioned
by the government in lieu of social security payments owed by the Nadir
companies. It was subsequently sold to the Turkish Metal Workers Union as a
recreation centre.
Because of PPI's failure to pay about TL35bn to TL40bn (Pounds 2.28m-Pounds
2.61m) in debts, the government has placed a general lien on all the PPI and
Nadir assets. Local bankers say even with the injunctions lifted, it will
not be easy to be find a buyer, given the likely Greek claims if there is a
settlement of the island dispute.
The fruit business is dependent on orchards which once belonged to Greek
families. Three of the four PPI hotels are former Greek properties, leased
under 49-year arrangements from the government. The leases are not
transferable without government permission.
One banker in Nicosia said: 'The perspective in Cyprus is that he was making
his money in London and bringing it to Cyprus, while the City always assumed
he was making huge sums in Cyprus and bringing it to London.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / 4,000 coal managers' jobs at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO two thirds of the 6,000 core management and clerical jobs at British
Coal could go under proposals put forward by a consultancy. The number of
regional headquarters may be cut from five to two or three, and their power
reduced.
The proposals, prepared by Resource Decision Systems and circulated to
senior corporation management, suggest more integration between the deep
mine and opencast operations. The report explores the possibilities for
contracting out some operations to the private sector before privatisation.
Information technology is thought to be a likely target.
British Coal ordered the report after its announcement last October to close
31 of its 50 pits. Although 12 have since been reprieved, few are thought to
have a long future.
British Coal wants to cut about half of its 'above ground' administration
costs. This suggests a more radical programme than that envisaged by Ernst &amp;
Young, the consultancy which earlier this year prepared a similar report on
instructions from the government during the energy review. This said that at
least Pounds 74m could be cut from British Coal's Pounds 268m administrative
expenditure.
British Coal yesterday refused to comment in detail on the report beyond
saying that it was not complete and was still subject to discussion.
One topic under consideration is the degree to which management
responsibility should be devolved from the national headquarters to the
pits. The report suggests the role of the middle tier of management, the
regional headquarters, could be redefined to give pit managers more
authority and accountability. This may be more practical in an organisation
of about 30 pits than it was in one with 950, as the National Coal Board was
in 1948.
John T Boyd, the US consultancy, said in a report for the government last
year that colliery managers were not given enough freedom to manage.
The report by RDS, part of the LEK partnership, suggests regional
headquarters in Yorkshire and in Nottinghamshire.

BRITAIN'S Chambers of Commerce yesterday added their voice to the lobby
calling for the government to give businesses a statutory right to interest
on unpaid bills, Charles Batchelor writes.
This formed part of a package of measures intended to change the payment
culture of British business announced by the Association of British Chambers
of Commerce at its annual conference in Leeds.
Mr Richard Brown, the chambers' policy director, said: 'Every effort to
tackle the problem must focus on changing the payment culture. Consultation
within the chamber of commerce movement has revealed that the voluntary
process of exhortation is not working.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Row delays training revamp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OVERHAUL of the education and training of young people, which would
result in all 16-to-19-year-olds working towards a recognised qualification,
is being delayed by a squabble between government departments, the Training
and Enterprise Councils claimed yesterday.
Tec leaders said they had expected Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment
secretary, to publish a white paper on the issue this spring. A working
party - drawn from Tecs, the Department for Education, the Employment
Department and the Further Education Funding Council - submitted a report to
Mrs Shephard, at her request, towards the end of last year.
The working party recommended that by the year 2000 all people up to the age
of 19 should be taking take part in an activity leading to a recognised
qualification. The report called for a strengthened careers guidance service
and a common system of funding for academic, vocational and job-specific
training.
It is understood that the education department favours the proposed reforms
but the Department of Social Security may have objected to a transfer of
funds from its budget to those of other government departments in order to
cover the scheme.
The Engineering Employers' Federation yesterday urged a narrowing of the gap
between academic and vocational training. It put forward a planto the
government for a new national qualification awarded to those who achieved
three Level 3 National Vocational Qualifications, or three A-Levels, or
equivalent units of AS examinations and/or vocational qualifications.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Competition policy is 'vague and misdirected'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OBJECTIVES of UK competition policy are 'vague and misdirected' and the
inquiry process is 'laborious and secretive', a report by the London
Business School says, Robert Rice writes.
The report, based on a study by Professor Kim Warren of recent Monopoly and
Mergers Commission inquiries into petrol, beer, soft drinks and coffee,
questions the analytical standards and balance applied to information
collected by inquiries.
Prof Warren says that problems with competition inquiries result from
reliance on simplistic ideas of how the competitive process works.
MMC investigations assume that competition invariably benefits consumers. In
reality, he says, the competitive process can itself destroy the rivalry on
which consumers' ability to choose depends. Policy aimed at consumers'
interests must go beyond issues of price and address availability, quality,
choice and service.

MR ARTHUR Scargill, the president of the National Union of Mineworkers,
plans to visit the picket line outside the Timex factory in Dundee on Monday

But his plan will be criticised tomorrow by Mr Bill Jordan, president of the

Some members of the local Timex strike committee are also known to be

Mr Jordan will visit the Timex picket line tomorrow for the first time.
Throughout the dispute, which started in February when Timex sacked all its
manual workers for refusing to accept reduced terms and conditions as well
as a pay cut, the AEEU has sought successfully to stay strictly within the
law.
Mr Gavin Laird, the union's general secretary, warned strikers individually
that they could be dismissed from union membership if they behaved
unlawfully.

THE LEADERS of six of Britain's largest trade unions stressed yesterday that
they want to avoid any confrontation with Labour leader Mr John Smith at
this autumn's party conference over the issue of union-party links.
The union leaders, who met yesterday to try to hammer out an agreement on
principles for the future relationship between the unions and the Labour

the Public Employees, MSF the technicians union, UCW the communications
union and RMT, the main rail union.
The union leaders do not accept one member one vote for the selection of

All agreed to back a demand by Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU's general secretary,

constituency parties and affiliated associations emphasising why the union
links are essential for the Labour party.
Other union leaders, however, are concerned about a draft of the proposed
statement Mr Morris wants to have approved at today's executive meeting of
Trade Unionists for Labour (TUFL), the party's trade union funding body.
The draft statement says 'Labour's individual membership is small' and those

The statement says it is 'the affiliated unions that give the party a much
broader, more representative base and a wider appeal among electors'.
It says that trade unions are popular, adding: 'It would be foolish to
alienate and lose this base support in the quest for floating voters.'
The statement adds: 'When the media, other parties, business interests and
the establishment have tried to kill off the Labour party the trade unions
have provided the stability which helped us survive.'
One senior union source said of the statement: 'It is unhelpful to Mr John
Smith and potentially divisive.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Clark 'overturned' Iraqi sales advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILITARY ADVISERS working on the vetting of export licences to Iraq were
told by the chairman of their committee at the start of 1990 that Mr Alan
Clark, then the minister for defence procurement, was 'gung-ho' on defence
sales and did not necessarily accept their advice on security, the Scott
inquiry heard yesterday.
Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Glazebrook, a retired army officer who was a
member of a Ministry of Defence working group which vetted export licences,
said that Mr Clark had overturned the working group's decision not to
recommend a licence for Iraq for a computer-based automatic vehicle locating
system manufactured by Terrafix, a company based in Stoke-on-Trent.
The Terrafix system was one of three sensitive applications that were being
discussed and was turned down initially by the working group in February,
1990, just months before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Lt-Col Glazebrook said: 'We believed we had good reasons to turn all three
down.'
Later Mr Barrett reported that the minister had upheld two of the refusals
but that the advice on the third, the Terrafix system, had been overturned.
Lt-Col Glazebrook said that in another case officials from the government's
defence export sales department tried in April 1990 to overturn a
recommendation not to export sophisticated radar jamming equipment, S500,
made by Plessey.
Plessey's supporters said the system would be used for training purposes.
Lt-Col Glazebrook disagreed.
'I turned to the company's own brochure and it was clear that the the
company listed the system's training capability as the 'last of its
attributes',' he said.' We had given our decision but this appeal was coming
back again and again, wearing us down.'
Lt-Col Glazebrook remarked that after the invasion of Kuwait a Royal Signals
officer, when he heard that the Iraqis had acquired an earlier version of
the Plessey radar jamming equipment, said to him: 'Oh, bloody hell. We've
got nothing to touch that.' The hearings continue next week.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Fears over inflation surface again in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US producer prices rose 0.6 per cent between March and April, reigniting
fears that inflationary pressures are growing in the US economy in spite of
sluggish growth of output and jobs, official figures indicated yesterday.
The rise in wholesale prices - three times the consensus forecast on Wall
Street - prompted a sharp retreat of bond prices as traders discounted
lingering hopes that the Federal Reserve might respond to signs of flagging
growth with another cut in short-term interest rates. An early tightening of
monetary policy, however, remains highly improbable.
A surge in vegetable prices following severe winter storms accounted for
much of the increase in producer prices: the food price index rose 1.4 per
cent between March and April.
However, the 'core' producer price index, which excludes volatile food and
energy prices, rose 0.4 per cent last month, a larger increase than
expected.
Producer prices have risen more than expected for three months in a row. The
increase relative to April last year was only 2.4 per cent but the
annualised rate of increase for the last four months is 4.7 per cent against
1.6 per cent in all of last year.
Consumer prices and various indices of commodity prices have also risen
faster than expected, prompting sporadic concern about inflation trends in
markets.
Most economists believe recent price figures have been distorted. The
relatively sluggish domestic US recovery coupled with weak labour markets
and recession in many overseas markets is expected to keep inflationary
pressures in check this year and next.
However, the unexpectedly poor price figures have undermined the bond market
rally earlier this year by hinting that consumer price increases of 3 per
cent last year marked the low point of inflation in this business cycle.
Hopes that inflation might continue to decline to about 2 per cent,
justifying much lower long-term bond yields, have largely evaporated.
With the inflation trend still uncertain, the markets are anxiously awaiting
the release of consumer prices figures out today.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Puerto Ricans speak out against Clinton tax plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUERTO RICO'S government has attacked tax changes proposed by US President
Bill Clinton which it says will damage the island's economy.
The US administration has proposed that section 936 of the internal revenue
code, which has led many companies to set up factories on the island, be
changed as part of efforts to cut the federal deficit.
The administration of the US Caribbean possession, which had earlier
appeared willing to consider Mr Clinton's proposals, began signalling a
policy switch last week amid mounting fears of economic dislocation
resulting from the changes, which could lead to disinvestment and increased
social and political problems.
'Puerto Rico stands to lose 30,000 jobs if the Clinton proposal is
implemented,' said Mr Baltazar Corrada del Rio, the island's secretary of
state. 'This means that unemployment, now 18 per cent, will increase to 21
per cent.'
The Puerto Rican government has begun seeking the support of Caribbean
neighbours to argue in Washington against changes to the revenue code; it
claims Mr Clinton's proposals will affect a programme under which Puerto
Rico has pledged to lend Caribbean countries about Dollars 100m (Pounds
64.9m) a year.
Section 936 of the US tax code allows federal tax exemption to Puerto Rican
subsidiaries of US companies. Profits from these subsidiaries are deposited
in Puerto Rican banks. The deposits, totalling about Dollars 15bn, are
central to the island's financial stability.
US government officials say section 936 costs the Treasury Dollars
2bn-Dollars 3bn a year. Mr Clinton is proposing to change the tax break to a
60 per cent wage credit, in an attempt to raise Dollars 7bn for the Treasury
over five years.
'All this means is that there will be more dependence on federal aid, such
as food stamps, and more pressure for migration to the mainland. The Clinton
proposal for Puerto Rico is the reverse of his policy for the rest of the
US,' Mr Corrada del Rio said.
Puerto Rico's neighbours will be quick to argue against the Clinton plan.
Previous administrations on the island have committed Dollars 100m a year of
the section 936 deposits for low-interest loans for business projects in
Caribbean Basin countries. Since 1985, neighbours have received Dollars 650m
in loans under the scheme.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Cezanne still life animates market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dollars 28.6m (Pounds 18.6m) paid for a Paul Cezanne still life of
apples at Sotheby's in New York on Tuesday night suggests confidence has
returned at the highest levels of the art market, writes Antony Thorncroft.
It was the first time in three years that any work of art had topped the
Dollars 20m mark at auction. Prices are still well below the peaks of May
1990, when a Van Gogh portrait sold for Dollars 82.5m, but the sale proved
that even in a nervous market good pictures can do well.
Painted around 1890, Cezanne's 'Nature morte: les grosses pommes' has a
celebrated history. It was included in the landmark sale of the Jakob
Goldsmidt collection in 1958 when it sold for Dollars 252,000 to the
Embiricos shipping family: it was the success of this auction that
established salerooms as the leading traders in art works.
The price paid on Tuesday was a record for Cezanne and far in excess of
Sotheby's cautious Dollars 15m estimate. The buyer remains anonymous, but
possibly a big collector has entered the field. In all, the 56 works of
impressionist art on offer fetched Dollars 75.9m, with 12 per cent unsold by
value.
The other important lot on offer, 'Fatma, La Mulatresse', which is a large
portrait of a young girl painted by Henri Matisse in 1912, also did well in
selling for Dollars 14.3m. It is not such a 'chocolate box' painting as the
Matisse which set a record Dollars 14.5m for the artist last November, but
obviously it appealed to a connoisseur.
Twenty of the 56 lots in the auction failed to sell, suggesting that serious
 -and rich - collectors are prepared to bid for masterworks but that the
secondary market, below Dollars 1m, is still weak.
A dazzling Renoir - 'Femme dans un jardin' - almost doubled its estimate at
Dollars 6.7m and one of Braque's eight views of his studio, painted in the
early 1950s, went to a European dealer for a modest Dollars 3.85m. A Monet -
'La Debacle' - depicting the Seine in winter, also sold at the bottom of its
estimate for Dollars 2.2m.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Bringing the patient to market: The progress of US health
care reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS meant to arrive in the first 100 days. Then it was delayed to the
middle of this month. The latest word is that President Bill Clinton's
health care reform plan will be sent to Capitol Hill in mid-June. But few
Washington insiders would be surprised by further delay.
The plan is supposedly being held back to avoid a legislative logjam. The
White House is reluctant to unveil the biggest upheaval in domestic policy
since President Lyndon Johnson's 'Great Society' of the 1960s while
sceptical congressional committees are fully occupied analysing (and
frequently amending) the fine print of the Clinton economic plan.
But the delays also reflect the monumental complexity and political
sensitivity of the challenge confronting Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr
Ira Magaziner, the workaholic White House aide who has emerged as the true
intellectual leader of her 500-strong task force. Tall and frizzy haired, Mr
Magaziner looks and sounds like a madcap inventor. But for his personal
friendship with the Clintons, he would still be an obscure Rhode Island
management consultant.
Instead he is playing the leading role in reshaping an industry that
accounts for nearly 14 per cent of US gross domestic product and that
touches the lives of every family and business in the nation. His historic
task is not merely to produce an economically coherent reform but one that
can survive an onslaught from dozens of powerful interest groups, including
doctors and the private insurance industry.
By all accounts the going is heavy. The goals are clear enough: to reduce
the growth of healthcare costs, which threaten to bankrupt both state and
federal government, and to guarantee a basic package of benefits for all
Americans, which means extending cover to the 35m people (15 per cent of the
population) who lack health insurance.
But the means to these ends remain uncertain. Since the final stages of the
election campaign last year, Mr Clinton has professed support for a reform
known as 'managed competition'.
The idea is to enroll people (including the currently uninsured population)
in regional intermediaries known as health insurance purchasing
co-operatives. These would buy care on behalf of individuals and companies
from competing networks of private sector physicians, hospitals and
insurance companies.
The theory is that their market clout would enable them to exert much
greater downward pressure on costs, while maintaining quality, than is
possible in today's fragmented health care market.
This still appears to be the general route favoured by the task force,
although it is chary of the language of managed competition, which was
invented by right-of-centre economists. Senior officials talk of 'health
alliances' rather than purchasing co-operatives and emphasise guaranteed
access to care via new 'health insurance' cards rather than market
discipline.
They also claim the reforms would not restrict individuals' choice of
doctors even though most systems of managed care, such as pre-paid Health
Maintenance Organisations (HMOs), achieve cost savings partly by limiting
patient choice.
But the managed competition framework (whatever it may be called) leaves a
host of questions unanswered. How much flexibility will be left to
individual states, some of which favour different types of reform? How will
the cost, which could exceed Dollars 100bn a year, be financed?
What will be included in the guaranteed package of minimum benefits? Will it
embrace expensive new items such as mental health benefits and long-term
community and nursing home care? Mr Clinton will face a political storm if
he includes abortion, yet if he excludes it many women's access to it could
be restricted.
How much of the health care market will be subsumed in the new system? It
seems certain to absorb Medicaid, the existing publicly funded regime for
the poor. But there is controversy about Medicare, the system that covers
35m elderly Americans. The administration says nobody will be forced out of
Medicare, yet it clearly wants to encourage a switch into managed
competition because the elderly account for a disproportionate fraction of
health care spending.
And what about big companies? If they too stay outside the proposed health
alliances, the new system might end up little different from the status quo.
Equally controversial is the way that cash will be channelled from companies
and individuals to the purchasing co-operatives. The task force is
considering replacing current premiums with what amounts to a payroll tax on
employers and employees. This offers great administrative simplicity and a
promising way of capping spending.
With a payroll tax, the money available to purchasing co-operatives for
buying the minimum package of benefits could not grow faster than corporate
incomes unless the tax rate were raised. However, a payroll tax would be
vigorously opposed by Republicans and many conservative Democrats as a
job-destroying step towards Canadian 'socialised' medicine.
Mr Clinton's dilemma is that root-and-branch reforms offering the greatest
savings are the least likely to win broad congressional support. Thus while
the chances of reform being enacted next year are good, the fundamental
problems may not be adequately addressed during Mr Clinton's first term.

FT  13 MAY 93 / California grabs insurance nettle: A novel scheme could
solve the problem of non-payment of car insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE in every four Californian drivers does not have car insurance; in some
inner-city areas the figure rises to four out of every five. The 'average'
Californian motor policy costs about Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 649) a year, yet
only half the premiums collected are paid out in claims.
For years the problems of the Californian car insurance industry have held
the attention of politicians, lawyers, the industry and consumer groups.
Now, however, an ingenious but surprisingly simple solution - called
'pay-at-the-pump' insurance - has become a serious political proposition.
Legislation to introduce a pay-at-the-pump scheme is grinding through the
state legislature in Sacramento after being introduced by Mr Art Torres, a
Democrat senator from Los Angeles. It has the backing of Mr John Garamendi,
California's politically-ambitious insurance commissioner.
Even if the Torres legislation fails, the idea may be put to the Californian
electorate more directly. Mr Andrew Tobias, a Harvard-educated economic
commentator whose book 'Auto Insurance Alert' was the genesis for the Torres
initiative, has teamed up with a former associate of Mr Ralph Nader, the US
consumer activist, to draft a proposal which could be presented to
Californian voters next year.
'We're seeing whether we can put something together,' says Mr Tobias. 'We're
taking it one step at a time, but the next few months could decide.'
Pay-at-the-pump insurance is fairly straightforward. Under the amended
Torres bill, for example, Californian drivers would pay an extra 28 cents
for every gallon of petrol they buy. In return they would receive a one-off
voucher which could be exchanged, via an insurance agent or company, for a
basic motor insurance policy.
This would provide the holder with medical coverage worth up to Dollars
15,000. There would also be coverage for non-reimbursed lost wages of up to
Dollars 12,000 a year for a maximum two-year period. The effective annual
cost of this policy for someone clocking up about 15,000 miles a year in a
car with average petrol consumption would be in the Dollars 200-Dollars 300
range.
The coverage would be in the form of a 'no-fault' policy - in the event of
an accident the insurance would be triggered regardless of who was to blame
and would cover the policyholder's losses rather than those of anyone
injured by the policyholder. Drivers could top up their protection with
additional private policies if they wished.
The appeal of the Torres proposal is that a greater proportion of drivers in
the nation's most populous state would fall into the insurance net. Lengthy
legal battles over damages resulting from car accidents - in addition to
core medical costs - would also be minimised.
There are some problems, however. A 'pay-at-the-pump' scheme could penalise
out-of-town drivers who travel longer distances but are statistically better
risks than their urban counterparts.
It could also encourage drivers to nip across state lines, filling their
tanks with cheaper, out-of-state petrol, although California's geography
mitigates against this possibility. Some supporters of the plan also suggest
that if California goes down this route, other neighbouring states might be
encouraged to follow.
But the biggest hurdle remains a political one. The California state
legislature sent the Torres bill first to the state Senate insurance
committee, where it narrowly won approval late last month after amendments
designed to make it more palatable to the industry lobby.
Unfortunately, it also dictated that the next stop would be the judiciary
committee, where trial lawyers have considerable clout.
The Californian Trial Lawyers Association has steadfastly opposed any
'no-fault' system. Clearly, such a system would diminish the lawyers'
workload. However, the CTLA has always justified its opposition on more
ideological grounds - that individuals' rights would be undermined if they
were unable to sue for damages beyond basic medical costs.
Even Mr Torres' aides admit the legislative odds are against them at this
stage, although they take some comfort from the wider industry support which
the amendments negotiated at the insurance committee stage have won.
'If you'd asked a few weeks ago, I'd have said this was dead. There's a
chance we can get it through judiciary,' said one. If the bill falls,
however, the Tobias initiative could emerge as the next line of attack.

FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Clinton trade policy makes noisy debut -
Tactics come to the fore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID a chorus of criticism and confusion abroad, the Clinton
administration's trade policy has begun to emerge in speeches, interviews
and, most tellingly, in its actions.
In the fine tradition of the Democratic party (accused of devouring its own
in the heat of battle), the debate is noisy. But it is more about tactics
than policy, and insiders pour scorn on reports of differences among the
main policymakers.
Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former Republican trade official, and confidant of a
number of Clinton trade policymakers, insists there is little conflict in
the administration. He says there are different perspectives, depending on
the officials' briefs, because 'you don't expect monolithic expressions' of
opinion.
In fact, trade policy under President Clinton is little changed from the
days of George Bush.
One way in which they are different, however, is that Mrs Carla Hills,
President Bush's trade representative, imposed sanctions only reluctantly;
her successor, Mr Mickey Kantor, believes US credibility suffered as a
result.
If he is the 'agnostic' he claims to be on trade policy, he is a complete
atheist on the danger of trade war. He believes it will not happen. The
players in the world economy have grown too interdependent - witness the
administration's soul-searching on the question of renewing China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status.
During the presidential campaign, Mr Clinton promised to make China's MFN
status conditional on good behaviour on human rights and weapons transfers.
As president, he has learned US aircraft makers, farmers and importers - as
well as friends in Hong Kong - are dependent on good US-China business
relations.
Mr Clinton is struggling to unearth a benign China strategy to honour his
campaign pledge. On other fronts, there is no longer any hesitation.
The administration is determined to complete the Uruguay Round this year, if
it can be done at all. The tactics are mostly in the hands of Mr Kantor and
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner in charge of trade. The two
experienced negotiators have developed a good working relationship, and
showed in their recent agreement over government procurement that both
possess the agility to succeed where others have not. The question has
become how much they can achieve rather than whether.
So confident is the administration that even before a Uruguay Round
agreement has been forged, it has begun to prepare for a new 'Clinton Round'
to deal with trade-related environmental issues, competition policy and
technology.
On Nafta the administration is pushing to complete side agreements on labour
and environment next month, despite polls which show the pact in deep
trouble with voters. It has taken up the Bush vision of a hemispheric-wide
free trade agreement. However, it also intends to strengthen ties with Asia
through the Asia Pacific Economic Council. Among the 15 nations, efforts
will be made to create a regional trade and investment framework, to achieve
minimum standards harmonisation and forge common approaches to trade and
investment.
Key to the administration's relations with Congress will be Congressman
Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, and a respected adviser. In a
pessimistic but thoughtful speech on Tuesday, Mr Gephardt warned of
polarisation over Nafta because of emerging Republican opposition to the
side agreements, necessary to its passage in Congress.
Angry, too, at the press and academics who 'pigeonhole us as protectionists
or worse,' Mr Gephardt laid out a depressing vision of a changing world
where the old economic rules - for example the linkage between wage and
productivity growth - no longer automatically produce high-wage economies.
The prescription for the future is fiscal responsibility, retraining,
rebuilding, research and development. Trade policy, while only part of the
larger economic mosaic, is 'the inescapable link to the world economy'.
His view of the need to manage trade in a complex world is shared by
administration trade thinkers. This is true particularly with Japan, where,
says one senior trade official, 'we have been very Japanese about Japan,
reading off the same script'.
There are few, if any, defectors from the 'Japan is Different' school, and
the decision to apply pressure for quantifiable goals akin to the recent
semi-conductor agreement awaits a definitive strategy.
Mr Prestowitz scorns the view that economic adviser Laura D'Andrea Tyson,
who selectively advocates industrial policy, and Treasury secretary Lloyd
Bentsen, a supposed free trader, represent clashing poles in the
administration. He recalls that Mr Bentsen was the author of the
controversial Super 301 legislation which empowers the US administration to
take unilateral action against countries it sees as unfair traders.

FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Brussels wins US car tax probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE governing council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
yesterday agreed to set up an independent disputes panel to examine an EC
charge that US car taxes discriminate against European exports.
The US said it would accept the decision, which must be taken by consensus.
The EC claims that European car manufacturers are paying a disproportionate
share of the three taxes - two of which penalise high fuel consumption,
while the third is a luxury tax.
Brussels says the total revenue of the three taxes levied in 1991 was
Dollars 558m (Pounds 362m), of which Dollars 494m fell on European cars.
European manufacturers paid 100 per cent of penalties under the corporate
average fuel economy (Cafe) law, 80 per cent of the 'gas-guzzler' tax, and
80 per cent of the luxury tax, against a market share of just 4 per cent.
The EC argues that Cafe payments in particular discriminate against European
luxury car manufacturers since they are based on the sales-weighted average
fuel consumption of all models produced. Thus US producers who make cars
across a range of sizes, and Japanese producers who manufacture mostly
small, fuel-efficient cars, do not incur penalties.
The Gatt council failed to reach consensus on a demand by five Latin
American banana producers for a panel to examine the EC's new banana import
regime, which comes into force on July 1.
The producers, whose panel request under expedited procedures was supported
by other Latin American countries, the US and Australia, argue that the
regime unfairly discriminates against them.
However, their request was blocked by the EC, with backing by several
Caribbean and African banana producers who will get preferential treatment
under the new regime. The Community said it was still willing to search for
a negotiated settlement to the long-running dispute.
The Gatt council agreed to return to the matter later.
Separately, the EC was criticised for failing to settle compensation for
countries hurt by its oilseeds subsidy policies, which are not covered by
last November's bilateral deal between the EC and the US. There was also
renewed criticism of punitive US levies on imported steel.

FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC positive about Nafta agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC has given a broadly positive response to the North American Free
Trade Agreement, while reserving the right to take steps to redress
potential unfair trading practices.
The European Commission yesterday approved a study of the Nafta agreement
between the US, Canada and Mexico.
The positive reaction was expected and matches the Commission's desire to
avoid trade frictions with the US as it attempts to reach a successful
conclusion of the Gatt Uruguay round by the end of the year.
The study also concludes that the EC's political relationship with Mexico
will be affected by the free trade area. 'As the Nafta draws Mexico more
closely into the North American orbit, Mexico's relationship with the EC may
gain importance as a counterweight' mainly because of the likely dynamic
impact on the Mexican economy and its population.
The report identifies, however, a number of areas where it believes the
Nafta agreement could lead to a loss of EC market share in the US and
Canada.
Financial services and insurance: The principal problem is the possibility
that Nafta privileges could be limited to companies with majority holdings
based inside the Nafta area. This would be a 'very important and unjustified
discrimination' against EC-controlled subsidiaries in North America.
Rules of origin: The EC raises concerns about rules applying to cars and
textiles which are more restrictive than in Europe even if they are not
actually contradictory to Gatt.
Services: The Commission warns that a failure to reach a Gatt agreement
covering services could lead to substantial shifts of business to the
disadvantage of the EC. This applies particularly to potential business in
Mexico.
Farm products: The EC could suffer in sectors such as milk products, sugar
and meat exports to the Mexican market. It is particularly worried about a
clause raising Mexican barriers to the same level as the US after a six-year
period. Despite these worries, the Commission says the net effect of the
Nafta agreement is likely to be globally positive and ought to lead to a big
boost in trade with the EC.
The report concludes that if trade relations are more restrictive after the
sig-nature of the Nafta agreement, it should tackle these questions within
the Gatt framework.

FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US likely to toughen its China policy

THE US is set to impose conditions on the privileged access of billions of
dollars of Chinese goods to the US market, risking a war of words with
Beijing and a possible deterioration of relations.
Mr Winston Lord, the assistant secretary of state, told Chinese officials
yesterday that the administration was likely to attach conditions to renewal
of China's Most Favoured Nation trade status, that guarantees privileged
access to the vast American market.
Mr Lord is the most senior State Department official to visit Beijing since
the change of administration. A former ambassador to China from 1985 to
1989, Mr Lord has been outspoken in his criticism of China's human rights
record.
His condemnation of China's behaviour at the time of the Tiananmen Square
massacre in 1989 was especially forceful. He has made no secret of his view
that progress on human rights should be a central factor in relations
between Washington and Beijing.
China has warned angrily against MFN conditions being tied to human rights,
weapons proliferation, and its Dollars 18bn trade surplus with the US, but
has not spelled out how it might react beyond threatening a cooling of
relations.
The clash could damage Chinese efforts to secure the Olympics in the year
2000.
President Bill Clinton has until June 3 to rule on renewal of China's MFN
status, but pressure from Congress and from within his own administration
appears to be pushing him towards imposing conditions in some form.
After Mr Lord's meeting with acting foreign minister Tian Zengpei, a senior
US official said: 'The Chinese are under no illusion of the seriousness of
the situation and of the fact that conditions are very likely. It would have
taken dramatic progress (on human rights and other issues) not to have some
kind of conditions.'
Influential US politicians, including Senator George Mitchell and
congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, have threatened to attach conditions to China's
MFN renewal if the administration fails to do so.
Mr Clinton's advisers have indicated the administration is likely to fall
into line, although conditions on human rights, liberalisation of China's
own trade regime and weapons proliferation may be less rigorous than
demanded by some congressmen.
Mr Clinton, said the US official, wanted to find common ground with Congress
on the MFN issue. Whatever form the conditions take, 'they obviously will be
serious ones .the objective is to make progress and not to lose MFN, which
would have harmful effects.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Dalai Lama calls for dialogue: Tibetan leader voices fears
of 'cultural genocide'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DALAI Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, said yesterday he wanted to
discuss with China a 'one country, two systems' approach along the lines of
Beijing's policy for Hong Kong and Taiwan.
At a press conference in London, the Nobel peace prize winner said Tibet was
not part of China, which has governed it since invading in 1951.
'Ultimately, the Tibetan people have the right to decide (their future),' he
said.
However, Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, had said anything could
be discussed except complete independence, the Dalai Lama added, apparently
referring to a meeting in 1979 between Mr Deng and the Dalai Lama's brother,
acting as his emissary. Without accepting this starting point, discussions
would be pointless, he indicated.
The Dalai Lama's suggestion of autonomy under Chinese sovereignty has been
made before. But his urgent desire for dialogue on such an approach clearly
reflects his growing concern about transfers of Chinese people into Tibet
and the devastation of Tibetan culture.
Population movements into Tibet, he said, involved violations of human
rights, environmental problems, and 'cultural genocide'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, told the Dalai Lama yesterday he
would raise the issue of population transfers with China. He would also urge
China to start a dialogue with Tibetans including the Dalai Lama'without any
preconditions'.
This toughening of Britain's position on Tibet came recently after China
sought to impose conditions on talks, officials said. Britain believes Tibet
should be autonomous but recognises the 'special position' of China - an
approach in line with that of most other countries which do not believe
complete independence from China is realistic.
A group of European ambassadors to Beijing is due to visit Tibet later this
month to seek first-hand evidence. Travellers report the wholesale
demolition of Tibetan buildings and their replacement with stalls for mostly
Chinese vendors. Mr Robbie Barnett, director of a London-based Tibet
information network, said one recent visitor had reported an 'architectural
holocaust'.
There are no reliable estimates of movements of Chinese into Tibet, although
China specialists note that movements of people from rural to urban areas in
search of commercial opportunities are common throughout China.
China meanwhile kept up its campaign to discredit the Dalai Lama. Its London
embassy issued a document accusing him of acting 'in total disregard of
historical facts' and insisting that life for Tibetans was much better than
under the previous 'feudal serfdom'.

<TEXT>
Maverick guerrilla groups launched a fierce bombardment of the Afghan
capital Kabul before dawn yesterday, killing at least 15 people and injuring
hundreds, Reuter reports from Kabul.
It was the fiercest battle since the fractious guerrilla leaders of the
Islamic coalition government signed a pact in Pakistan in March to end
months of fighting.
Over 300 rockets and shells hit Kabul before dawn. Government tanks raced to
reinforce the main battlefront in the south-western suburbs.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported 576 injured in
the shell-shattered capital. Doctors earlier reported 15 dead but said later
the figure would be much higher.
Most of the rockets were fired from positions of the Iran-backed Shia
Hezb-i-Wahdat group and the hardline Hezb-i-Islami party led by Mr Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, prime minister-designate, in hills to the south and west.
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and Mr Hekmatyar were in the eastern city of
Jalalabad for a 12th day of talks to try to break the deadlock over
formation of a cabinet under the terms of the March peace agreement.
International response to a UN appeal for humanitarian aid for Afghanistan
has been 'disgraceful,' Oxfam director Mr David Bryer said yesterday.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Afghans still waiting to win the peace: Little progress a
year after the country's civil war ended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HERAT, visiting dignitaries fete local leader Mr Ismael Khan as chief of
the 'north-west kingdom of Afghanistan.' In north central Mazar-i-Sharif,
nothing gets done without permission from kingpin Mr Rashid Dostum. And in
eastern Jalalabad, Governor Abdul Qadir serves at the good grace of
kingmaker Pakistan.
A year after an Islamic revolution ended its 14-year civil war,
Afghanistan's disintegration has accelerated. Its strongest guerrilla forces
continue to battle for control of Kabul, allowing the rest of the nation to
spin off into mostly peaceful independent fiefdoms.
These, like most people outside the region, long ago lost interest in the
relentless killing in Kabul, which intensified yesterday as guerrilla groups
launched a pre-dawn bombardment.
Mr Sayed Jaffer Naderi, governor of the northern province of Baghlan,
declares of leaders in the capital: 'They don't care about us, so we don't
care about them.' Mr Naderi is part of a federation led by Mr Dostum, called
the National Movement of Afghanistan.
'In a year, they couldn't even design a national flag,' Mr Naderi continues.
'What can we expect they will do for this country?'
The end of the Afghan war in April last year was supposed to signal the
return of more than 5m Afghan refugees from Iran and Pakistan. Instead most
remain in exile, and the rebels' latest attempt to settle their problems -
an accord signed in March - has all but fallen apart.
The main antagonists in the continued fighting are the prime
minister-designate, Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and the defence minister, Mr
Ahmed Shah Masood.
Their mutual emnity runs deep. Since Mr Masood is Kabul's most powerful
single figure, Mr Hekmatyar won't risk entering it, and instead fires
rockets to get Mr Masood out. His forces were thought responsible for most
of the rockets and shells which rained on the capital yesterday.
One Afghan surveying the damage in another recent attack said: 'The only way
to solve Afghanistan's problem is to put all the leaders on a plane and
shoot it down.'
Indeed, little can be said for the leadership of President Berhannudding
Rabanni. There is an almost incapacitation of public services.
Roads do not get fixed, and travelling outside Kabul is like traversing a
moonscape.
Electricity is regularly severed to Kabul - opponents blame Mr Hekmatyar -
and that shuts off the water supply as well.
Violence and intimidation has increased against western relief workers as
well. In February, four United Nations employees were executed at a roadside
near Jalalabad.
The UN and the French organisation Medecins sans Frontieres this spring shut
its offices in northern Kunduz, complaining of threats by Arab relief
agencies there and robberies.
Some Afghans are so fed up that they are longing for the old days under the
pro-Moscow government of President Najibullah.
At a checkpoint along the road from Jalalabad to Kabul, an armed man boarded
a bus and, seeing foreigners, shouted: 'Long live Najibullah. As long as we
lack strong leadership, there will be war.'
The northern fiefdom run by Mr Dostum and Mr Naderi, in comparison, is a
model of peace which has kept more foreign missions open in Mazar-i-Sharif
than in Kabul.
The fact that Mr Dostum and Mr Naderi operate something of a secular enclave
that is a haven for members of the former communist government rankles those
fighting it out in Kabul. But this has not caused much despair in the north.
'Everyone says we are not Moslem,' says Mr Naderi. 'But we're watching while
they keep fighting in Kabul and call each other kafir (heretic). We don't
know who is a kafir any more.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Researchers develop artificial eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ARTIFICIAL eye capable of recognising shapes and patterns in a way which
mimics human sight has been developed by researchers in Dublin.
Teams from Hitachi of Japan and Trinity College, Dublin, have combined two
of the most advanced information processing technologies - optical computing
and neural networking - to create an optical device which can 'learn' to
recognise objects in a fashion far in advance of the comparatively crude
robot vision systems available today. The Dublin eye can, for example,
recognise and distinguish between two patterns irrespective of their
position or movement.
Applications for the new technology could include automated assembly systems
in factories, robots able to tackle a wide range of services and
self-steering vehicles. Among the work being carried out at Hitachi is the
interpretation of human facial expressions, which could have important
consequences for human-machine interaction.
Current automatic vision systems use television cameras to scan an image or
an object, the shape of which is analysed by special software. While
impressive results have been obtained with such systems they are at best an
approximation to true machine vision.
The Dublin researchers realised that computers using light beams instead of
electrons would have the necessary speed to analyse more complex shapes or
objects in motion. The Dublin eye is one of the first devices which combine
light based computing with a neural network, an attempt to create a
brain-like system using microprocessor chips.
It is the second breakthrough this year for Hitachi's European laboratories.
In February, the Cambridge laboratory developed the prototype of a powerful
computer memory. Hitachi has been collaborating with Trinity College for
five years and the arrangement has led to establishment of the Hitachi
Dublin Laboratory in 1989.

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission wants to earmark Ecu1bn (Pounds 790m) of central and
national EC funds for rehabilitating developing countries which have been
crippled by civil war or natural disasters.
The Commission yesterday proposed an initiative aimed at filling the gap
between short-term emergency aid and long-term development funding. Some 60
per cent of the planned funding would come from existing EC resources,
including the Lome Convention of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries
and the Community budget, and the rest would have to come directly from the
12 EC members.
Rehabilitation aid is supposed to prepare the way for economic recovery and
political and social development after upheavals such as civil war. But
although the Commission has already launched rehabilitation schemes in areas
such as Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia, existing aid instruments are not
tailored to economies which are still too fragile to support long-term aid
programmes.
Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, has been pressing for a Commission
initiative, and development ministers from the 12 EC members will discuss
the proposal at their May 25 meeting.
EC rehabilitation support would be used to help restore production, repair
basic infrastructure and restore administrative institutions, and prepare
the way for retraining, resettlement and job creation.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Miyazawa denies Cambodia pullout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KIICHI Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday gave assurances the
country would not withdraw from a United Nations peace-keeping operation in
Cambodia, but said the government would renew requests for tighter security
for Japanese participants.
Controversy over the killing last week of a Japanese police officer has
threatened not only Tokyo's role in the Cambodian operation, but challenged
the country's longer-term policy of taking an international political
profile appropriate to its economic influence.
Over the past few days, the Japanese mainstream media has improbably
suggested that the peace-keepers were unfairly exposed to risk in Cambodia,
that the operation was designed to go wrong to ensure a greater domestic
role for Japan's military, and even that the depth of reaction to the
killing is due to the unique emphasis that Japanese put on the value of
life.
In the face of sustained criticism, a government poorly prepared for the
likelihood of casualties has fumbled badly in attempting to justify the
presence in Cambodia. Mr Miyazawa, in a specially called press conference
yesterday, attempted to put the UN peacekeeping operations in a broader
context and to put Japan's international ambitions back on course.
'We have a commitment to assist in the Cambodian election process, and we
will honour that commitment,' Mr Miyazawa said. 'The death of the officer is
regrettable, and I, as the head of government, feel responsible.'
In spite of Mr Miyazawa's assurances yesterday, it is clear that the
peace-keeping policy could collapse if there are further casualties. A
retreat would compromise Japan's campaign for a permanent seat on the UN
Security Council and make it very difficult for the government to commit
troops to future peace-keeping operations.
As well as the police officer killed last week, four others were injured in
the same ambush, apparently by the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group, which has
boycotted the election.
The Japanese government, fearing that casualties could rise sharply after
the election on May 23, have hinted the peace-keeping policy will be
reviewed after the vote, but is likely to wait for other leading countries
to withdraw before pulling out.
In addition to the 75 civilian police and 600 military personnel already
sent to Cambodia, 41 Japanese election monitors left Tokyo yesterday, 12
fewer than originally planned. The government has requested that the
monitors be sent to secure areas, and is still negotiating with the UN on
improving conditions for the police.
However, Mr Keijiro Murata, the home affairs minister, who has just visited
Cambodia, said the government should not be seen to be asking for special
treatment for Japanese police, although it should ensure that they have
enough water, food and other supplies to perform their duties.
'There is really a very large gap between the perception Japanese have of
the UN operations and the international perception. We have to be aware of
that gap,' Mr Murata said.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Seoul may resume N Korea talks over nuclear issues

SOUTH KOREA said yesterday that it may soon resume talks with North Korea in
an attempt to encourage it to remain a signatory of the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
The announcement followed the UN Security Council's adoption on Tuesday of a
resolution urging North Korea to reconsider its decision to withdraw from
the NPT and open its nuclear facilities to inspections by the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
The resolution also included the implied threat of economic sanctions if
Pyongyang blocks further nuclear inspections. The resolution was approved by
a vote of 13-0, with China, North Korea's most influential ally, and
Pakistan abstain-ing.
Seoul will co-ordinate its policy on North Korean talks with the US, which
has indicated that it is willing to hold high-level discussions with
Pyongyang on the nuclear issue.
South Korea is proposing to grant concessions to North Korea if it returns
to the NPT, including a reduction in the size of the annual US-South Korean
military exercises and opening US military bases in South Korea to
inspections by the North.
Seoul is also prepared to offer aid to North Korea's struggling economy.
North Korea said during the UN debate on Tuesday that the nuclear issue
could be solved through negotiations with the US. North Korea believes that
such talks could be the first step to diplomatic recognition by Washington.
North Korea rejected the UN resolution, accusing the Security Council of
interfering in its internal affairs.
The official news agency KCNA quoted a statement by a foreign ministry
spokesman as saying the government considered the resolution 'an
interference in its internal affairs and a grave infringement on its
sovereignty'.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Brussels clears aircraft link-up

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has approved a German-Dutch alliance to build
regional and commuter aircraft, 18 months after turning down the proposed
Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer,
in the same sector.
The acquisition by Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of 51 per cent of Fokker, the
Dutch manufacturer, was assessed on the same basis as the de Havilland
decision but posed no competition problems.
However, it could open the way for a possible four-way link-up to build
regional and commuter jets and turbo-prop aircraft with Aerospatiale of
France and Alenia of Italy. Both bid unsuccessfully for de Havilland in
1991.
That is still the only deal to have been outlawed under the EC's 1990 merger
rules. The October 1991 decision caused political uproar in France and
Italy. The main argument within the Commission was over the definition of
the market for commuter aircraft. But the companies and governments also
argued that Europe needed a strong manufacturer if it was to hold its own in
the world market.
Dasa, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, has invited Aerospatiale and Alenia to
take a minority stake in Fokker in due course. A spokesman for the German
company admitted yesterday that such a deal would pose much greater
competition problems than the Dasa-Fokker link-up.
Using the same criteria as in the de Havilland case, the Commission decided
the turbo-prop activities of Dasa and Fokker did not overlap. Dasa does not
manufacture jets directly, and, although it is part of Airbus, Brussels
decided the link would not significantly reduce competition.

FT  13 MAY 93 / German union ballot backs wider strikes: Heavy support in
eastern states
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's engineering union, yesterday received overwhelming
support for further strike action in eastern Germany after balloting metal
and electrical workers in three of the region's states.
More than 82 per cent of the union's 72,000-strong membership in Thuringia,
Berlin-Brandenburg, and Saxony-Anhalt said they were prepared to strike in
pursuit of higher pay.
Backed by such a mandate, the union's leadership, headed by Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, will today hold a special meeting to decide how many more
enterprises in eastern Germany will be targeted for strike action, and where
any action should take place.
Over 40,000 workers from more than 90 enterprises are now on strike to put
pressure on the employers to reinstate a contract signed with the union in
March 1991 which sought to equalise western and eastern wages by next year.
About 10,000 west German workers yesterday held token stoppages in
solidarity with the easterners.
The contract would have meant pay rises exceeding 20 per cent for the metal,
electrical and steel sectors in eastern Germany. But the employers cancelled
the contract because of the country's deteriorating economy.
The threat of further strikes coincides with the resumption today of crucial
talks between the employers and union in the Saxon capital of Dresden.
Mediated by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the state's prime minister, they could lead
to a negotiated settlement of the 12-day-old dispute.
Both Mr Dieter Kirchner, head of Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical
employers association, and Mr Michael Kittner, IG Metall's main legal
expert, will be attending the talks.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Danish Referendum: Punks and pensioners find common cause -
Odd alliances in the anti-Maastricht ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TATOOED and unkempt, a group of post-punk youngsters appeared the least
likely allies of the staid retired gentleman. But at a campaign meeting for
next week's Maastricht referendum here, they cheered him as one of their own
when he voiced fears that a Yes to the treaty would endanger his pension.
This coincidence of interest captured the sometimes unexpected grouping
among those who are campaigning for a No next Tuesday.
In their efforts to achieve a repeat of last June's vote against
ratification of the treaty, the anti-Maastricht forces are exploiting the
electorate's fears on a wide range of issues - from the country's future as
an independent nation to worries that Brussels will dictate pension and
other social policy issues.
By pressing buttons which trigger an emotional response, the No campaigners
have made much of the running this spring and are hoping to confound the
opinion polls, which continue to show a comfortable lead for supporters of
the treaty. But they are up against the entire political establishment, not
to mention the business community and the trade union movement, all of them
calling for a Yes.
At the campaign meeting in Copenhagen on Tuesday night, the Noes were
represented on a 10-strong panel by two left-wing university professors and
an MP for the right-wing populist Progress Party (the only one of the eight
parties in parliament against the treaty).
Among those ranged against them were Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, prime minister
and leader of the Social Democratic Party, Mr Poul Schluter, his
Conservative Party predecessor, three other cabinet ministers and a former
minister. The meeting itself was organised by the pro-Maastrict European
Movement.
The disparate opponents of the treaty - stretching from left-wing
environmentalists, who would really prefer to see Denmark out of the EC
altogether, and ex-Communists to the far right - have not come together to
mount a joint campaign. But they are happy to accept each other's support.
The left-wing dominated June Movement, biggest of the anti-Maastricht
organisations whose leaders include a long-standing former member of the
central committee of the Danish Communist Party and a feminist academic,
invited Lord Tebbit, inveterate British Tory opponent of Maastricht, to
address their supporters.
The June Movement's representative at Tuesday evening's meeting, physics
professor Niels Meyer, hammered home the message that a vote for Maastricht
was a vote to sell out the country's democracy and independence to 'a
centralistic and bureaucratic' European union.
'We shall no longer be masters in our own house. We have no need for a new
European commercial and political superpower,' he said to applause and
whistles from the post-punkers. The Progress Party's Mrs Annette Just, by
contrast, enthusiastically supports the free market basis of the internal
market, but argued that the European Community did not need the Maastricht
treaty's political superstructure.
One point on which all the 'antis' are united is that the voters are being
deceived when the government claims that the new referendum is being held
'on a new basis' following last December's Edinburgh agreement between
Denmark and its EC partners.
That agreement allows Denmark to opt out of the treaty's defence
co-operation programme, the common currency, supranational legal and police
co-operation and union citizenship. But since the Maastricht treaty itself
has not been changed, the Noes argue that the voters are being conned. One
of the most potent No-campaign posters depicts the Edinburgh agreement as
the emperor with no clothes in the famous fable by Hans Christian Andersen.
The Noes say that if Maastricht proceeds, it will set Europe on the slippery
slope towards a European super-power, a European army and a European police,
a vision which many Danes find deeply disturbing - and was probably the main
factor in last year's referendum defeat.
The weakness of the No campaign seems to be that it has no real alternative
to offer. Mr Rasmussen was at his most effective at the meeting when he shot
down Professor Meyer for his vague advocacy of wider co-operation with the
Nordic countries and the countries of eastern Europe as an alternative to EC
political co-operation.
'When I ask the No people what the alternative is, I hear something about
mutually interlocking circles,' the prime minister said sarcastically to the
evening's loudest applause.
The Yes campaigners warn that Denmark will be dangerously isolated and could
even be pushed out of the Community if there is a second No vote. The June
Movement and others dismiss this as nonsense.
Denmark cannot be forced to leave the EC against its will, they say, and
will therefore continue to play a full part in the inevitable rethinking of
Community strategy if the Maastricht treaty falls.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Phone bill cuts will help Irish business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND'S state-owned telecommunications company is to make large cuts in
international call rates, but will increase residential and some local
charges to compensate.
Telecom Eireann said its aim was to help business. The changes would also
help align more closely the prices and costs of calls - a process of
'rebalancing' tariffs taking place across Europe.
International call rates will fall by between 16 and 59 per cent from
September. The peak-time rate for calls to Britain will fall from 48 Irish
pence a minute to 30p, and calls to continental Europe from 61p a minute to
between 36p and 48p.
The minimum charge for local calls in peak period will change from 11.2p for
15 minutes to 9.5p for three minutes.
Residential customers will also have to pay more VAT on their phone bills.
Consumer groups reacted angrily to the changes; business welcomed the
prospect of cheaper overseas calls.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Yeltsin tries to speed new constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday signed a decree calling for a
special assembly of the Council of the Federation for June 5 to 'consider
and finalise preparation' of a new Russian constitution.
Mr Yeltsin's plan is that the council would adopt a new constitution,
thereby bypassing the federal parliament. Under the present amended
Soviet-era constitution, it is parliament's responsibility to pass any new
constitution.
The council will be composed of two representatives from each of Russia's 88
regions and autonomous republics as well as representatives of the president
and parliament.
Simultaneously yesterday the Russian parliament launched its own timetable
for a new constitution.
The announcements marked the beginning of a process certain to divide the
country between the conservative parliament and its regional allies on the
one side and President Yeltsin and his supporters on the other.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliamentary Speaker and Mr Vitaly Zorkin, chairman
of the constitution, both told meetings of the regional council
representatives that Mr Yeltsin would be guilty of 'a crime' if he pressed
ahead with his plans to adopt a new constitution.
In a speech of pointed ferocity, Mr Khasbulatov said that Mr Yeltsin's
'political games' would cause the disintegration of the Russian federation.
He also warned the regional leaders - whom Mr Yeltsin has been wooing - that
'those high officials want to make you all equally guilty in this.' From a
less predictably hostile position, Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, a centrist deputy who
is the secretary of the parliament's constitutional committee, warned of the
dangers to democracy from Mr Yeltsin's version of the constitution, which he
described as ushering in a 'super presidential regime.'
The parliament's version, which Mr Rumyantsev's committee drew up and which
called for the establishment of a parliamentary republic with a relatively
constrained president, is to be discussed throughout this month with the
elected regional and republican councils - with a final version due to be
approved on July 6.
The adoption of Mr Yeltsin's constitution would mean immediate elections,
since it abolishes the present parliament which is composed of a Congress of
Peoples' Deputies and a Supreme Soviet in favour of a bi-cameral assembly
with the Council of the Federation of the Upper House and a State Duma - the
name taken from the pre-revolutionary Russian assembly - as the lower house.
This wooing of the regions will be largely based on promises to increase
their economic autonomy and lighten their tax and other obligations.
Mr Yeltsin's control of the government and of the armed forces and security
ministries give him the edge in the struggle against his conservative
opponents and there already appears to be signs that the administrative
leaders, and even some local councils, are inclining towards him.

FT  13 MAY 93 / EC moves to defuse policy row with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN governments yesterday attempted to defuse a rift with the US over
what action to take in Bosnia by pointing out that differences between
allies on such complex issues were a normal hazard of transatlantic policy
co-ordination.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said in parliament that he
saw no purpose in 'exchanging accusations across the Atlantic' and cited
several areas of agreement between the US and European nations over Bosnia.
In particular, discussions were continuing on possible military measures to
be taken against the Bosnian Serbs if they persisted in their refusal to
endorse a United Nations and European Community-backed peace plan, he said.
Though not mentioning him by name, Mr Hurd was clearly referring to highly
critical remarks made by Senator Joseph Biden, a member of the US Senate
foreign relations committee, when he told a questioner in the House of
Commons: 'I don't think some of those remarks would have been made if those
concerned had actually seen the exchanges which have taken place between the
allies in recent days, or if they had understood the nature of the effort
and the risk which some of us, including this country (the UK), are actually
making in Bosnia.'
Mr Biden had accused European governments on Tuesday of 'bigotry and
hypocrisy' for resisting US efforts to save Bosnian Moslems from what he
called 'fascist thuggery' on the part of the Bosnian Serbs.
In reply, British and French officials have pointed out that the lives of
their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia would be endangered if their neutral
status was undermined by air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions or a
lifting of the UN arms embargo in favour of the Bosnian Moslems. Since the
US did not have any ground forces in Bosnia, Washington would not be running
a similar risk.
A senior British government official had earlier defended the right of
European countries to express reservations and doubts about the US policy
options discussed by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state,
during his recent tour of European capitals. 'It is our job to point out
some of the difficulties of some of the options,' he said.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, also expressed surprise at the
reports of a split between the US and its European allies.
'That is not the way I see things,' he said. He also stressed that EC
governments had not ruled out further steps against Serbia, if sanctions
failed to end the Bosnian conflict.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Key Hungarian's US pay revealed
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hungarian government faces a politically embarrassing row following
revelations that a US government-financed investment fund has been paying a
large part of the salary of the chairman of Hungary's state holding company.
The Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund (HAEF), the Dollars 60m institution
set up in 1990 to boost the Hungarian private sector, admitted yesterday it
was paying Mr Pal Teleki, chairman of Hungary's state holding company AV RT.
The payment - about Dollars 130,000 (Pounds 84,415) annually - is much
larger than his basic salary.
The admission is expected to anger nationalists, who accuse the conservative
coalition government of favouring foreign investors. The latter, they
allege, have dominated the Hungarian privatisation process to the detriment
of potential local investors.
US companies have been the most active investors in Hungary and confirmation
that the US fund has been subsidising the salary of the man in charge of
about half the country's business sector is expected to cause a political
outcry.
The AV RT controls Hungary's main utilities and the biggest banks and
industrial companies. Its portfolio is worth about Ft1,500bn (Pounds 11bn)
and includes many of the choicest privatisation prospects.
US and Hungarian officials yesterday defended the subsidy as essential for
the AV RT to attract Mr Teleki, a Hungarian-American who formerly worked as
a geologist for the US government.
But several Hungarian officials were critical, saying Mr Teleki's US
connection raised conflict of interest issues.
The exposure of the large payments to Mr Teleki has hit the HAEF at a
vulnerable time. The fund was recently attacked by US congressmen for
allowing its independent merchant bank to pay excessive salaries and make
deals outside its defined area.

<TEXT>
COMMANDERS of the Moslem-led Bosnian army and Croatian forces, who have been
involved in a four-day battle in the south-western city of Mostar, have
agreed to a ceasefire to take effect at noon today - but Bosnian radio said
last night that fighting was continuing.
As Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, appealed for the city to
be declared a United Nations-protected 'safe area', radio reports said
Mostar was in flames and that hand-to-hand skirmishes were being fought.
The truce agreement confines rival soldiers to their barracks, and provides
for the release of all civilian prisoners and the opening of all roads. It
was signed by the Croat army's Commander Milivoj Petkovic and the Bosnian
Moslem army chief, General Sefer Halilovic, in the presence of the UN's
military commander, General Philippe Morillon in Medjugorje, south-west of
Mostar.
It could ease the plight of more than 1,300 Moslem civilians held by Croat
troops in a military prison outside Mostar after being forced from their
homes. Croat troops have been trying since Sunday to break a Moslem foothold
on the west side of the Neretva River, which bisects Mostar and which
Bosnian Croats want to mark as their eastern-most boundary.
Meanwhile, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said he expected that
the Bosnian Serbs would vote, in this weekend's referendum, against the
peace plan to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines. Bosnian
Serbs have turned down a call by Belgrade to attend a joint session of an
'all Serbian' parliament to ratify the UN peace plan. They opted instead to
go ahead with the referendum on the UN proposal. Serbia has imposed
sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs for refusing to back the plan.

STATE support in Russia will in future concentrate on those companies,
farms, and even regions which showed themselves willing and able to reform,
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, told parliament
yesterday.
This strategy of 'picking winners' would be combined with 'strengthened
state regulations' to aid reform, he said. The prime minister added,
however, that the government would not take 'the fatal step' of substituting
state action for market reforms.
Mr Chernomyrdin said the government would stop issuing general credits to
agriculture, and would instead support those farms which had proved
themselves best able to produce. It would back regions which had introduced
reform plans and which were willing to use their resources to further
reforms. It would also intervene more actively in the management of
companies which remained in state hands, identify those which would benefit
from investment, and create 'financial and industrial groups'.
He was careful to strike a note of optimism, saying that the 'people are now
slowly re-establishing their previous consumption levels'. He claimed that
inflation had fallen sharply in April, from a weekly rate of 6 per cent in
the first week to 2.5 per cent in the last - while the drop in output was
now levelling off.
'We have,' said Mr Chernomyrdin, 'a shaky balance. But we cannot take on
ourselves economic burdens which we cannot carry.' As evidence of the
latter, the prime minister referred to the difficulties in paying for what
he delicately called the 'April measures - promises made to increase pay and
benefits by President Boris Yeltsin in his referendum campaign.
Mr Chernomyrdin's ray of hope was further brightened by Mr Oleg Soskovets,
one of the two newly appointed first deputy prime ministers, who said
yesterday that a number of Russian companies could be made competitive on
the world market. He said that his Russian industry portfolio contained a
number of potentially world-class corporations and that attention would
focus on these as a means of reviving the economy.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Deciphering Fiat's code of ethics: In the battle against
corruption, some fronts remain unopened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT Italy's political corruption scandal one vital question has gone
 -and may remain - unanswered: were company executives simply unwilling
instruments in a network of kickbacks to politicians and parties, or were
they the corrupters?
The 'code of business ethics' unveiled by Fiat, Italy's biggest private
company, this week, does not reveal anything about the past. But it goes
some way towards eliminating the question in the future.
In three pages, Fiat's lawyers have written a code of conduct governing
behaviour in dealings with the government, civil servants or public-sector
companies. The message is clear. In no event shall employees provide 'money
or goods of any kind to promote or favour the interests of one or more group
companies, even following illegitimate pressure'.
The ban covers both cash and other kinds of 'favours', which have cropped up
in the leaked testimony of managers and politicians who have been
interrogated. Although Fiat, which is alleged to have paid L2.4bn (Pounds
1m) for a posh Rome apartment for a senator, is not exhaustive, its list
includes 'any form of aid or contribution, disguised as sponsorship,
assignments, consultancies, advertising, etc'.
The document is as forthright on monitoring and enforcement. All employees,
'considered because of their company duties to be most affected by the
principles of the Code', will have to sign.
Fiat will immediately suspend business with any public functionary who tries
to obtain favours. Any such attempt must be reported to an employee's
superior or directly to the chief executive and legal division.
Sub-contractors or freelances working for the group must make the same
commitment.
Chief executives of group subsidiaries will have to report annually to
Fiat's managing director on compliance, providing details of any attempts to
extort bribes or favours. The sanction in the event of violation is clear;
an employee 'shall be deemed to terminate the relationship of trust existing
between the company and the employee concerned, with the appropriate
contractual and legal consequences on the employment relationship'.
Tough talk. But does Fiat, which has seen almost a dozen of its executives
in jail, under house arrest or having been briefly detained, mean what it
says?
The question is particularly pertinent given the group's size, status and
prestige. Last month, Mr Cesare Romiti, managing director, who has testified
twice voluntarily before Milan magistrates, exhorted fellow executives to
follow Fiat's example of speaking out against corruption in future.
Other companies are also re-considering their business ethics. Eni, the
state-owned energy and chemicals group, which has been implicated even more
deeply than Fiat, will introduce its own code soon. In spite of the new mood
of co-operation between business and the magistrates, some doubts remain
that the change of heart by Fiat and other companies may be partly cosmetic.
Fiat's new code leaves a number of stones unturned. It governs relations
only between the company and the public sector. Although the corruption
scandal has so far involved only public-sector orders, it is not clear why
Fiat is not demanding the same standards from staff when dealing with
private companies.
Moreover, the code only covers Italy. Until now, magistrates have focused
their attention on allegations of domestic corruption. However, kickbacks on
foreign business, so far restricted to Italy's state-sponsored foreign aid
programme, have also been alleged.
Without broadening the code to foreign countries, Fiat leaves itself open to
accusations, often levelled against some big Italian companies by their
foreign competitors, that contracts abroad have sometimes been won with
bribes. Many US multinationals, particularly those operating in the
developing world, have codes of practice similar to that of Fiat, but with
the focus more on foreign operations.
Italian companies are particularly defenceless against claims by their
competitors of unfair competition as the country has no law against paying
bribes abroad. The only legal sanction, now being increasingly used by
magistrates, is to press charges of falsifying company accounts.
Fiat says its code will be extended abroad in time. First, it must be
approved by the boards of the group's roughly 1,000 subsidiaries. Then the
code must be checked against laws in foreign countries in case amendments
are needed.
The group says relations with other private companies are already largely
covered by an existing 'internal' code of practice, which governs matters
such as conflicts of interest. Every new manager has to sign a declaration
of agreement with the code.
However, the new code, for all its worth, does not mask a lingering
ambivalence on the part of the company towards corruption. Addressing fellow
industrialists at a meeting of the Confindustria employers' federation in
Venice last month, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, recognised the
group's involvement in political corruption, but attempted to distinguish
between two different types of behaviour.
First were companies, like Fiat, which may have been caught up in 'episodes'
of corruption, but were fundamentally involved in 'industry'. The second
category comprised unspecified companies which had based their success
entirely on privileged relations with politicians. The distinction, not easy
to maintain, has been only partly clarified by Fiat's new code.

HEAVY street fighting continued yesterday in the south-western Bosnian city
of Mostar, despite attempts by the United Nations to mediate a new ceasefire
between Bosnian Croats and Moslem-led government forces.
Much of the eastern, Moslem-held section of the city was in flames as Croat
troops battled to break a Moslem foothold on the west side of the Neretva
River, which bisects Mostar and which Bosnian Croats want to mark as their
eastern-most boundary.
The Croatian Defense Council (HVO) was holding more than 1,300 Moslem
civilians at the airport building outside Mostar, after forcing them from
their homes, UN officials said yesterday.
Meanwhile, General Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander, met leaders
of the Bosnian army and Bosnian Croat forces in Medjugorje, about 20 km
south-west of Mostar, in an effort to agree a ceasefire. He was also to meet
with Bosnian Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban. In eastern Bosnia, the UN
evacuated the first 22 of about 200 wounded from Zepa, one of six 'safe
areas' declared by the UN security council last week, after Serbs had
blocked the departure of UN helicopters for five hours.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday said he expected the
inhabitants of his self-styled state would vote against the peace plan to
divide Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines in this weekend's
referendum.
Bosnian Serbs have turned down a call by the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, to attend a joint session of an 'all Serbian' parliament to
ratify the UN peace plan.
They opted instead to go ahead with the referendum on the UN proposal.
Serbia has imposed sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs for refusing to back the
plan.

<TEXT>
THE CZECH government has decided to allow the transfer of shares in
privatised Czech companies to Slovak investors, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech
prime minister, said yesterday, reversing an earlier controversial decision
not to hand over the shares.
The shares were acquired by Slovak investors during last year's mass voucher
privatisation before Czechoslovakia was split into the Czech Republic and
Slovakia on December 31.
Prague surprised investors in March by announcing that it would not hand out
shares due to Slovak investors because of a dispute with Bratislava over the
financial assets of the former Czechoslovak state.
Mr Klaus then said the shares would be held as security against Czech
government claims for compensation from Slovakia. The decision enbittered
relations between the two countries, and the dispute over assets has still
not been resolved.
The move proved controversial and it caused widespread unease among domestic
and foreign investors who had until then regarded investment in the Czech
Republic as safe from political attacks.
Large private investment funds were particalularly upset as it meant the
long-awaited distribution of the shares was to be postponed indefinitely.
After several delays the shares were to be distributed in April, and the
funds have been waiting eagerly to start trading their shares.
Czechoslovakia's voucher privatisation was the largest single programme of
state asset disposal in the former communist countries. More than 8.5m
investors bought shares indirectly in about 1,500 companies with an
estimated book value of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn).

<TEXT>
THE Italian prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former central bank
governor, yesterday cleared the final procedural hurdle in the lengthy
process of forming a new government by winning a vote of confidence in the
senate.
The financial markets reacted positively to the outcome, with the lira
gaining modestly against the D-Mark and trading at L920. This compared with
a parity of nearly L960 with the D-Mark when Mr Ciampi first set out to form
his government.
He received support similar to that provided by the parties in last week's
vote in the lower house of parliament. This was based on the backing of the
outgoing coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and
Liberals. However, this time Mr Ciampi had to fend off a potential protest
vote by the Liberals and elements within the Christian Democrat party who
wanted firmer commitments on aid to the south of Italy.
But the protest vote never materialised and Mr Ciampi obtained 162 votes in
favour of his programme - centred on early electoral reform and tight
economic management. The main opposition parties chose to abstain or
absented themselves, ensuring a majority. Abstentions totalled 50. In last
Friday's vote in the lower house the same opposition parties abstained.

<TEXT>
LEADING industrial lobbies in the German private sector yesterday denounced
government plans for a new social insurance surcharge on workers and
employers.
They flatly rejected plans for a DM13bn (Pounds 5.2bn) statutory scheme to
finance residential care for the chronically sick and elderly. They
described the move as a direct threat to jobs, investment and to economic
recovery.
In an extraordinary joint appeal to the government, the leaders of the four
principal employers' organisations called for the whole programme to be
reconsidered, and postponed, at least until recovery is under way.
In spite of their urgent call, however, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
appears to be determined to press ahead with the programme. The battle over
the scheme has caused serious divisions within the coalition, with the
minority Free Democrats, in particular, sharing many of the private sector's
misgivings.
Defenders of the plan in turn accused the private sector of 'scandalous'
selfishness in ignoring the urgent needs of the ageing population in
Germany.
The insurance plan for residential care is seen by German industry as the
last straw on the overwhelming burden of social costs imposed on employers.
They fear that an initial surcharge of 1.7 per cent on incomes would rapidly
rise to double figures, as the number of old people grows.
Social insurance costs already amount to 37.4 per cent on top of basic
wages, and all additional personnel costs for German employers add DM84 to
every DM100 in their workers' pay packets, they say.
Mr Klaus Murmann, leader of the German employers' federation (BDA), said the
scheme was 'economically damaging and flawed in its basic conception. . . .
The whole of German industry is united on this, as it has hardly ever been
before.'

FT  13 MAY 93 / Clinton seeks to contain Bosnian war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised 'some more' steps to encourage
peace in the Bosnian civil war and to help confine the conflict.
However, he appears to have gone back to the drawing board in his efforts to
find a Bosnian policy, placing much more emphasis on measures to prevent the
violence spreading beyond Bosnia.
Among the measures Mr Clinton is considering is sending US troops to join
United Nations observers in Macedonia, as a safeguard against the conflict
spilling over into other areas of the former Yugoslavia. However, White
House officials said yesterday that no decision was imminent.
The president is also contemplating placing monitors along the border
between Bosnia and Serbia to see if the Serbian government fulfils its
promise to cut off all but humanitarian supplies to the Bosnian Serbs.
Last week, Clinton administration officials were arguing for an end to the
UN arms embargo which has hampered the Bosnian Moslems in their efforts to
defend themselves against the much better-armed Bosnian Serbs.
They were also pressing for the embargo coupled with a short campaign of air
strikes to hold the Serbian militias in check until the Moslems could be
rearmed.
Although US officials deny there has been any change in that policy, there
has been a shift of emphasis, in recognition of the reluctance of several
European allies to see the arms embargo lifted.
At the least, a policy of containment is now twinned with the goal of ending
the violence within Bosnia.
Those who have criticised the Europeans include Senator Richard Lugar, the
senior foreign policy spokesman for the Republican opposition, and, more
shrilly, Senator Joseph Biden, the Democratic chairman of a Senate
subcommittee on European affairs.
Senator Lugar said: 'We really do want the British and the French to be on
board. We want support from the Germans and the Russians and other Europeans
who really ought to be with us on this situation and are not quite there
yet.
'I see the president moving steadily and trying to move our allies steadily,
and the people who will need to vote for Security Council authorisation of
force steadily,' Mr Lugar added.
Others acknowledge, however, that doubts remain within the administration,
and still more so within the Congress, over what policy to pursue.
While some congressional leaders fiercely advocate military intervention,
the rank-and-file of both parties in Congress are still deeply reluctant to
become embroiled in a war that could come to resemble Vietnam.
Mr Clinton said in a radio interview yesterday morning that he wanted 'to
make sure that there is no Vietnam', but said that wanting to avoid the
mistakes made in Vietnam did not mean that the US should do nothing.
'The big difference from the point of view of the average American is I have
made it very clear that the United States, unlike in Vietnam, is not about
to act alone,' Mr Clinton said.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Political polecat treats Danes to a Maastricht mauling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH hijacked Denmark's Maastricht referendum contest yesterday to
the bemusement - and some irritation - of the Danes.
British politicians, trailed by British camera crews and British reporters,
traded insults and doled out advice to the Danes in the ante-chambers of the
Folketing, the Danish parliament - all in English of course.
In one corner was Lord Tebbit, erstwhile Conservative cabinet minister,
scourge of Maastricht and political street-fighter of repute. Lord Tebbit
was invited to Copenhagen by the June Movement, fellow-travellers
campaigning for a repeat of last June's No vote in Denmark.
In the other, seeking to blunt whatever impact Lord Tebbit might have, was
the scholarly Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP, more sheepdog than polecat, and
guest of the governing Social Democratic party.
Lord Tebbit, Mr Radice warned at a press conference, was a 'xenophobic
meddler' with no genuine concern for Denmark. The referendum, he said
earnestly, was 'not something the British should interfere with at all',
glossing over what Mr Radice was doing in Denmark himself.
Summoning up a look of injured indignation, Lord Tebbit protested. His
objections to Maastricht were based not on xenophobia but on a belief that
it would do great damage to the European Community. 'Is it meddling to tell
the Danish people what I as a European citizen believe?' he asked reasonably
enough. 'Are we to have free movement of goods but thought police at our
borders?'
It is a moot point what effect - if any - such interventions will have on
Tuesday's vote. A Gallup poll to be published today showed that the
long-standing Yes lead was hardening. It showed 49 per cent in favour and 33
per cent against, compared with a gap of 46-34 at the weekend, with 14 per
cent undecided and the balance resolved not to vote. Another poll, also to
be published today, showed 52 per cent in favour, 36 per cent against, 8 per
cent undecided and 4 per cent resolved not to vote.
The respected pro-Maastricht newspaper Berlingske Tidende had sharp words
for the British visitors, also taking a swipe at Sir James Goldsmith,
financier turned crusader, who has paid for full-page advertisements in
Danish newspapers advocating a No vote.
The British, said Berlingske Tidende, 'are not welcome to consider the vote
as a substitute for the referendum which they themselves will not have, let
alone treat the Danish voters as puppets who can be used to vote no for
reasons of British domestic politics'.
Ulterior motive or no, Lord Tebbit said a second Danish No vote would stop
British ratification of Maastricht and that Denmark would not subsequently
be isolated or pushed out of the European Community. Yes campaign propaganda
to that effect played on 'fear, ignorance and sheer misstatement of facts',
added Britain's most celebrated Maastricht mauler.

FT  13 MAY 93 / SFO seeks more use of remand in custody
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTS should give greater consideration to holding defendants in serious
fraud cases in custody before trial, following the flight of Mr Asil Nadir
to northern Cyprus, Mr George Staple, director of the Serious Fraud Office,
said yesterday.
Despite the fact that such cases often took more than two years to reach
court, he said that remand in custody might be necessary where there was a
strong possibility of a defendant jumping bail and leaving the country to
avoid trial.
Mr Staple was speaking at the presentation of the SFO's annual report,
during which he defended the handling of the Nadir case by his department
and the police.
He noted that bail conditions remained the responsibility of the courts, but
said that the decision of the Polly Peck founder to jump Pounds 3.5m bail
last week could lead to a change in attitude to long periods in custody.
'I would be surprised if, in future, courts don't look more critically at
these cases.'
Mr Staple acknowledged that imprisoning defendants for such long periods
before trial would cause considerable concern within the legal profession.
To meet such concern, the SFO could try further to speed up its
investigation and prosecution processes. The arrest of people in such cases
might also be postponed until investigations had proceeded further, he said.
Responding to Mr Staple's comments, defence solicitor Mr David Kirk, head of
the fraud unit of City law firm Stephenson Harwood, said: 'It is extremely
rare for defendants to fraud cases to abscond. It would be unfortunate if
the clear requirements of the Bail Act were to be overridden by one
isolated, if regrettable, incident.'
Defending the handling of the Nadir case, Mr Staple said the SFO had done
all it could to ensure Mr Nadir came to trial by opposing the granting of
his bail.
In sending out an 'all-ports' warning in response to the anonymous tip-off
before Mr Nadir's escape, the police had taken action they thought
appropriate in the circumstances.
Although not 'over-optimistic' about the trial starting in September, Mr
Staple said he was not yet prepared to assume that it would not take place.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Lamont launches vigorous defence of policy record:
Chancellor regrets hardships inflicted by recession as he fights to retain
his post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   EDINBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont last night launched a last-ditch and probably futile effort
to remain chancellor by offering a vigorous defence of his record alongside
a candid expression of regret for the hardships inflicted on the electorate.
But as he issued what amounted to a public plea for prime ministerial
clemency at the Scottish Conservative Conference in Edinburgh, senior
political associates of Mr John Major were insisting the prime minister
would move Mr Lamont in a summer cabinet reshuffle.
With some of the most senior figures in the Conservative party adamant that
Mr Major must move quickly to reshape his team, one suggested there was a
small chance Mr Lamont could be moved during the Whitsun parliamentary
recess at the end of this month. The most likely dates, however, remain July
or September.
At one point in his speech, Mr Lamont appeared to acknowledge the gravity of
the threat when he commented: 'My job is unimportant - your jobs are what
count. We have beaten inflation, let's go on and beat unemployment.'
In a generally combative performance, that brought only respectful applause
from an audience that had earlier attacked the imposition in the Budget of
value added tax on fuel, Mr Lamont insisted there had been no alternative to
the harsh anti-inflation policies of the past two years.
Declaring that 'the British recession is over', he said he had never claimed
credit for the resumption of economic growth. But he had laid the
foundations for growth by getting inflation down to its lowest level for 25
years and interest rates to below the level of any other European Community
state.
Defending the tax increases in his March Budget, he said that reducing the
government's borrowing requirement was essential to ensure the recovery was
sustained. He added: 'I accept my responsibility for everything that has
happened over the last two years. The government should be judged on its
record, and I rather hope I shall be judged on mine.'
Mr Lamont said he expected criticism. The chancellor inevitably was in 'the
firing line' when people were losing their houses or businesses as a result
of recession.
But he then launched a searing attack on the media for taking out of context
his remark - Je ne regrette rien - during the Newbury by-election campaign.
Describing it as a light-hearted response to a light-hearted question, he
said the media had been determined to misrepresent him.
Mr Lamont added: 'I do have regrets. I regret that inflation got out of
control at the end of the 1980s. I regret the hardship that getting down
inflation has caused. But I do not regret taking the tough but necessary
decisions that getting inflation down has caused.'
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said Mr Lamont's 'gesture of regret'
would have been welcome if accompanied by a change of policy - but there was
no change.
The chancellor concluded by saying the government had to keep its nerve
'when all our enemies want and expect us to lose it'. That meant 'sticking
together when they want us to fall apart'.
But the polite reaction of Tory party activists did nothing to dispel the
question mark over Mr Lamont's political future.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, acknowledged that private conversations
among members of the royal family had probably been bugged but categorically
rejected reports that the security services had been involved.
His comments followed the latest controversy over the publication of an
alleged conversation between the Prince and Princess of Wales, supposed to
have taken place at Highgrove, the prince's Gloucestershire home, at a time
when the couple's children were also there. Mr Clarke, responding to concern
from MPs, said he would not set up an inquiry into the allegations.
Last night Buckingham Palace threw doubt on the alleged Highgrove
conversation. A spokesman said a check on the royal diaries had shown the
couple and their children were at no stage together there at the time in
question.

FT  13 MAY 93 / MPs call for Pounds 2 cut in price of CDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CUT of at least Pounds 2 in the dealer price of compact discs and an
inquiry into restrictions on CD imports were urged by a Commons select
committee yesterday.
The national heritage committee, chaired by the Labour MP Mr Gerald Kaufman,
said that while it had 'found no evidence of formal or overt collusion, it
considers that the major record companies and the retailers are effectively
cartels, and indeed partly interlocking cartels'.
It concluded that music companies which gave evidence to an inquiry by the
committee last month had not provided adequate explanations why full-price
CDs sold for between Pounds 1.50 and Pounds 2 less in the US than in the UK.
The companies had been even less convincing in explaining why dealer prices
for full-price CDs were Pounds 2.50 higher than the equivalent cassettes
when production costs were the same.
Mr John Deacon, director-general of the British Phonographic Industry, which
represents UK music companies, said he was not surprised by the committee's
report.
He added: 'In the biased and prejudiced way the Kaufman committee chose to
take evidence, there was never a likelihood that there would be a fair
debate on the issues.'
The committee's report is expected to be followed in the next few days by a
recommendation by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, that
the music industry should be investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The committee said a Pounds 2 cut in dealer prices 'is the minimum that is
required'. It also criticised retailers for not using their power to demand
lower prices from manufacturers. It asked the Department of Trade and
Industry to investigate whether import restrictions and copyright law had an
anti-competitive effect.
The committee accepted that small independent companies had high costs and
would not survive if they reduced prices substantially.
It added that it had received evidence that some independent producers had
seen their products sold by retailers at a higher price than they wished.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Carclo agreed offer values Lee at Pounds
55m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARCLO Engineering Group yesterday made a recommended offer for Arthur Lee &amp;
Sons, valuing the Sheffield-based manufacturer of steel and plastic products
at Pounds 55m.
Leeds-based Carclo, which already had a 29.9 per cent stake in Lee, said it
now spoke for 49 per cent of the ordinary shares, after receiving
acceptances from directors and other shareholders.
Carclo is offering seven shares for every nine Lee. In addition, Lee
shareholders will receive a special interim dividend of 4p. There is a cash
alternative, fully underwritten by Fleming, of 151.7p for each Lee share.
Separate cash offers will be made of 208p for Lee's A preference and 146p
for the B preference.
Carclo's shares, which had been suspended at 223p on Monday, yesterday
closed 13p down at 210p, valuing its bid at 163.3p per share. Shares in
Arthur Lee, which had been suspended at 142p, closed 16p higher at 158p.
Mr John Ewart, Carclo chairman, said: 'I am delighted that a merger between
our two new companies has been agreed on terms that we expect in due course
will enhance the earnings per share for Carclo shareholders.
'The combined management expertise together with the broader range of
businesses will provide shareholders in the enlarged group with an enhanced
investment in a financially strong engineering business.'
Mr Peter Lee, chairman of Arthur Lee, said: 'The terms of the merger give
our shareholders good value for their shares, including an opportunity to
participate in the growth of the enlarged group which I believe has
excellent prospects.'
Mr Ewart said considerable benefits would arise from the combination of the
two companies' wire and wire rope businesses, and increased buying power.
Carclo's head office in Leeds, which is coming to the end of its lease, will
be combined with Arthur Lee's offices at Sheffield.
Five Lee directors, two of whom are non-executive, will join the Carclo
board with Mr Lee becoming deputy chairman. Mr Graham Logan Brown, currently
Carclo's deputy chief executive, will become managing director.
Carclo estimated that for the year to March 31, its pre-tax profits were not
less than Pounds 8m and earnings per share were at least 13.6p. Lee said
that its pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 were not less than
Pounds 2.1m and earnings per share at least 4p.
Carclo is being advised by Flemings, while NM Rothschild is acting for Lee.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Martinez moves quickly to bring
a new vision to Sears, Roebuck - Laurie Morse and Nikki Tait examine the
embattled US retailers' new merchandising chief's attempts to reposition in
the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, one of the largest and most heavily criticised companies in
the US, will tomorrow confront its shareholders. The annual meeting, in
Kansas, promises to be flinty, though it is unlikely to be as contentious as
in previous years.
Institutional shareholders are likely to take a soft line on the shopkeeping
side of the business and, instead, focus their anger on the failures and
foibles of Mr Edward Brennan, Sears' chairman.
In the past 10 months, Mr Brennan has been forced to abandon his vision of
Sears as an integrated financial company selling 'stocks and socks'.
As the financial businesses are spun off - Dean Witter and Discover Card
operations were sold in a popular public offering last quarter - Sears is
returning to its merchandising roots.
To the relief of shareholders, America's retailing dowager is undergoing a
long-overdue facelift. In a last-ditch effort to retrieve sagging lines and
return its large retailing operations to profitability, Chicago-based Sears
is offering cosmetics and fragrances, silk blouses, where once it offered
staples such as tools and hardware in its mall-based stores.
These signs of a fundamental overhaul are being orchestrated by Mr Arthur
Martinez, Sears' new merchandising chief, who arrived from Saks Fifth Avenue
seven months ago. Despite the brevity of his tenure, he has moved quickly.
He has wielded the axe. Sears' 97-year-old catalogue has been dropped, more
than 50,000 employees have been made redundant, and 113 of the company's 850
stores have been closed.
The cuts, reckoned to add Dollars 300m to annual profits, have been
applauded on Wall Street, where the retailer has been accused of feinting
reform for 15 years. Sears' shares have risen from around Dollars 37 a year
ago to around Dollars 55 - one reason shareholder discontent may be less
pronounced at the annual meeting.
Mr Martinez has also unveiled plans to spend Dollars 4bn over the next five
years refurbishing stores and to make them attractive to the nation's middle
class, and increasingly female, shoppers. Furniture and hardware lines will
be shifted, in some cases to free-standing Homelife stores which will
compete with specialty chains such as Home Mart and Ikea.
All Dollars 4bn must come from group operating profits. Mr Martinez says
that, to fund the strategy, 'we are not dependent on the parent company, or
the fortunes of other subsidiaries, like Allstate'.
Analysts say the affable executive has made all the right moves so far.
Retailing consultant Leo J. Shapiro says: 'He's taken the important first
step, which is getting Sears to stop doing things wrong.'
But no one, least of all Mr Martinez, pretends that repositioning Sears' 740
remaining stores will be easy. He is saddled with retail properties of
diverse standards situated in mid-market malls of 1960s and 1970s vintage.
His target shopper, the middle class woman, is not used to finding glamour
at Sears while shifting hardware lines elsewhere might alienate faithful
male shoppers.
But Sears' re-positioning efforts may be inadequate. Wal-Mart Stores, the
aggressive discount retailer, has a capital expenditure budget averaging
about Dollars 2bn a year and K mart is spending Dollars 3bn to renovate its
discount stores.
Part of Sears' problem is that discount store competitors continue to
undercut prices, while specialty retailers are building ever-larger
superstores and attracting shoppers with larger product ranges.
Many traditional department stores, meanwhile, have moved upmarket,
stressing service levels in an effort to better the discounters. 'Our
biggest vulnerability is the distance we have to come,' says Mr Martinez.
The figures reveal the scale of the task. Last year, the core retailing
operations made a tiny Dollars 55m profit. Total revenues from the
merchandising division were Dollars 32bn. Credit operations then contributed
Dollars 411m, leaving the net profits for the division (before non-recurring
items) at Dollars 271m.
Same-store sales growth was inconsistent, sagging badly in the early-summer
but recovering towards the year-end.
Despite Mr Martinez's aggressive cuts, Sears' selling costs still take 28
cents out of every dollar of sales compared with about 16 cents at Wal-Mart
and about 20 cents at K mart.
Analysts suggest Sears is targeting an expense ratio of 22 per cent within
three years, which would rival other department stores and specialty chain
operators. It will need to achieve steady sales gains to hit that target.
Analysts note that previous cost cuts - all Dollars 1bn-worth - were simply
counteracted by lower margins.
The 57-year-old Mr Martinez knows competitors will not wait while Sears
catches up. 'The pace of change in this business gets faster and faster each
year,' he says, estimating he has about a year to show results before Wall
Street critics rise again.
Taking out the high-cost catalogue business should significantly cut selling
costs, alongside attempts to lighten Sears' cumbersome buying organisation.
This cut to the heart of Sears' culture. Last century, the retail operation
was founded on the catalogue business and executives were reluctant to
abandon it - even though it had been bleeding about Dollars 150m a year for
the past eight years. Mr Martinez's advantage is that he is an outsider.
This is a sharp contrast to Mr Brennan, who surrendered the merchandising
division's reins after fumbling two reform attempts. Mr Martinez says he has
Mr Brennan's full support for his reforms, but he is emphatic that the plan
to reposition Sears in the market is completely his own.
He has also been replacing old Sears hands with new blood, particularly in
his marketing department, and is conducting a competition to determine which
agency should win Sears's lucrative advertising business.
But, somewhere down the line, Mr Martinez must bring forth some fresh ideas.
One possibility stems from his belief that paper catalogues are becoming
obsolete; so Sears must position itself for video shopping.
'Interactive home shopping may be finally, finally coming into its own,' Mr
Martinez says. 'I've got board support to commit some research and
development dollars in this area.'
Sears is part-owner of the Prodigy home computer network, and its Craftsman
tools are pitched on the Philadelphia-based QVC television shopping channel.
Radical ideas, such as video shopping, are the kind of risky long shots
analysts say are necessary if Sears is to leapfrog its rivals. However, with
department stores such as Macy's already on that trail, Mr Martinez may
again find himself trying to catch up.

<TEXT>
SAKURA, the Japanese bank, and Dellsher Investment, the Chicago futures and
options clearing firm, have received US Federal Reserve approval to merge.
Sakura, which was formed in 1990 with the merger between Mitsui Bank and the
Taiyo Kobe Bank, offered to become Dellsher's majority shareholder in 1991,
but the deal was delayed by US regulatory reviews.
The new firm, Sakura Dellsher, will be a clearing member of the CME and the
Chicago Board of Trade. Sakura's consolidated assets of Dollars 449bn will
give strong backing to Dellsher in the derivatives business, which demands
large amounts of capital.
Dellsher, owned by Mr Leo Melamed, one of the founding fathers of Chicago
futures, is a small firm with an estimated Dollars 4m to Dollars 5m in
assets.
Mr Kenichi Suematsu, president of Sakura, said: 'The competence of Dellsher,
coupled with the unique qualifications of Mr Melamed, will afford our
clients with outstanding access to global financial futures and options
markets.'

<TEXT>
SPRECHER and Schuh, the Swiss electrical engineering group, reported a loss
of SFr9m (Dollars 6m) for 1992 compared with a loss of SFr9.5m in 1991.
The loss was mainly due to the weakness of the group's low-voltage
electromechanical controls business, which has since been sold to Rockwell
International of the US.
As a result of the cash proceeds from the disposal, the company proposes
increased dividends of SFr50 per registered share and SFr250 per bearer
share. Dividends in future will be similar to 1990's SFr16 and SFr80
respectively.

Swedish tobacco sales, losses from hotels and one-off lease settlement costs
for a 20 per cent fall in first-quarter profits.
Profits after financial items fell to SKr893m from SKr1.12bn in the same
1991 period, disappointing stock market expectations. The B shares fell Skr4
to close at SKr169.
Sales were virtually static at SKr9.55bn (Dollars 1.3bn), although on a
pro-forma basis they rose 10 per cent. Income from ongoing operations fell 4
per cent to SKr963m from SKr1.01bn.
The group said a 20 per cent fall in Swedish tobacco sales in the first
quarter was a significant reason for the downturn - the result of hoarding
prior to an increase in tobacco tax at the end of last year.
It saw an increase in one-off costs to SKr83m from SKr3m, largely because of
an early settlement of a lease. It incurred a SKr150m deficit from its share
of losses in the Sara Travel and Hotel group, in which it holds 46.4 per
cent.
On the plus side, the group benefited from currency gains totalling SKr180m.
The weaker Swedish currency had a particularly positive impact on Kabi
Pharmacia, which increased sales by 16 per cent to SKr3.95bn from SKr3.40bn
and lifted lifted operating income to SKr779m from SKr746m. Sales growth was
particularly marked in the UK and Spain, although prices were generally
under heavy pressure.
Last week, Kabi finalised a deal to buy the Italian pharmaceutical group
Erbamont in a deal worth up to Dollars 1.3bn.
Procordia's second-biggest unit, United Brands, lifed sales by 47 per cent
to SKr1.96bn from SKr1.33bn, but operating income slumped 43 per cent to
SKr118m from SKr207m. The fall came in spite of the inclusion of Swedish
Match, which the group acquired last August, and reflected the drop in
income from tobacco.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Amnesty in rights call for indigenes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INDIGENOUS people suffer grave human rights abuses including massacre and
torture in more than 70 countries, Amnesty International said yesterday,
Reuter reports.
'They have been massacred and terrorised, forced from their ancestral lands,
caught up in bitter civil conflicts, and left without redress for the abuses
they suffer,' the London-based human rights organisation said.
The United Nations has designated this year as International Year of the
World's Indigenous People, and will hold a UN conference on human rights in
Vienna in June.
But for the 300m indigenes from Vietnam to the US threatened by rights
abuses, this may not be enough, the Amnesty report said.
'Unless the international community acts urgently there is a danger the UN's
International Year will. . . pass without significant progress towards
protecting indigenous people,' it said.
These people are often caught up in the crossfire between government troops
and armed opposition groups, the group said.
In Peru, indigenous people have suffered torture and killing on a massive
scale. Security forces killed villagers from several small communities in
September 1990 because they refused to join civil defence patrols.
'Cases like this, where those guilty of killing, abducting and torturing
indigenous peoples are shielded from justice, are common in many countries
around the world,' Amnesty said.
Human rights abuses in Bangladesh, India and Sudan were also cited in the
report. In Brazil, an Indian leader was shot dead last December because he
opposed logging operations inside indigenous areas. His killer was
identified but not arrested.
Last April scores of tribal villagers in Bangladesh were reportedly shot
dead by armed civilians and paramilitaries who had set fire to their homes.
Babies were snatched from their mothers' arms and thrown into the flames,
Amnesty said.
Indigenous people were tortured or killed by hired gunmen for their lands
and this was often done with the tacit support of the authorities, the
report said.
But it was not only third world countries which were criticised in the
report. Aborigines in Australia were arrested at a rate 29 times higher than
that of other Australians, and reports of police harassment were widespread.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Afghans fuel war on ex-Soviet territory: Tajikistan's
Islamic rebels find ready allies to take on former communists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING a month of combat training, Ismatullah was posted as a guard
outside a new office in the Afghan city of Taloqan - the headquarters of the
Islamic Renaissance party of Tajikistan. However, he is unlikely to be there
for long.
He and hundreds of other Tajiks, assisted by Afghan leaders, plan to return
to their native country, 50 miles north, to try to depose the former Soviet
government. 'When the snow melts, in about a month, we will go back to
Tajikistan and fight,' Ismatullah said.
A comrade named Manon agreed: 'People think communism has been destroyed.
But they are being stupid. It is still alive in central Asia. But if we are
victorious, it will die.'
Until a year ago, when Afghanistan's government fell in an Islamic
revolution, Taloqan was the guerrilla headquarters of Mr Ahmad Shah Massoud,
known as the 'Lion of the Panjshir'. Since then, however, Mr Massoud has
become the Afghan defence minister, and has opened his capital to
like-minded friends in ex-Soviet Tajikistan. There, the Tajiks receive
uniforms, weapons and training, along with encouragement to emulate the
successful Afghan revolt. 'To stop the bloodshed and make the region stable,
the whole world should help us remove these bandits from power,' said the
IRP leader, Mr Saeed Abdullah Noori, 45, a soft-spoken Islamic scholar.
'We are asking the United States to pressure the government to step down and
allow the people to decide their fate through elections.' Through their
backing for the rebels in the year-old Tajik civil war, the Afghans have
broadened the conflict, attracting foreign military backing to both sides.
Fearing the Islamic-led rebels, Russia and Uzbekistan have given armour and
MiG fighter aircraft to the Tajik government in Dushanbe.
Thousands of Russian and troops from neighbouring Uzbekistan are also massed
on Tajikistan's southern border, the Amu Darya river, to block the
Afghan-based rebels from returning home to fight.
Hostility toward the Uzbeks is already apparent among the 60,000-strong
Tajik refugee population in Afghanistan, forced from their country as
suspected opposition supporters. Tajikistan and Uzbekistan share large
populations of each other's ethnic groups, and long-feared violence between
them could flare at any time.
A Tajik named Abdul Kahor, for one, cannot forget how his village of Shartus
was attacked. 'Their tanks and helicopters pushed all of Shartus towards the
border. Uzbeks from Shartus helped. Many of us drowned in the river,' he
said. 'Now we are thinking of revenge.'
The Tajik republic of 5m people has been racked by clan warfare since the
Soviet Union dissolved in 1991 and the republic gained its independence. The
fighting has pitted regional clans associated with democratic and Islamic
forces such as the IRP against others connected with the former communist
leadership.
The hardliners finally consolidated power in December, after thousands of
Tajiks died and 350,000 were displaced, including those who fled to
Afghanistan. Like all of Afghanistan's key figures, Mr Massoud insists he
provides only humanitarian aid to the Tajiks. But IRP fighters in Taloqan
said Mr Massoud's Shura Nazar (supervisory council), provided their two-acre
compound, their military training and weapons.
The men's crisp, new fatigues are identical to those worn by Mr Massoud's
men in the Afghan capital of Kabul. Mr Massoud has had little choice. He is
himself an ethnic Tajik, and is not alone in supporting the rebels.
Aid also comes from the Arab-financed Afghan parties Ittehad-i-Islami and
Hezb-i-Islami. The latter is run by Afghanistan's prime minister designate,
Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
'We have already trained about 1,000 of them,' Mr Mohammed Zaman, a
Hezb-i-Islami leader, said. 'If this is really an Islamic government, we
should help our brothers. Most of the people who have been trained have
already gone back to Tajikistan.'
If the Russian and Uzbek support continues, the Tajik rebels will face a
difficult time against superior forces.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Hungarian right calls for border revision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONALIST members of Hungary's parliament have refused to renounce
Hungarian territorial demands against Ukraine, indicating that border issues
will continue to dog the country's foreign policy.
A treaty confirming the existing border between the neighbours has inspired
resistance from a far-right minority within Hungary's governing conservative
coalition. The bilateral agreement with the Ukraine was ratified yesterday
by a large majority after a tortuous parliamentary passage.
Earlier in the week rebel MPs argued for the revision of borders with one
calling for the 'peaceful reunification' of the Carpathian basin, the extent
of Hungary until 1920.
The government argued convincingly that the agreement, by enshrining rights
for Ukraine's Hungarian minority, was worthwhile. Those openly seeking the
return of territories are a small minority both among MPs and the Hungarian
population as a whole.
Nevertheless, this week's acrimonious debate has drawn attention to the
lingering bitterness that most Hungarians feel about the loss of two-thirds
of the country's territory after the first world war - land in which more
than 3m ethnic Hungarians still live.
Hungary's current political wrangling over the accord with Ukraine moreover
foreshadows potentially graver disputes with other neighbours. Budapest,
which has prided itself on model ties with Ukraine, starts from a far worse
position in treaty talks with Romania, Slovakia and, eventually, Serbia.
Hungary and Romania, in which about 2m Hungarians live, are deadlocked on
the same issue of border guarantees and have failed to conclude a basic
agreement.
Budapest argues that it adheres to the multilateral Helsinki agreements
which renounce the modification of frontiers by force and that this
commitment is sufficient.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CZECH economic reforms have progressed well, but Prague faces difficulties
in its relations with western Europe, according to Mr Vaclav Klaus, the
republic's prime minister.
'We are not facing an economic crisis, the worst is behind us,' he said in
an interview with Lidove Noviny, the Czech daily. He rejected forecasts of a
sharp rise in unemployment and difficult times as economic reforms take
hold.
Mr Klaus said some reforms had been delayed for practical reasons and not
for lack of will to transform the economy. The recent introduction of a
bankruptcy law had been delayed by at least six months because of the
dissolution of the former Czechoslovakia. Housing reform had also been more
difficult to implement than expected.
But the radical reform of property relations had been accomplished
successfully and without social upheavals, Mr Klaus continued. 'In all
countries of central and eastern Europe (social instability) has been much
worse.'
He was more cautious about the Czech Republic's relations with the European
Community. 'I am a Euro-pessimist,' Mr Klaus said, noting what he saw as the
growing power of protectionist lobbies within the Community.
Prague wants to join the Community this decade, but officials have been
increasingly irritated by EC ceilings on Czech and other east European
exports to the Community. These limits affect steel, textiles and
agricultural produce.

FT  12 MAY 93 / German recycling bill draws criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S plan to force industrial producers to recycle their consumer goods
could run into the ground in the face of growing criticism from industry
lobbyists and parliamentarians.
The plan, drafted into a bill last month, is unlikely to receive
parliamentary support in its present form, following a review this week by a
parliamentary committee in charge of environmental affairs.
Opposition Social Democrats and the Free Democrats, the junior party in the
coalition, say the bill allows too much state intervention in the economy
and could be detrimental to the environment in the long-run.
'Price signals are more efficient than legal standards in driving
enterprises to find efficient recycling methods for their products,' Ms
Birgit Homburger, a liberal MP said.
Their arguments are similar to those of the German industry federation which
has been campaigning fiercely against the government plan. The federation
has particularly been warning against the additional costs the law would
bring on German enterprises.
'The prevention of waste must be left to individual enterprises which know
about the complicated manufacturing processes. General legal instructions
can instead lead to short-term and wrong solutions,' the federation said in
a statement on Monday.
The bill, the first of its kind in Europe, makes industrial manufacturers
responsible for collecting and recycling the goods they sell. The
Environment Ministry hopes the law will force industry to create goods which
can be recycled and reduce the increasing amount of industrial waste it
produces.
Striking engineering workers said yesterday they would resume talks with
employers tomorrow that could end a controversial nine-day-old strike in
eastern Germany, Reuter adds.
But the powerful IG Metall union was preparing for mass demonstrations in
the west today to support the strikers, who have been pressing employers to
resolve a dispute over broken management wage promises.

FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bright close to a lacklustre session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DULL trading session was suddenly enlivened just before the close when a
rally in early trading on Wall Street proved sufficient to lift the UK stock
market from weakness to a modest gain. But equity strategists remained
cautious, aware that the market is poised for the pricing this morning of
the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue of Zeneca shares which opens the road to the
demerger from ICI.
Traders hesitated to applaud the late upswing, which left the FT-SE 100
Index with a gain on the day of 6.3 at 2,836.1. However, there were hints
from the stock index futures market that a large buyer had shown up and was
expected to continue his operations today. More sceptical sources noted that
the UK stock market may be merely confirming its recovery from the lower end
of an established trading range.
A senior figure at one of the London stockbroker firms commented: 'The UK
stock market is still dominated at present by trends in the derivatives
markets.'
For most of the session, share prices were on the downside in fairly
unexciting trading. Losses were extended in the afternoon when the Footsie
showed a fall of 6.2 at 2,823.6 after New York had opened easier. However,
by the time London closed for the day the Dow Average was about four points
ahead.
The tone of the session remained much as it has been for the past week. A
small - Pounds 22.5m - rights issue from Avon Rubber had little direct
effect, although it reminded the market of its fears of fund-raising in both
equities and government bonds and focused attention even more on today's
news on the Zeneca issue.
Also disappointing London was New York's failure overnight to live up to the
high promise displayed as the UK market closed on the previous evening.
Also, firmness in sterling appeared to imply reduced expectations of a base
rate cut.
On the corporate scene, insurance issues brightened after General Accident
reported more than satisfactory first-quarter trading figures. But the
overall market was slow to respond to GenAcc's news, or to a handful of
minor corporate deals; Inchcape paid more than Pounds 40m for a 15.3 per
cent stake in Gestetner, Alco bid Pounds 67.4m for Erskine House and Carclo
paid Pounds 57m for Arthur Lee.
Trading volume was very unimpressive for most of the day, although business
jumped smartly when the market moved higher at the close. The day's Seaq
total of 676.9m shares compared with 587.5m on Monday when retail, or
customer, business only just scraped above the Pounds 1bn mark now regarded
as the minimum acceptable daily total.
Some strategists regarded yesterday's performance, and especially the late
recovery, as confirmation that the market has established a trading range
and is now rallying from the low end, which is put at around the Footsie
2,770 mark.
At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall sees the current rally as taking the
index no further than 2,860. While political pressures continue to pile on
the UK government of Mr John Major, economic news this week has been more
favourable.
The fall of 1 per cent in producer input prices last month suggests that
'much of the devaluation effect' has now fed through into costs, according
to Nikko Securities.

FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shell wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News of a potential disposal helped Shell Transport ahead of first-quarter
figures due tomorrow. Analysts were enthusiastic at the announcement that
the group was hoping to sell most of its metals assets to Gencor, of South
Africa, and the shares ticked up sharply shortly before the close to gain a
net 10 at 581p.
Hoare Govett was a keen buyer, arguing that as with BP the first-quarter
figures would beat most expectations. The house added that the company was
well exposed to cyclical recovery through its chemicals side and should
receive benefits from currency shifts.
Meanwhile, Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said the sale could 'raise in
excess of Dollars 1bn' and prompt a turnround of about Pounds 140m in taxed
profits. Analyst Mr John Toalster said: 'This is a major development and
shows the company is being more responsive to shareholders' needs.'
ICI shed 21 to 1263p as the UK view of today's rights issue pricing for
ICI's biosciences arm, Zeneca, took precedence over the more optimistic US
stance. ICI's advisers were said to be testing a range of 550p to 650p for
Zeneca's Pounds 1.3bn cash call.
Glaxo Holdings rebounded from a small early loss to close 21 better at 634p
in a flat market following a meeting between pharmaceutical analysts and the
company's new management. NatWest Securities was a strong buyer. Fisons was
2 lower at 172p following a downgrade by SGST, which decided its view of the
group's scientific instruments business was too optimistic. The house cut
its 1993 profits forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 130m and its 1994 estimate
to Pounds 150m from Pounds 170m.
Insurer General Accident rose 18 to 591p after the company announced
first-quarter profits well above most analysts' expectations. The company
made Pounds 41.9m, against a loss of Pounds 29m a year earlier.
Among engineering stocks, the late news that VSEL had won the contract to
build the Royal Navy's new LPH helicopter carrier took the market by
surprise. It led to a hectic bout of trading and caused a backwardation  - a
situation in which the bid and the offer price are temporarily reversed. By
the close the shares had jumped 35 to 725p.
Monday's suspension of dealings in Arthur Lee and Carclo pending an
announcement was lifted after confirmation that the latter was to make an
agreed bid for the former. Lee forged ahead 16 to 158p and Carclo gave up 13
at 210p. William Cook moved in sympathy with Lee, adding 12 at 174p.
A Pounds 22.5m rights issue from motor components and tyre manufacturer Avon
Rubber caused the shares to drop 31 to 501p as the company unveiled a 22.2
per cent increase in interim profits. GKN shed 5 to 452p, with SG Warburg
said to have downgraded profits expectations, and NatWest Securities
negative on the motor sector as a whole.
The fading bid talk around United Biscuits turned investor attentions back
to more fundamental considerations in the sector and Cadbury Schweppes
gained 6 at 449p and Tate &amp; Lyle added 6 at 388p. UB lost 9 to 425p.
A big buyer in Iceland Frozen Foods helped the shares climb 15 to 683p.
Profit-taking continued in Ratners, the shares declining 5 to 35p with 18m
traded.
RMC Group jumped 15 to 700p with SGST positive and Cazenove, its joint
broker, said to have upgraded.
Shares in office equipment distributor Erskine House leapt 54 to 89p after
the announcement of an agreed takeover bid from Alco Standard Corporation,
of the US, for Pounds 67.4m. Eurocopy firmed 4 in sympathy.
Recent speculation that Inchcape had its eye on Gestetner, the office and
photographic equipment distributor, was confirmed by news that it was taking
a 15.3 per cent stake in the latter. Gestetner shares closed 7 ahead at 130p
while those of Inchcape fell 8 to 583p on the news.
Media conglomerate Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, receded 7 to 436p
as Hoare Govett reiterated its view that the stock was fully valued and
shareholders should switch into Reed International, up 9 at 658p.

FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unigate surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprise decision by Unigate to postpone the flotation of its US
restaurant business, which was announced only last month, hit sentiment in
the shares.
The company had hoped to raise up to Dollars 250m through the float, valuing
each share at between Dollars 15 and Dollars 17. However, market sources
suggested that although the pre-placing had taken place at the upper range
price, US institutional investors had baulked at this and offered only
Dollars 14 a share.
Unigate blamed poor weather conditions affecting sales for the postponement.
Food manufacturing analysts said another factor had been that a number of
poorly received small flotations in recent months in the US had soured
investor sentiment.
While Unigate said it intended to 'complete an IPO of the business at an
appropriate time', rumours in the market suggested Unigate might opt for a
trade sale, with PepsiCo tipped as a likely candidate. Unigate fell 12 to
353p. NatWest Securities moved the stock from long term outperform to
neutral.

FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pilkington hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Pilkington, the world's leading glassmaker, were hit in late
trading by a flurry of rumours concerning its US arm.
The rumours surrounding Libbey-Owens-Ford, the 100-year-old Ohio glassmaker,
ranged from insider trading to FBI involvement. After the UK market closed,
Pilkington confirmed that the chief executive and two vice-presidents of
Libbey-Owens had been suspended pending an internal inquiry. The company
said there was no 'evidence of major financial loss', but that there were
allegations that the men had 'failed to follow corporate procedure'.
One analyst commented: 'The market will not be particularly happy until it
knows what the reasons are behind these executives being removed. Until
then, people will guess and guess the worst.'
Pilkington, which owns 80 per cent of Libbey, saw its shares slide 5 to
128p.

FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Doubts on Sainsbury DIY talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL specialists were mostly sceptical of rumours in the market yesterday
that J. Sainsbury was considering buying the Do It All interests of WH
Smith.
Sainsbury already owns the profitable Homebase DIY business and is known to
have been looking for well-placed sites. One stores analyst said he believed
that Sainsbury may have approached Smith to purchase selected stores, but
that talk of a full-scale offer was probably wide of the mark.
Smith owns the Do It All chain in a joint venture with Boots. The business
has suffered as the recession has squeezed margins in the highly competitive
sector and analysts had pencilled in losses of around Pounds 28m for this
year. While Smith had been considered by the market as the more reluctant
partner in the venture, many specialists had been predicting a buyout by
Boots as the most likely development.
It was also pointed out that the drugs group has first refusal on any deal
by Smith and was not likely to want to swap one partner for another. Nor, it
was argued, was it in keeping with Sainsbury's strategy to buy a 50 per cent
stake in a rival business.
Finally, a Sainsbury offer for a stake in a heavily indebted group such as
Do It All would be seen as bad for its own shares; in fact, they rose
yesterday, closing 13 ahead at 481p in 4.1m turnover. NatWest Markets,
Henderson Crosthwaite and Panmure Gordon were recommending the stock ahead
of today's full year results. Boots held at 439p and WH Smith 'A' shed 7 to
458p.

FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE spate of active buying on the back of an improved Wall Street was the
only feature in an otherwise dull day in the derivatives market, writes Joel
Kibazo.
In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened strongly at
2,843, a 15-point premium to the underlying cash market.
However, this early strength soon fizzled out, leaving the contract to drift
lower. It traded in a 10-point range between 2,830 and 2,840 for the next
few hours.
Further selling during the afternoon saw June fall below the morning's
trading range and it reached the day's low of 2,823 at around 3.15pm.
It was the buying spree that followed the recovery of Wall Street that
brought about an upturn in the June contract and it ended at 2,842, up 1
from its previous close and around 3 above its fair value premium to cash of
about 5. Turnover was 8,063 lots, although dealers suggested that a big
buyer today may boost turnover.
The traded options saw reduced volume of 26,243 contracts with the index
options once again the most active. Some 8,525 lots were dealt in the FT-SE
100 option and 4,818 in the Euro FT-SE. Glaxo was the busiest stock option
with a total of 1,409 trades, followed by BP at 1,083. British Airways was
also active.
Dealings will begin today in an additional seven stock options.

FT  12 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages late surge on
program buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER drifting in narrow trading ranges for most of the day, US stocks ended
with solid gains yesterday, thanks to a late burst of program buying, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.47 at 3,468.75,
having spent almost the entire day only a few points above opening values.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion,
finishing 1.56 ahead at 444.36, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.24 firmer
at 683.06. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 221.5m shares, while
rises outpaced declines by 1,059 to 859.
Once again the absence of fresh economic news, or a lead from either
overseas equity markets or from a becalmed US bond market, left investors
searching for inspiration at the opening. Although prices rose sharply on
Monday morning, the buying was mostly technical in nature and by the end of
the day the Dow had registered a gain of only 6 points, which meant that the
markets' main index had barely moved for five trading days - a reflection of
investors' uncertainty about the outlook for the economy, corporate earnings
and stock prices.
This pattern was maintained for most of the day, with many investors
deciding to sit on the sidelines, at least until the next piece of economic
data - today's release of the April producer prices index. The Dow and the S
&amp; P suddenly took off, however, in the final hour of trading as computerised
buy programs lifted a range of leading stocks.
Anheuser Busch, the largest brewer in the US, climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 51 3/4 in busy trading on reports that beer may be exempted from
President Bill Clinton's proposed 'sin' taxes, which are likely to be levied
on cigarette and liquor sales.
Philip Morris, owner of the company which makes Miller Beer, the main
domestic competitor to Anheuser Busch's Budweiser brands, failed to receive
a lift from the news. Its shares declined Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 51 1/2 ,
primarily because of profit-taking in the wake of recent gains by the stock.
Bank shares were in favour as a group, posting gains across the board.
Citicorp added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 28 1/4 , Chemical Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 39 5/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 31.
On the Nasdaq market, technology stocks ran into sellers. Intel fell Dollars
3 to Dollars 99 1/2 on 3.7m shares traded after brokerage Kidder Peabody
lowered its investment rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'accumulate'.
Canada
TORONTO closed marginally higher as a rally in gold issues, underpinned by a
recovery in bullion futures prices, pulled the market up from earlier losses
and offset weakness in banking shares. Dealers said the overall tone was
lacklustre as the market consolidates from several months of gains and heavy
volumes.
The TSE 300 index was finally up 1.8 at 3,780.4 and rises led falls by 355
to 344. Turnover was 54.9m shares.
Thomson Corp slipped CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 15 3/8 . The company said Mr
Michael W. Johnston resigned as chief executive of Thomson Newspapers, one
of Thomson Corp's three major operating units.

FT  12 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Manila picks way round obstacles to new
heights - The recent equity market rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippine stock market appears to be taking a breather from a
record-breaking frenzy since late April.
However, analysts expect the rise to resume after the market consolidates
this week from an overbought position. The composite index closed yesterday
at 1,642, down from a record high of 1,654 on May 5.
Excess liquidity caused by a reduction in the volume of Treasury bills
auctioned by the Central Bank in early April has kindled interest in
equities.
According to Mr Francisco Liboro, research head at Belson Securities,
technical factors have also favoured a rise in the market. In spite of
optimism over the economy since early this year, the market had been trading
below the previous peak of 1,581 registered in June last year after the
country's first peaceful general election in 25 years.
The past two weeks' hectic trading has also pushed turnover to an average
510m pesos (Dollars 21.2m) a day in the first week of May, almost double the
usual volume.
The sharp increase in turnover is giving analysts reason to believe that the
market advance could be sustained for some time. However, fundamentals leave
much to be desired.
The government has scaled down this year's GDP target to 3.5 per cent from
4.5 per cent because of the adverse effects of the daily power cuts in the
main Luzon island, and the failure of a scheme to 'pump-prime' the economy
by advancing the implementation of infrastructure projects to the first half
of the year.
Even that goal may be difficult to attain. Mr Jose Pardo, president of the
Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says his organisation's
analysis suggests a 2.5 per cent growth in GDP this year because of the
power problem. But he adds that 'the real growth' should come late this year
when new power plants are expected to come on line.
Corporate earnings, earlier projected to grow by about 20 per cent this
year, have not moved as expected.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone, for instance, yesterday reported a 19
per cent decline in first-quarter net profits because of a sharp rise in
dividend payments to preferred shareholders during the period.
Optimism, however, is expected to be sustained by lower domestic interest
rates and inflation. Rates on Treasury bills dropped to 11.6 per cent on
average last week, compared with 15 per cent at the end of last year.
A bill now being debated in congress will establish a new Central Monetary
Authority that will replace the Central Bank. Designed to be able to
exercise more independence from the incumbent administrations, the new CMA
is seen as being more effective in further bringing down interest rates.
Since the start of the year the composite index has gained more than 30 per
cent, with such favourites as San Miguel advancing 51 per cent, Ayala 20 per
cent and PLDT 15 per cent. Among recently listed issues, Manila Electric has
already surged 106 per cent since the start of the year, and International
Container Terminal Services (ICTSI) 75 per cent.
Analysts expect such 'recession-proof' stocks as ICTSI and PLDT to continue
to lead any market advance in the coming months.
PLDT should benefit from the recent drop in the peso rate against the US
dollar: the peso has declined by as much as 7.5 per cent from its end-1992
level in spite of occasional central bank intervention.
At the height of last week's rally, the market was trading at a
price/earnings multiple of about 13. Analysts forecast that in a period of
economic recovery the market can grow to a p/e of at least 15. As such, most
analysts see room for further growth among equities. Brokerage houses are
already talking of a new high of 1,750 and if economic recovery gets under
way the target could be 1,800 by the end of the year.
A further decline in interest rates is expected to favour corporate
earnings, although a reversal of the current trend may develop in the third
quarter. Coinciding with a reduction in the bank reserves required against
deposits, this should lead to bigger amounts available for lending to
corporations.
On the other hand, the peso decline should boost earnings of export-oriented
companies, including some of the mining companies now largely ignored by
investors.

FT  12 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Land sale agreement
supports Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE yen's depreciation against the dollar failed to maintain Japanese share
prices at Monday's higher levels as arbitrage-related buying lost momentum
and dealers took profits in late trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 114.34 easier at 20,940.37, after a day's range of
20,932.34 and 21,224.78. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost
3.22 at 1,635,83, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.93 to
1,272.12.
Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was estimated at
700m shares, compared with a final 549m during the previous session. Rises
still showed a lead over declines at the close by 667 to 418, with 114
issues unchanged.
Investors are likely to avoid taking long positions in Tokyo before the bulk
of Japanese corporate earnings reports are released later this month,
brokers said.
Fears of unexpected downward company revisions, coupled with a lack of fresh
incentives, have placed a ceiling on the Nikkei's advance, they added.
However, market participants expect limited downside risk because
institutional investors tend to buy equities on dips and pension funds
managed by the government may serve to support share prices.
An analyst at a Japanese securities brokerage said domestic life insurance
companies were gradually increasing the percentage of equity holdings in
their portfolios, which would improve the chances for a sustained rally once
additional signs of an economic recovery surfaced.
In spite of the day's declines, the yen's downturn against the dollar
prompted investors to purchase export-related issues. Sony put on Y80 at
Y4,930, Pioneer Electronic Y70 at Y2,650 and TDK Y20 at Y4,000.
Profit-taking pushed carmakers lower: Nissan shed Y39 to Y780, Toyota Y20 to
Y1,720 and Isuzu Y8 to Y485.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 198.81 higher at 23,152.38 in volume of
31.6m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets managed a mostly firmer performance yesterday.
HONG KONG rallied as the Sino-British Land Commission agreed its land sales
programme for this year. The Hang Seng index was up 107.83, or 1.6 per cent,
at 6,847.06 after touching 6,872.79. Turnover came to HKDollars 4.2bn after
Monday's HKDollars 4.0bn.
Property issues led the rise. Cheung Kong and Henderson Land rose 70 cents
to HKDollars 27.30 and HKDollars 20.30 respectively.
AUSTRALIA received support from strength on Wall Street and demand for some
banking shares.
The All Ordinaries index appreciated 15.4 to 1,687.4 as hopes of an interest
rate cut encouraged investors.
Westpac jumped 14 cents to ADollars 3.77 and ANZ advanced 13 cents to
ADollars 3.80 on overseas buying. Brambles Industries, the transport group,
recouped Monday's loss which was prompted by a weak profits forecast,
rebounding 46 cents to ADollars 13.44.
SINGAPORE saw selected institutional buying which took the market index
higher while overall trade remained mixed. The Straits Times Industrial
index rose 22.02, or 1.24 per cent, to 1,794.04 in volume of 211.4m shares,
after 217.7m in the previous session.
KUALA LUMPUR was mixed to easier on profit-taking, with falls in some
leading component stocks weighing on the composite index, which finished
5.55 lower at 710.55.
BANGKOK edged higher in thin trade and the SET index gained 8.51 at 850.35
in turnover of Bt2.1bn. Among the actives, Bangkok Bank of Commerce firmed
Bt1 to Bt16.00.
NEW ZEALAND rebounded from Monday's fall on short-covering and bargain
hunting. The NZSE-40 index rose 8.55 to 1,565.59. Forestry stocks, which had
led the recent slide, firmed, with Fletcher Challenge up 1 cent to NZDollars
2.57.
KARACHI was higher after the government unveiled incentives to help the
textile industry, ranging from a cut in duties to more liberal financing.
The 100-share price index climbed 7.13 to 1,113.95.
BMA Capital Management in Karachi notes in its latest weekly review that
investor confidence has been improving amid repeated assurances by the
caretaker government on holding elections on time and under army
supervision.
BOMBAY gained ground on short-covering and the BSE index rose 62.37 to
2,289.31.

FT  12 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris off 1.2 per cent
following budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was widespread disappointment in France to the government's budget
proposals, detailed after the market closed on Monday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
As Mr Andrew Shepherd-Barron, analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London,
commented, many of the plans had been in the market last week and factored
into prices, leading to the market's underperformance over that period.
James Capel suggested that 'this budget is going to send France deeper into
recession in the short-term and provides little direct assistance to
equities which will have to rely on further rate cuts if it is to move
upwards.'
Morgan Stanley, taking up this theme, noted that high and growing
unemployment 'demands much lower real interest rates which the French, in
defending the franc fort, have been unable to deliver. German monetary
policy is therefore the key to the alleviation of this social tension'.
PARIS shed 1.2 per cent in reaction to the budget which did not provide the
hoped for stimulus to encourage equity investment by small investors. The
CAC-40 index closed off 22.69 at 1,854.52 in turnover of some FFr3bn.
Further evidence of disappointing first quarter sales came from Alcatel
Alsthom and the shares eased FFr13 to FFr627. Eurotunnel closed off FFr1.70
or nearly 5 per cent at FFr33.30 as the opening of the rail link receded
further.
FRANKFURT firmed on technical trading as dealers bought back shares after
the index failed to fall through the 1,600 level on Monday. The DAX index
rose 7.12 to 1,616.15 in turnover of DM6.6bn.
Volkswagen plunged DM6.60 to DM320.50 on further pessimism over the
company's future performance.
Veba, the utilities concern, rose DM5.30 to DM384 after a statement that the
company expected satisfactory results in spite of the weakening economy.
ZURICH drew strength from the firmer dollar and D-mark, which help export
earners, and the SMI index rose 13.5 to 2,192.6, near to its all-time high.
The market is seeing a return of foreign demand as well as funds being
switched from interest-bearing investment into stocks.
Mr S J Marshall Lockyer of Kleinwort Benson in London attributes the
market's current strength to a return of investorsentiment towards
pharmaceutical stocks. This followed the perception that Mrs Hillary
Clinton's exploration of US healthcare reform was becoming more sympathetic
to the pharmaceutical sector.
Roche certificates which have been recent strong performers, added SFr20 in
early trade before late profit-taking left them SFr10 easier at SFr4510.
Insurers were back in demand: registered shares in Zurich Insurance rose
SFr40 to SFr2,900 ahead of today's press conference at which a breakdown of
1992 figures will be presented.
MILAN edged lower, with trading held back by today's expiry of monthly
options contracts and Friday's end of the monthly account. The Comit index
shed 1.0 to 531.62 in turnover well down from recent levels at an estimated
L250bn.
Fondiaria, the insurer, was an exception, rallying L1,437 or 4.7 per cent to
L31,582 on speculation, confirmed late in the day, that it had finally sold
its 20 per cent stake in AMB, its German partner.
AMSTERDAM saw a strong performance from Elsevier, up Fl 1.80 at Fl 130.70,
after the group announced further acquisitions in both Europe and the US.
The CBS Tendency index lost 0.1 to 108.7.
BRUSSELS edged up amid low volume, with activity led by trading in Delhaize
which surged surged BFr38, or 3.3 per cent, to BFr1,196 on shortcovering by
foreign investors and speculative buying by dealers. The Bel-20 index added
3.22 to 1,190.78 in turnover of BFr1.25bn.
MADRID reversed recent weakness with a gain in the general index of 1.82 to
242.21 helped by strength in the banking and construction sectors. Turnover
was high at Pta18bn, compared with an average Pta11bn last week.
DUBLIN built on Monday's 1 per cent rise with a gain in the ISEQ index of
10.82 to 1,522.93, as some confidence returned following the completion of
the Greencore placing.
There was strength in financials with Irish Life and AIB both gaining 2 per
cent while Fyffes rose 5.5 per cent on news of a joint venture with a Canary
Island's group.
OSLO advanced on a stronger dollar and lower money market rates. The All
Share index rose 6.53 to 476.45 in turnover of NKr484m. Norsk Hydro rose
NKr3 to NKr174.5. The strength in the dollar helped the shipping sector up 9
to 456.14, with Kvaerner up NKr4 to NKr196.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Money easy in quiet day
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUIET day on the UK money markets saw overnight money drift down to 4 per
cent, and interbank rates slightly firmer.
Dealers said there was little reaction to reports that the government's
backbenchers were pushing for a cabinet reshuffle following the Conservative
party's disastrous performance in local elections last week. There was also
considerable scepticism that the chancellor would be replaced.
'Many of us wonder what the point of replacing him would be,' said one
dealer. 'Things are a mess, but most of the mess was created so long ago
that it is not really relevant to the present situation.'
A statement from the prime minister that he had 'not even begun' to
contemplate any changes to his cabinet made little difference to sentiment.
With dealers not yet convinced about the strength of economic recovery, many
expect the government to cut base rates again at some stage over the summer.
They are not, however, pushing their case particularly strongly and the
three-month interbank rate - a good guide to where the market thinks base
rates will be in three months' time - remained fairly steady at about 6 per
cent.
One dealer commented that speculation of an early rate cut to boost the
government's standing was premature.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn in the
morning which was partially relieved in the early round after the Bank
provided liquidity of Pounds 702m. The shortage was later revised to Pounds
1.4bn. Further operations, in which the Bank purchased Pounds 700m of bills,
removed the shortage in the afternoon. There was no late assistance.
Overnight rates started the day at about 5 1/2 per cent, declining later to
5 1/4 per cent and ending at about 4 per cent. Further out, three-month
money rates were slightly firmer at 6 per cent on the offered side and 5 7/8
per cent on the bid side.
The June sterling futures contract hit a high of 94.06 before finishing the
day at 94.05. Although the September contract dipped to a low of 94.10, it
firmed over the day to end a net two basis points higher at 94.16.
German call money was unchanged from the previous day's level of 7.75 per
cent in quiet trade, with the market expecting another small cut in the
Bundesbank's securities repurchase rates this week.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar holds on to gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR held on to recent gains against European currencies yesterday,
while the pound staged a respectable recovery from its post - local election
lows, writes Emma Tucker.
In a generally quiet day's trading, the dollar was firm against the D-Mark
at around DM1.61, traders still heartened by the currency's valiant
performance last week in the face of poor employment data. It finished New
York trading at DM1.6085.
None the less, the market remains wary of the dollar, with a number of
analysts saying they expect the latest rally to peter out at about DM1.62
unless there is some very positive US economic data soon.
A modest 2-pfennig recovery for the pound was fuelled by overseas buyers,
suggesting that foreign investors were not too bothered by the Conservative
party's spectacular defeat in the county council elections and Newbury by -
election.
Sterling slipped to around DM2.46 on Monday as domestic investors took
fright, but climbed back by the London close to DM2.48 yesterday, still
below last month's high but not by much.
News that UK housing starts rose strongly in the first quarter made little
impact on the currency. The pound closed against the dollar just under a
cent firmer at Dollars 1.5420.
The Bank of Spain dipped in and out of the market, buying pesetas for
D-Marks as the Spanish currency continued to come under selling pressure.
Mr Mark Austin of Midland Global Markets said: 'The fundamental problem with
the peseta is that the Spanish economy is very weak and the currency is
perceived as being overvalued.'
He added that the Spanish authorities were aiming to avoid a devaluation of
the currency before the general election next month. Before then, however,
the government will have to defend what is expected to be a very poor set of
first-quarter employment statistics - showing an unemployment rate of above
20 per cent - while maintaining interest rates of 15 3/4 per cent.
The Danish krone was under some pressure ahead of Tuesday's referendum on
Maastricht. Although the opinion polls are pointing to a majority 'yes'
vote, dealers said investors were not heavily exposed on the krone. 'The
most likely thing is that there will be a yes vote, but people are not
taking any risks,' said one.
The French franc showed little reaction to the 1993 mini-budget. Nor did
details of a bill making the Bank of France independent have any effect on
the currency. Dealers said the budget confirmed rumours of tax and spending
increases and contained no real surprises.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said French interest rates could
fall below Germany's given economic fundamentals: 'As our fundamentals
appear better than Germany's, nothing - and the Bundesbank chairman has said
this - prevents French rates falling under theirs.'

FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (7): Wide-ranging
consequences - Winners and losers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hundreds of hard-fought compromises which form the framework of the
North American Free Trade Agreement will have impacts far beyond what
negotiators have envisioned.
No one expected, for example, that a big beneficiary would be Pilkington
Brothers of the UK, the world's leading flat glass producer. Pilkington has
a 35 per cent share of Vitro, a Mexico-owned holding company which has
secured real gains in the deal.
The US flat glass industry is aghast at what it calls 'an enormous disparity
between the US and Mexican tariff rates.' With no apparent success thus far,
it has been urging the US Trade Representative to force Mexico to
renegotiate the flat glass provision of the Nafta.
This disparity is by no means a new one. The average US tariff on dutiable
imports of Mexican flat glass is 4.8 per cent. Mexican duty rates are 20 per
cent on most US flat glass. But the US industry is arguing that the gap
between the two will widen after the Nafta goes into effect.
Meanwhile, the US market is already oversupplied. 'Vitro's monopoly position
in the lucrative Mexican market permits it to use profits both to further
expand its capacity, aggressively acquire US firms and US market share and
expand its already highly developed distributional structure in the US,'
according to Mr John Reichenback Jr., an industry business analyst. 'Unless
the present tariff disparity is eliminated the US flat glass industry
estimates that the Mexican flat glass monopoly will capture at least 13 per
cent of the overall US flat glass market.'
Like the US flat glass industry, other Nafta losers are trooping up to
Capitol Hill to plead for changes in the pact. The winners, however, are
fighting to retain the advantages they have gained. Some sectors have both
winners and losers.
American agriculture is a loser and a gainer. Vegetable and fruit producers
in Florida are convinced their days in business are numbered if they have to
compete - even after a 15-year phase-out - with Mexican imports. US exports
of barley and maize and expected to soar. American soyabean meal will do
well, as will rice, wheat and fats and oils.
However, US sugar producers are up in arms about the pact, saying Mexico
will re-export to the US large quantities of cheap sugar imports.
According to the International Trade Commission, the US automotive parts
industry will gain considerably in the long term, but US car production will
be ultimately a loser.
Upon implementation of the pact, tariffs on US vehicles will be eliminated
immediately. The phase-out is longer - 10 years - for automotive parts.
Mexican tariffs on US cars and the rest will be phased out over 10 years.
Mexico's tariffs on 75 per cent of its imports of US automotive parts will
be eliminated over five years with the rest to be eliminated over 10 years.
American service industries, clearly advantaged by the pact, will have new
opportunities through both cross-border trade or investment in Mexican
enterprises. The ITC says US investment in Mexican telecommunication and
banking services could increase by 6 to 15 per cent. Investment in Mexican
transportation services could rise by even more over the long-term. Removal
of Mexico's restrictions on foreign equity ownership in the insurance market
may result in expansion of US investment by 16 per cent or more.
The US energy sector is a partial winner in the deal. Mexico resisted
opening most of its energy market for foreign participation, but where it
liberalised it will gain access to high quality foreign expertise and
equipment. According to a report to Congress by the Industry Policy Advisory
Committee, the Nafta will promote trade in natural gas by establishing the
right of all Nafta producers to negotiate supply contracts directly with
end-users.
The pact enables independent power producers and electric utilities to
negotiate power purchase and sales contracts; reduces the number of
petrochemicals reserved to the Mexican state to eight and makes the rest
available for 100 per cent foreign ownership; and provides for expanding
commercial arrangements in the electricity sector.
Over the short term, the US is likely to import more Mexican bearings,
household glassware and steel mill products. Its exports to Mexico will rise
in the following sectors: bearings, machine tools, steel mill products,
pharmaceuticals, industrial machinery, chemicals and household appliances.
In the long-run both the US and Mexico are expected to increase to each
other sales of vehicles, computers, textiles and apparel and ceramic tiles.
The pact has spurred hopes and anxieties in Latin America. There is concern
that the advantages Mexico will gain in some markets, such as sugar and
textiles, means losses for its southern neighbours, and that zero tariff
benefits granted to developing countries through the US Generalised System
of Preferences will be neutralised by Mexico. Investment which might have
gone to the Caribbean and other low-cost producers may be diverted, and in
Latin America Mexico will get the first boost towards acquiring the
technology of the 21st century.
The Clinton administration has been at pains to assure the Latin leaders
that it shares the vision of its Republican predecessor of a
hemispheric-wide free trade agreement. But it also being urged to look to
the Pacific Rim for free trade deals to discourage the formation of an
aggressive super-competitive Asian trade bloc.
Japan has expressed worry about the Nafta, but no external tariffs will be
raised against Japanese products. The rules of origin will make it more
difficult for Japanese companies to use Mexico as a springboard into the US
market.
The biggest losers may be those Asian countries whose cheap labour has been
the comparative advantage which draws foreign investment. Many companies
might now shift production to Mexico where there is additional gain in lower
transportation costs.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (10): Lessons from
earlier pact - The nuts and bolts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN US, Canadian and Mexican negotiators sat down to produce a framework
for the North American Free Trade Agreement, they had three years of
experience to draw on from the US-Canadian pact.
The first trade accord had worked well in most areas and had successfully
boosted trade. The bipartisan dispute settlement mechanism had been
successful in defusing a number of disputes - more often to the Canadians'
liking than the Americans' - but both sides saw the need for important
'clarifications' for the process of reviewing anti-dumping and
countervailing duty cases, said Mr Jules Katz, former Deputy US Trade
Representative.
Both agreements stress that 'consultation' is the best way to resolve
disputes, but they set timetables for settlement. In the Nafta, if a dispute
is not settled within 30 to 45 days, a government can request a meeting of
the cabinet-level, three-member free trade commission. If the commission
cannot solve a dispute, a panel is selected from a roster of trade, legal
and other experts.
Most cases were expected to concern all three countries, Mr Katz said.
Panels have four months to decide an issue and if a dispute is not resolved
within 30 days after that decision, then the injured country can impose
sanctions.
On the rules of origin question, there had been even more controversy and
even more concern about 'the pass-through' potential for foreign businesses
using Mexico as an export platform to the north. The US and Canada, having
fallen into a dispute about the level of domestic content in Hondas, were
both anxious to clarify the means of calculating the level of North American
content. Negotiators apparently learned well their lessons from the FTA.
When the agreement was finished, the Industry Policy Advisory Committee
which advises Congress on the impact of trade agreements, gave an
enthusiastic thumbs up: 'The Nafta rules of origin have a level of clarity
and detail for which the negotiators should be congratulated,' the advisers
said. 'The Nafta customs provisions represent an improvement over the FTA
and provide a sound basis for regulating and classifying goods.'
Basically, goods are considered to be made in North America if they are
manufactured there or products from elsewhere have been 'substantially
transformed' so that they are moved to a different tariff classification.
Special rules were devised for vehicles, computers and textiles. To meet the
concerns of Canada, which wants to give its vehicle factory-owners time to
adjust to stricter rules, the local content standard will remain 50 per cent
for four years, the current minimum under the FTA. It will then rise to 56
per cent for four more years and reach 62.5 per cent after eight years.
Mexico will phase out its 20 per cent computer tariff for the US and Canada
and will seek to harmonise its external tariff with the US and Canada,
lowering it to 3.9 per cent for all other countries. Computers will be
required to contain a North American-made motherboard, a big component that
usually accounts for 20-40 per cent of the value of the computer.
Mexico will phase out its tariffs for US and Canadian-made textiles and
apparel over five or six years. To qualify for tariff benefits, blue jeans,
blouses and other apparel will have to be made from yarn spun in North
America, and fabric would have to be made from North American fibres. Canada
and Mexico will be allowed to ship a specified amount of clothing and
textiles made from foreign materials to the US each year; the quota will
rise slightly over five years.
The Nafta - building on much of the work done in the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - has a high level of obligations on
intellectual property rights. Mexico agreed to protect foreign-registered
patents for pharmaceutical and other products for at least 20 years. This
has been met with some grumbling among elderly Americans, many of whom send
couriers to purchase large quantities of cheap medicine in Mexico.
Copyright protection for films, records and television will meet
international standards. One remaining problem is the illegal pirating of
satellite television broadcasts by Mexican cable systems. However, licensing
contracts with the systems have remedied the problem for the time being.
On investment, Mexico has agreed to liberalise many of its restrictions and
to treat US and Canadian companies equal in most areas. Mexican liberalism
has spurred a 10 per cent rise in foreign investment this year. During the
first two months of 1993, more than Dollars 1.68bn was invested in Mexican
manufacturing, services, retail, transportation, communications and stocks.
The US accounted for more than half of the total investment, followed by the
UK, France, Spain and Canada.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (8): Negligent
neighbours - Environmental Issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As trucks carry goods back and forth across the international bridges,
cities on both sides of the US-Mexican border suffer from the same smog, fed
by the same idling traffic.
Hazardous wastes dumped near the border by factories seep into the
groundwater, contaminating goods sold in both countries.
The Rio Grande is the main source of drinking water for Texans in the Lower
Rio Grande Valley. But every day Mexicans use the river as a depository for
raw sewage.
Environmental negligence is linking the two neighbours ever more closely as
each year passes and, as the American Medical Association recently noted,
the unchecked pollution is 'seriously threatening health and future economic
vitality on both sides of the border.'
If the North American Free Trade Agreement fails to win approval by the US
Congress, there is little hope that the hazards growing out of Mexico's
industrialisation will be soon be addressed. Billions of dollars are needed
for the clean-up and, on the Mexican side, for inspectors and their
training. Both governments' budgets already are stretched.
The Nafta is expected to accelerate foreign investment and Mexico's
industrialisation. Much of this could be in 'dirty' industries. A 1991 World
Bank report found that between 1981 and 1989 about one-tenth of Mexico's
export earnings were derived from pollution-intensive products such as
cement, chemicals, pulp, paper, and petroleum. Yet, supporters of the Nafta
argue, only increased economic development will provide funds for the
clean-up and enforcement of environmental standards.
The debate over Nafta is dominated by suspicion and mistrust on both sides.
Proponents of the pact believe that labour has taken up environmentalism
because it is more intellectually respectable than protectionism.
President Clinton's proposal to address the issue by creating a tri-national
environmental commission in a side agreement has 'the potential to undo much
of the good created by the Nafta,' says the conservative Heritage
Foundation. Protectionists will seize on the side pacts 'as vehicles by
which to reintroduce the trade restrictions Nafta is intended to eliminate.'
Opponents of the Nafta portray it as a pact with the devil - an undemocratic
government - made on behalf of heartless multinational corporations which
have no other objectives but to exploit Mexican resources and workers.
They say that is all very well to promise that Nafta will raise money for a
clean-up, but that it is necessary to identify a fund-raising mechanism -
such as a cross-border tax - to ensure that the money for a clean-up is
there.
Pro-Nafta groups are adamantly opposed to a border tax and the Clinton
administration also does not like it much. Officials say it will raise only
Dollars 300m a year and raise tariffs, which are scheduled to be cut to
zero, by an average 40 per cent.
What is lacking in Mexico is not strong environmental law but environmental
enforcement. For example, a recent study by the US General Accounting Office
found that none of six US majority-owed maquiladoras - manufacturing plants
that assemble components imported tax-free for re-export - studied had
prepared the environmental impact assessment required under Mexican law.
In the supplemental agreement now being negotiated, the Clinton
administration is trying to find an acceptable middle ground to improve
enforcement. But much is being demanded by influential members of Congress
who carefully tend their green credentials. And most of the business lobby
would like nothing to emerge from the current talks with Mexico and Canada.
The environmentalists want to establish a strong formal commission composed
of the three countries' environmental ministers and an independent
secretariat with environmental expertise. Its operations would be
transparent and experts would play a strong role in the decisions.
Each country would enforce its own environmental standards. Mexico would
allow its citizens to go to court if enforcement lagged. Corporate polluters
could be punished after a dispute settlement process or through trade
sanctions.
The environmentalists insist that nothing be allowed to weaken local, state
or regional environmental standards. Countries must be allowed to restrict
trade if it is produced through environmentally destructive processes such
as the drift nets used to catch tuna, which also catch dolphin.
Environmental measures would be judged as trade barriers only if the
decision-making process and justification for a contested measure is
'arbitrary and capricious' and intended to discriminate against a foreign
product.
Thus far, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade Representative, has been reluctant
on most of these points. He worries that a strong environmental panel would
require the three governments to yield national sovereignty to a
non-national body.
This sovereignty argument was addressed by the Canadian-American Committee
in a book of essays entitled Ties Beyond Trade.* It pointed out that all
international agreements have binding commitments affecting sovereignty, but
these intrusions have become acceptable over time.
'Plainly, setting tariffs is as much a sovereign act as specifying product
standards or offering subsidies, and Gatt tariff bindings and disciplines on
non-trade barriers are an intrusion into national sovereignty,' it says.
'Constraint on sovereign powers is the price that national governments have
accepted in return for the economic benefits created by increased access to
foreign markets and specialisation among countries.'
However, there is no consensus view yet on the level of interference to be
allowed in subverting domestic sovereignty over environmental laws. However,
says Ties Beyond Trade, this debate is 'no more and no less an affront to
Mexican sovereignty than Mexican efforts to seek constraints on US and
Canadian application of dumping and other trade remedy laws would be an
affront to US and Canadian sovereignty.'

FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (9): Conflicting
objectives - Extending the Treaty
</HEADLINE>

MEXICO City is not the only Latin American capital closely following the
Nafta debate in Washington. For some countries, notably some smaller
economies in central America and the Caribbean, the concern is that Nafta
will divert trade away from them towards Mexico.
That concern has been intensified by criticism from the Clinton
administration of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers special
treatment for the region's goods in the US market.
Some other governments are seeking clues about whether the pact can be
extended southwards. The Clinton administration has professed itself open to
the extension of the agreement to the rest of the region, citing Chile as
the next candidate. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has also
spoken of Argentina and Venezuela joining the pact.
But if Nafta falls in the US Congress - or is delayed so long that the
Mexican government decides the political cost of the agreement is too high -
this possibility becomes remote indeed. 'The rejection of Nafta at this
stage would gut the core of future hemisphere-wide trade arrangements,' said
the InterAmerican Dialogue in a report published in December.
'If the 600lb gorilla doesn't have the political weight in Washington to
secure a free trade agreement,' says Mr Mark Falcoff of the American
Enterprise Institute speaking of Mexico, 'what chances do the others have?'
The idea of a western hemisphere free-trade agreement, mooted by President
George Bush as part of his Enterprise for Americas Initiative in June 1990,
was greeted enthusiastically by most Latin governments.
This was despite differences over the trade benefits of such agreements. A
study published early last year by Mr Refik Erzan and Mr Alexander Yeats,
two World Bank economists, suggested the trade gains of free trade
arrangements with the US would be limited for most Latin American countries.
This was mainly because most Latin countries - in contrast with some Asian
economies - already faced a relatively open market anyway in the US under
the Generalised System of Preferences. Only Mexico and Brazil - the latter a
likely loser from Nafta because its mix of exports is, of all Latin
countries, most similar to Mexico's - stood to make significant trade gains
from free trade with the US.
This conclusion is not universally accepted. However, there is much wider
agreement that the benefits of free trade accords with the US are not
limited to export gains. The bigger benefits may come in enhanced investment
flows: market size is an important factor in the decisions of companies
making foreign direct investment decisions.
Furthermore, the signing of an international treaty offers additional
protection for investors by locking in policies that provide some assurance
that investments will not be expropriated by future governments.
Such accords improve the prospects for economic co-ordination among regional
partners. Importantly, at a time when the future of the world trading system
is being questioned, they offer some insurance against a more restrictive
world trading environment.
Yet there is little doubt that, at least in some quarters of the US
administration, the view of the benefits of free trade agreements with Latin
America is different from that of the Bush administration.
Mr Kantor has spoken of the importance of Nafta in 'harmonising upwards
workers' standards.' The Clinton administration's overall thrust for Latin
policy, inasmuch as any guidance has been given in public statements, lays
more emphasis on such social and environmental concerns than the Bush
administration.
If this suggests free trade agreements being used as levers to obtain
improved social and working conditions in Latin countries, it contrasts with
the Bush administration philosophy which implicitly assumed - at least until
its final year in office - that encouraging growth would take care of other
problems.
The implications of this for the sovereignty of Latin governments are
potentially substantial. Some of those administrations with less to gain
than Mexico from an agreement - in other words, most of the continent - may
thus be less disposed to free trade with the Clinton administration than
they would have been with a Bush administration.
There are other complications. There is no doubting that, in contrast with
the past, regional economic integration is now a practical possibility
because of the openness of most Latin economies. There is no doubting either
the political weight behind regional integration. However, what has
developed is a patchwork of regional groupings with sometimes potentially
conflicting objectives.
One example, but by no means the only one, provides an illustration.
Argentina is committed to Mercosur, the proposed customs union which groups
it with Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. Brazil's economic instability
threatens to destabilise the Mercosur timetable. But not only that:
Argentina's recent good economic record makes it a potential candidate for
Nafta, as Mr Kantor has noted.
Brazil, on the other hand, is economically a long way from the point at it
which it could conceive of joining Nafta and the political interest in the
topic in Braslia is - unlike in Argentina - currently lukewarm. Yet
Argentina and Brazil are committed to negotiate together in Mercosur their
trade arrangements with third parties such as the US. Something will have to
give.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (6): Subtle shift in
attitude - The view from Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The attitude of Canadians towards North American free trade has undergone a
subtle but perceptible shift since the fiery debate which dominated the 1988
election campaign. Instead of arguing about free trade, Canadians are
learning to cope with its challenges and opportunities.
Recent opinion polls show that a majority still oppose the bilateral pact
with the US which came into force in January 1989, as well as the wider
Nafta deal. But the polls also point to a rising number who, however
reluctantly, have come to accept that there is no turning back.
A plethora of anti-free trade groups still dot the political landscape,
raising many of the same arguments against Nafta that were heard in 1988.
They contend that the agreement will deprive Canada of control over its
natural resources, especially energy, and divert investment to Mexico.
Mr Bob Rae, Ontario's social-democrat premier and one of the most vocal
opponents of both the FTA and Nafta, predicted recently that 'companies in
Ontario will insist that if they are to compete with enterprises in Mexico,
Ontario workers must reduce their wages or face job losses.'
Generally, however, the reaction to Nafta has been far more muted than to
the four-year-old deal with Washington.
The House of Commons has already approved Nafta legislation in principle and
is set to ratify the deal by the end of June. Free trade is unlikely to
ignite the same passions in the election due later this year as it did in
1988.
One reason is that the Liberals, the main opposition party, are divided on
the agreement. Another is that Mexico is a miniscule trading partner in
comparison to the US. Canada's imports from Mexico currently run at only
about 1.8 per cent of purchases from the US.
Finally, just about all that can be said about free trade has been said over
the past six years. Free trade is not dead as a political issue, but it has
come to be overshadowed by other controversies.
Implementation of the 1989 agreement has, however, proved to be a wrenching
experience for Canadian companies and their workers.
The provisions of the FTA are relatively modest. They include the gradual
elimination of customs duties over 10 years, liberalised rules on US
investment in Canada and the highly successful system of bi-national panels
now used to settle protracted trade disputes.
But the FTA coincided with such other pressures as the slump in domestic
demand, low commodity prices and rising taxes. In addition, the prospect of
lower trade barriers has encouraged companies on both sides of the border to
rethink the way they do business in North America. They have spent the past
four years rationalising and integrating US and Canadian operations in much
the same way as the motor industry did in the years after the 1965
Automotive Pact.
US multinationals typically no longer view Canada as a 'branch plant'
country, but as part of their domestic operations. Instead of producing an
item at two or more factories on each side of the border, companies such as
Procter &amp; Gamble, Campbell Soup and Stanley Tools now supply both countries
from a single plant.
Almost all of Canada's large flour mills are now either owned by US
companies or have US joint-venture partners.
The move towards a free-trade zone has brought a gust of competition to the
labour market, straining traditionally friendly relations between US and
Canadian trade unions.
The tensions are illustrated by a dispute at an instant-coffee factory south
of Ottawa owned by Nestle, the Swiss food and beverage company. Nestle,
which has excess capacity in North America, locked out the Canadian workers
in March after they refused to accept more flexible overtime rules which
have become standard practice at the company's two US plants.
Even Canada's farmers, long accustomed to special protection, have not been
immune from the pressures. For example, Canadian brewers have complained
that high domestic prices for malting barley are putting them at a
disadvantage to US brewers. The US industry pays lower prices for Canadian
barley which then finds its way back across the border in US beers.
Ottawa signed the Nafta deal last year mainly to protect gains made in the
FTA and to ensure that Canada would continue to compete for foreign
investors eyeing the entire North American market.
Many Canadian companies have seized the opportunity to take a closer look at
trade and investment in Mexico. A record 4,500 exporters visited the
commercial division of the Canadian embassy in Mexico City last year.
While Ottawa is scaling back diplomatic representation in other parts of the
world, it recently opened a trade office in Monterrey.
Canada's exports to Mexico soared by 37 per cent last year to CDollars 771m,
due largely to sales of cereals and other foodstuffs. Imports were up by
about 8 per cent to CDollars 2.8bn.
Mexico's burgeoning economy and improved payments record has encouraged
Canadian banks to increase their trade credits and to reduce rates on export
finance. Bank of Nova Scotia paid CDollars 90m last autumn for a 5 per cent
interest in a Mexican financial institution, Grupo Financiero Inverlat SA.
A recent study by the Conference Board of Canada predicts that Canadian
exporters of grains, oilseeds, livestock, textiles, oil and gas services,
telecommunications equipment and engineering services are among those which
will benefit from more liberalised trade and investment rules under Nafta.
On the othe hand, Canadian industries at risk from labour-intensive,
standard-technology Mexican exports include clothing, footwear, metal
fabrication, machinery and electrical products.
Canadian officials and businessmen also have a less tangible - but very real
 -concern that implementation of Nafta may be hampered by cultural
differences between the US and Canada on the one hand, and Mexico on the
other.
They wonder to what extent political corruption in Mexico will interfere
with efforts to bring down trade barriers. They also question the ability of
the Mexican government to enforce a complex multilateral agreement whose
provisions in many cases will override domestic laws.
One Canadian official predicts that the different ways of doing business
north and south of the Rio Grande will create many 'hassles' over the next
few years.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (5): Conflicting
predictions - Jobs and Labour Migration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<TEXT>
'THE first rule of war is don't shoot yourself. Our trade agreements,
including this one, violate this rule.' Pithy comments like this entrance
the worshipful hordes which still support Mr Ross Perot, the Texas
billionaire and former presidential candidate.
It was with these words that Mr Perot announced that because the North
American Free Trade Agreement could 'suck' as many as 5.8m jobs out of the
US economy, he would oppose the pact. Even worse news for the Clinton
administration is that he is buying television time to broadcast 'an
educational campaign' against the Nafta.
The study Mr Perot produced to support his conclusion focused particularly
on US manufacturing industries with high costs and easily transferred
technology. It contradicts one of the most cited reports - Nafta: An
Assessment - released in February by Mr Gary Hufbauer and Mr Jeffrey Schott
of the Institute of International Economics. Their report shows a gain of
about 171,000 net new US jobs by 1995, although the authors also acknowledge
that in the long run the US could show a small net loss.
The Economic Policy Institute, which receives labour support, has predicted
a loss of 500,000 American jobs in 10 years. The US International Trade
Commission has projected long-term gains in aggregate employment at less
than 1 per cent for the US and Canada but up to almost 7 per cent for
Mexico.
From more than 20 studies of the Nafta, only this much is clear: No one
really knows how many jobs will be created or lost, numbers can be found to
boost every contention, and whether or not there is a Nafta, US workers will
continue to lose jobs as companies seek cheaper labour south of the border
or in Asia.
Although the ITC also concluded that there would be an almost indiscernible
effect on US wage rates for both low-skilled and high-skilled wages,
American unions worry that US wages will be forced downward as workers
compete with lower-paid brethren in Mexico.
To assuage labour's concern, the Clinton administration has promised to
negotiate a side agreement which would ensure that Mexico enforces the
strong labour laws it now has on the books. Otherwise, the unions say, the
'exploited' young Mexican workforce - 30m strong and growing - will never
freely share in the Nafta benefits and rising living standards.
Labour is supported by a number of Democratic congressmen and senators.
Rarely does a month go by without a group of lawmakers flying down to
Mexico, only to return shaken by the working conditions. Mr Richard
Gephardt, leader of the House of Representatives Democratic majority,
recently described a visit with a group of Mexican workers.
'Despite their living conditions, they all were proud people. They couldn't
understand why the system didn't work for them. Why the unions didn't
represent them. Why the rich got richer and their lives never seemed to
change,' he told a congressional committee.
He talked of the workers at a Sanyo plant in Tijuana who earn an average
Dollars 50-Dollars 55 a week, and whose manager said that once the Nafta was
signed, no US companies with labour-intensive production would be able to
survive the competitive pressures without moving to Mexico.
'I will not support a Nafta on a leap of faith,' he said.
Most of the US business lobby believes that market forces alone will raise
the income levels in Mexico, creating a strong market for US and Canadian
goods. The conservative Heritage Foundation puts forth this scenario: With a
Nafta, Mexican economic modernisation will accelerate. Because about 80 per
cent of all its capital equipment is US made, American industries are likely
to expand production and hire more workers.
These companies will not relocate because the Mexican workers and
infrastructure are not capable of supporting high-technology production. As
Mexico grows, the demand for skilled manufacturing in the US will grow,
placing upward pressure on US wages.
Advertising ventures by Mexican entities hoping to lure American companies
to their areas have been throwing fuel on the flames of union discontent. A
recent advertisement in World Trade magazine sold the Yucatan as a
businessman's paradise 'where labour costs average under Dollars 1 an hour
including benefits and the employee turnover rate is less than 5 per cent a
year. 'You could save over Dollars 15,000 a worker. . .' said Yucatan's
Department of Industrial and Commercial Development.
If the Clinton administration is ever to overcome the fears produced by such
untimely advertising ventures, then money must also somehow be found to
retrain American workers who lose their jobs to the Nafta. President George
Bush promised Dollars 10bn in new funding over five years on training and
adjustment assistance (Dollars 335m would be for Nafta); President Clinton
has yet to reveal his plans.
In its negotiations on the side agreements, the administration seems to
envision the establishment of a tri-national commission which is more a
watchdog than an enforcement agency. Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce
Secretary, urged business in Mexico to reform itself voluntarily.
'You must demonstrate your commitment to high environmental and labour
standards, to job growth and the health of the North American economy,' he
told businesses in a recent speech. 'For some this may require a fundamental
change in attitude, a willingness to re-examine your operations and maybe
even a change in your processes.'
Even some business leaders believe such exhortations will not be enough. The
Economic Policy Council of the United Nations Association of the US,
composed of business and labour leaders and academics, recently called for
an effective enforcement mechanism and a timetable for the upward
harmonisation of North American labour standards.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman of Xerox Corporation and co-chairman of the
Council, said the supplemental labour pact must ensure an equitable
distribution of benefits of Nafta and protect US interests in a more
integrated North American economy. Mr Jack Sheinkman, the other co-chairman
and president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, said
that only 'steady improvement in Mexican incomes will alleviate competitive
downward pressure on US and Canadian wage rates, reduce the incentive for
illegal immigration and increased Mexican demand for US and Canadian goods.'
While the Nafta negotiators have been wrestling with the make-up of the
Trilateral Labour Commission, Mr Jagdish Bhagwati, professor of economics at
Columbia University, has found a way around the administration's reluctance
to interfere with Mexican sovereignty.
The US Congress can legislate rules for American companies in Mexico which
require that they 'act entirely up to our standards,' he said.
'It would thus strengthen the ability of the Clinton administration to
reject the outlandish demands that Mexico, despite its poverty, do much more
for the environment and labour than it can current afford and that it
replicate our regulations and standards on each industry,' Mr Bhagwati
concluded.

importance attached to pact - Impact on Mexico
</HEADLINE>

Mexico remains deeply worried about Nafta.
On November 24 last year, Mr Jose Cordoba, the chief of staff to Mexico's
President Carlos Salinas, was having lunch in an elegant Washington DC
restaurant with Mr Samuel Berger, head of national security in the Clinton
administration team, and Mr Barry Carter, another Clinton adviser.
For Mr Cordoba, the lunch was important enough that he flew to Washington
especially for it. The Mexican government had barely concealed its
preference in the US elections for President George Bush, and was worried
the Clinton administration might (partly as a result) be less than
enthusiastic about pushing for a rapid congressional approval of the
proposed North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr Cordoba thus turned salesman. In a private conversation obtained by the
newspaper El Financiero and the weekly Proceso, and whose contents have been
confirmed, Mr Cordoba said (with his remarks re-translated):
'For us, timing is everything. We would like to see this finished by the end
of 1994. . . In December 1993 we will have a candidate for the presidency
and the electoral process in Mexico will have started.
'It is very important for us to have finished this by then; that Nafta does
not become mixed up with internal political affairs. By these dates, we
would want to have left this matter behind us.'
Mr Cordoba's remarks capture well the overwhelming importance the Mexican
government attaches to Nafta. The presidency of President Salinas has come
to be identified with the treaty. If it is passed, Mr Salinas will go down
in history as the Mexican president who tied his country's economy
irrevocably to the market principles of the US. If it is rejected, then his
single most important initiative will have been seen to be a failure.
However, whether rejection would go so far as to lead to an economic
collapse and nationalist backlash is questionable. Given the lack of
grass-roots support for Nafta in the US, the Mexican government has
exploited such an argument, in the belief this would step up pressure on the
US administration and Congress to approve the treaty.
But were Nafta not approved by the US Congress, the government may want to
intensify economic reforms, as a way of reassuring foreign and domestic
investors that there will be no sudden change in government policy. As one
senior government minister said earlier this year: 'We will have to speed up
structural change were Nafta not passed'. This would be the preferred option
rather than 'shooting yourself in the foot' by reversing reforms, he said.
The government is believed to have a number of such reforms up its sleeve -
such as the independence of the central bank, and news regarding membership
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) - in
case the prospects for Nafta look dim.
Similarly, while some analysts speculate that rejection of Nafta would
encourage President Salinas to select a candidate with political savvy for
the presidency next year, just as many say it would put the premium on a
candidate with a strong economic background, given the need to assure
investors, in the absence of Nafta, of the future direction of economic
policy.
Even if the rejection of Nafta does not provoke a crisis, most investors in
Mexico's stock market, and leading businessmen, reckon such an event would
have some damaging short-term economic consequences. Mexico last year ran a
current account deficit of Dollars 22.8bn, forcing the government to let
interest rates rise to 18 per cent to attract short-term foreign capital.
High interest rates and a budget surplus in turn helped slow economic growth
to just 2.6 per cent.
Investors reckon passage of the Nafta will reduce uncertainty about future
economic policy in Mexico and thus encourage more foreign investment. This
should allow interest rates to come down and government spending to
increase, giving the economy a vital shot as it enters the last year of the
Salinas presidency. Such reasoning explains how on any given day positive
news about Nafta can lift the stockmarket 20 or so points, while negative
news depresses it by the same or more.
Later in this year, concerns over Nafta may become worse as they feed
speculation over the presidential succession. As Mr Cordoba indicated, the
selection of the presidential candidate for the ruling party is expected to
occur just after the congressional vote on Nafta (earmarked for December,
according to one US adviser to the Mexican government). The confluence of
uncertainties could drive even the most adventurous investors from Mexico's
stock market and threaten the stability of the peso.
In an attempt to temper such uncertainties, the president has made sure that
all the presidential candidates from the PRI broadly share his economic
philosophy. The potential candidates - whether it be Mr Donaldo Colosio, the
social development minister and current favourite, Mr Manuel Camacho, the
populist-leaning mayor of Mexico City, or Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance
minister - all worked under Mr Salinas in the budget ministry in the last
administration and while differences remain between them they are unlikely
to reverse current policies in any significant way.
Likewise, the government has been at pains to stress that the current
austere macroeconomic policy will remain unchanged throughout this and next
year. It is pressing ahead with further economic reform in the form of a new
foreign investment law - to be introduced as part of the Mexican enabling
legislation for Nafta some time in the summer - and more deregulation in the
financial and industrial sector.
Despite such precautions the government is still biting its tongue. Indeed,
Mr Cordoba returned to Washington recently to impress on the US
administration the importance of the treaty for Mexico and Mexico-US
relations. This time he was advised to stay clear of public restaurants.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (2): The picture is
changing - Mexican Perspective / Emigration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The helicopter of the US immigration patrol is hovering above, its bright
lights illuminating the farmland below. About 30-40 Mexicans - including
about 10 women and a couple of teenagers - are getting ready to jump.
Leaning against the new eight-foot corrugated fence that separates the
Mexican city of Tijuana from the US is Mr Jorge Sanchez, 30, a mechanic from
Guadalajara. He is the sort of worker the Mexican government says will stay
south of Rio Grande were the North American Free Trade Agreement passed, and
more jobs created in Mexico.
But opponents of Nafta, and many academics, suggest that Nafta will
encourage even more Mexicans to cross the border. Just as migration has
increased since Mexico opened its country to trade in recent years, many
economists point out that the free trade agreement will expose Mexico's
remaining protected and inefficient sectors to competition - most notably
agriculture, but also manufacturing - and could put hundreds of thousands of
more labourers out of work.
Mr Sweder van Wijnbergen, former chief Mexico economist at the World bank,
and Mr Santiago Levy, now a senior official in Mexico's trade ministry,
calculated in a recent paper that freeing maize prices could force some
700,000 Mexican corn farmers out of work. Mr Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, an
economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimates that the
treaty may increase Mexican emigration to the US by 600,000.
Mr Wane Cornelius, director of the Centre for Mexico-US Studies at the
University of California, San Diego, takes a more sanguine view of the
effects of Nafta on immigration, reckoning such studies exaggerate the
dependence of rural workers on income from selling maize. He says that in
the longer run immigration may fall when Nafta reduces the wage gap between
Mexico and the US and creates jobs for displaced farmers in Mexican cities.
But with wages in Mexico about one eighth of those in the US, this is sure
to take a long time.
What is certain is that immigration is not falling by significant amounts
despite the US recession last year and more border patrol agents, fences,
and other mechanisms to reduce illegal immigration. Last fiscal year, the
Border Patrol apprehended 1,140,574 illegal migrants, compared with
1,077,511 in 1991.
Such figures overstate the number of migrants trying to cross the border,
given that the typical illegal worker will attempt to cross three or four
times before succeeding. But according to the Colegio de la Frontera, a
leading research centre for immigration, the flow of immigrants trying to
cross into the US has remained unchanged recently, at about 300,000 a year.
What has changed is the type of immigrant. While the vision of the wetback
crossing the Rio Grande to look for work as a tomato picker was always
exaggerated, surveys now show that most immigrants work in service,
construction or light manufacturing sectors rather than in agriculture; most
have left jobs in Mexico; stay more than a year in the US; and,
increasingly, most are female.
Mr Sanchez, for example, is relatively educated, having stayed at school
until 17. He comes from a large city, rather than the countryside and he
intends to work in a Los Angeles factory or restaurant, rather than pick
oranges. He has also brought his wife.
Mexico, which has traditionally seen migration as an escape valve for those
unemployed, is now losing some of its more productive workers. Because these
workers stay longer in the US, and therefore often take their families with
them, they are less likely to send so much money back to Mexico, an
important source of external finance for the country.
For the US, while immigration is becoming spread through different sectors
of the economy, it remains concentrated in certain parts of the country. One
half of the immigrants go to California.
Mr Cornelius says that the shift from a single, male, temporary, migrant to
the longer-staying migrant family 'will increase the effects of the Mexican
immigration population on housing, schools, and health-care systems in
localities that attract large numbers'. As immigrants stay longer, their
presence, he says, has raised racial tensions in some communities.
The change in Mexican migration has numerous causes. The demand for cheap
labour has shifted in the US, with agricultural needs being overtaken by
household work, construction and light manufacturing. According to a survey
by Mr Cornelius of migrants from three rural villages, just 21 per cent
worked in agriculture in 1988-89, down from 55 per cent in 1976.
It has also become more expensive to cross the border than in the past,
meaning that very poor Mexicans cannot afford the trip. Mr Jorge Bustamente,
head of the Colegio de la Frontera, reckons it costs about Dollars 200 to
reach the border from the interior of Mexico - excluding the implicit cost
of lost working days. Because of increased border patrol vigilance, it takes
on average three or four attempts before a successful crossing is made, from
one or two attempts a few years back.
The increased difficulty in crossing the border encourages immigrants to
stay longer in the US, so as to recoup their fixed costs of travel. An
illegal immigrant now stays an average 1.5 years in the US, up from the
traditional period of four or five months.
The US Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 has also played its part.
The act legalised some 3m illegal immigrants - most of them Mexican - and
encouraged them to bring their wives and family from Mexico. Partly as a
result some half of the Mexican immigrants who settle in the US are now
women.
The act penalises employers who hire workers without legal papers. Rather
than deter immigration, this has led to a thriving market in forged papers,
still further increasing the cost of immigration. The necessary working
papers can cost another Dollars 200-Dollars 300.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (4): Companies gear up
for implications - Mexican Corporate Strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of Nafta is changing Mexican corporate strategy. When Modelo,
Mexico's largest brewery responsible for Corona beer, announced last March
it was selling 18 per cent of its company to Anheuser-Busch for Dollars 477m
and then going public, history was made.
Mexico's best-known private company - which did not believe in debt and
seldom disclosed information about itself - was going to have three
Americans on its board, hire expensive foreign investment bankers to arrange
an international offering, and bare all to the world.
Modelo, like practically all Mexican companies these days, buckled under the
pressure of free trade, and the imminent North American Free Trade
Agreement. As Mr Don Juan Sanchez Navarro, Modelo's vice-president, said,
the tie-in with Anheuser-Busch 'is an example of a strategic association
that will be increasingly seen in other sectors' as companies gear up for
the business implications of Nafta.
When Mexico was a protected economy, companies did not have to worry much
about strategic alliances and other mechanisms to achieve international
competitiveness because they had a captive market. But since the late 1980s,
when Mexico tore down most of its trade barriers, and then in 1990 when it
announced its intention to sign the Nafta, Mexican companies have though
about little else.
Some Mexican companies - those in global industries - have aspired to be
internationally competitive by becoming international companies. Others have
signed joint ventures with world leaders so as to acquire the best
technology and eliminate potential competition. But all are striving to
improve productivity by seeking cheap capital, economies of scale, flexible
labour contracts and new technology.
Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex) and Vitro, Mexico's two largest industrial
conglomerates, have paved the way in turning themselves from strictly
Mexican companies into global cement and glass producers respectively. In
1989, Vitro bought the US glass company Anchor Glass for Dollars 900m
(including debt), making it North America's largest glass producer. Last
year, Cemex bought the two Spanish cement companies, Valenciana and Sanson,
for Dollars 1.85bn, to add to cement companies it already has in the US.
Cemex's acquisition was harshly criticised by foreign investors who had
bought the company because of the fast-growing Mexican construction market.
But Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, president of Cemex, said after the transaction: 'If
you stay small you become vulnerable. The global cement business is becoming
increasingly concentrated and we need to stay with the leaders.'
Cemex's fear was that if it stayed in Mexico, the large European cement
companies (headed by Holderbank whose subsidiary, Apasco, is Cemex's rival
in Mexico) would eventually move in for the kill - just as they did to US
cement companies in the 1980s.
Such a strategy is likely to be followed by other Mexican companies in
global businesses as Nafta comes into effect, says Mr Gustavo Cabellero,
Cemex's finance director. 'It is unsustainable in the long term to survive
as a purely Mexican company in an open economy. What Cemex did will be
followed by an increasing number of Mexican companies as they try to compete
in international markets.'
Indeed, soon after Cemex's acquisitions, a group of investors from the
south-east of Mexico paid Dollars 499m for the US company Del Monte Fresh
Produce, the fresh fruit side of Polly Peck International, the fruit and
electronics conglomerate which collapsed in October 1990. Likewise, Mexican
banks have bought stakes in financial companies in Latin America and are
seeking to increase their presence in the US.
Most Mexican companies are still so far from acquiring global or regional
leadership, or the cost of so doing is so prohibitively large, that the
purchase of foreign companies makes little sense. Instead, they have sought
to form joint ventures with world leaders. That way they can acquire
technology, capital, access to the US and other markets, and eliminate
potential competition.
Modelo will be using Anheuser-Busch technology and money in the construction
of its eighth brewery, and inter-changing personnel as a way of learning
from its huge American rival. Femsa, Modelo's rival in the beer business and
Mexico's largest beverage company, has just sold 30 per cent of its
soft-drinks division to Coca-Cola and hopes to benefit from Coke's expertise
in marketing and technology. Femsa is now looking for a partner in its beer
division to compete with Modelo.
Vitro, as well as buying up Anchor Glass, has signed joint ventures with
Corning, the US glassware producer and Whirlpool, the white goods maker,
enabling it to use these companies' distribution outlets to increase exports
to the US, and sharing technology to lower costs.
Best-known have been the alliances in the retail sector, with practically
all the big US chains - Wal-Mart, Fleming, Price Club and K-Mart - forming
joint ventures with Mexican counterparts in the past 18 months.
The proposed Nafta will likely intensify this trend, by reducing trade
barriers to the US for Mexico, and by making American companies more
comfortable with signing joint ventures with smaller, less well-known
Mexican companies. Foreign investment bankers are now eagerly examining the
consumer goods market, the vehicle parts sector, textiles, and other
industries, to see which foreign partners they can team up with willing
Mexican companies.
Mr Jacob Zaidenweber, head of the American Textile Group, says of his
sector: 'The first stage of Nafta is the most important. Those textile
companies that are going to survive will have to establish niches and low
financing. Some are not going to, but those that do, will then be ready to
form alliances with US companies. Production will move from Asia to North
America.'
The joint venture itself is no panacea under Nafta. Unless Mexican
businesses improve productivity, many will be unable to compete in the wider
North American economy. For most, this means divesting or eliminating areas
where they are not competitive, and specialising production.
General Electric Mexico has, for example, stopped making light bulbs in
Mexico because it is more efficient to import them from plants in the US
which enjoy much greater economies of scale. Cemex has divested itself of
all non-cement holdings except tourism. Desc is reducing, selling off, or
closing petrochemical divisions where it cannot compete, concentrating more
on consumer goods such as glue. As the Nafta is implemented more will follow
suit.
To remain competitive, Mexican companies will have to increase substantially
investment in the divisions they retain, making the cost of capital critical
to competitiveness. With Mexican borrowing rates at about 35 per cent,
increasing numbers of Mexican companies are attempting to borrow cheaply in
dollars, or raise money through equity in international offerings.
This has important implications for the way businesses are run. As Mr Don
Sanchez Navarro recently put it at the annual stock market convention: 'The
relationship with highly sophisticated and demanding foreign investors has
led to pressure for results, better information, a more efficient business,
to open new markets, to improve quality, and to obtain the desired
international competitiveness.'
Mr Gilberto Borja, the head of ICA, Mexico and Latin America's largest
construction group which went public last year, told the same convention:
'We accepted (in 1991) that given new expectations, the internal generation
of resources, based on an aggressive policy of re-investing profits, with
which we had built up our capital, would be insufficient. In consequence, we
took the decision to go to the capital markets.
'Internally, this signified a profound change in the policies that we had
maintained throughout our history. From being a closed company - the
exclusive property of the active partners in the company, with capital 100
per cent a result of our work, that did not require giving out information
bar the essential - we turned into an open business.'
In the past couple of years Videovisa, Gigante, Televisa, ICA, Dina, Grupo
Herdez, and others have gone public, 18 banks and the telephone company have
been privatised, and practically every leading company has issued new
equity. Other private companies, such as Modelo, Gutsa, or GMD, are
intending to go public.
Mr Roland Wojewodski, head of Latin America for JP Morgan says: 'What is
happening in Mexico is that a lot of privately owned companies are looking
two or three years down the line. They are going public to raise financing;
they are looking at joint ventures; and they are increasing financial
capabilities to take advantage of new opportunities.'
As part of the process of increasing productivity, Mexican companies are
also having to change their relations with labour. In the past, labour
contracts were usually negotiated sector by sector and were affected as much
by the political importance of a union to Mexico's ruling party as by the
demands and needs of individual businesses.
Last year, important strikes were broken - such as one in the textiles
industry - and this will allow negotiations to be conducted company by
company. Other strikes were - probably illegally - overcome, enabling
companies to introduce more flexible working practices.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (1): Problems to be
resolved - Nafta supporters reckon the economies of the US, Canada and
Mexico will all benefit from the treaty. Studies indicate a 'win-win-win
situation', says one expert. Yet there will also be losers in the process of
economic restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SINCE the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the leaders of
the US, Canada and Mexico last October, the political landscape of the
region has changed. President George Bush, one of the accord's great
supporters, is no longer in the White House and Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's
prime minister, has announced his intention to step down this year.
The Mexican president, Mr Carlos Salinas, is still in place, his great
initiative to integrate the Mexican economy with its powerful northern
neighbours now in the hands of a Democrat-controlled US Congress.
As a result, the Mexican economy and political system is in a state of great
uncertainty. Mr Salinas wants the treaty, which brings together three
countries responsible for more than 18 per cent of world trade, ratified
this year. For him, it will set in stone the market-oriented economic
policies he has pursued since assuming office in 1988. He hopes that the
boost in economic confidence that will ensue will pave the way for the
election of his party's presidential candidate in the 1994 election.
Nafta - the first reciprocal trade treaty between developed and developing
countries - provides for the gradual ending over 10 years of tariffs and
most other barriers to trade between Canada, Mexico and the US. Tariffs on
some goods, such as agricultural products, will be phased out over 15 years.
It extends to Mexico trade dispute settlement procedures established by the
existing US-Canadian free trade agreement. It lays out commitments on the
treatment of services and investment and opens industries such as Mexico's
petrochemicals and financial services sectors.
From the viewpoint of economic efficiency, the negotiations which concluded
last year worked out better than many trade experts had predicted. But some
sections have been criticised. Basic energy, for example, has been excluded
from the agreement at Mexico's insistence.
In the words of Mr Gary Hufbauer and Mr Jeffrey Schott of the
Washington-based Institute for International Economics, a 'schizophrenic'
regime has been established in textiles and clothing. They say origin rules
for textiles and vehicle production force regional producers to source from
less efficient suppliers within the region.
Supporters reckon that nonetheless all three economies will benefit from the
treaty. According to Ms Nora Lustig of the Brookings Institution, most
studies 'indicate that there will be a win-win-win situation for the three
countries.'
This expectation is partly derived from the assumption that wage differences
will lead to a mutually-beneficial division of labour: labour-intensive
industry requiring fewer skills would migrate to Mexico while
capital-intensive, highly-skilled work will concentrate in the US and
Canada.
There is little disagreement that Mexico has most to gain. Mexico does about
three-quarters of its trade with the US; its economy is a 20th of the size
of the US and half that of Canada. Yet Mexico is of increasing significance
to the other two economies. It is already a Dollars 40bn-plus export market
for US goods, accounting for nearly 10 per cent of US exports, and it is a
growing potential market for Canada.
Canadian exporters presently sell less than Dollars 1bn worth of products
annually to Mexico, but Ottawa's interest in protecting the gains made in
its bilateral free trade accord and in ensuring its continued importance to
foreign investors looking at the North American market led it to support the
accord.
The main economic benefits to Mexico may, however, come from increased
capital inflows - and therefore the higher investment - that should be
sustainable once the Nafta goes into effect.
Nafta proponents argue that the benefits from the US point of view may not
be only, or even mainly, economic. The agreement would fix an outward,
pro-Washington orientation in Mexican foreign policy, traditionally
antagonistic to the US.
Economic growth would also provide stability in Mexico, better place it to
address mutual environmental concerns and over time reduce illegal
immigration to the US, which reached a record high last year.
Yet there will unavoidably be some losers. In the process of economic
restructuring, companies in all three countries will close factories and
many thousands of people will lose their jobs. Ms Lustig says that because
the Bush administration had seen the overall economic impact of Nafta as
positive, it had glossed over the problems of the losers in the US.
By contrast, the Clinton administration has decided to address these
concerns. This has turned out to be important in any case to secure
congressional passage for the treaty over an increasingly vociferous
opposition. While opposition encompasses environmentalists and those with
political concerns about Mexico's one-party rule, its most powerful US
opponents - including Mr Ross Perot, the former presidential candidate - are
worried about US job losses as companies are sucked southwards to exploit
cheap Mexican labour.
The idea that imports produced by cheap foreign labour will reduce standards
of living in the US resurrects a notion almost as old as economics itself.
The reality is a bit more complicated: US workers get paid more because they
are more productive.
Most of the Nafta losers in the US can be helped unilaterally by the US  -
through support and training for displaced workers, for example. Backing for
a North American development bank to iron out economic dislocation within
Nafta also appears to be gaining momentum on Capitol Hill.
The president has also insisted on supplemental agreements, now being
negotiated trilaterally, over labour standards and the environment. The aim
is to make sure that migration by companies, and therefore jobs, from the US
to Mexico does not take place merely to take advantage of lax enforcement of
Mexican labour and environmental laws. The side accords foresee
supranational commissions to investigate disputes.
These side agreements have presented the US administration with a dilemma.
It has recognised that the commissions have important implications for US
sovereignty as well as Mexico's. The greater their powers, the more likely
they are to be used against the US. Furthermore, to the extent that the side
agreements are effective in addressing concerns of environmentalists and
trade unions in the US, they will dilute some of the economic gains that
Mexico expects to derive from the agreement. There are worries among Nafta
supporters that the jobs and environment issues have become little more than
a respectable cloak for the protectionist instincts of those who want to see
the treaty killed. Reports from the negotiators, however, have suggested
they are making important advances toward agreement.
For the Mexican government, the side agreements have extended the agony
surrounding ratification. President Salinas has staked its prestige and
economic policy on Nafta, which is important in ensuring the continuation of
the government's economic reforms.
In the shorter term, it is needed to provide confidence that a current
account deficit which reached Dollars 22.8bn last year can be financed.
Mexico's financial markets are in thrall to day-to-day signals on prospects
for ratification by the US Congress, a state of affairs that will prevail
until the treaty is voted on by the US Congress, which could be as late as
December.
According to Mr Peter Hakim of the Washington-based InterAmerican Dialogue,
the US administration has been pushed on the defensive over Nafta because it
is fighting on the turf of the treaty's opponents over the labour and
environment issues. If the administration wants to secure passage, it should
go on the offensive, presenting Nafta for example as part of its overall
economic strategy.
The treaty is not yet a legislative priority for the administration.
Although he continues to insist that the treaty will be ratified in time for
implementation at the beginning of 1994, Mr Clinton is unwilling yet to risk
political capital which may be more usefully employed elsewhere.
Mr Hakim and others believe that, once the side accords are secured, Mr
Clinton has the ability, if he wants, to win ratification. 'It'll pass if
Clinton gets involved and shows leadership; it will not pass of its own
accord,' said Mr Mark Falcoff of the American Enterprise Institute in
Washington.

council projects

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Jute Council, hamstrung by a lack of funds, could launch
only two projects at its recent meeting in Dhaka. These were for the
promotion of jute goods in Japan and the use of enzyme and microbiological
process for upgrading low grade jute and jute cuttings.
According to a study by the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation, the consumption of jute goods in Japan, considered the most
lucrative market for the fibre, has been declining by more than 4 per cent a
year since 1973. The shrinkage in the demand for rice bags and
carpet-backing cloth in Japan has hit in almost equal measure India,
Bangladesh, Thailand and China. There has, however, been a marginal increase
in the demand for jute yarn in Japan.
The jute council shares the view of exporting countries that the demand for
jute goods in environment-conscious Japan could be given a boost through
effective market promotion measures. Japan itself has agreed to underwrite
the greater part of the market development expenditure.
The enzyme project holds great promise for all jute producing countries, as
inferior quality jute constitutes nearly 30 per cent of total fibre
production. It has been established on a pilot scale at two jute mills in
Bangladesh that enzymic treatment leads to a significant improvement in
fibre quality.
The project is to be financed by Canadian and French lines of credit.
Concern has been expressed at the council, however, about the poor funding
prospects for projects that have already been appraised by its committee on
projects. Among the more important projects crying out for funding are those
concerning the development of jute-based packaging, diversified uses for
jute blended fabrics, an improved spinning process, the introduction of high
speed rapier looms, and the promotion of jute goods in the US, Australia and
New Zealand. Work on some existing projects has also slowed down
considerably for want of funds.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME traders warned over feared
nickel squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange executive yesterday added its voice to warnings
from traders and analysts about a potential squeeze in its nickel market at
the end of this year by announcing it was 'closely monitoring' the
situation.
Traders said the LME's action had an immediate effect and that the
backwardation (premium for immediate delivery) between November and
December, which has been as wide as Dollars 100 a tonne in recent weeks,
narrowed to Dollars 15.
Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural
resources group, said the potential options-related squeeze was having some
near-term impact by underpinning the price of nickel for delivery in three
months because 'people are wary about being short'.
He said the build up of option positions suggested that some traders were
confident of significantly firmer nickel prices towards the year-end. 'But
it is difficult to get too bullish with LME nickel stocks at a record 91,980
tonnes. We will need to see those stocks being drawn down before we know
that the market fundamentals are really changing.'
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said that the groundwork for a potential
squeeze had been in place for some time and 'the LME was probably right to
sound the alarm bells sooner rather than later'.
The exchange's announcement might not have detered those behind the
potential squeeze, 'but the rest of the market started to behave in the way
the LME would wish'.
For most of last year the LME zinc market was gripped by a squeeze and the
executive was forced to intervene. In 1991 it took similar action to restore
order in the copper market.

Three-month COPPER ended firmer, but closed below its highs on the LME after
faltering near Dollars 1,800 a tonne. Dealers said the rally represented a
much-needed technical correction after recent heavy declines. But whether
the market could extend the recovery much further was doubtful, as
fundamentals remained poor, and stocks continued to rise. LME warehouse
stocks are at a fresh nine-year high of 403,475 tonnes. Precious metals
drifted sideways in very narrow trading ranges on the London bullion market
as GOLD paused for breath and the others lacked any fresh fundamental news,
dealers said. New York failed to inject any life into the market as Comex
opened lower, depressed by the firm dollar. 'It's exceptionally quiet,' said
one dealer. Others said the gold market was becoming increasingly speculator
driven as physical demand had dried up at current price levels. New York
analysts said market participants were continuing to look for further news
regarding Sir James Goldsmith after Monday's news that he had sold a large
amount of stock in leading US gold producer Newmont Mining.

RUSSIAN WHITE sugar imports will fall to 950,000 tonnes this year from 1.25m
tonnes in 1992, a government advisory group said, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
The Centre for Economic Research and Forecasting, in a study on the economy,
put refined sugar production at 2.5m tonnes in 1993, unchanged from the
previous year.
The study said the figure included output using raw sugar imports, which it
said totalled 2.6m tonnes in 1992.
The centre, which draws on various official sources for its data, gave no
figure for 1993 raw sugar imports.
Russia's state sugar purchasing company has said it expects to import up to
2m tonnes of raw sugar in 1993.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tropical timber 'bashers'
attacked

<TEXT>
MR LIM Kem Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, yesterday
attacked importing countries for 'bashing' tropical timber exporting
countries for their own ends. He said that those who criticised tropical
countries should show goodwill and patience.
Speaking at the opening here of the 12th meeting of International Tropical
Timber Organisation, Mr Lim called for an end to unilateral decisions to
boycott the purchase of tropical wood by national governments and individual
organisations. He cited the plight of Sarawak, Malaysia, where decisions to
reduce tropical logging by 1.5m cubic metres in 1992 and similar amount in
1993 in response to ITTO recommendations had meant the loss of 26,000 jobs
and USDollars 50m.
Producer and consumer country members of the ITTO are divided over the
future role of the organisation. Mr Lim restated his views that trade in
timber from temperate forests should be considered alongside tropical
interests. He said he wanted to see the present renegotiation of the
International Tropical Timber Agreement expanded to include all world
forests.
With less than 10 per cent of world international trade being in tropical
wood and the rest of temperate origin, the minister said that the new
agreement, scheduled to be in place by March 1994, should widen its scope.
But tropical timber importing countries do not agree.
Mr Menzo Baratini, spokesman for the European Community, pointed out that
the ITTO was set up specifically for tropical timber and had developed
principles and strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable management of
tropical forests by the year 2000. The system of annual national reporting
on progress toward sustainable management of productive tropical forests
should be standardised, he said, adding that ITTO's real objectives should
be in the field of trade.
The ITTO meeting takes place against a background of steeply rising prices
for tropical timber from Asia Pacific sources. Sawn wood and plywood prices
have leapt 40 per cent over recent months as log production and export in
the Sabah and Sarawak States of Malaysia have fallen in response to moves to
conserve forest resources in terms of sustainability and industrial
requirements.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS aluminium agency makes
contact with EC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INTERCOMALUM, THE organisation set up last month to promote and defend the
aluminium industry of the Commonwealth of Independent States, has made its
first contact with the European Commission.
The commission is being urged by European producers to impose draconian
quotas on CIS aluminium imports and is inquiring into the complaints under
rules that allow measures to 'safeguard' European Community industries.
Mr Elliott Spitz, a vice chairman of Intercomalum and also a director of
AIOC Corporation, the New York-based trading company, said it was believed
this was the first time that there had been contact between the CIS
aluminium industry and the Brussels-based commission. It was hoped that
there would be regular discussions between them from now on.
A commission official confirmed that lawyers representing Intercomalum had
made contact with its delegation in Moscow. 'It is up to them to take the
next steps,' he added.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex members not tempted by
doubled offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE TEAM of New York Mercantile Exchange traders negotiating the energy
exchange's take-over of the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) is prepared
to double its bid to Dollars 20m and make concessions on trading rights in
an effort to bring the deal to closure.
Still, Comex members say the offer is not sufficient, and many are losing
interest in the deal.
Both sides are keenly aware of the time and effort lost in failed merger
negotiations between the Comex and the Chicago Board of Trade, 'We would
like to settle this, either way, as soon as possible,' said a Comex
official. The exchange's board of directors has a regularly scheduled
meeting tomorrow and will discuss the Nymex proposal formally for the first
time.
Nymex's first offer for the Comex, the world's largest precious metals
exchange, was for Dollars 10m in cash. Comex members immediately said the
amount was inadequate, considering Comex holds Dollars 13m in cash. The new
offer, which has yet to be approved by the Nymex board, is said to be
Dollars 20m. That is still far less than the Dollars 60m Comex members claim
as the 'book' value of the exchange.
The Comex board accepted a take-over offer from the Chicago Board of Trade
last January in an effort to find a financial backer and cut overheads after
several years of sluggish precious metals futures and options volume. Nymex
stepped in on April 27, a week after that deal failed.
Now, with the gold market the busiest its been since 1991, Comex members are
beginning to question the need for a merger. Comex gold futures volume
jumped to 826,585 contracts in April, from 492,857 last year. Gold volume,
and record April turnover in high-grade copper, sent overall Comex volume to
1.67m contracts last month, compared to 1.05m the same month last year.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese bank's gold trade
monopoly under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PEOPLE'S Bank, China's gold-purchasing agency, is facing increasing
challenges to its gold trade monopoly at a time of rapidly rising demand for
the precious metal among Chinese consumers.
The establishment of a flourishing gold market in northern Liaoning province
near the Soviet border almost certainly poses the most severe threat in
years to the People's Bank's domination of the gold trade.
'Some stores trade gold bars, not just gold jewellery. See that's serious.
Of course, we're worried there will be more such markets,' said a People's
Bank official this week.
In an official statement the People's Bank, the country's central bank, has
accused those responsible for the Liaoning market of spreading disorder in
the gold jewellery market. It charged that gold merchants had 'harassed' the
state purchase plan.
Under present rules, the bank is empowered to acquire all gold produced in
China at about Yuan50 (USDollars 8.70) a gram, two-thirds of the world
price. Miners blame the depressed purchase price for lagging production,
which reached about 110 tonnes last year, compared with demand of 250
tonnes.
The China Daily said this week that the authorities were considering
sweeping reforms, including price-reform, in the gold sector to boost
production. The paper reported that gold production had declined in the
first quarter this year, although it also observed that some miners may be
withholding production from the state for sale on the booming local market.
Under China's present five-year plan (1991-1995) USDollars 1.3bn of
investment in gold mines is proposed with the aim of increasing production
by 40 per cent by 1996. At present rates of production growth it seems
unlikely China that will reach that target.
News of the Liaoning gold market and reports that Beijing is considering
seriously the establishment of a Gold Exchange coincide with reports that
China has emerged as the world's largest gold consumer.
According to Gold Fields Mineral Services in its annual report 'Gold 1993'
Chinese passion for gold jewellery, a desire by Chinese to hedge against a
depreciating currency and heavy gold purchases by the People's Bank
contributed to the gold buying spree.
The report said that the Chinese central bank might have purchased a
substantial portion of the 400 tonnes of gold sold by the Netherlands
central bank last year. China has not published gold reserve figures since
1981.
The People's Bank official described the Liaoning market as 'a very
sensitive problem'', adding that the State Council, or Cabinet, had not
resolved what to do about the unauthorised gold dealing, which appears to
have been sanctioned by local officials, but not necessarily by the
provincial government.
Chinese officials have recently indicated an interest in involving foreign
mining companies in the exploration and exploitation of China's gold
deposits, but this would require amendments to regulations that expressly
forbid such foreign involvement.
China has devoted much of its minerals exploration and development budget to
the search for gold in the past two decades with limited success. Estimates
of in-ground gold reserves stand at about 3,000 tonnes and were being added
to at the rate of about 10 per cent annually.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK's S Atlantic fishing licence
move will anger Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN PLANS to introduce a fish licensing regime for the South Georgia and
South Sandwich islands in the South Atlantic similar to the scheme operated
in the Falkland Islands since 1987.
Last week the UK government announced that it would extend the 12-mile limit
around the two island groups to 200 miles to halt over-fishing. British
officials said yesterday that new fishing regulations were being drafted
similar to those already being enforced around the Falklands.
Argentina reacted angrily to Britain's decision to extend territorial waters
and will be doubly displeased by a unilateral move to charge vessels for the
right to fish there.
Argentina claims sovereignty over the Georgias and South Sandwich islands as
well as the Falklands.
In statements issued over the weekend, Argentine officials said the new
200-mile limits would indirectly grant Argentina a role in fishing policy
because both island groups fell within the ambit of the 22-nation Commission
on Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, of which both
Argentina and Britain were members. British officials dismissed that
suggestion, however, insisting that they would not accept any Argentine role
that implied recognition of its territorial claims.
For the moment, the British announcement is only a formality as London lacks
fishery patrol ships to enforce the extended limits. However, officials said
it was considered important to announce it before the next fishing season
began in February.
Britain and Argentina are to hold talks on a new fisheries regime in waters
around the Falklands. No date has been set, but discussions are expected to
begin in May or June.
Argentina last year introduced a licensing scheme for ships operating in its
waters that is similar to the Falklands' regime and it has managed to poach
most of the islands' best customers by offering cut-price licences.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Opinions differ on effects of possible UK
rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in the UK government bond market again steered clear of 10 to
15-year stock - regarded as the most likely target for the next gilt
auction, details of which the Bank of England is expected to announce on
Friday.
Although the Conservatives' drubbing at last week's parliamentary
by-election and local government elections sparked talk of interest rate
cuts, opinions were divided on whether this would happen and what effect it
would have on the long end of the market.
The futures contract reflected this split, falling by more than a quarter
but then retracing most of its steps.
If a cut came, it was expected to be in response to weak economic news
rather than as an immediate political measure.
PUBLICATION of the French mini-budget, which contained no surprises, did
little to move government bonds.
The yield spread between French and German 10-year stock stayed at about 41
basis points, while the futures contract fell through the 117 support level.
This may indicate some nervousness ahead of the Danish referendum. One
economist said it served as a reminder that French bonds had not yet made it
to safe haven status.
The short end performed better on persistent hopes of interest rate cuts.
German government bonds held up better than most other continental European
stocks yesterday in quiet trading.
Hopes of a significant cut in the repo rate by the Bundesbank today have
been well damped down. Forecasts ranged from 2 to 7 basis points, taking the
rate a sliver below 7.7 per cent.
Again, Dutch government bonds outperformed bunds on the back of a strong
currency and hopes of interest rate cuts.
The biggest gains came in Denmark, where an opinion poll showed a
strengthening lead for the Maastricht Yes vote. This undid the damage
inflicted on the market on Monday by a weekend poll showing the opposite.
THE BEARS prevailed again in the Japanese government bond market, pushing
the yield on the benchmark No 145 stock due 2002 above 4.5 per cent for the
first time since January.
While there were underlying factors - the lapse in the yen's strength
against the dollar, the buoyant stock market - the main explanations for
yesterday's fall were weak demand and bearish sentiment.
One way of looking at it, according to one economist, was that the 145 had
been too expensive in the first quarter of this year and had now returned to
last year's levels.
The 145 underperformed the June futures contract, which closed in Tokyo at
107.85 after trading between 107.49 and 107.89. In London, however, there
was an early sell-off, taking the contract down to 107.38 before it
recovered somewhat.
US TREASURY prices remained stuck in a narrow trading range despite a
broadly successful afternoon auction of Dollars 16bn in three-year notes.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 103
29/32 , yielding 6.813 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , to yield 3.791 per cent.
With so much new supply coming to the market - on top of yesterday's
three-year sale, an additional Dollars 34bn in 10-year notes, 30-year bonds
and cash management bills will be offered later this week - investors and
dealers were reluctant to trade in in advance of the afternoon auction.
In the event, the sale went well. The offering was sold at an average 4.27
per cent yield, at the high end of expectations, and the issue was almost
three times oversubscribed. Yet the auction failed to lift prices, probably
because dealers and investors remained wary of buying large amounts ahead of
the 10-year and 30-year sales.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: DTB challenges Liffe with
Fibor contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the Frankfurt-based futures exchange, is
preparing to mount a further challenge to the London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange, with the launch of a short-term D-Mark
interest rate contract. The exchanges already compete for market share in
five-year (BOBL) and 10-year (bund) futures, while Liffe also trades a
highly-successful Euro D-Mark contract, based on D-Mark Libor.
The DTB yesterday discussed with senior German traders how best to structure
such a contract, which is likely to be based on the Frankfurt interbank
offered rate. Fibor is the domestic benchmark rate, which takes account of
Bundesbank minimum reserve requirements, and is rarely looked at by
international investors. A DTB official said it had not yet been decided
whether to go ahead with the contract, and admitted efforts to promote Fibor
were needed.
Although there is currently a sharp focus on German interest rate movements,
it is difficult to launch a futures contract without a strong cash market.
The German money market received a boost in February, when the Bundesbank
started offering new money market instruments called Bulis, but is still in
the early stages of development.
German institutions that currently use the Euro D-Mark contract would be
likely to switch to the DTB since it is owned by German banks, and German
institutions have tended to favour their domestic exchange when possible.
A Fibor contract could be used for hedging Buli positions, and for
spread-trading against the Euromark contract. If plans to link the DTB and
the Matif, the Paris futures exchange, go ahead, this could encourage spread
trading between Fibor and Pibor (the short-term French interest rate)
futures.
However, it is usually an uphill battle to win market share from an existing
contract.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: India Fund to convert to
open-ended status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE India Fund, one of the largest country funds, with net assets of more
than Pounds 240m, is to be converted into an open-ended fund to reduce the
substantial discount to net asset value at which the shares have been
trading.
The fund, created in 1986, traded at a premium to NAV until 1990 but moved
to a discount in 1991. A week ago, before the plan was announced, the shares
were trading at a 16 per cent discount, or 9 per cent taking withholding tax
into account.
Political troubles, the opening of other investment avenues in Indian
equities and the perception that the Bombay market was overvalued all
contributed to the discount, said Mr Charles Lillis, of fund managers
Merrill Lynch International Capital Markets (Guernsey).
Subject to approval at an extraordinary general meeting on May 28,
shareholders can redeem shares at net asset value less India's 10 per cent
capital gains tax and the fund will be free to issue shares.
Since the plan was announced, the share price has risen from 214p on May 5
to 228p, giving a market value of Pounds 215m. The price compares with a net
asset value of 235p per share after allowing for Indian withholding tax.
The NAV of the fund in local currency terms had risen from Rs48.7 per share
at launch to Rs126.48 by April 29 this year. In sterling terms, the rise was
from 100p per share to 255p.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Return of corporate borrowers generally
well received
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of corporate borrowers hit the Eurobond market yesterday, with
Bellsouth Telecommunications' Dollars 500m, five-year issue making the
biggest splash. Corporate borrowers have shied away from the Eurobond market
in recent months, leaving investors starved of top quality corporate paper,
so the deals launched yesterday were generally well-received.
Bellsouth Telecommunications is a triple A rated name which last tapped the
Eurobond market in 1988 with a Dollars 120m deal. The five-year bonds have a
5.25 per cent coupon, an issue price of 101.25 and were re-offered at 99.58.
The yield spread over the relevant US Treasury bond was 25 basis points at
launch, and tightened slightly to 24 basis points by late afternoon,
according to Morgan Stanley, the lead manager.
The deal went well, helped by the fact that Swiss retail investors and
European institutional investors have seen a dearth of high quality US
corporate paper, while Bellsouth itself is not a frequent name in the
market.
The proceeds will be used to repay some short and long-term debt,
refinancing the borrowings at more attractive rates. Morgan Stanley said the
borrower had achieved much more attractive terms in the Eurobond market than
it would have done in the domestic US bond market, claiming Bellsouth saved
about 15 basis points on the yield spread.
Bell Canada, the biggest Canadian phone company, also tapped the Eurobond
market yesterday, but chose the Canadian dollar sector with a CDollars 200m,
10-year issue. The borrower's credit rating is AA3/AA- and the deal was
priced to yield 76 basis points over the relevant government bond. Wood
Gundy, the lead manager, said the deal saw interest from continental
European investors attracted by the relatively high coupon of 8.5 per cent.
In the Eurosterling sector, McDonald's came with a Pounds 100m, 10-year bond
issue which was initially criticised for being rather aggressively priced.
The fast-food chain is not a frequent borrower in the Eurosterling sector.
BZW, the lead manager, said demand was mainly from institutional investors.
The bonds were launched with a yield spread of 40 basis points over the
10-year gilt, and by late afternoon had held their spread, trading at a
price of 98.85-98.90.
BZW said it looked at a couple of recent Eurosterling issues when pricing
the deal, citing a recent issue from Abbey National which is also a AA/AA2
credit and whose bonds were trading at a yield spread of 39-40 basis points
over gilts in the secondary market.
Other deals of interest yesterday included a Dollars 150m, three-year issue
from the Republic of Venezuela. The bonds were launched with a yield spread
of 473 basis points over US Treasuries but by late afternoon the spread had
tightened to 444 basis points, according to the joint lead managers.
CSFB, the book-runner, said the deal attracted strong investor interest from
a mix of retail and institutional investors interested in the emerging
markets.
Venezuela has tapped the Eurobond market before and in the secondary market
its 9 3/4 per cent bond due 1996 is trading at a yield spread of about 400
basis points over Treasuries.
A more recent bond issue - Dollars 130m of 9 1/8 per cent bonds due 1996 -
was targeted at the Colombian market and these bonds are trading at a yield
spread of about 450 basis points.
Kingdom of Spain added a further FFr1bn to its recent FFr6bn issue, lead
manager CCF said yesterday.

SEARS, Roebuck, has sold its mortgage banking group to a Pittsburg-based
bank holding company for Dollars 328m in cash.
The sale is the latest in a series of planned spin-offs designed to trim
Sears' financial businesses.
The Sears Mortgage Banking Group, part of Coldwell Banker Residential
Services, consists of Sears Mortgage Corp, Sears Mortgage Securities Corp
and Sears Savings Bank. PNC Bank, which is buying the group, will add the
units to its own retail banking operations.
PNC Bank is the 11th-largest US bank, with Dollars 51bn in assets and 550
community banking facilities in north-eastern US.
Mr Edward Brennan, Sears chairman, said: 'The successful completion of this
transaction is another important step in Sears' previously-announced
repositioning which will continue to enhance shareholder value.' Mr Brennan
said efforts to sell the Coldwell Banker residential brokerage business were
proceeding 'on schedule'.
Industry analysts said an employee-led buy-out of the Sears property unit
had been discussed, but apparently has not gained sufficient support. In the
first quarter, the Coldwell Banker unit recorded a net loss of Dollars 7.7m,
down from a profit of Dollars 3.8m the year before.
Sears Mortgage last year was the seventh-largest mortgage writer in the US,
generating Dollars 11.8bn in loans. It services a loan portfolio of Dollars
27.2bn. Sears Savings Bank has assets of around Dollars 6.7bn, mostly in
residential mortgage loans. Sears Mortgage Securities is one of the leading
conduits for securitising private home loans in the US and has a portfolio
of Dollars 8.7bn.
The sale to PNC is the second major asset sale for Sears this year.
In February, Sears sold 20 per cent of its Dean Witter Reynolds and Discover
Card units in an initial public offering. The offering, which was
oversubscribed, brought in more than Dollars 800m. Sears plans to complete
the Dean Witter spin-off later this year.
Sears has also said it would sell portions of its profitable Allstate
Insurance business.

THE EQUITABLE, the US life insurer in which France's Axa group holds a 49
per cent equity stake, yesterday reported an after-tax profit of Dollars
31.8m for the three months to end-March. This compared with a loss of
Dollars 3.7m in the same period of 1992, before one-off items.
The insurer said the first-quarter figure included Dollars 7.3m of
investment gains and restructuring charges of Dollars 3.9m. Last time, the
net loss stemmed partly from the inclusion of Dollars 24.3m of investment
losses and restructuring charges of Dollars 1.9m.
The net profit would have been higher but for continued losses from the
disability income business. This produced a net loss of Dollars 31.6m in the
1993 quarter, compared with a deficit of Dollars 4.5m in the same period of
1992.
The insurer said its core insurance business - after taking out disability
income losses and investment transaction gains - made a net profit of
Dollars 21m. On a similar basis, the comparable 1992 figure would have been
a Dollars 4.8m profit.
Equitable's 'investment services' operations, which include the Alliance
Capital fund management operation and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
brokerage, recorded an after-tax profit of Dollars 46.4m, slightly down on
the Dollars 49.3m in the same period of 1992.
On the investment side, The Equitable said it had stepped up the income
yield on its main general account portfolio to 7.74 per cent, compared with
7.44 per cent a year ago. It attributed the improvement to a shift to
longer-term fixed maturity investments, and better returns for
property-related holdings. 'Problem' commercial mortgages totalled Dollars
299.1m at the end of the first quarter, against Dollars 388.4m at the end of
1992.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESIDENT of Isetan, Japan's sixth-largest department store, yesterday
became the latest in a growing list of senior executives who have been
forced out of their posts by a leading bank.
Mr Kuniyasu Kosuge, Isetan's president for nine years, is to become the
group's honorary chairman. The reshuffle is thought to reflect Mitsubishi
Bank's disenchantment with his performance. Mitsubishi is Isetan's main
bank.
Isetan, in common with other Japanese department stores, is suffering from
the decline in consumer spending in Japan just as it is paying for ambitious
expansion in the late 1980s.
However, Isetan has also become embroiled in controversy over its ownership.
Mr Kosuge's departure is thought to be the culmination of a long power
struggle with Mitsubishi bank over Isetan's ownership.
About 29 per cent of Isetan's stock is owned by Shuwa, a
financially-troubled real estate company. Ito Yokado, a leading supermarket
group, last year attempted to buy into Isetan through the purchase of the
Shuwa stake. Such a deal would have broken the traditional divide between
department stores and supermarkets in Japan. However, the sale fell through,
thwarting plans to strengthen Isetan's balance sheet.
The replacement of Mr Kosuge with Mr Kazumasa Koshiba is likely to clear the
way for Mitsubishi bank to lead a consortium to finance the purchase by
Isetan of the Shuwa stake.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Taiwan may join BMW Rolls-Royce
in aero-engine venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW Rolls-Royce, the Anglo-German aero-engine joint venture, has been
talking to the Taiwanese government about possible involvement by the Asian
country in future developments of its BR710 series of medium-thrust engines.
Taipei said yesterday that Sir Ralph Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce, met Mr
Lien Chan, prime minister, on Monday to discuss the possibility of Taiwanese
participation in the project.
Taiwanese aerospace officials said discussions were still in a very early
stage, with the form and size of any investment unclear.
In London, Rolls-Royce said Sir Ralph was in Taipei on behalf of BMW
Rolls-Royce. The discussions were one of a number that the joint venture
company is having with companies about future developments of the engine.
A venture with BMW Rolls-Royce could represent the second significant step
in Taiwan's drive to develop its fledgling aerospace industry.
In January, Taiwan Aerospace, which is 29 per cent owned by the government,
agreed to form a venture with British Aerospace to make regional passenger
jets to be assembled in the UK and Taiwan.
A proposal for Taiwan Aerospace to invest Dollars 2bn for a 49 per cent
stake in McDonnell Douglas's civil aircraft business fell through last year.
The joint venture between BMW and Rolls-Royce, announced in May 1990, is a
big step towards strengthening the European aero-engine industry.
The venture is developing the BR710 family of engines - designed for
business and regional jets - at a plant outside Berlin. Since September it
has won orders from Gulfstream of the US and the Canadian Bombardier group.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Home advantage from overseas
experience - Japan's banks have accumulated expertise from European markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH tough times at home are forcing Japanese financial institutions to
curb overseas expansion, some banks admit they still have much to learn from
western markets.
Overseas securities subsidiaries are of increasing importance for Japanese
banks, which are now able to set up domestic securities operations after the
easing of barriers between the banking and securities industries last month.
The Industrial Bank of Japan, one of the four banks being allowed to set up
securities arms, says experience at lBJ International, its UK securities
subsidiary, will give it an advantage in developing domestic operations.
IBJI, which has been in London for 18 years, says the European capital
markets have been a nurturing ground for the Japanese banks enabling them to
accumulate expertise from the European capital markets.
Japanese banks, which were previously banned from the securities business by
article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Law, set up overseas securities
operations to gain exposure to the securities business.
The country's long-term credit banks and Norinchukin, the central
agricultural bank, will be the first to obtain access to the securities
business. The banks' affiliates, however, will be kept from the lucrative
stock market, and will only be able to underwrite corporate and
equity-linked bonds, and deal in straight bonds.
In spite of the disappointment of the banks at the tighter-than-expected
restrictions by the ministry of finance, Japanese corporations hope that the
banks will bring in more innovation and help develop the country's fledgling
capital markets.
IBJ is expected to set up a securities operation with Y30bn (Dollars 270m)
in capital and 130 staff. Mr Toshiki Tobe, managing director at IBJI, says
more than 10 people with experience at the London securities arm will be
transferred to the new Japanese securities affiliate. He hopes the new
domestic subsidiaries will change the closed and non-competitive nature of
the domestic bond market, currently dominated by the 'Big Four' securities
houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi.
'We want to bring in proper syndication methods into the Japanese market,'
says Mr Tobe. In the past, underwriting responsibilities were usually
divided between the big four, where relationships between the issuer played
a larger part than competitive performance.
The Tokyo arm of Morgan Stanley managed to become the first foreign leading
underwriter for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone by introducing the
fixed-price re-offering method.
Japanese companies also hope that the newcomers will help the development of
a liquid secondary market as in the Eurobond markets. Japanese institutional
investors still see straight bonds as investments to be kept till maturity,
and while US houses and leading domestic brokerages have started market
making of major issues, the secondary market remains almost non-existent due
to lack of interest among investors.
Companies also hope the entrance of the banks' subsidiaries will help the
development of a settlement system for the corporate bond market.
Meanwhile, IBJI is keen to expand its operations in London, and expects the
domestic securities business to bring in more European business
opportunities, such as sales of Japanese bonds to European investors. Unlike
most Japanese securities houses which have resorted to Japanese investors,
IBJI is cultivating overseas investors, especially in Europe.
The company wants to improve its credit information services on Japanese
companies, especially those which issue government guaranteed bonds. This
will be a core part of the business.
Unlike the Japanese securities companies, which are cutting overseas
overheads, Mr Tobe says IBJI will continue to expand in the City of London.
The securities house aims to increase its current operation of 300 to 500 in
the next four years by increasing sales, trading and support staff.
Mr Tobe also dismisses suggestions that the recent bombs in the City of
London will prompt an exodus of Japanese financial institutions. 'London is
too important, especially as a learning ground,' he says.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hong Kong to block 'back-door'
exchange listings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S regulatory authorities last night moved to stem the rush of
mainland Chinese companies seeking a stock exchange listing by blocking
'back-door listings' on Hong Kong's stock market.
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
issued a joint statement warning financial advisers and companies that
future deals would be scrutinised closely and stiff penalties applied to
those who breached listing and takeover rules.
Since October, large mainland Chinese state enterprises have acquired
control of eight Hong Kong companies. In two of the cases, arms of the
People's Liberation Army have been involved in the transactions.
A 'back-door listing' is a convenient way of avoiding the HKSE's
requirements for new listings. For mainland companies it is also a way of
avoiding Beijing's approval system for foreign listings.
Typically, a mainland company acquires a small, third-line, stock in Hong
Kong and proceeds to sell it mainland assets financed by placements and
rights issues.
This practice has raised concerns in Beijing with the China Securities
Regulation Commission, China's fledgling corporate watchdog, which has
responsibility for the development of securities markets on the mainland
China.
The SFC said it would take 'the strongest action open to it' under the
colony's takeover code if it found that a controlling shareholder selling to
another party had received a benefit unavailable to minority shareholders.
This action would include forcing the buyer to make available to all
shareholders the same level of compensation, and withdrawing the licence of
merchant banks and other financial intermediaries who advised on the deal.
The stock exchange said asset injections into a newly-acquired company might
result in the company being treated as a new applicant for listing, or
result in its listing status being reviewed more generally.
It also said it might treat transactions between a listed company and former
controlling shareholders as connected transactions. In that event a vote of
minority shareholders would be required for a transaction to take place.
The SFC could limit the number of shares investors can apply for in new
issues in a bid to curb massive over-subscriptions, Reuter adds. 'We are
studying the situation . . . and that's one possibility,' a spokesman said.
The commission's findings could be published next month.

<TEXT>
TWO of Japan's largest semiconductor manufacturers are teaming up with a US
company to develop the next generation microprocessor to serve as the heart
of the most powerful desktop computers.
NEC and Toshiba - Japan's largest semiconductor manufacturers, and keen
competitors - are joining forces with MIPS Technologies, a designer and
supplier of reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessor
technology, to develop an advanced microprocessor based on MIPS' technology.
The alliance highlights a growing tendency in the semiconductor industry to
share across national borders the spiralling costs and huge resources that
are needed to develop advanced semiconductors.
The three companies will jointly fund research and development, and
collaborate on process development. Other design experts also are expected
to take part the development project.
MIPS hopes the new microprocessors will go on sale in 1994.
The US group will be responsible for the architecture of the new
microprocessors, while NEC and Toshiba will be responsible for other aspects
of development and implementation, and for volume production.
The move also reflects NEC's and Toshiba's recognition of the importance of
open architectures in future semiconductor technology.
The three plan to spend Dollars 150m during the programme, but NEC estimates
that its investment over the next few years will amount to about Y10bn
(Dollars 90m).
The alliance will compete directly with five other groups that have rallied
around other Risc chips, with each hoping to become the world standard.
They are IBM and Motorola, which have joined forces around the PowerBook;
Digital Equipment and supporters of its Alpha chip; Sun Microsystems and its
backers; Hewlett-Packard and Hitachi; and Intel.

<TEXT>
A TOP Pentagon official yesterday warned McDonnell Douglas, the defence
contractor, that unless it improved its development of the C-17 transport
aircraft, the programme would be cancelled, writes Martin Dickson.
The company had been hoping for a 120-aircraft order, worth up to Dollars
40bn or more. However, the project has been subject to delays and cost
overruns.
Mr John Deutch, under-secretary of defence for acquisition, said in a letter
to the company that 'unless there is strong resolve on the part of McDonnell
Douglas corporate management to meet contract requirements, particularly
schedule specifications and testing requirements, the C-17 cannot be
continued.'
McDonnell said it was confident the programme was viable and would result in
production of the aircraft.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: FASB rule would cut earnings,
study says
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH-TECH companies in the US face a 49.5 per cent reduction in earnings if
a recently-proposed accounting ruling is approved, according to a study
released today by Wyatt Company, a leading consulting firm in employee
benefits.
Companies outside the high-tech sector would see earnings decline by a more
modest 5.8 per cent, the study found.
The survey comes as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) prepares
its official draft of new rules governing the disclosure and accounting
methods for share options. The proposed measures would make companies report
the value of share options granted to employees and deduct them from
profits.
Wyatt based its findings on a survey of 139 companies in the high-tech,
service and minerals/manufacturing sectors. It found the median option value
at high-tech companies was 58.8 per cent of the actual stock price on the
date of the option grant, against 35.9 per cent for other companies.
In addition, the average high-tech company grants nearly five times as may
options to employees as other companies.
If the FASB proposal goes ahead in its present form, most companies outside
the high-tech sector will not alter their stock-option policies, said Wyatt.
'Apparently, most of these companies assume that sophisticated financial
analysts will look beyond this expense in assessing company performance,
value and potential,' said Mr Matt Ward, a Wyatt consultant.
Wyatt's findings may give weight to critics of the FASB proposal who claim
it will have a disproportionate impact on start-up companies with little
working capital.
FASB will release its official draft in June. If adopted, the full proposal
would not take effect before 1997.

THE EQUITABLE, the US life insurer in which France's Axa group holds a 49
per cent equity stake, yesterday reported an after-tax profit of Dollars
31.8m for the three months to end-March. This compared with a loss of
Dollars 3.7m in the same period of 1992, before one-off items.
The insurer said the first-quarter figure included Dollars 7.3m of
investment gains and restructuring charges of Dollars 3.9m. Last time, the
net loss stemmed partly from the inclusion of Dollars 24.3m of investment
losses and restructuring charges of Dollars 1.9m.
The net profit would have been higher but for continued losses from the
disability income business. This produced a net loss of Dollars 31.6m in the
1993 quarter, compared with a deficit of Dollars 4.5m in the same period of
1992.
The insurer said its core insurance business - after taking out disability
income losses and investment transaction gains - made a net profit of
Dollars 21m.
On a similar basis, the comparable 1992 figure would have been a Dollars
4.8m profit.
Equitable's 'investment services' operations, which include the Alliance
Capital fund management operation and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
brokerage, recorded an after-tax profit of Dollars 46.4m, slightly down on
the Dollars 49.3m in the same period of 1992.
On the investment side, The Equitable said it had stepped up the income
yield on its main general account portfolio to 7.74 per cent, compared with
7.44 per cent a year ago. It attributed the improvement to a shift to
longer-term fixed maturity investments, and better returns for
property-related holdings.
'Problem' commercial mortgages totalled Dollars 299.1m at the end of the
first quarter, against Dollars 388.4m at the end of 1992.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: US brokerage to sell off energy
partnerships
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Securities, the fourth-largest brokerage firm in the US, is to
sell 35 energy partnerships to a US petroleum company for Dollars 557m. The
deal is an important step towards resolving the problems of Prudential's
troubled limited partnership business.
If the offer from Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum is accepted, Dollars 448m will
be paid directly to investors. This means that, along with the Dollars 665m
Prudential has already distributed, investors could receive about 76 cents
on the dollar for their initial investment of Dollars 1.45bn.
The partnerships, which invested in US oil and gas properties, were popular
in the 1980s and sold aggressively by big brokerage firms, particularly
Prudential. But after tax laws changes and depression in the energy and
property businesses, the partnerships racked up heavy losses.
Prudential faces a class-action lawsuit filed by thousands of investors who
lost money in the partnerships, and it is the subject of a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation into whether the firm improperly sold the
partnerships to investors.
The legal battle has cost the firm's parent, Prudential Insurance, more than
Dollars 400m, which has been set aside to cover the cost of fighting the
lawsuits.
Although neither the class-action lawsuit nor the SEC investigation will be
directly affected by the deal with Parker &amp; Parsley, Prudential will soon
offer investors who filed the class-action suit a new settlement in light of
the sale.
News of the deal, which if accepted will boost Parker &amp; Parsley's proven oil
and gas reserves by 75 per cent, was well received on Wall Street. In early
trading yesterday, the company's shares were up Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 on
the New York Stock Exchange.

breakthrough

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph yesterday introduced a telephone which allows
the user to send full-colour, television-quality still pictures down an
ordinary phone line, while simultaneously talking over the same line.
The company said the product, called the Picasso phone, was the first of its
kind and would be marketed to businesses - such as advertising, design and
engineering companies - which needed to transmit high quality images between
different sites.
Several products allow the transmission of still or moving images while
talking on a telephone line, but these generally require a special, upgraded
phone service, such as integrated services digital network (ISDN).
The new AT &amp; T equipment is distinctive in that it does not require the user
to have an ISDN service, but merely an ordinary telephone line.
The phone will sell in the US for around Dollars 3,295 and the cost of
calling on it will be the same as for a regular voice call.
The phone underlines two important trends at AT &amp; T: its increasing emphasis
on the merging of voice, video and computer technologies to produce new
products; and its greater entrepreneurial focus.
Mr Robert Kavner, head of its communications products business, said the new
phone had been developed in a year by a team drawn from across the AT &amp; T
group, which relied heavily on customer advice in creating the device.
Images can be put into the phone system from ordinary video cameras, digital
cameras, photo compact disc players or personal computers. Users can draw
over the transmitted pictures with a computer mouse to highlight a point.
AT &amp; T also announced yesterday it and Kodak, the photographic products
company, were exploring synergies between the two businesses with the aim of
producing 'end-to-end image communications solutions' for customers. Kodak's
photo CD player is one source which can send images over the Picasso system.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Apple moves towards 'open'
software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer is developing technology to enable applications programs
designed for its Macintosh personal computers to run, without modification,
on Unix workstations from Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and
International Business Machines.
The move represents a reversal of Apple's long-standing strategy of
protecting its competitive advantage by ensuring Macintosh software would
run only on its own computers.
Its switch to an 'open' software strategy heralds a mounting challenge to
the market dominance of Microsoft and Intel, the leading suppliers of
software and microprocessors for personal computers.
Apple also revealed that it had a project under way, called Amber, that will
make it easier to create application programs, such as word processors and
spreadsheets, that run both on Apple's Macintosh and on PCs using Windows,
the Microsoft operating system.
Apple said that it would form a non-profit association to share Amber
technology with other computermakers.
Last week, Sun Microsystems, the leading workstation manufacturer, also said
it was developing technology that would enable Windows programs to run on
Unix workstations. Both Sun and Apple are trying to loosen Microsoft's grip
on the software market.
The battle over standards is expected to lead to intense price competition
as manufacturers seek new ways to differentiate their products.
For computer users, the industry battle is expected to accelerate the trend
toward 'open systems' that enable different types and brands of computers to
share software and data more easily.
Increasingly, computer buyers want to be able to run the same software on
different types of computers to minimise training and management.
'The customer is in the driving seat today,' said Mr John Sculley, Apple
chairman and chief executive. Apple's 'extraordinary move' is 'precisely
what customers want,' said Mr Roel Pieper, president of Unix Systems
Laboratories, the former AT&amp;T unit responsible for Unix development and
licensing.

PHILIP MORRIS, the US tobacco and food group, yesterday appointed Mr William
Webb to head its international cigarette operations, writes Nikki Tait.
Mr Webb, who was previously president of the Asia/ Pacific region for Philip
Morris International, will report to Mr Geoffrey Bible, who was recently
appointed head of the worldwide tobacco operations.
The move is the latest in a series of top-level executive changes at Philip
Morris.
The company sent shockwaves round the consumer products sector when it
announced large price-cuts in its leading cigarette brands, including
Marlboro, last month.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Benefit turns sour for Bronfman
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE business empire con-trolled by Toronto's Bronfman family is scrambling
to unravel an executive compensation scheme which held the promise of rich
rewards, but has turned into a debilitating burden for hundreds of managers.
The scheme was based on the premise that managers perform best when they are
substantial shareholders in their companies. But plunging share prices of
many Bronfman companies have left the executives at best uncertain about the
future value of their portfolios, and at worst facing possible financial
ruin.
Noranda, the Bronfman-controlled resources group, last Monday allowed 50
managers to sell 1.6m shares they owned under the compensation scheme. The
proceeds, totalling CDollars 30m (USDollars 23.8m), have been used to repay
company loans used to finance the share purchases.
Mr Courtney Pratt, senior vice-president at Noranda, said yesterday the
sales were allowed 'to deal with the uncertainty and risk which a number of
people felt about the future'.
Compensation packages at Bronfman-controlled companies have typically
comprised relatively low salaries, but have required managers to buy large
parcels of shares financed by corporate loans.
The expectation was that they would reap hefty capital gains as share prices
rose. Interest on the loans would be paid out of dividends.
According to estimates by the Toronto Globe &amp; Mail, employees have borrowed
at least CDollars 250m from companies in the Bronfman orbit over the past
decade. Some have also taken out large bank loans.
The Noranda managers are among the luckier ones. They sold their shares at
CDollars 20.25 each. The biggest parcel was bought in 1987 at CDollars 18,
and most have made a small profit.
The strains in other Bronfman companies were evident however, in last week's
revelation by Hees International Bancorp, the group's merchant banking arm,
that it lent CDollars 5.2m to seven senior executives last year to help them
refinance bank loans used to acquire shares.
Several other Bronfman holding companies, including Edper Enterprises,
Brascan and Trilon Financial, have made similar advances.
Without the loans, the executives, who include the Bronfmans' chief
strategist, Mr Jack Cockwell, would either have had to put up extra
collateral or begin selling their stock.
The most intractable problem is at Royal Trustco, the financial services
group whose operations are being sold to Royal Bank of Canada. A condition
of the deal is that RT must find a way to 'unfetter' 175 managers encumbered
by share-purchase loans.
RT's share price has plummeted from a peak of almost CDollars 36 in 1986 to
49 cents. Mr Pratt said the extent of most of the loans 'is well beyond the
capacity of virtually anyone to repay'.
But any bail-out is complicated by Canadian tax rules, which do not allow a
capital loss to be offset against a taxable benefit.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ericsson bounces back to profit
in first three months

<TEXT>
STRONG demand and cost-cutting helped Ericsson, the Swedish
telecommunications group, swing back into profit in the first quarter of
this year.
The group, which has announced a series of big new orders in recent days,
said pre-tax profit amounted to SKr428m (Dollars 57.8m), compared with a
SKr363m loss in the first three months of 1992.
However, the results fell short of stock market expectations and the
company's B shares slid SKr9 to SKr291.
The group reaffirmed its forecast of a significantly improved result for the
whole of this year. In 1992, the group recorded profits of SKr1.30bn.
Order intake was healthy and sales were rising. First-quarter orders rose 34
per cent to SKr17.5bn while sales - helped by the weaker Swedish krona -
increased 36 per cent to SKr12.9bn.
Ericsson's orders have risen for six successive quarters. The most
impressive growth has been recorded by the company's radio communications
division, which houses its mobile phone operations. Order intake here
increased by 58 per cent.
It exceeded the level of orders recorded by the group's more traditional
public telecommunications business for the first time.
Radio communications sales rose to SKr4.76bn from SKr2.73bn, while public
communications lifted sales to SKr5.03bn from SKr4.16bn. A growth area for
the company was Asia, where sales rose to SKr2.15bn from SKr935m.
China has become the company's fifth-largest market, accounting for 7 per
cent of sales, compared with just 1 per cent a year ago.
Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive, said the group's order backlog of SKr45bn
at the end of the first quarter was its highest, and SKr7bn more than at the
beginning of the year.
He noted that although sales had been lifted the depreciation of the krona
had so far had little impact on profits.
