THE Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of the eastern
German economy, yesterday concluded the sale of the big Neptun shipyard
located at the northern port of Rostock.
The yard, a big lossmaker, was sold partly to Hanse Holding, which is part
of the Bremen-based Bremer Vulkan Verbund, and partly through a management
buy-out. The Treuhand will take over the debts, which the agency yesterday
would not disclose.
Although Treuhand officials declined to reveal the selling price, it said
Bremer Vulkan was committed to investing DM350m (Dollars 219m) and
guaranteeing 1,320 jobs. At present, about 1,450 people are employed at the
shipyard, which, before 1989, used to employ more than 7,000.
The security of the yard, at least in the short term, might reassure the
workforce, which as members of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering
union, have been on strike since last week in support of higher wage claims.
Treuhand officials indicated that Bremer Vulkan would not be using the yards
specifically for shipbuilding, particularly since there was overcapacity in
Germany. However, the yard could provide base for repairs and spare parts.

PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group, yesterday blamed lower
Swedish tobacco sales, losses from hotels and one-off lease settlement costs
for a 20 per cent fall in first-quarter profits.
Profits after financial items fell to SKr893m (Dollars 120.6m) from
SKr1.12bn in the same 1991 period, disappointing stock market expectations.
The B shares fell SKr4 to close at SKr169.
Sales were virtually static at SKr9.55bn, although on a pro-forma basis they
rose 10 per cent. Income from ongoing operations fell 4 per cent to SKr963m
from SKr1.01bn.
The group said a 20 per cent fall in Swedish tobacco sales in the first
quarter was a significant reason for the downturn - the result of hoarding
prior to an increase in tobacco tax at the end of last year.
It saw an increase in one-off costs to SKr83m from SKr3m, largely due to an
early settlement of a lease. It incurred a SKr150m deficit from its share of
losses in the Sara Travel and Hotel group.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: EniChem sinks deeper into red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Haig Simonian in Milan
ENICHEM, the loss-making Italian chemicals group controlled by the
state-owned Eni energy and chemicals concern, moved deeper into financial
difficulties with a L1,560bn (Dollars 1.02bn) loss last year.
The result, more than double the L742bn lost in 1991, reflected the
recession, which has cut demand for primary petrochemical products, and
continuing severe price competition. Sales, adjusted for disposals, fell by
8.2 per cent to L11,155bn
EniChem said prices for primary petrochemicals products had fallen between
10 per cent and 20 per cent last year as a result of weak demand and
overcapacity. The Italian market had been hit particularly hard owing to the
slowdown in the auto, building and textile industries.
EniChem's losses, which included L300bn in provisions for environmental
protection measures, came in spite of indications last year that the group
might be able to contain losses to within L1,000bn due to cost-savings and a
big cash injection from the Eni parent company.
However, the group's finances appear to have deteriorated steadily during
the year.
Operating losses deepened by L231bn to L308bn in spite of lower raw material
prices and attempts to contain fixed costs.
Meanwhile, interest costs, adjusted for disposals, rose by a further L131bn
to L893bn in 1992. Total group debt rose to L7,391bn from L7,004bn, in spite
of the cash injection.
EniChem has been struggling to restructure to reduce costs. The workforce
was cut by over 4,000 employees last year, contributing to a L80bn saving on
the wage bill.
In July, formal approval is due for a plan to merge 10 wholly-owned
subsidiaries with the EniChem parent company, which is forecast to produce
annual savings of about L200bn

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group which is a candidate for
privatisation, experienced problems in France during the first quarter of
this year, according to Mr Jean Yves Haberer, chairman, although its
international operations fared well.
Mr Haberer, who has been criticised for his aggressive expansion and lending
strategy, said the group, which fell into the red last year, had a bad first
quarter in its domestic market due to the economic recession and rise in
business failures.
However, Credit Lyonnais's commercial banking interests outside France
produced a good performance, according to the chairman, with BfG, the German
bank in which it recently acquired a controlling stake, performing
satisfactorily.
Credit Lyonnais, one of France's largest commercial banks, has been in
trouble for some time, mainly because of its exposure to a series of
corporate collapses, notably the late Mr Robert Maxwell's media empire and
MGM, the crippled Hollywood film studio.
Last year, these problems were aggravated by the economic squeeze in France
which left Credit Lyonnais very vulnerable to property and small companies,
two of the weakest areas of the economy. It swung from net profits of
FFr3.2bn (Dollars 592.6m) in 1991 to a net loss (the first since 1974 and
the third in its history) of FFr1.8bn, on net banking income of FFr48.9bn.
The announcement of Credit Lyonnais's first-quarter problems in France comes
at a time when the new centre-right government is finalising plans to
privatise a number of state-controlled companies. Credit Lyonnais is
believed to be a candidate, although analysts suspect that its financial
problems may force the government to delay the sale until after Banque
Nationale de Paris.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fila confirms NYSE listing plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FILA, the Italian sports shoes and clothing maker owned by the Gemina
holding company, has confirmed plans to quote 30 per cent of its shares on
the New York Stock Exchange.
The move, which follows a similar decision last month by Gemina to list
shares in the Natuzzi furniture group, reflects growing disenchantment by
Italian companies with the domestic stock market and their readiness to make
initial public offerings abroad.
It is believed similar plans are being considered by Benetton Sportsystem,
the fast-growing sports goods group being assembled by the acquisition of
famous brands by the Benetton family. Bankers believe a listing for the
group, which had sales of Dollars 608m in 1992, could come in the second
half of next year.
Fila, one of Italy's best-known sports brands, has branched out from
clothing into footwear. The development has been accompanied by a marked
internationalisation of its business, with the US accounting for 58 per cent
of sales.
Gemina will place 37.5m Fila shares, held by its Gemina Investments
subsidiary, in New York in a deal led by Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs.
The shares represent 30 per cent of Fila's capital. Gemina Investments will
retain 6 per cent, while the Gemina parent company controls the remainder.
The offering will be made via 7.5m American Depositary Shares, each
comprising five Fila shares.
Separately, Gemina Investments is placing 10 per cent of its 15 per cent
stake in Natuzzi as part of an initial public offering in the US. The deal
is part of a placing of 30 per cent of Natuzzi's stock in the US.

FONDIARIA, the Italian insurance group controlled jointly by Ferruzzi and
the Gaic holding company, yesterday sold its 21 per cent stake in Aachener
und Munchener Beteiligungs to a group of German institutions for DM985m
(Dollars 616m).
The deal concludes a long-running battle between the formerly-allied Italian
and German insurers, and provides a much-needed cash injection to Fondiaria,
Italy's third-biggest private-sector insurer.
The buyers are Deutsche Bank (10 per cent), Allianz (5 per cent) and
Dresdner Bank and Munchener Ruckversicherungs, which are taking about 3 per
cent each.
The deal follows months of secret negotiations over the stake, the existence
of which had threatened to disrupt co-operation between AMB and Assurances
Generales de France, the French state-owned insurer which owns just over 25
per cent in the German insurance company.
Hostilities between AMB and AGF ended last summer and Fondiaria tried,
unsuccessfully, to use its holding to block shareholder approval of the
co-operation agreement between the French and German companies.
The agreement involved the sale of AMB's holding in BfG Bank, Germany's
sixth largest bank, to Credit Lyonnais in a transaction valuing BfG at
DM2.1bn.
The deal is a much-needed lift to Fondiaria, which has suffered falling
profits as a result of difficulties in the Italian market and growing debts
as a result of its foreign ambitions.
Last year, Ferruzzi, which is facing a heavy debt burden, warned it intended
to take a closer involvement in Fondiaria's affairs. The changes culminated
in the departure of Mr Alfonso Scarpa, Fondiaria's managing director and
architect of foreign expansion plans.
Although Ferruzzi has emphasised its determination not to sell Fondiaria, a
disposal is still widely expected by analysts in view of the parent
company's severe debt problems.
Among possible scenarios, short of selling Fondiaria, are the disposals of
the group's Milano and La Previdente insurance subsidiaries.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Packer sells 8% stake in Westpac
Banking
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KERRY Packer, the Australian media entrepreneur, has sold an 8 per cent
stake in Westpac Banking Corporation to Lend Lease Corporation, the
financial services group.
The shares changed hands at ADollars 3.50 each for a total transaction of
ADollars 490m (USDollars 352.5m). Mr Packer said yesterday his company,
Consolidated Press Holdings, would make an ADollars 100m profit on the
disposal.
The purchase increases the Lend Lease group's stake in Westpac to almost 10
per cent. The group, which is likely to go up to 12 per cent by buying
Consolidated Press's remaining 2 per cent, has been granted federal
government approval to eventually take its shareholding in Westpac to 15 per
cent.
The deal leaves Westpac with two large financial institutions as dominant
shareholders. AMP Society controls 15 per cent of the bank.
Lend Lease has agreed to pay Consolidated Press half of any profit if it
sold Westpac shares over the next 12 months, up to a maximum of 50 cents a
share.
Mr Packer accumulated his 10 per cent Westpac stake late last year,
prompting an invitation from the bank to take a seat on the board. However,
Mr Packer resigned from the board in January, just one week after joining,
following a disagreement over the bank's recovery programme.
Mr Packer said his company had been approached by Lend Lease late last week.
He said Lend Lease, which included a big insurance business through MLC Life
and Australian Eagle, would bring added stability to Westpac's shareholder
base.
After a failed ADollars 1.2bn rights issue last May and a ADollars 1.56bn
loss for the year to September 1992, Westpac's share price was trading at
ADollars 2.40 last November against a pre-rights issue peak of ADollars 4.63
in January 1992.

Great Western Resources, the US-based oil, gas and coal company which almost
collapsed last year following litigation with its largest customer, showed
significant improvement over the six months to end-March, when pre-tax
losses were reduced from Dollars 13.6m to Dollars 2.03m (Pounds 1.3m).
Total revenues of the USM-quoted group improved from Dollars 34.7m to
Dollars 59.1m, the bulk of which was derived from the coal operations, which
contributed Dollars 45.5m against Dollars 18.5m last time.
The dispute with the South Carolina Public Service Authority has now been
settled, and the net loss for the period, after a tax credit of Dollars
518,000 (Dollars 610,000), was Dollars 1.51m (Dollars 13m). Losses per share
came out at 2 cents (15 cents).
The company said it had signed a new credit agreement with Citibank, which
permitted a Dollars 34m capital programme for the year. Of this, Dollars

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: McLaughlin &amp; Harvey Pounds 6.8m in loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES AT McLaughlin &amp; Harvey, the County Antrim-based construction group,
widened from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 6.8m pre-tax for the year to
end-December. Turnover fell Pounds 35m to Pounds 63.2m.
The deficit took account of a reduction in both interest charges to Pounds
1.09m (Pounds 1.71m) and exceptional provisions to Pounds 3.34m (Pounds
4.13m).
The group's principal objective for 1992 was to cut borrowings. At year end
these amounted to Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 11.2m). The reduction was partly
achieved at the expense of profitability, particularly in the housing
division where prices were reduced to secure sales and reduce exposure in
this sector.
Additionally, the sale of the Mallusk Park investment property made a
significant contribution.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brymon expected to be split in revamp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS and Maersk Air of Denmark are expected to announce today a
restructuring of The Plimsoll Line to rescue the regional airline services
it operates.
TPL, in which BA and Maersk each hold a 40 per cent stake, owns Brymon
European Airways, formed last year from the merger of Plymouth-based Brymon
Aviation and Birmingham European Airways.
Following losses over the past four years, the two companies have now
decided to demerge the operations with BA taking over Brymon and Maersk Air
the Birmingham airline.
The two companies are expected to inject about Pounds 5m to Pounds 6m each
to restructure TPL and rescue the regional airline services together with
about 500 jobs. However, there will be about 125 job losses, mainly at
Brymon.
The TPL airlines lost about Pounds 2m on turnover of Pounds 66m in the
1991-92 year and a further Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m in 1992-93 on similar
turnover.
BA will also take over Plymouth City Airport, where it absorbed the Brymon
operations. The agreement still has to be cleared by the UK regulatory
authorities, including the Office of Fair Trading.
Brymon operates a fleet of small turbo-prop aircraft including Dash 8,
serving the west country, Aberdeen and Newcastle.
Birmingham European flies from the Midlands and Humberside and include some
jet services. Maersk Air will become the first non-British company to own a
British carrier following the liberalisation of the European airline
industry at the beginning of this year.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fleming Claverhouse raising up to Pounds
110m in conversion issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLEMING Claverhouse is raising up to Pounds 100m via an offer of conversion
shares.
The investment trust is only expecting to receive between Pounds 25m and
Pounds 35m but has set a high maximum so that applications do not have to be
scaled down.
The shares have been trading at a premium to net asset value - 5.3 per cent
at the start of dealing yesterday - a sign that demand exceeds supply.
Issuing new shares may eliminate the premium.
The directors believe that the potential for economic recovery in the UK
provides attractive opportunities for investment and it is an appropriate
time to expand the capital base.
The trust is the top performer in its sector over both three and 10 years,
with growth of 579.7 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income
reinvested) over 10 years. It is attractive to private investors, who now
own nearly 65 per cent of the equity.
The shares, issued at 100p each, will be converted into ordinary shares once
the proceeds of the offer are invested. This is designed to ensure that
existing shares do not suffer any dilution in net asset value, and is now a
common structure for investment trust share offerings.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: An improving climate for flotations - A
line up for market and a revival of investor interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLIMATE for flotations has rapidly moved from freezing to a near
summer-like warmth as investor interest has revived.
Recent issues have been comfortably over-subscribed and first day dealings
have shown premiums.
There is a string of companies lining up for market taking advantage of
historically high share prices.
Institutional investors are currently keen on smaller companies - most of
the recent flotations have given issuers market values of under Pounds 100m.
Private investors, painfully aware of falling returns from cash, are turning
to equity investment. New issues provide a commission-free way of buying
shares, with the hope of a 'stagging' profit.
However, there are concerns that the public is being disadvantaged in some
issues. Smaller flotations are conducted through institutional placings,
with the private investor excluded.
Such has been the recovery in sentiment that the Stock Exchange has reversed
last summer's relaxation of its listing rules on the proportion of shares to
be offered publicly.
That move was made when some issues attracted less public demand than
expected. Then the Exchange told corporate financiers they could negotiate
to cut the proportion to be offered to the public.
According to the listing rules issues raising more than Pounds 30m must be
by public offer, but up to half can be placed with institutions. A greater
proportion can be placed in particularly large issues or, the Yellow Book
says, 'in other exceptional circumstances'. Poor retail demand appears to
come in that category.
In subsequent offers a 75:25 per cent split between firm placing and public
offer was normal. But as retail interest in flotations picked up, the Stock
Exchange began to edge back towards the written rule.
A turning point was the David Lloyd Leisure flotation in March. That issue
raised Pounds 59m with 75 per cent of the shares placed firm.
The former tennis star's business attracted applications for over 7 times
the number of shares on offer.
Mr Philip Stephens, of UBS, the stockbroker, says 'the success of some
issues has pushed us back to the rubric'. He acts for both Stagecoach, the
coach operator which floated in April with a 65:35 split, and for OGC
International, the contractor specialising in North Sea oil and gas
construction, due to float later this month with a 50:50 division.
'Retail interest is certainly there and has been developing through the
year' says Mr Stephens.
The Exchange is prepared to give some leeway on the Pounds 30m issue size,
with a public offer not necessarily required for issues up to Pounds 35m.
In March Hambros Insurance Services raised Pounds 35m through a placing and
financial intermediaries offer.
This willingness to raise the minimum amount where a public offer becomes
obligatory suggests the Exchange is finding it harder to justify demanding a
public offer on a Pounds 30m issue.
This minimum has, in any case, been gradually rising for years and the 50
per cent institutional placing is relatively new. One merchant banker
remembers doing an offer for sale for Pounds 5m in 1986. Another says:
'People forget it is not very long ago that issues over Pounds 30m were all
straight offers for sale to the public'.
The Exchange is believed to be looking at alternatives to public offers so
long as they can be shown to accommodate public demand. It appears
sympathetic to the financial intermediaries route.
It may gradually edge the minimum upwards, so long as there are no
vociferous complaints. However, it is understood to believe that larger
offers, and not just privatisations, do need public offers.
The rise of the financial intermediaries offer could thus be part of a trend
away from the traditional public offer for sale, with all that they entail
in terms of fixing a price and underwriting the issue over the week or so
before applications come in and dealings start in the shares.
Privately, sponsors of issues and institutional investors would be happy to
have a cosy arrangement cutting out the private investor. Publicly the line
is often 'if retail demand is there, why not tap it?'
Says one corporate financier: 'We prefer a firm placing element. It gives
you a stable long term institutional investor base. If you offer the lot to
the public you have to price it a bit lower to make it go and institutions
end up buying it back'.
The expectation of low pricing and stagging profits were partly behind the
huge - and many regard as undesirable - oversubscriptions of new issues in
the mid-1980s. Some fear it could happen again this year.
One banker said: 'Some recent oversubscriptions are unhealthy. People have
no idea what they are buying, they are just stagging. One issue will go
wrong, fingers will get burnt and then we'll be back to last summer again'.
Some brokers and bankers feel that this could be avoided if there was a
further development of a 'book-building' approach to new issues, with a
greatly truncated period between pricing an issue and dealings starting.
In the US most of an issue is sold in advance on the basis of a 'red
herring' prospectus which contains a price range. Pricing is done one
evening, on the basis of demand found among investors, and the issue is
usually declared 'all sold' the following morning.
To some extent the UK practice is moving that way. Pathfinder prospectuses,
introduced with the first British Telecommunications sale in 1984, do not
include a price range. But they do provide the basis for informal
book-building with institutions.
'Pricing is very much driven by institutional demand even if half is going
to the public,' says one broker.
The intermediaries offer could tie into a book building approach, thus
accommodating private investor demand while removing the risks inherent in
an offer for sale.
But such an offer excludes investors who do not have a stockbroker and
prefer to apply for issues 'off the page'. And it means extra commissions
for either the company or the investor to pay to the intermediaries.
Companies such as Sharelink, the private client dealing service, and the New
Issue Register, have launched new issue schemes for private investors.
Sharelink offers an application and dealing service under which it applies
for the shares on behalf of investors and can then sell them on the first
day of dealing, or later, or transfer them to a personal equity plan. NIR
hopes to offer sponsors of issues a list of investors prepared to buy into
new issues.
If such schemes are plugged into the financial intermediaries offers or even
the institutional placing, then an issue could be fully placed - including a
placing with retail investors - in advance of pricing. It would cut out the
need for a period when investors fill in and post applications.
Should the Stock Exchange go along with such notions, the days of heady
oversubscriptions, queues of applicants at banks' doors and frantic first
day dealings, at least in smaller issues, could be over.

FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: J Crean in red after IAS
write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES CREAN, the Dublin- based industrial holding company, suffered a
pre-tax loss of IPounds 15.4m (Pounds 15.1m) for the 1992 year reflecting a
IPounds 30.7m total write-off of its investment in IAS, an aircraft leasing
subsidiary in which it first invested in 1986.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 amounted to IPounds 11.4m.
An additional provision of IPounds 1.8m was made against a loan for an
option to acquire a holding in a UK business, making a total exceptional
charge of IPounds 32.5m.
It is the second year running that the group made a write-off provision, a
IPounds 7.1m charge having been made in 1991.
Operating profits fell 2 per cent to IPounds 24.1m on turnover up 8 per cent
to IPounds 226.2m. Net borrowings rose 21.4 per cent to IPounds 69.7m,
representing 76.5 per cent of net assets including goodwill.
The company said that the IAS write-off 'which includes all Crean's loans,
investments and guarantees' to the company, has been made because 'the
affairs of IAS have over-shadowed Crean's other business interests in a
disproportionate manner for the past two years'.
Crean increased its stake in IAS from 31 to 38 per cent in 1991. The company
said that a recovery in aviation 'offers a good prospect of realising value
from its loan stock in IAS in due course'.
Crean's main profit centres are in food and beverages, in operations in the
US and Ireland, and in print and packaging through Inishtech, a 72.7 per
cent-owned subsidiary.
Losses per share amounted to 70.3p. A final dividend of 4.635p is
recommended for a total of 12.5p (18.34p).

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Candover plans to raise new funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANDOVER Investments, an investment trust specialising in management
buy-outs, yesterday announced plans to raise a new fund valued at between
Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m.
It will invest between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m of its own money towards
this total alongside funds raised from outside investors.
If Candover succeeds in reaching even its minimum target, this would be the
largest fund raising by an independent venture capital company for more than
three years.
In March the company said it did not need to think seriously about new
fund-raising but it has since been using the money in its existing funds and
wants to be well-placed to invest in any large deals which come along, said
Mr Roger Brooke, chairman.
Candover still has Pounds 75m left to invest from its two existing funds, a
Pounds 319m fund raised in 1989, and a Pounds 37m smaller companies fund
raised in 1991. But other UK venture capital funds have had great
difficulties raising money over the past 18 months and Candover is keen to
ensure it has enough funds available.
The company has not set a formal target figure of funds to be raised but it
set itself a target of Pounds 200m with its 1989 fund and finally achieved a
total of Pounds 319m, including Pounds 20m of its own money.
'We are talking about the same order of magnitude,' said Mr Brooke. Candover
started talking to UK institutions two to three weeks ago and expects to
begin approaching US investors in the next couple of months. 'The board and
I feel we should be a bit more aggressive in investing. We have Pounds 25m
of cash from realisations,' said Mr Brooke.
Candover has had quite a good reaction from UK investors, including people
who invested in its last fund, said Mr Brooke. But many UK venture capital
funds had failed to provide the returns expected by investors and had been
unable to dispose of their investments so institutions were still waiting
for their money back. In the US, in contrast, institutions are increasing
their allocation to venture capital.
Candover expects to back two or three more deals this year to exhaust its
present funds. Four of the companies in which it has already invested are
planning a stock market listing while two are considering selling out to
other companies.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Alco Standard bids Pounds 67m for Erskine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALCO STANDARD, the acquis-itive US paper and office products distribution
group, yesterday made a Pounds 67.4m recommended cash offer for Erskine
House, the Kent-based office equipment service company.
Under the terms of the proposed deal Alco will pay 90p a share for each
Erskine ordinary share and 100p a share for the preference stock.
In addition, provided the deal goes ahead, Erskine will pay shareholders a
second interim dividend of 2.5p.
Erskine, with operations in the US, UK and Germany, has been hard hit by the
decline in machine sales in the UK which fell 24 per cent in the six months
to September 30.
First half pre-tax profits declined 29 per cent to Pounds 4.7m and the
company warned in March that it would not be paying a full year dividend.
The shares, which had been trading just above a 10 year low of 30p in recent
weeks, jumped 54p to 89p yesterday after Alco bought 10m shares in the
market, equivalent to a 21.7 per cent stake, at the 92 1/2 p offer price -
including the second interim dividend.
Mr Ray Mundt, chairman and chief executive of Alco, which is quoted on the
New York Stock Exchange and reported operating income of Dollars 225.7m
(Pounds 146.5m) on turnover of Dollars 4.93bn last year, said the proposed
acquisition represented 'the next logical step' in the group's global
strat-egy.
Mr Brian McGillivray, Erskine's chairman and chief executive, said the offer
was a 'good deal' for shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers,
although he acknowledged that he would have prefered to keep the company
independent.
If the deal goes ahead he is not expected to stay with the group although
any parting would be amicable.
Alco's office products division already operates the largest independent
copier dealer network in North America with annual revenues of Dollars 1.5bn
and has targeted Europe for further expansion.
Mr Mundt said Alco identified Erskine as a possible acquisition target 'some
time ago,' but only began negotiations on Friday night. The negotiations
were completed over the weekend.
Erskine House is the leading office equipment distributor in the UK with a
6-7 per cent market share although more than half its 1992 turnover and
pre-tax profits came from its US operations.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pubs acquisition gives first half lift to
Vaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUX GROUP'S acquisition of 265 pubs last year helped boost the
Sunderland-based brewer's first half trading profit by 10.7 per cent to
Pounds 17.3m.
The pre-tax line was distorted by the switch to FRS 3 with headline figures
showing a 32 per cent decline. However, excluding property disposals and
exceptional profit from the sale of the Blayney's off-licence chain, pre-tax
profits for the 24 weeks to March 20 rose from Pounds 9.21m to Pounds 9.66m,
in line with market expectations.
Earnings per share, on the same basis, rose 6.7 per cent to 5.42p. The
interim dividend is held at 3.25p.
Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman, said: 'This has been a far from easy period in
which to make progress . . . but there have been some bright spots which
give hopeful signs for the future.'
The breweries and enlarged tenanted pub estate lifted profits from Pounds
7.31m to Pounds 8.43m. Total beer sales fell 1.4 per cent. Draught volumes,
however, rose 8.4 per cent, with Samson, the leading brand, ahead 13.2 per
cent. Cask beer volumes were nearly 25 per cent higher but sales of
low-margin packaged beer fell 20 per cent. Sales of wines, spirits and soft
drinks all increased.
Vaux Inns, taking in the 127 managed pubs, raised profits from Pounds 2.16m
to Pounds 2.35m with income from amusement machines beginning to improve.
Profits from the St Andrew's nursing homes were 19 per cent higher at Pounds
1.99m. Occupancy was close to 92 per cent - more than two percentage points
above the same period last year. The group bought a 50-bed home in Co Durham
last week and has two further homes under development.
Swallow Hotels increased profits 8.7 per cent to Pounds 5.3m. Occupancy
improved 3.4 percentage points to 56.4 per cent but achieved room rates
declined 6 per cent. 'Forward bookings look rather healthier than at this
time last year,' Sir Paul said.
'If the recession is over, we can expect a recovery in hotel profits, which
has been the biggest problem faced by the group in this recession.'
The pubs acquisition programme raised net debt from Pounds 94.6m to Pounds
125.2m, representing 30 per cent of shareholders' funds.
COMMENT
Signs of recovery are still weak in Vaux's northern trading area. On the
beer side, market share gains are tempered by an overall decline in its beer
volumes, down 2.8 per cent on a like-for-like basis, and continuing margin
pressure. Pub income from food sales and amusement machines is improving,
but slowly. Hotel occupancies and forward bookings are rising but customers
are haggling over room rates. On full year profit forecasts of Pounds 25.5m
and a p/e of 17, the shares look expensive despite a prospective yield of
4.8 per cent.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;W considers Philippines venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE AND Wireless, the telecommunications group, is considering a Dollars
3bn (Pounds 2bn) joint venture which could give it a prime role in the
development of the telephone system in the Philippines.
The venture would be the latest in a succession of moves by C&amp;W to establish
itself as the leading international telecoms operator in the Asia Pacific
region.
It already has stakes in two network operators in the Philippines. Other
investments in the region include a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecom and
a 24.5 per cent share in Optus, the main domestic competitor to Telstra
(formerly AOTC) in Australia.
The other partners are Australia's Telstra International and Benpres of the
Philippines.
C&amp;W stressed that at present the partners have agreed only to carry out
'feasibility studies' into the possibility of establishing a new company to
expand and modernise the telephone network.
Analysts believe prospects for the new company would be bright: with fewer
than 1.5 fixed lines per hundred people, the Philippines has one of the
lowest levels of line penetration in the region and its government is
anxious to extend and update the system.
About 40 per cent of the venture will be owned by C&amp;W and Telstra, another
40 per cent by Benpres, and the rest by smaller investors.
Mr Andrew Harrington, regional telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers Hong
Kong, said the joint venture was 'typical of the growing trend for
governments in the region to seek expertise and investment from overseas
telecoms companies to help with their network development. It reinforces
C&amp;W's pre-eminent role in the region.'

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Alco Standard bids Pounds 67m for Erskine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALCO STANDARD, the acquis-itive US paper and office products distribution
group, yesterday made a Pounds 67.4m recommended cash offer for Erskine
House, the Kent-based office equipment service company.
Under the terms of the proposed deal Alco will pay 90p a share for each
Erskine ordinary share and 100p a share for the preference stock.
In addition, provided the deal goes ahead, Erskine will pay shareholders a
second interim dividend of 2.5p.
Erskine, with operations in the US, UK and Germany, has been hard hit by the
decline in machine sales in the UK which fell 24 per cent in the six months
to September 30.
First half pre-tax profits fell 29 per cent to Pounds 4.7m and the company
warned in March that it would not be paying a full year dividend.
The shares, which had been trading just above a 10 year low of 30p in recent
weeks, jumped 54p to 89p yesterday after Alco bought 10m shares in the
market, equivalent to a 21.7 per cent stake, at the 92 1/2 p offer price -
including the second interim dividend.
Mr Ray Mundt, chairman and chief executive of Alco, which is quoted on the
New York Stock Exchange and reported operating income of Dollars 225.7m
(Pounds 146.5m) on turnover of Dollars 4.93bn last year, said the proposed
acquisition represented 'the next logical step' in the group's global
strategy.
Mr Brian McGillivray, Erskine's chairman and chief executive, said the offer
was 'good deal' for shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers,
although he acknowleded that he would have prefered to keep the company
independent.
If the deal goes ahead he is not expected to stay with the group although
any parting would be amicable.
Alco's office products division already operates the largest independent
copier dealer network in North America with annual revenues of Dollars 1.5bn
and has targeted Europe for further expansion.
Mr Mundt said Alco identified Erskine as a possible acquisition target 'some
time ago,' but only began negotiations on Friday night. The negotiations
were completed over the weekend.
Erskine House is the leading office equipment distributor in the UK with a
6-7 per cent market share although more than half its 1992 turnover and
pre-tax profits came from its US operations.
Erskine's US operations are strongest in New York, Houston and Los Angeles
and will strengthen Alco's existing US business, according to Mr John Stuart
who runs Alco's office products operations.
Both companies supply and service the same office equipment from Canon,
Ricoh, Sharp and Minolta.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Avon Rubber calls for Pounds 22.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVON RUBBER, the tyre and motor components company, yesterday reported a 22
per cent increase in interim profits and announced a cash call to raise
Pounds 22.5m for capital investment.
The 1-for-4 rights issue at 440p will form part of a Pounds 40m investment
programme over the next two years in its auto components, tyre and technical
products divisions.
The share price fell 31p to 509p.
Mr Tony Mitchard, chief executive, said he hoped the rights issue would not
dilute earnings in 1994, the first full year.
Gearing after the rights issue would fall to 22 per cent at the end of this
year. Without the rights it would have risen to 55 per cent, compared with
50 per cent at the last year end.
In the six months to April 3, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.1m to
Pounds 5.01m on sales up 16 per cent at Pounds 133.4m (Pounds 115.3m).
Earnings per share rose 40 per cent to 15.5p (11.1p); the interim dividend
is maintained at 5p.
Automotive components was hit by weak sales in Germany and by manufacturers
selling from stock. Operating profit fell from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.62m
in spite of sales up 21 per cent at Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 40.1m).
The technical products division, which makes golf grips, milking machine
components, photocopier rolls and aerosol gaskets, saw profits increase from
Pounds 2.17m to Pounds 3m on sales up 22 per cent at Pounds 37m (Pounds
30.6m).
Tyre profits rose sharply to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.64m) on sales up 9 per
cent at Pounds 41m (Pounds 37.6m) as the division benefited from overhead
cost savings.
COMMENT
It will not have escaped investors' attention that they last paid 500p four
years ago to fund part of the Cadillac Rubber and Plastics acquisition and
are only just seeing a return. This time the call is to fund the recovery,
gearing being too high and the investment needs apparently too pressing to
allow investment from Avon's own resources. Almost certainly the rights will
dilute earnings in the first full year unless the company can lay down the
investments extremely quickly. Earnings are therefore likely to rise to only
38.1p in 1994, against a previously forecast 42p. The shares are therefore
in for a dull time until the company proves it can produce the organic
growth its ambitious expansion is anticipating. Not least, investors will
want to see how far German auto makers will shift allegiance from
traditional, and expensive, local component suppliers to the likes of Avon,
the price advantage of which has so far cut little ice.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Improving trend at United Newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD STEVENS of Ludgate, chairman of United Newspapers, told yesterday's
annual meeting that profits in the first half of this year should be up on
last year's comparable period.
He added: 'We hope that this improvement will be maintained throughout the
year. Further improvement can be expected from any upturn in the economy.'
Lord Stevens warned, however, that the group's markets showed little sign of
any significant pickup in the economy - United publishes the Daily and
Sunday Express and the Daily Star.
He said Express Newspapers had made a good start to the year and had
benefited from higher advertising volumes and revenues, while costs had been
held at last year's levels.
The regional newspaper division, however, had yet to benefit from any
sustained increase in classified advertising.
Mr George Bull has been appointed a non-executive director of United
following the retirement of Sir Derek Palmer.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Inchape deal enhances its reputation -
Price of 129p per share compares with 250p paid by Ricoh in 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE'S deal with Gestetner, the office equipment distributor, will
enhance the international business service group's reputation for being
ready to wait until the price is right.
Inchcape is paying 129p per share for its initial 15.3 per cent stake in
Gestetner, compared with the 250p per share which Ricoh, the Japanese
photocopier manufacturer, paid in 1991 for a 24 per cent stake.
One of Inchcape's largest recent deals came at the end of 1991, when it
bought TKM, the motor dealer, for Pounds 382m, reputedly Pounds 100m less
than its asking price 18 months earlier.
Mr Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, said the first contacts with
Gestetner came in Hong Kong in August, 1990, but 'we were always way apart
on price'.
Although Mr Mackay believes the present purchase price is 'very acceptable',
he said the structure of the deal reflects a decision to proceed cautiously.
Unlike TKM, a private company which allowed Inchcape to 'crawl all over it'
before the acquisition, Mr Mackay said that in case of Gestetner they had to
rely solely on information supplied at arms-length by one shareholder, the
vendor, Chiltern Capital.
Mr Mackay said: 'We would be well advised to take one step at a time. It is
the right thing to do with this company at our present level of knowledge.
It shows no lack of confidence, it's just that our knowledge base is not
there.'
Mr Rod O'Donoghue, finance director, and Mr Andrew Cummins, the strategic
director, are joining the Gestetner board.
Although confident that Gestetner is not associated with the
pressure-selling abuses which has dogged parts of the photocopier market, Mr
O'Donoghue will be keen to ensure that the company takes a conservative line
on issues such as non-recourse financing and writing down the value of
leased assets.
Mr Basil Sellers, Gestetner's Australian chairman and chief executive, is a
large shareholder in Chiltern. He said the investment in Gestetner had 'just
been average' since he bought into the former family-controlled group in
1986.
The cash consideration of Pounds 39.7m represents a book loss of Pounds
300,000 compared with the current book value of Chiltern's investment in
Gestetner.
Mr Sellers said: 'I would obviously have preferred to sell out at 250p, as
we did to Ricoh, but the time had come to return to my roots. I came here
for two years and stayed for seven.'
The Australian management team is credited with doing a good job in moving
Gestetner away from stencil duplicators towards photocopiers, but it also
made an ill-judged expansion into the photographic equipment market. In
January the planned sale of the group's Vivitar and Hanimex camera
distribution businesses fell through, but there is no doubt that the company
will focus entirely on office supplies.
Inchcape will treat its 15 per cent stake as a trade investment, and would
only equity-account the stake if and when it is lifted to 25 per cent. But
Mr Mackay stresses that outcome is by no means predetermined. 'We will be
entirely pragmatic. We could say we don't like the look of this thing.'
Inchcape said that Gestetner operated mainly in office equipment, a large,
globally homogenous industry in which the distributor role was well
established and could potentially generate good returns as a result of
revenue from service and supplies.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Unigate postpones public offering of US
businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIGATE, the food and distribution group, has postponed the planned public
offering of its US restaurant businesses after the two chains involved
reported poor sales in March and April.
The company announced last month it was preparing an IPO to dispose of up to
100 per cent of the businesses, which trade as Black-eyed Pea and Taco
Bueno. The sale was expected to raise Dollars 220m to Dollars 250m (Pounds
145m to Pounds 164m), or Dollars 15-Dollars 17 a share.
However, trading was affected by bad weather in March and did not fully
recover last month. The March figures were also weak in comparison to a
strong month a year earlier, due to different promotional campaigns.
Goldman Sachs, the company's US adviser, had hoped to price the shares at
the top end of the range. However, when the latest trading results became
available, the likely offer price is understood to have fallen below the
target range and Unigate decided to pull the issue.
The issue would be delayed 'at least several months'. Unigate would still
favour selling the businesses via an IPO although a private sale would not
be ruled out.
Unigate's shares fell 12p to 353p. Analysts said the delay was disappointing
but not seriously damaging. Unigate had hoped to use the proceeds of the
sale to reduce borrowings. Following a number of acquisitions earlier this
year, the company is expected to have pro forma gearing of about 60 per cent
at its March year end, but interest cover remains strong.
Black-eyed Pea, which offers home-style cooking, has 115 outlets in 16
states while Taco Bueno has 111 Mexican fast food restaurants. In the last
financial year, the businesses made operating profits of Pounds 13.3m.
Shares in Grand Metropolitan, which owns the Burger King chain, fell 2p to
430p on worries about its US restaurants.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holmes &amp; Marchant, the marketing services group, returned to the black at
the pre-tax level in the six months to March 31.
Profits emerged at Pounds 299,000 (losses Pounds 715,000) on turnover some
Pounds 200,000 lower at Pounds 16.7m. Operating profits from continuing
businesses rose 27 per cent to Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 963,000) after
administrative expenses declined to Pounds 5.62m (Pounds 6.16m) following
rationalisation.
Lower interest rates meant a reduced charge of Pounds 451,000 (Pounds
511,000) and exceptional items, again relating to reorganisation and empty
property costs, fell to Pounds 471,000 (Pounds 1.05m).
Mr John Holmes, chairman, said that borrowings had shrunk by Pounds 500,000
to Pounds 8.5m since the year-end and that there was only 'minimal' deferred
consideration - a blight on the whole sector since the acquisitive 1980s -
still outstanding.
He said that although public relations and medical marketing were still
subdued, there were 'positive indications of increased activity' in design
and sales promotion.
Earnings were 1p (losses 2p).

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Huntingdon International Holdings, the life sciences and
engineering services group, fell to Pounds 984,000 in the six months to
end-March, compared with Pounds 6.95m last time.
Turnover, helped by a maiden half-year contribution from Travers Morgan,
acquired in December 1991, growth in UK operations and currency
fluctuations, rose to Pounds 84.5m (Pounds 69.9m). A maintained interim
dividend of 0.875p is uncovered by earnings of 0.009p (0.056p).
The group warned last month that profits would be depressed in the second
quarter, citing continuing weakness in the US economy, abnormal weather and
the need to rationalise its US-based engineering and environment services
group.
The rationalisation was behind a Pounds 3m exceptional provision which
contributed to a Pounds 2.74m pre-tax loss in the second quarter on turnover
of Pounds 40.9m. For the comparable period last year the group returned
profits of Pounds 3.73m on turnover of Pounds 38.9m.
Operating performance at the US engineering and environmental services group
improved in March, directors said.
In the UK, turnover at the Life Sciences group rose 7 per cent with new
orders so far ahead 16 per cent on last year.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: First quarter recovery at GA - Estimate of
net loss from the Bishopsgate bomb increased to Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL ACCIDENT yesterday provided further evidence of the turnround in the
general insurance market with better-than-expected first quarter figures.
The Perth-based composite insurer reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 41.9m
in the first three months of 1993, compared with a Pounds 29m loss in the
same period of 1992. The shares rose 18p to 591p.
A fall in worldwide underwriting losses of Pounds 54.5m to Pounds 80.5m, was
underpinned by a strong performance in the UK where GA was boosted by the
impact of higher premiums, milder weather and cuts in operating costs.
UK underwriting losses fell to Pounds 4m (Pounds 65m), in spite of a pay -
out of Pounds 3m after flooding in Scotland in January.
GA has revised its estimate of net losses from the Bishopsgate bomb in April
to Pounds 10m compared to earlier estimates of Pounds 7m. The loss will
affect second quarter figures.
Overall premium income rose to Pounds 1.02bn (Pounds 914.7m) for general
business and to Pounds 207m (Pounds 165.1m) for life business. In the UK the
book of household business was expanded with premium income rising to Pounds
71m (Pounds 47.3m), following the acquisition of a block of business from
the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society last October.
Investment income - after loan interest - increased to Pounds 115.6m (Pounds
102.7m). Losses from estate agency operations fell to Pounds 3.7m (Pounds
4.5m). Life profits amounted to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 7.8m).
The company did not intend to follow the example of Commercial Union and
Royal Insurance by raising fresh capital through a rights issue in order to
take advantage of rising rates, said Mr Nelson Robertson, chief general
manager.
Mr Robertson said his company's capital base was adequate, its solvency
margin - the yardstick which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life
premium income - amounting to 46.1 per cent, compared to 41.5 per cent at
the end of 1992.
GA raised Pounds 250m in cumulative preference shares last year.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: New I&amp;S trust seeks Pounds 172m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW investment trust, Ivory &amp; Sime ISIS Trust, is hoping to raise up to
Pounds 172m via the issue of ordinary shares and convertible annuity shares.
The trust will invest in a portfolio of UK equities. However, the income
from these equities is being sold to institutional investors in the form of
convertible annuity shares.
These will have a negligible repayment value but a high dividend yield.
The convertible shares will be issued in a ratio of 1 to every 10 ordinary
shares. Institutions have agreed to underwrite the sale of 10m convertible
annuity shares at 147p per share, with a maximum of 15m available.
The ordinary shares will receive no income but will be entitled to all the
assets of the trust. Proceeds from the sale of the convertible annuity
shares will result in an uplift in the net asset value of the ordinary
shares.
Ivory &amp; Sime estimates the initial net asset value per share at 110p,
compared with an offer price of 100p.
Private investors will be offered a low-cost way of selling their ordinary
shares in order to use their annual capital gains tax allowance. The aim
will be to get a 7 per cent tax-free income.
To reduce the risk of the ordinary shares falling to a discount, ISIS will
also have a low-cost savings scheme, with holders being offered free
warrants every year. The hope is that the demand from the savings scheme
will mop up the shares sold by investors who take income.
The offer is open until June 4.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pilkington suspends executives at US arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESIDENT and two top executives of Libbey-Owens-Ford, the US subsidiary
of Pilkington, have been suspended during an internal investigation of
'discrepancies', the glass group said yesterday.
The three are Mr Ron Skeddle, president and chief executive officer, Mr Ed
Bryant, executive vice-president operations, and Mr Darryl Costin, executive
vice president technology.
They were suspended on Monday after it was discovered that the three
'appeared to fail to follow corporate procedures', Pilkington said.
Mr Trevor Jones, chairman of LOF's board, is taking charge of the business
until the investigation is com-plete.
Pilkington denied market rumours that the FBI had been called in, saying
that no 'outside agency' was involved in the investigation.
The shares fell 5p to 128p with the market closing before Pilkington
responded to the speculation.
Pilkington stressed that the problem did not involve 'a major financial
loss' and said LOF's customers and operations were not affected.
Pilkington bought LOF in April 1986 and in 1989 sold a 20 per cent stake to
Nippon Sheet Glass.
In the 1991-92 year, LOF contributed Pounds 511.5m to group turnover of
Pounds 2.6bn, and operating profits of Pounds 10.8m out of Pounds 182.5m.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook and Itel reject agreed bid for TIP
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO shareholders controlling 9 per cent of TIP Europe, the trailer rental
company, have said they will not accept the recommended offer for the
company from GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric of
the US.
The two are Tiphook, which holds 5.5 per cent and is TIP's main competitor,
and Itel Corporation, a US distribution concern.
The companies said GE's offer was 'wholly inadequate' and did not reflect
TIP's long term earnings potential.
The first closing date for the 42p a share cash offer is today, although no
details are expected until tomorrow.
Tiphook's move seemed designed to frustrate GE's plans to build a trailer
rental business in Europe, or wrest a higher price for control of TIP.
The announcement was described as a 'commercial spoiling tactic' by Mr
Richard Gillingwater, managing director corporate finance at BZW, adviser to
TIP.
Itel said it was reacting to an 'undercurrent of sentiment' from other
shareholders that the sale was poorly timed at the offer price. Itel felt
TIP's earnings would recover in step with the European economies.
The rejection of the offer is likely to give pause to institutions sizing up
GE's bid. Institutions are having to weigh the options of taking cash now or
waiting for a recovery in TIP's main markets. The offer price was at a steep
premium to TIP's share price before the bid of 25 1/2 p, but well below the
share's trading level in 1990, when they collapsed from 175p as recession
hit.
TIP also has a large number of individual shareholders; their view of GE's
offer is difficult to assess.
Tiphook is unlikely to make a counter offer for TIP because of monopoly
considerations. According to analysts, other bidders are unlikely because of
the high gearing involved in truck rental and because of the depressed
market.
TIP shares closed unchanged yesterday at 41 1/2p.

FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BM banking facilities extended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BM Group, the construction equipment concern, has successfully negotiated
continued financing facilities with its 10 banks for an initial period to
June 6.
Talks on securing longer term funding are proceeding but it is thought
unlikely there will be an agreement by the end of the period, requiring an
extension of the arrangements.
The company is working on a survival plan expected to cost about Pounds 42m
in redundancies, closures, disposals and write-offs.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Billiton gives promise of new life on international stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENCOR has for years been searching for assets that would provide it with
the core of a substantial business outside South Africa.
'We have kissed a lot of frogs but not one has turned into a princess,' is
the way Mr Derek Keys, the former chairman, summed up this apparently
hopeless quest.
But now the search is over. Gencor believes Billiton, a mining and metals
company with a 114-year history but which has been buried within the Royal
Dutch Shell oil group since 1970, has all the necessary qualifications.
Ironically, although virtually every other oil company has baled out of
mainly disastrous forays into mining and metals, Shell seemed determined to
persevere with Billiton even though low metal prices and various write-downs
and provisions pushed it into a Dollars 75m (Pounds 48m) net loss last year
against a Dollars 12m profit in 1991.
However, Gencor's unsolicited offer, which analysts suggest was probably
more than the Dollars 1.8bn book value of the Billiton assets, was too
attractive for Shell not to give it serious consideration.
If everything went smoothly, Gencor eventually would have interests in two
mining and metals businesses. The one in South Africa would retain most of
the group's assets there - including those producing gold, platinum, coal,
manganese, chrome, ferro-alloys, stainless steel, aluminium, and granite.
Billiton would be used to create a second, publicly-quoted international
group mining gold, nickel and zinc in six countries, with exploration
activities all over the world, a global metals marketing and trading
network, and joint ventures in alumina refining in Brazil, Australia and
Surinam and aluminium smelting operations in Brazil.
To this Gencor would add its existing operations outside South Africa - 25
per cent of Consolidated Rutile in Australia and nearly 100 per cent of Sao
Bento in Brazil and, probably, its half-share of Richards Bay Minerals in
South Africa.
This would be a medium-sized mining and metals group in world terms and
without a comparable rival, although it would have some similarity to
Minorco, owned by the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Break-up signals overhaul of corporate South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENCOR's announcement that it plans to unbundle came as no surprise, but
this does not diminish the significance of an event whose political and
business ramifications are likely to be widespread.
It almost certainly heralds the beginning of a gradual, but far-reaching,
overhaul of corporate South Africa. Over the next 10 years and beyond,
groups such as Anglo American-De Beers, South African Breweries, Rembrandt,
Anglovaal, Old Mutual and Sanlam, which dominate South African corporate
life, are likely to be significantly restructured.
Two factors will determine the pace and extent of this restructuring: the
vigour with which a future government might pursue anti-trust policies, and
the extent to which corporate South Africa voluntarily restructures, for
reasons either of self-preservation or economic self-interest.
The African National Congress, likely to be the largest partner in any
future government, is committed to introduce anti-monopoly, anti-trust and
mergers policies weaken the influence of the country's largest groups, and
promote private sector efficiency.
There is also considerable support for unbundling in the investment
community where many hold the view that the economy has become too
concentrated, stifling initiative in the process.
With the exception of Gencor, however, corporate South Africa has shown
little enthusiasm for unbundling. Most captains of industry are not
convinced unbundling has economic merit. Anglo American, in particular, has
defended its size with vigour, sophistication and some success. Ultimately,
however, these arguments, couched mostly in economic terms, are unlikely to
sway the ANC, which objects to the degree of corporate influence exercised
by a few whites.
Yesterday's announcement is only the first salvo in a long debate. And
practical barriers to unbundling have to be addressed - most obviously, who,
other than the existing large groups, will buy the assets of companies that
unbundle.
Gencor's announcement will certainly force some of the other large groups to
take a harder look at unbundling, if only because the onus of proof has
shifted towards those favouring the status quo.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Gencor moves to unbundle all non-mining units: Group seeks
greater focus - Talks start on Royal Dutch Shell metal interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENCOR, South Africa's second largest mining house, yesterday announced that
it plans to unbundle its non-mining interests in a deal that will probably
halve the group's market capitalisation to about R8bn (Pounds 1.6bn) from
R16bn.
Gencor also disclosed that it is involved in talks with Royal Dutch Shell
for the acquisition of its main metal mining businesses. Discussions are at
an early stage, but if successful would see the creation of a world-scale
mining enterprise.
The effect of the Gencor unbundling, expected to be completed by August 31,
is that Gencor will relinquish control of its three industrial arms  - paper
and pulp company Sappi, consumer group Malbak and energy company Engen - as
well as investment arm Genbel. Gencor will emerge as purely a mining, metals
and mineral processing company, with interests in gold, platinum, coal,
ferro-alloys, stainless steel and aluminium.
Although Gencor said the move was motivated by the desire to unlock
shareholder wealth - it trades at a discount of about 19 per cent, or
R3.8bn, to net asset value - and improve focus for operations and investors,
Mr Brian Gilbertson, executive chairman, conceded there had been a political
angle to the deal. Unbundling is a policy much favoured by the African
National Congress.
The announcement was favourably received in the investment community. It
will also bring some of South Africa's unwieldly conglomerates into line
with trends towards more focused operations.
Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, and chairman of Gencor when the unbundling
issue was raised nearly three years ago, also endorsed the deal. 'I welcome
the announcement of the plan to unbundle in the belief that it will result
in five entrepreneurs,' he said.
The restructure will involve Gencor passing its shares in Sappi, Malhold,
Genbel and Engen to its own shareholders. Gencor Beherend, the controlling
pyramid, which has only a 54 per cent stake in Gencor, will pass its shares
in the underlying companies to shareholders (50 per cent Sanlam and 25 per
cent Rembrandt, the tobacco group) and be liquidated.
Mr Marinus Daling, chief executive of Sankorp, which controls Sanlam's
strategic investments, and the key driving force behind the unbundling, said
that Sankorp supported the unbundling 'because focus is extremely important
to us as investors'.
Gencor plans to supplement existing cash holdings of about R1.5bn by raising
a further R1.5bn by disposing of group shares and portfolio investments.
Thus, by the time of unbundling, Genmin will be about R1.5bn larger.

FT  12 MAY 93 / ICI cuts size of Zeneca rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY, PAUL ABRAHAMS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries has cut the size of the rights issue for
Zeneca, the bioscience business being demerged from the chemicals group.
However, the price is expected to be towards the top end of forecasts at
about 590p to 600p.
A meeting of the board and underwriters to confirm the terms will be held
today. They will be announced at 7.30am.
It is expected that the issue will have been priced to raise slightly less
than the Pounds 1.3bn originally planned, as the stock market has become
concerned at the level of cash calls on it. The government's BT 3 sale,
likely to raise over Pounds 5bn, is due in July.
Rather than the expected 1-for-3 issue, the terms will probably be set at
3-for-10. That could cut the amount raised to around Pounds 1.25bn after
expenses.
The main difficulty in pricing the issue has been that the demerged shares
of new ICI and Zeneca have yet to start trading, giving no base to value the
rights shares.
There were still doubts that the issue would be warmly received. 'At 600p
this looks like a second division player being sold at a first division
rating,' a pharmaceuticals analyst said.
Institutions said they would be unwilling to sub-underwrite the issue at
more than 610p. They wanted the price set to give a yield above the market
average to offset Zeneca's perceived low growth prospects. The company has
already said it will pay a 27.5p net dividend this year.
Grey market trading in the demerged and the rights shares will start at
2.30pm today, when the sub-underwriting should have been completed. It also
coincides with the start of business in New York.
Official dealings in the new shares are due to start on June 1, so long as
ICI shareholders approve the demerger at a special meeting on May 28.
A plan to 'recycle' rights shares, through an international syndicate of
brokers, is expected to meet only modest demand.
US investors, one of the main target audiences for Zeneca's roadshows, are
thought to be more interested in the new-ICI business. At present, US
investors favour cyclical rather than drugs stocks. The latter have been hit
by uncertainty over US health care reforms.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Inchcape buys 15% of Gestetner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the international services and marketing group, is to buy a 15 per
cent share of Gestetner Holdings, the office and photographic equipment
distributor, plus an option to raise its stake to 25 per cent.
Inchcape is buying the initial stake for Pounds 37.9m from Chiltern Capital,
an Australian company which took control of Gestetner in 1986. Chiltern has
already sold 29.9 per cent of Gestetner to Ricoh, the Japanese office
equipment manufacturer.
Gestetner is the world's largest independent distributor of office
equipment, using the brand names of Gestetner, Nashuatec and Rex Rotary.
Much of it is produced by major Japanese manufacturers, principally Ricoh
and Mita. It also derives substantial revenue from service and supplies.
Mr Basil Sellers, Gestetner's chairman and chief executive and a major
shareholder in Chiltern, will give up executive responsibilities
immediately, although he will continue as chairman until an independent
successor is appointed. Inchcape will have two directors on the board and
Ricoh will have three.
Chiltern will sell its remaining 15 per cent stake in the group to Inchcape
for 129p a share. Inchcape is also paying Pounds 2.9m for an option on
convertible unsecured loan stock, enabling it to raise its stake in
Gestetner to 25 per cent on or before July next year. If Inchape exercises
the option, it will have paid about Pounds 80m for its 25 per cent stake.
Last year Gestetner made pre-tax profits of Pounds 27.2m on sales of Pounds
900m. However, the company warned yesterday that conditions in Europe, where
it earned 55 per cent of its revenues, continued to deteriorate. It would
therefore charge Pounds 45m against first-half results to cover redundancies
and asset writedowns. It said trading conditions in the rest of the world
were pleasing.
Mr Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, said: 'For a relatively
modest investment at a very acceptable price, we have obtained an important
strategic stake in a core business which has considerable growth potential.'
Inchcape funded the purchase by a Pounds 40.4m vendor placing of shares at
570p each. Inchcape's shares yesterday closed 8p lower at 583p, while
Gestetner's rose 7p to 130p.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Reed Elsevier may buy airline guides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED ELSEVIER, the inter- national publishing and information group, has
signed a letter of intent to purchase Official Airline Guides in a deal
worth Dollars 425m (Pounds 275m).
The move came on the same day as the company, owned jointly by Reed
International and Elsevier, reached an agreement to acquire at least a
controlling interest in Editions Techniques, the French legal publishers. No
price was disclosed but it is believed the agreement would value Editions
Techniques at around Pounds 75m.
These are the first two planned acquisitions to be announced since Reed
International and Elsevier merged at the beginning of this year. One of the
reasons behind the merger was to increase the combined group's ability to
take on international acquisitions.
However, the OAG letter of intent, signed with Price Waterhouse, the joint
administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation, is non-exclusive and is
being seen as a way to find out whether Reed Elsevier, which already owns
ABC airlines guides, would be qualified to bid under anti-trust legislation.
'There's a long way to go yet. This is just getting into the paddock,' one
of those close to the negotiations said yesterday.
Mr Alan Jamieson of Price Waterhouse said yesterday: 'If a better bid comes
forward we are free to accept that bid. If we have no better bid we are
happy to move to contract at that price.'
The assets on offer, which include travel magazines as well as an airline
information service, are similar to those bought by Mr Robert Maxwell from
Dun &amp; Bradstreet for Dollars 750m in 1988. The deal, which is subject to
further due diligence, does not include Standard Rate &amp; Data Service.
Reed Elsevier will argue that putting together OAG and ABC will allow the
business to compete better with the electronic systems now being operated by
many airlines.
Any deal will be subject to approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Act.
Mr Guy Lamming, media analyst at stockbrokers James Capel said last night
that both deals looked good for Reed Elsevier. 'OAG looks cheap with
operating profits of Dollars 44.547m in 1992,' said Mr Lamming who added a
higher rival bid was still possible.
If the OAG deal goes ahead the acquisition will be by Reed Travel group, a
subsidiary of Reed Elsevier.
Editions Techniques is the largest general legal publisher in France with a
workforce of 500 people and sales last year of around Pounds 48m. Its best
known publication is the series Juris Classeurs which covers most aspects of
law and includes 80 titles in 400 volumes. The family-owned company also
owns the medical publication Encyclopedie Medico Chirurgicale.
The size of Reed Elsevier's ultimate stake in the company will depend on
further negotiations with members of the family.

FT  12 MAY 93 / US relations with EC turn sour over policy debate on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS between the US and the European Community took a sharp turn for
the worse yesterday after mutual recriminations about the attempts to
co-ordinate western policy on Bosnia.
The EC presidency categorically denied Washington's claim that its European
allies were pressing it to wait for a Bosnian Serb referendum this weekend
before taking a decision on possible joint military action against the
Bosnian Serbs.
Mr Niels Halveg Petersen, foreign minister of Denmark which currently holds
the EC presidency, said the US statement on the subject had 'no foundation
whatsoever'.
'The question of tying anything in the EC position to the referendum is
totally absurd,' Mr Petersen angrily told a news conference in Brussels.
He was referring to a statement by a White House official, Ms Dee Dee Myers,
on Monday that to preserve a common front with the EC, Washington was
putting off any decision on further action until after the Bosnian Serb
referendum. This has been called to allow the Bosnian Serb people to make a
final decision on an international peace plan, rejected by their self-styled
parliament a week ago. Meanwhile Bosnian Serb leaders rejected a call by
Yugoslav, Serbian and Montenegrin leaders to attend a joint parliamentary
session in Belgrade on Friday to decide whether to accept the peace plan,
the Tanjug news agency said.
The Yugoslav, Serbian and Montenegrin leaders wanted the parliamentary
session to replace the referendum, the Yugoslav news agency said, but the
leadership of Mr Radovan Karadzic's Serbian Democratic party agreed late
yesterday that such a meeting could be held only after the referendum.
Before news came of the rejection by the Bosnian Serbs, President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia who, since the summit of the warring parties in Athens
at the beginning of this month, has been actively pressing the Bosnian Serbs
to accept the peace plan, said it concerned Yugoslavia, Serbia, Montenegro
and the Serb-populated region of Krajina in Croatia, as much as the Bosnian
Serbs.
This meant that a decision on the plan, drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen, the United Nations and EC mediators, should not be taken by the
Bosnian Serbs in isolation.
Mr Petersen said EC foreign ministers, at their meeting in Brussels on
Monday, had expressed the same view as the US on the referendum, namely that
the move to call it was no more than 'a cynical ploy', aimed at buying more
time for the Bosnian Serbs.
Mr Petersen said the question of the referendum had not even come up when he
discussed the Bosnian situation by telephone with Mr Warren Christopher, the
US secretary of state, on Monday, nor in discussions with Mr Andrei Kozyrev,
the Russian foreign minister, on Tuesday.
President Bill Clinton yesterday defended his original proposal to lift the
embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnian Moslems, an idea that several European
governments have strongly opposed for fear that it would prolong the Bosnian
conflict.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Fiat issues code of business ethics for workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's biggest private company, yesterday sought to distance itself
from the growing political corruption scandal by issuing a new 'code of
business ethics'.
The move is expected to be followed by other big Italian companies,
including the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, which has also
been implicated in allegations of corruption and kickbacks on public-sector
contracts.
The code, drawn up by a team of lawyers headed by Mr Franzo Grande Stevens,
a close adviser of Fiat's controlling Agnelli family, sets out behaviour for
employees towards government officials, political parties and civil
servants. It supplements an existing 'internal' code regarding issues such
as conflicts of interest and insider trading.
The document, approved at a special board meeting yesterday, specifically
forbids any form of bribery or kickbacks involving the public sector.
The ban also applies to any financial inducements to public servants or
politicians in covert form, such as sponsorship, advertising or cosmetic
'consultancy' agreements.
'No group employee must promise or pay money or benefits in kind of whatever
nature or value to any public sector official to promote or favour the
interests of one or more group companies, even as a result of illegal
pressure,' it says.
Though not made explicit, the penality for non-observance would be
termination of a worker's contract. The same requirements will have to be
met by sub-contractors or freelances working on behalf of Fiat or its
subsidiaries, which will have to make a commitment to respect the strict
conditions.
All employees whose jobs are likely to expose them to the areas covered by
code will have to sign a copy of the document. The company said
implementation throughout the group would be slow, as the code would only
come into operation in each of the roughly 1,000 separate companies after
being approved by their respective boards.
The code does not extend to dealings with other private sector companies or
the behaviour of Fiat executives abroad, although the company said it was
expected that the code would in time be extended outside Italy.
Fiat employees most likely to be asked to sign are those dealing with sales
and marketing, relations with the public sector and lobbying, and
purchasing.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Pay-for-distance motorway toll ruled out for five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GOTHENBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday firmly ruled out the
introduction of pay-as-you-go tolls on Britain's motorway system for at
least five years.
However, he left open the possibility that money could be raised from road
users earlier than that by requiring them to buy and display an annual
permit if they wanted to use the motorways.
Mr MacGregor is shortly expected to publish a green paper setting out the
options for raising more money from motorists to help finance the
government's Pounds 19bn roadbuilding programme.
Yesterday he visited the world's most advanced experiment in road pricing
technology at a test site in Gothenburg, Sweden, to see how charges could be
collected electronically from motorists using roadside beacons that debit
devices inside their vehicles.
But Mr Jonas Sundberg, senior researcher for Sweden's Transport Research
Institute, told Mr MacGregor that even when the technology had been fully
developed, it could not be introduced nationally in Britain until at least
1998 because of the time it would take to fit the devices to the country's
25m vehicles.
Mr MacGregor has already ruled out the idea of collecting charges through
Continental-style toll-booths because they would slow traffic and take up
too much land. That leaves annual permits as the only short-term measure
available.
Mr MacGregor conceded that electronic road tolls could not be introduced in
Britain for at least five years. 'I have certainly been told by all the
experts I have spoken to so far that the first feasible moment is 1998,' he
said.
But he added that electronic road tolling was not an issue that could be
rushed. 'You have to have a political debate, you have to decide whether you
take up this option, you have to get legislation for it and you have to
prepare for it.'
Mr MacGregor said the permit system was a possible alternative. 'There is a
discussion about that in the green paper, but there is a lot of difficulty
about it because it doesn't have the flexibility of the electronic system.
It would be feasible and technologically possible, but you would have to
iron out a lot of practical problems.'
One of the chief objections to a permit system is likely to be the
difficulty of reconciling it with privately built toll roads, which the
government is keen to encourage.
Drivers would be reluctant to pay tolls on privately built roads if they had
already paid for a permit to use the state-owned motorway system.
One solution likely to be explored in the green paper, due out within four
to six weeks, is the idea of so-called shadow tolls. Under this system the
government would reward private sector operators for building motorways by
paying them a fee according to the number of vehicles that used them.

The administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation's US businesses
recently reported they were receiving bids for the diverse assets on a
'Chinese menu approach'. Reed Elsevier, though, is sticking to plain boiled
rice by offering Dollars 425m for Official Airline Guides alone. If Reed can
consummate the deal at that price, it would represent something of a coup.
The assets are essentially the same as those which Reed failed to secure in
1988 when Mr Robert Maxwell weighed in with a higher Dollars 750m bid.
Although OAG has suffered badly in the torrid US airline market, it still
made operating profits of Dollars 44m on revenue of Dollars 154m last year.
With firm management and a recovering market, Reed should be able to push
margins higher. The business would also complement Reed's existing interests
in airline publishing. The deal, however, is far from done. Reed will now
conduct its due diligence while the anti-trust investigators scrutinise the
deal. The letter of intent is non-binding and non-exclusive. The
administrators may hope they can flush out a higher offer now firm numbers
are on the table. They may still believe they can realise greater value by
selling the assets as a package.
Reed can afford to walk away again if the bidding goes too high. Its
simultaneous announcement that it had agreed to buy into France's biggest
legal publisher suggests plenty of other routes for expansion.

<TEXT>
General Accident continues to defy those expecting it to launch a rights
issue. First-quarter results showing a solvency margin of over 46 per cent,
despite an 11 per cent increase in premium income on general business, leave
plenty of room for further expansion. There are some technical factors
behind the Pounds 71m swing in profits. Two successive preference share
issues have allowed the company to pay down debt, helping reduce the
interest charge by Pounds 8m. Last year's generous transfers to technical
reserves have the indirect effect of boosting investment income. Marginally
smaller transfers this year accentuated the improvement in the underwriting
result.
Still, the extent of the underwriting turnround came as a surprise,
particularly in the UK which is almost breaking even. Since the first
quarter is traditionally weak, one can now pencil in pre-tax profits in
excess of Pounds 200m for the year as a whole. Coupled with the absence of a
rights issue, this was enough to drive the shares 3 per cent higher. In its
excitement, though, the market appears to have overlooked the limited room
for dividend growth.
Retained earnings in GA's balance sheet have fallen to just Pounds 44m at
the end of last year from a peak of Pounds 660m in 1989. Despite this year's
more optimistic outlook, the company will scarcely manage more than a token
increase in the dividend without dipping in to reserves again. General
Accident has not launched a rights issue like Royal and Commercial Union,
but nor has it cut its dividend like GRE. Its reluctance to break what has
become a habit of overpayment will limit its ability to rebuild its reserves
in the recovery. Not a happy thought for a company which is trading at a
hefty premium to book.

<TEXT>
At first glance, Inchcape's acquisition of a stake in Gestetner looks a
cheap and canny deal. Inchcape is limiting the risks of buying into a
struggling photocopier distributor by staggering its investment. The
immediate acquisition of 15 per cent of Gestetner's shares at a minimal
premium buys it two seats on the board and access to management accounts.
The purchase of the option to buy its entire convertible unsecured loan
stock before 1994 gives it greater exposure if it likes what it sees.
Inchcape is attracted to the recovery value which seemingly lies in a
business making small profits on Pounds 900m of sales. But the vendor is
clearly selling cheap for a reason. The softness of Gestetner's markets in
mainland Europe suggests it will be a long, hard slog to return to
respectable margins. Inchcape regards the investment as somewhat
speculative; shareholders should perhaps do likewise. Some, though, may have
misgivings about the change in strategic thrust should the Gestetner
involvement develop significantly. Inchcape's primary attraction for many
investors is its exposure to the blossoming southern Chinese economy. For
them, at least, Gestetner may prove an unwelcome distraction.

Gencor's long-awaited decision to demerge its non-mining interests looks
like a sensible response to changing political circumstances in South
Africa. The African National Congress has voiced strong opposition to the
complex webs of cross shareholdings between South African companies. Gencor
has decided to jump before it was pushed. The former chairman, Mr Derek
Keys, did much to transform Gencor's insular culture. As finance minister,
he has had responsibility for the legislation which will make such
unbundling easier.
The financial rationale for the move, however, looks more specious. While
the managements of the individual businesses may have greater flexibility,
Sankorp and Rembrandt will still have near-controlling stakes in each of the
companies - most notably in Gencor's mining operations. Since the move has
been well flagged, Gencor's discount to net assets is also unlikely to
improve much. Foreign investors are still more likely to be deterred by the
political risks of investing in South Africa however transparent the
structure of corporate ownership.
This demerger will also increase pressure on other combines. Life assurance
companies which control a large segment of domestic savings may be forced to
unwind their complex cross shareholdings in industrial companies. The
greatest discomfort, however, will be felt in the Anglo American
Corporation, which effectively controls almost a quarter of the quoted South
African market. The Oppenheimer family's resistance to unbundling will
doubtless continue, and the creation of De Beers Centenary in Switzerland
creates a trap-door escape from South Africa. But skill will be needed if
the Anglo pyramid is not to become a monument to a weakened dynasty.

Want to get to the top in the BBC? Take a compass bearing on Bob Phillis,
the new deputy director-general. After little more than a month in the job,
Phillis has set off for the Himalayas.
It might seem a bit early to take a holiday, even by civil service
standards. But that misses the point. He is following in the footsteps of
his new master - John Birt - who travelled to Nepal to think great thoughts
about the future of the Beeb before he became its DG.
Phillis's official reason for his early pilgrimage is that he wants to visit
son Ben who is teaching English there before going to university in the
autumn. But cynical BBC types are wondering whether there is more to his
mission than meets the eye.
Could it be that the necessary induction process into the highest peaks of

The hunt for Larry Summers' replacement as the World Bank's economic guru
seems to be taking an inordinately long time.
Since there are not many Brits in top positions at the bank, and the job
will probably go to a non-American, how about Richard Layard, 59, professor
of economics at the London School of Economics? He's best remembered in
Whitehall for pointing out flaws in the Thatcher government's presentation
of unemployment figures. But as an adviser to the Yeltsin government he has
first hand experience of the problems of former communist economies - a
central part of the bank's portfolio in the 1990s.
As founder of the Centre for Economic Performance he has the necessary
administrative skills, and his expertise in micro-issues, such as the
economics of human resource development, is now seen as key to effective
third world development.
If he is too old, or regarded as lacking the intellectual gravitas, then
there are plenty of other candidates in Britain and elsewhere. It is right
that Lewis Preston, the World Bank president and former J P Morgan banker,
wants somebody with whom he feels personally comfortable. But with pressing
challenges in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere, he shouldn't
dilly-dally much longer.
Even economists need leaders.

<TEXT>
For a man who spends most of his time in prisons, ex-Watergate villain Chuck
Colson seemed unusually worried about the health of the British pound
yesterday.
Colson, a 61-year-old ex-US Marine Corps captain, has just won the world's
biggest religious award - the Templeton prize for progress in religion. For
some strange reason Sir John Templeton, one of the world's most astute fund
managers, made the mistake of donating his Pounds 650,000 prize in sterling,
and Colson, despite being a born again Christian, is acutely aware that the
pound has been going through a bit of a rough patch.
Not that he gets to keep the money for himself - it is all going to his
Prison Fellowship - but he wants value for money.
Although Colson's role in the downfall of President Nixon is history he
still resembles the powerful Washington power-broker he once was - a person
who can be relied on to get things done. Only nowadays, he channels all his
energies into his worldwide network of prison ministries. With over 280
staff and 50,000 volunteers his empire operates in 55 countries.
If you want to talk prisons, Colson's your man and his considerable
achievement has been deservedly recognised by an award which has already
gone to people such as Mother Teresa, Dr Billy Graham and Lord Jakobovits.
Colson's conclusion that there is no better way to destroy a person than
give them nothing to do is a grim verdict on the lack of proper work for the
inmates of prisons in Britain and elsewhere.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Observer: Lesson from Vienna
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One calculation seems to have been overlooked during Monday's sometimes
acrimonious debate about the imposition of VAT on British fuel bills. How
much extra will it cost if higher fuel bills force more freezing pensioners
into state-subsidised nursing homes earlier than planned?
Presumably, a statistically minded chap like Peter Lilley, secretary of
state for social security, has asked someone to add it up. If he hasn't then
he ought to have a word with his opposite number in Vienna.
It seems that the socialist city fathers of Austria's capital have concluded
that the most economical policy of all is to provide free heating for old
age pensioners.
Admittedly, Austria is a colder place than Britain and probably has a better
social safety net. Even so the argument still sounds applicable to the UK.
Given that fear of winter cold was driving an increasing number of OAPs into
local nursing homes, the Viennese authorities concluded that it would be
worth providing old people on low incomes with free district heating and
home insulation.
If, by so doing, they could keep these old Viennese in their flats for just
two additional years rather than seeking permanent shelter in nursing homes,
the programme would pay for itself. In practice, the Viennese are staying an
additional five years in their flats compared with the period before the
free heating began.
UK nursing home care is more limited and less plush than in Vienna, but it
would be surprising if the addition of VAT to heating bills - if not fully
reimbursed for OAPs - did not lead to a corresponding rise in nursing home
care and end up perhaps costing the exchequer more than the tax it will
yield.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Unbundling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNBUNDLING of South Africa's economy has begun. Gencor's decision
yesterday to hand over to its shareholders the stakes it owns in a
wide-ranging collection of industrial subsidiaries is the first step in a
process that will reshape South African business.
It has not come a moment too soon. The tensions that have bedevilled South
Africa's economy - between corporatism and free enterprise, between
English-speakers and Afrikaners, between the boundless wealth of the mining
houses and the slim pickings of manufacturing - have left the country with a
top-heavy corporate structure. Six groupings control 80 per cent of the
total capitalisation of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Now, prodded by politicians from the National party as well as by the
African National Congress, big business is starting to think of becoming a
bit less bloated. Tax concessions for unbundling from Mr Derek Keys - the
finance minister but before that boss of Gencor - have eased the way.
Yet so far only Gencor has indicated a serious interest in the subject. The
other big groups are doubtless studying the proposition, but so far without,
apparently, making the emotional leap into the unknown.
That is a pity. South Africa needs to set its companies free from the
strangling embrace of the big groups. Setting operating companies free to
sink or swim will itself improve the quality of South African management.
The argument against such a process is that it will open the way for
corporate raiders, asset-stripping and all the other accoutrements of
Anglo-Saxon capitalism.
They are certainly a mixed blessing. But if ever a country cried out for
them, it is South Africa. Vulnerability to takeover concentrates managers'
minds, and gives fresh energy to their actions. South Africans of all races,
all incomes and all political persuasions would benefit from the application
of a little unfettered capitalism. Gencor has led the way.

THE CONVENTIONAL argument for making central banks independent is that
politicians cannot be relied on to conduct a responsible monetary policy
because of electoral pressures. How ironic, then, that France should now be
introducing legislation to reduce political control over the Banque de
France after an election in which the main parties of both right and left
were committed to policies of exceptional monetary stringency. The outcome
will reinforce suspicions of reverse causality in the statistical evidence
that countries with independent central banks have lower rates of inflation.
Those countries where there is a genuine consensus for low inflation, as in
France over the past 10 years, will naturally be more prone to remove
control of monetary policy from politicians.
Not that this invalidates the case for independent central banking. Since it
is now widely accepted that there is no medium or long-term trade-off
between higher inflation and higher output, the monetary authorities can
only aspire to achieve the limited goal of price stability. Certainly the
British experience indicates that shorter-term gains in output and
employment from unanticipated inflation simply result over a period of years
in more inflation for the same level of output.
How far a restructured and more autonomous Banque de France will add to an
already credible French monetary policy is nonetheless a moot point. The
government proposes to retain control over decisions on the exchange rate.
As long as the Bundesbank remains the anchor of the European exchange rate
mechanism and the French government remains committed to present parities,
this implies that central bank decisions about interest rates are of limited
import. By the same token, if the resolve to maintain the franc fort policy
should weaken, the reconstituted central bank would have little say in the
decision. Should the franc replace the D-Mark as the anchor of the system
before any move to monetary union, the institutional arrangements would
inevitably take on increased significance.
The French government proposes that the jobs of the governor, two deputy
governors and a group of six experts remain, in effect, within the
government's gift, but with a measure of independence coming from lengthy
tenure - six years for the top trio and nine for the experts. This is a less
powerful formula than the one with which a federal system has endowed the
Bundesbank. It has more in common with the US Federal Reserve, where
appointments are made by the administration. The question is whether the
clubbiness of the elite that dominates French economic policy-making will
result in rather less independence than the outward forms might indicate.
Equally important is the question of accountability. The bank's chief
objective of price stability, which mirrors the Maastricht treaty's European
central banking model, is undefined, while procedures for monitoring
performance are opaque. But the fact that a retreat from disinflationary
policy will require a legislative process is an important discipline.
Yet the benefits of central bank independence are probably greatest for
countries such as Britain, where past failure has undermined the credibility
of monetary policy. In the UK, more than in France, institutional reform is
needed. Merely changing the face at the top of the British Treasury would
not be enough.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Much ado about lending: Financial considerations alone no
longer dictate aid strategy for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund does not, for once, hold all the bargaining
chips. Negotiators are in Moscow this week to thrash out a tough credit plan
with the Russian government, without which no western aid can flow. But they
know that the west is determined to start releasing funds soon, no matter
what kind of agreement is reached or whether it can be implemented.
Financial considerations alone no longer dictate the west's aid strategy to
the former Soviet Union, much to the IMF's dismay. Officials from the Group
of Seven industrialised countries say they are determined not to see a
repeat of last year, when only Dollars 1bn of an original Dollars 24bn aid
package was disbursed because the Russian government was unable to meet the
IMF's tough financial conditions.
'The G7 did a lousy job last year,' admitted one senior G7 official. 'A good
opportunity was lost because the IMF tried to nail down too many details. We
are determined not to see that happen again.'
At their meeting in Tokyo four weeks ago, the G7 foreign and finance
ministers announced a headline figure of nearly Dollars 44bn of assistance
to Russia over the next year from the IMF, the World Bank and in bilateral
aid. (Both the IMF and the World Bank receive the bulk of their funding from
the G7.) But the ministers told the fund to dispense with its normal
practice of waiting for a track record of financial discipline before
releasing aid.
Instead, they instructed the IMF to offer each former Soviet republic fast
disbursing aid - labelled a 'systemic transformation facility' - half of
which would be paid immediately to any government demonstrating a 'credible'
reform strategy. For Russia this facility will provide Dollars 3bn. The IMF
was also told to begin to disburse to Russia a further Dollars 4bn in
standby loans by, at the latest, October 1, and preferably before the July
G7 summit in Tokyo. The World Bank is being pressed to lend about Dollars
4bn during its next fiscal year, which runs from next month to June 1994.
The recent Tokyo meeting posed a problem for both the bank and the fund  -
and potentially a crisis of authority. According to a senior bank official,
the G7's command that the bank and the IMF must come to an agreement with
the Russians is 'unprecedented in the annals of the bank or the fund, in any
country. Nothing is remotely comparable'.
Another bank official said that 'the danger is that our reputation and our
expertise will be debauched. We are big organisations which have built up a
large body of expertise. Now we are being told: just do it. What happens to
morale? And what about those countries which also didn't meet the criteria
we set and didn't get the money. You can bet there is a lot of screaming
going on behind the walls in Washington.'
Life had already become increasingly uncomfortable for the IMF, even before
these new pressures were applied. 'Last year,' said one IMF official, 'was a
disaster. But it has been a disaster not just for Russia, but for the IMF
itself.'
At the root of the west's difficulties is Russia's failure to meet the
stringent targets set down for the receipt of aid. The reformers, constantly
fighting for their political lives and warring with Mr Victor Gerashchenko,
central bank chairman, were unable to bring inflation down to 9 per cent a
month by the end of 1992 by cutting state spending and central bank credits
 -the basic condition for assistance. Consumer prices rose by 25 per cent in
December alone, and, while the official budget deficit was only 4 per cent
of GDP, total credits issued by the central bank to the state sector
totalled 40 per cent of GDP.
If anything, the prospects for economic reform have deteriorated further in
the past few weeks. Both the Russian government and central bank continue to
sanction ever more credits for loss-making state enterprises, while
President Boris Yeltsin's recent cabinet changes have appeared
contradictory. Since his election victory two weeks ago, he has appointed
two deputy prime ministers without known commitment to reform, although
senior sackings yesterday may signal that he is willing to strengthen the
course of economic transformation again.
The IMF argues that its inability to lend more is the result of the Russian
government's financial profligacy, not excessive caution. Mr Michel
Camdessus, the IMF managing director, wrote recently in the daily Russian
newspaper Izvestia that the fund could not lend money to inflation-wracked
Russia only to see it leave the country as investors took flight from a
falling rouble.
Since those remarks, the west has had a change of heart. First, western
governments, seeing reform stagger and sometimes go into reverse last year,
have become more aware of the consequences of failure. President Clinton
illustrated the shift in attitude in a speech oon April 1: 'If Russia's
reforms turn sour, if it reverts to authoritarianism or disintegrates into
chaos, the world cannot afford the strife of the former Yugoslavia
replicated in a nation as big as Russia.'
Second, the Clinton administration has been influenced by western advisers
to the Russian government, who have, at times, mounted a ferocious critique
of what they term the passivity and alleged incompetence of the IMF.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, who has led this attack, says
the IMF has proved incapable of thinking tactically and continued to view
aid as a reward for success, rather than a pre-condition. 'The IMF has
refused to agree realistic targets which take into account the amount of
available foreign financing,' he said.
In Tokyo, the G7 ministers 'encouraged' the IMF 'to play a more active
role'. G7 officials now say the Russian government must merely demonstrate
that it intends to bring credit creation under control and cut subsidies to
enterprises before aid can start to flow as early as the end of this month.
But the lack of a Russian track record of discipline frightens financial
institutions. 'The bank and the fund are now under enormous pressure to
provide assistance and provide it quick,' said one senior World Bank
official. 'And the message is we shouldn't be too worried about conditions.
This is very difficult to do, not just in terms of our responsibility to our
donors, but also organisationally.'
G7 officials rebut the suggestion that aid will now, in practice, be
unconditional. 'We have focused conditionality, not weakened it,' said Mr
Lawrence Summers, assistant secretary for international affairs at the US
Treasury.
Nonetheless, growing tensions between the G7 and the international financial
institutions remain, and cannot be dismissed as a mere disagreement over
strategy. The institutions have to think of life after Russian reform - and
of their standing with other, often poorer, members in Latin America and
Africa.
G7 officials counter that the international financial institutions set too
much store by economic conditions and fail to recognise political realities.
'Let's not get overly misty-eyed about conditions,' said one senior G7
official. 'How much conditionality was there in the average Argentine
programme in recent years?'
'G7 officials do not believe that it is appropriate to lend regardless of
what is going on in Russia,' he added. 'But the task now is to push the
Russians to do the right thing. We cannot wait to negotiate every 'i' and
every 't'.'
The G7's bold strategy is supported by Professor Stanley Fischer, previously
chief economist at the World Bank and now an adviser to the bank from his
base at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is worried, however,
about the capacity of the Russians to implement reform.
'It is possible that the institutions' credibility will be damaged, although
probably much less than they now fear,' he said. 'But while the west must
not be seen to be supporting everything the Russians do, it must still
support them in a big way.'
The US backs that view, believing that aid is essential now to buy time
while reformers in the Russian government pursue the accelerating
privatisation programme and economic restructuring. But the policy seems
likely to meet resistance from senior officials in the IMF and World Bank
who fear that the money will be wasted, and that they will be blamed.
'One can debate the niceties,' said a senior World Bank official, 'but at
some point we must ask - is it likely that the Russian government will
deliver on a consistent economic programme? My view is that it will not. I
think the G7 will be proved wrong and I don't think it will be our fault.'

FT  12 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Italy's tangle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN CAPITALISM, like Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, appears to exist in two
strikingly different guises. Its outward-turning features radiate the
resourcefulness which since the second world war has given Italy one of
Europe's fastest economic growth rates. This performance, while strongest
among Italy's array of medium-sized companies, has turned some leaders of
large Italian groups into international figures. It has also rewarded the
country with a GDP per head (based on official figures) higher than that of
the UK and united Germany.
The secret countenance of corporate Italy is much less pleasant to behold,
but until recently has been mainly hidden. This face has now been revealed
by investigations into corruption during the past 15 months in which more
than 1,000 senior politicians and businessmen, many of them from Italy's
leading corporations, have been implicated. Italian executives stand accused
of connivance in a network of systematic bribery which has defrauded large
sums from the public purse and helped keep in power a generation of flawed
politicians.
As a result of the energy of the magistrature and the long-suppressed
indignation of the public, the edifice of malpractice has started to
crumble. For the larger companies caught up in the fray, an exercise in
damage limitation is under way. Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector group,
which has seen more than half a dozen of its top executives arrested,
interrogated or briefly detained in corruption inquiries, yesterday unveiled
a strict code of business ethics to stop Fiat employees accepting payment in
money or in kind from unscrupulous outsiders.
On one level, this is an attempt to demonstrate that Fiat is making a
genuine effort to adopt more transparent practices in line with those
ruling, say, in the US. On another level, by mounting an internal and
external campaign against kickbacks, Fiat seems to be trying to win less
harsh treatment for its executives ensnared in the judicial net. Mr Cesare
Romiti, Fiat's chief executive, who previously complained about
over-inquisitive magistrates, has switched to helping them with their
inquiries, and exhorting other company chiefs to do the same.
Fiat's appeal to Italian industrialists may turn out to be a full-hearted
bid to support the country's political reforms. But if the company is simply
trying to avoid prosecutions of individuals on the grounds that they were
forced to misbehave by the politicians, this is likely to bring discredit.
A spirit of co-operation - seen most vividly in Italy's close-knit business
networks - has been a vital source of its economic dynamism. But when such
networks give rise to self-serving or even criminal collusion among
corporations or among corporations, politicians and the state, they are
consistent neither with desirable standards of public morality, nor with
Italy's wish to move closer to the head of Europe's economic league. The
programme of privatisation of state enterprises is one way of freeing
Italy's considerable reserves of dynamism. Yet unless Italian companies
co-operate fully in the current attempt to unravel an inefficient and
self-destructive tangle of corruption, the dream of a reformed Italy will
remain unfulfilled.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Personal View: How to make the Ecu user-friendly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LORD COBBOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will the European Currency Unit be the single currency for Europe, as laid
down by the Maastricht treaty? I have my doubts. The Community's 340m
citizens are unlikely to accept a strange new currency that none of them
knows - any more than Europeans were willing to accept Esperanto as a common
language earlier this century.
Just as English, with American help, has become the lingua franca of Europe,
so the Continent's single currency will probably be the one most familiar to
a large proportion of the population. Most likely, it will be the D-Mark.
The Ecu is weighted against a basket of EC currencies; it was created as a
'European' currency, neutral in nationalistic terms. It is widely used in
Eurobond transactions, and an Ecu clearing system is managed by commercial
banks. Further, it is used as a unit of account between governments, as well
as by some European companies.
However, the Ecu has some overwhelming practical disadvantages. It is viewed
by the market simply as one more foreign currency. Its value is not known
outside professional circles. There are no Ecu notes and coins, nor are
consumer goods priced in Ecu.
Additionally, the Maastricht plan for economic and monetary union (Emu)
suffers from a serious technical drawback. According to the Emu timetable,
member currencies' exchange rates will be permanently fixed in terms of Ecus
at the start of Stage 3 - which could be in 1997 or (more likely) 1999. Thus
the value of the Ecu will not be known until the close of business on the
last working day before Stage 3 starts.
Since the closing market rates are likely to be expressed to four decimal
places, consumers and savers will be expected to learn to live with the new
currency at a complicated conversion rate. The Ecu can be saved only if it
is made much more user-friendly. The simplest way to achieve this is to fix
the Ecu/D-Mark parity at Ecu1.00=DM2.00 from the beginning of Stage 2 on
January 1 1994. This compares with the present rate of DM1.953 to the Ecu.
The process would require a precise interpretation of the wording of the
Maastricht treaty. Article 109g states that, from the beginning of Stage 2,
'the currency composition of the Ecu basket shall not be changed'. If this
article were taken to mean that the percentage weighting (rather than, as at
present, the fixed amount) of each currency within the Ecu basket shall not
be changed, it would need only a minor adjustment over the 1994 New Year
weekend to reset Ecu currency weights to produce a fixed value of DM2.
This scheme would allow the Ecu's value to become instantly recognisable.
The D-Mark, which has a weighting of about 32 per cent in the Ecu basket, is
by far the best known currency among Community consumers. The Emu planning
process for banks and industry could begin in Stage 2, assisting the
transition. New German notes and coins could be issued during Stage 2
showing both the Ecu and D-Mark value. The Bundesbank would still have to
surrender influence over monetary policy to the European central bank. At
the same time, one of the Bundesbank and the German people's main objections
to Emu would be removed. They would keep the D-Mark; the Ecu would become
the 'Doppelmark'.
For France, such a plan might bring some loss of face. But the 'basket'
concept of the Ecu would be preserved, albeit in a more cosmetic guise. The
French could permanently fix the franc against the D-Mark at the beginning
of Stage 2. France could then issue Ecu notes which could be co-ordinated
with German designs and made legal tender in both countries. Following the
French government's success in weathering currency turbulence on the foreign
exchange markets since last autumn, the obvious round number parity would be
FFr100=DM30=Ecu15.
My proposal would bring an important challenge for Britain, which clearly
does not want to be left out of a move towards a single European currency.
Britain is close to an important round number relationship with the DM/Ecu.
At DM2.50, the Ecu would be worth 80 pence. Should Britain decide to rejoin
the exchange rate mechanism at or after the start of Stage 2 at a fixed rate
of DM2.50, the British public would have a reasonably simple conversion to
make. Britain, too, could experiment ahead of Stage 3 by issuing some Pounds
20 notes showing their fixed equivalent value at DM50 and Ecu25.
If people object to the word Ecu, the Financial Times (and perhaps the Sun)
could sponsor a poll to choose a more appealing name. Why not rehabilitate
the 'guinea'?

FT  12 MAY 93 / Letter: Insider dealing and those in the know
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GODFREY CHANDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Those who worry about the extent of insider dealing sometimes fail to
appreciate the natural potential effect of good and bad news in a free
market. There are, of course, a few flagrant cases. But the very fact that a
limited number of people close to a company know of good or bad potential
means that, whereas most of them will not buy before good news, nor sell
before bad - they are unlikely to do the reverse. Therefore, a part of those
closest to the company - including advisers who might normally be sellers or
supporters - will 'hold fire', reducing the weighting of one side of the
market. Their absence from the market has its effect. This is especially
true of small and medium-sized companies. Under the personalised jobbing
system - pre-1986 - a jobber would soon have a quiet (or less quiet) word
with the principals of any broking firm bringing suspicious business. In the
new faceless market, matters are delayed and 'official'.
Commercial standards are lower - as they are with companies settling debts -
in spite of broader rules. For, as Mr Wally Giles of Barings said on the
introduction of the Take-Over Code: 'If they had all read the 10
Commandments this would not be necessary'.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Letter: Context crucial in analysing Ukraine's nuclear
position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr VIACHESLAV A SKRYGHIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Given the level of attention that the international news media has
placed recently on Ukraine's delay in pursuing nuclear disarmament policies
acceptable to the west, we were pleased to see that your editorial 'Nuclear
rift over Ukraine' (May 5) presented an unbiased and thoughtful analysis of
Ukraine's current position.
As presented in your editorial, failure by western governments to evaluate
some of the underlying motives surrounding Ukraine's position on these
issues, and to pursue policies aimed at satisfying these concerns, threatens
to thwart reaching an agreement which all parties, including the Ukrainian
government, ultimately seek to accomplish: the dismantling of nuclear
weapons on Ukrainian soil.
Further, the inclination of the international news media to report
peripheral events without placing them within a broader context threatens to
present a biased picture to the world of a country with potential strategic
importance which is desperately attempting to define its role in
geopolitical concerns.
With a population of more than 52m people and a land mass about equal to
that of France, Ukraine is in the process of recognising this potential. Its
relatively homogenous balance of 74 per cent ethnic Ukrainians and 21 per
cent ethnic Russians helps to solidify the posture it takes in global
events.
Your perspective also fosters the ultimate goal of encouraging the creation
of a viable, democratic, nuclear-free state that offers opportunities for
investment and trade which benefit both Ukraine and the rest of the world.
As an officer of one of the largest private companies in Ukraine, I found it
refreshing to see that the Financial Times took a complete and responsible
look at the complex underlying issues and presented them in their proper
context.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, Another refreshing stream of opinionated political cynicism from Joe
Rogaly: 'A few (sic) local authorities changing political colour means
little now that the Tories have stripped so much power from the counties'
('Where comedy is king', May 7).
The government's disastrous electoral results that very day stem from many
factors. One was a cocksure assumption that ministers could trample over
local democracy with impunity.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Letter: An unfair, but particularly British, moan about Don
Quixote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For most of the time Clement Crisp's ballet reviews make for enjoyable
reading. They are critical in the original, positive, meaning of the word
and are enriched with lots of historical details reflecting Mr Crisp's
profound knowledge of the matter. His destructive views on the Royal
Ballet's new production 'Don Quixote' (April 10 and April 28), however, and
much more so the supporting letter by Mr Varcoe-Cocks (Letters, May 8),
remind me of that British disease called moaning.
Marc Thompson's admittedly very unusual, and at first glance possibly
disillusioning, designs serve the real purpose of ballet designs, which is
helping the mind and the eye, to concentrate on the very dancing itself
(that is, supporting it instead of competing with it), and are at the same
time a most promising way of introducing classical ballet to a wider and
younger audience. The latter point especially is essential for classical
dancing to survive well into the next century.
On the night that I was fortunate enough to attend the performance the
dancing was splendidly and most beautifully delivered by Leanne Benjamin,
Jose Manuel Carreno and the supporting cast and was obviously very much
enjoyed not only by the artists themselves but by the vast majority of a
near-capacity audience as well.
I only hope the reasons for some of the seats being left empty have nothing
to do with Mr Crisp's views, which this time were far too conservative (or
may I say, as an elderly lady sitting just beside me suggested) reactionary.
It would have been a pity.
The Royal Ballet can only be congratulated for sticking to its way by
including 'Don Quixote' in the 1993-94 season programme as well.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Letter: Competition in the CD market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY H WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letters you published on May 10 uniformly attacked the idea of an
inquiry into CD pricing.
As a consumer who would willingly buy more CDs if the prices were lower, I
was surprised at the lack of objectivity in the arguments. The price of a
top-class classical CD is now Pounds 14.99 in the UK, having risen in the
last few years from the price quoted by Mr Perry of Pounds 11.99. Perhaps he
is not a fan of Nigel Kennedy or Herbert van Karajan.
The US price for the exact same items, which I verified through a computer
on-line shopping mall offering these items in the US, was Dollars 13.99,
which equates to about Pounds 9.15. This is, contrary to Mr Deacon's
comment, 40 per cent lower, not 10 to 15 per cent.
Finally, Ms Gordon's fears of illicit imports and inconsistencies in
different markets would create no new problems than already exist for other
imported goods.
There may indeed be problems for the distributors if changes occur but the
discrepancies in pricing compared with the US are there for all to see, and
without legally created barriers to import competition I doubt that these
market imperfections could survive.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Twin track to Bosnia peace: Air attacks and military aid are
complementary, not alternatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many readers are suffering from Bosnia fatigue. 'I know it's terrible,' they
say, 'but things are just as bad in Armenia, Abkhazia, Tajikistan and a lot
worse in Sudan. Why do you go on about it?'
I go on about it not primarily for moral reasons but because I believe the
security of Europe is threatened by the failure of European states to act on
the principles they proclaim.
Czechs and Slovaks, Russians and Ukrainians have shown that a federal state
can be dissolved without bloodshed. But the chances of it happening in
Yugoslavia were never good. Too many Serbs had drawn, from a selective
reading of history, the conclusion that they would never be safe unless they
all lived in one state. They were ready from the start to fight rather than
accept the secession of Croatia or Bosnia-Hercegovina. Recognition of those
states was therefore a cruel deception, unless the recognisers were able and
willing to deter the Serbs from reacting with violence.
But it is no use crying over spilt milk. The question is what to do now. So
far the Serbs have succeeded, by being better armed and more ruthless than
their opponents, in seizing control of most of the territory where Serbs
lived - even where they were a minority - and 'cleansing' it of other ethnic
groups. This has created an unmanageable refugee problem, reminiscent in too
many ways of the Palestinian one, and has set an appalling precedent for
ethnic or national leaders elsewhere in central and eastern Europe. It must
not be allowed to stand.
The Vance-Owen plan accepts the Serb logic, since it divides
Bosnia-Hercegovina into provinces all but one of which would be dominated by
one ethnic group. But it attempts to apply that logic more fairly than the
Serbs themselves have done.
The Bosnian Serbs do not like the plan because the provinces it assigns to
them would not all be contiguous, either with each other or with Serbia
proper; and because it requires them to withdraw from territory they now
control, leaving some of their homes under 'alien' domination. In those
areas, they naturally fear, it would be their turn to be 'ethnically
cleansed'.
The Bosnian Croats like the plan because it puts almost all their homes
under their own political control. They have already set about making sure
of that by doing some 'ethnic cleansing' of their own.
The Moslems do not like the plan at all. It leaves them, the largest group,
with the smallest area. The plan would give them back some of the territory
they have lost, but would still leave many of their homes outside their
political control. Their chances of returning to those homes would be slim.
Still, the Moslems have accepted the plan because it is their only chance of
getting international support. They too have been driven to accept the Serb
logic, and start 'cleansing' some of the areas they control.
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, has suddenly emerged as a
'goody' because he wants the Bosnian Serbs to accept the plan, as he wanted
the Croatian Serbs to accept the Vance plan in January 1992. He does not
expect either plan to be implemented, but hopes that a ceasefire now would
get the international community off his back, while enabling the Bosnian
Serbs to consolidate their gains (as the Croatian Serbs have done).
Having got so far, the 'international community' (meaning the west egged on
by Moslem and other non-aligned states, dragging Russia nervously in its
wake) should take Mr Milosevic at his word. He says he is cutting off all
but humanitarian aid to the Bosnian Serbs.
The United Nations should respond by placing monitors all along the
Yugoslav-Bosnian border and keeping them there until the Bosnian Serbs have
not only signed the Vance-Owen plan but implemented it.
Failing that, the military option is the only one. It need not imply putting
more external troops on the ground. It may even require withdrawing those
troops that are now there, since it certainly requires dropping any idea
that they are neutral. The military option means giving Bosnia the means to
defend itself: a fundamental right of any state, consecrated by Article 51
of the United Nations Charter. While the weapons are being flown in, Nato
air power should be used to prevent the Serbs from launching an all-out
assault.
At last, it seems, those two actions - arming the Bosnian government forces,
and air attacks on their opponents - are seen in Washington, if not yet in
European capitals, as complementing each other, not as alternatives. That is
vital, because neither by itself is likely to achieve what must be the
objective: the defeat of those, whether Serb or Croat, who seek the
partition of Bosnia.
If the Bosnian Serbs could be convinced that this strategy was really about
to be put into force, they might well promptly accept the Vance-Owen plan as
(from their point of view) the lesser evil. They should be given a last
chance to do so. But once the military strategy went into action the plan
should be dropped.
Abraham Lincoln did not challenge slavery south of the Mason-Dixon line so
long as there was a hope of avoiding secession. But once Americans were
fighting and dying to keep the country together, he proclaimed emancipation
of the slaves throughout the union.
Similarly, the Vance-Owen plan can be defended as an alternative to war, but
not as a war aim. If the war is to go on, the only acceptable outcome is one
allowing all Bosnian citizens to return home freely and in safety.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Price war is not just skin deep: A clash between two
competing retailing strategies for the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For British holidaymakers, safe summer tans will be a lot cheaper this year,
thanks to the recent outbreak of price discounts on suncare products. But
for some of Britain's biggest retailers, the competitive pressures which
have led to the price battle threaten to keep turning up the heat long after
summer ends.
Though other retailers such as Tesco, the supermarket group, have joined in,
the real battle is between two protagonists: Boots, the country's largest
chemists chain, and Superdrug, the fast-growing discount drugstore company
which triggered hostilities by cutting branded suncare prices by 25 per cent
two weeks ago.
This is Superdrug's second headline-grabbing price offensive in 18 months
and follows its decision to discount fragrances by up to 30 per cent at 42
of its 680 stores. Heavy lobbying by Superdrug has also prompted a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the distribution practices of
perfume manufacturers, which refuse to supply the company directly.
Though Boots has matched the perfume price cuts, it has done so gradually
and only in outlets near Superdrug stores which sell fragrances. Its
response in suncare products has been much more decisive. Days after
Superdrug acted, Boots announced 30 per cent price cuts in all its 1,100
stores.
The speed and scale of its reaction were deliberate. 'One reason we have
taken a high profile this time is to send a clear signal that we care about
our market share,' says Mr Gordon Hourston, managing director of Boots The
Chemists (BTC), the division of the Nottingham-based group which operates
the high-street stores.
At stake are much more than Boots' 47 per cent of the Pounds 110m UK suncare
market and Superdrug's goal of doubling its share to 16 per cent this year.
BTC points out in any case that suncare provides less than 2 per cent of its
turnover and says it is confident of offsetting lower margins through higher
sales volumes.
Far more worrying for Boots is the risk that if price battles of this kind
proliferate, they will reinforce the impression among consumers - already
detected by the company's market research - that its prices are too high and
its profit margins too fat.
Superdrug is adept at exploiting that impression. Not only has it won
valuable free publicity by skilfully posing as a consumer champion; it
misses no opportunity to portray its larger rival as greedy. 'In markets
such as vitamins, photographic film or cosmetics, where Boots' share is 30
per cent or more, its margins are sky-high,' says Mr Geoff Brady,
Superdrug's marketing director.
Behind the knock-about rhetoric and PR stunts, though, lies a genuine clash
between two business philosophies based on sharply different beliefs about
what retailers need to do to prosper in the 1990s.
Boots is widely admired for its professionalism and, in particular, its
effective use of sophisticated electronic information systems to manage the
supply chain, keep tight control of stocks and analyse the sales and profit
performance of each of its product lines.
The company is proud of its record in using the resulting efficiency gains
to deliver improved results to shareholders in the form of higher profit
margins. Despite recession, BTC has raised profits from 8 per cent of sales
to 10 per cent since 1990 - though other parts of the group have performed
less well.
Superdrug comes from a very different stable. Part of the Kingfisher group -
which also owns Woolworths, the B&amp;Q do-it-yourself chain and the Comet
electrical stores - it is guided by the 'value retailing' principles of Sir
Geoffrey Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman.
Sir Geoffrey believes consumers have become more discerning not just because
of recession but because they face ever wider choice. He has repeatedly
argued that retailers must respond by emphasising value and accepting lower
margins in return for volume growth.
His radical views - partly inspired by the success of discount chains such
as Wal-Mart in the US - have won supporters in the City. Some regard him as
a prophet of a new wave of retailing, which will eventually sweep through
the rest of the UK sector.
Though Sir Geoffrey stresses that value retailing does not mean neglecting
customer service, pricing is at the heart of the approach. It is exemplified
by B&amp;Q's recent decision to offer permanent discounts on 500 popular product
lines, and by similar, more limited, offers at Woolworths and Comet.
Industry observers think Boots' margins on many items make further selective
deep-discount raids by Superdrug inevitable - a view the latter company has
not sought to dispel. 'I don't think there is an end to this process,' says
Mr Paul Deacon of Goldman Sachs. 'Superdrug will move from product to
product and keep pushing.'
Apart from the favourable publicity it has generated, Superdrug's biggest
advantage is a low cost base. Though it is smartening up some of its stores,
they are less lavishly equipped and often occupy less desirable sites than
its larger rival's.
However, Superdrug faces several challenges. It has few in-store pharmacies,
which account for a fifth of BTC's sales and are believed to be its most
profitable business. Superdrug must also persuade Boots' main suppliers to
sell it products, which some have been reluctant to do.
Mr Brady says that, to be sure of supplies of suncare products, he has
bought in advance and stocked enough to meet all this year's expected
demand. He also doubts that he can continue to expand perfume sales unless
the MMC orders manufacturers to supply Superdrug direct, instead of forcing
it to buy on the unauthorised 'grey' market.
Mr Deacon doubts that if an all-out price war developed, Superdrug would
emerge the winner, though he thinks it could damage Boots' margins.
Mr Hourston says price cuts on only two product ranges do not even amount to
a battle. But he says BTC is preparing to defend itself against the threat
of further onslaughts by Superdrug and is considering a range of possible
responses. Though he will not give details, he says: 'If they do this again,
it would be wrong to assume we will retaliate in precisely the same way.'
He argues that while Boots aims to offer competitive prices, its strength
also depends heavily on its commitment to high product quality,
well-equipped stores and customer service. However, he admits this may be a
two-edged weapon.
'The impression can be created that, because of these investments, Boots is
an expensive place to shop,' he says - quickly insisting that this view is
mistaken.
With 35,000 product lines, Boots can afford to subsidise price cuts on some
from profits on others. However, Mr Hourston stresses that the company's
financial goals make this only a temporary solution: if profits on
individual products are inadequate, prices must be raised or the lines
dropped.
Clearly, the extent to which Boots is obliged to adjust its marketing
strategy depends heavily on when and how Superdrug steps up its offensive -
and how long it lasts. Unlike Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, Mr Hourston believes the
current pricing pressures are transient and will recede once sustained
economic growth resumes.
Which view is right may not become clear until much later this decade. But
meanwhile, Boots may need to pay unusually close attention to what Mr
Hourston calls 'the lovely balance' between delivering the high margins
which delight the City and the competitive prices need to keep customers
loyal.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Arts: Kodo Drummers - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was always a nadir during the rock concerts of the 1970s known as the
drummer's solo. It was totally unavoidable and totally boring; around 15
minutes of thrashing and flailing which ended with the drummer throwing his
sticks at the audience and pouring a bottle of water over his head.
The Kodo Drummers perform for around two hours and fifteen minutes, and pose
a different problem. Their drumming is unmatchable; you appreciate the
subtlety and imagination that drives each item. You readily believe that
such precision and commitment can only be attained after a routine of
training which makes SAS manouevres seem like a cake walk.
But for some people the drum is not the most melodic of instruments; not the
most lyrical. It stirs the blood rather than the soul. After the first Kodo
number, when the 12 drummers build up a wall of sound that makes your thighs
resonate and your ear drums ache, you doubt the pleasure principle.
Wisely the troupe knows the weakly western constitution and intersperses the
drumming with delicate solos and duets on traditional Japanese instruments
which tend to confirm that folk music throughout the world is inevitably
wistful and melancholic.
But it is for the drummer boys that the audience whoops and cheers,
especially when the pressure of work strips them down to loin cloths.
Like virtually all Japanese art forms these drummers from the island of Sado
are totally outside European experience and reference. The dedication, the
training, the physical perfection beat out as loudly as the drums - or as
softly, as they manipulate the skins with masterful control.
It is hardly music; more a primitive romance with rhythm. Often they pose
like young Samurai, treating their drums as worthy opponents. You wait for
the biggest drum, the 800 pounder, to be brought out, before which the
drummers undress and lie down, and then raise sticks as large as baseball
clubs to pound it to death.
Some of the asceticism has worn away from the drummers during their
interminable international tour. Their faces are less inscrutable; more
baleful; almost self-satisfied. This is spectacle, entertainment, which must
greatly delight anyone interested in drumming techniques but cause many
British people to sit in respectful boredom.

Directed by Richard Eyre, written by Ian McEwan and starring Harriet Walter,
is a pretty impressive combination so The Imitation Game (BBC 2 at 9pm)
demands attention. It was first broadcast in 1980 and is revived as part of
the tribute season to Richard Eyre, now director of the National Theatre.
Walter is a young girl, anxious to join the war effort in 1940, whose
enthusiasm evaporates when confronted by male condescension.
Newsreader Martyn Lewis's plea for more good news should be satisfied in
QED: Gallop to Freedom (BBC 1 at 9.30pm), which follows attempts to revive
the Przewalski horse. This was the horse of antiquity, immortalised in the
cave paintings at Lascaux.
Tight budgets do not allow much costume drama on screen, especially when it
involves the recreation of battles. So a welcome for Sharpe in which Sean
Bean buckles his swash as a lieutenant in Wellington's army in Spain during
the Peninsula War. In this episode (ITV at 8pm) he rallies his men to
recover the lost regimental colours and ideally to capture a French eagle.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Arts: 'Otello' revived - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elijah Moshinsky's production of Verdi's opera, re-staged now by Richard
Gregson, has established itself as a durable treasure of the Royal Opera
repertoire. It looks imposing, though it has no tricks that grow stale (the
opening tempest still dazzles with Robert Bryan's lighting); it sets a
credible time and place compactly and thriftily; it wastes no time - one
modest interval between the middle acts, the merest pauses elsewhere. On
Monday its fourth revival, with all the principals drawn from previous
casts, gave resounding satisfaction.
'Resounding' in particular because the Otello was again the Russian tenor
Vladimir Atlantov, whose forte is fortissimo: for the July 18
concert-performance by the lake at Kenwood, he will need no microphones. Not
long ago I heard him in the role in Vienna, where he sang wildly, if
sometimes thrillingly, and barely interacted with his Desdemona and Iago. At
Covent Garden, with sharply purposeful conducting by Edward Downes, he was
better tuned and rather less self-absorbed. It remains a broad, extrovert
performance - far removed from Domingo's anguished subtleties with Carlos
Kleiber in the pit (worlds away, in the 'Dio] mi potevi scagliar'
soliloquy), but honestly stirring in its own terms.
His Desdemona was the lovely Katia Ricciarelli, still a radiant,
unsurpassable icon of innocent goodness. The vocal problems of recent years
have melted away; the 'beat' in the voice is safely under control, and
warmly affecting. Her soprano glows with a new maturity, if not the reckless
generosity of her early career. On the modern stage sheer goodness is not a
plausible commodity, but Ricciarelli's natural grace, spontaneity and
dignity carry it off and seize one's heart.
Like this heroine, Justino Diaz's Iago was captured by Zeffirelli for his
film of the opera - and was, I suspect, enhanced by the experience. It is
not a flamboyant study in villainy, nor does it brandish the dark-grained
weight of the Diaz baritone. (In the roaring duet with Otello, indeed, he
sang his first verse more or less to his knees, an odd thing to do.) But
plain, subtle details accumulate and soon a formidably troubled character
comes into focus, without melodramatic signalling of the kind few Iagos can
resist.
Sterling work from the lesser principals, among whom I will mention
invidiously Robin Leggate's ever-upstanding Cassio, Anne Mason's alert
Emilia and the precocious Ambassador of Peter Rose, who lends to his
all-but-faceless role the solid bottom that it needs for the drama. For the
chorus Otello sets strenuous tests, all of which the Royal Opera forces
passed with flying colours. I still think that the choir of 'Cypriot' boys
(this time from Chorley Wood) is excessively tow-headed, but it is not a
point to fret over.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Arts: 'Shining Brow' - a tribute to Frank Lloyd Wright /
Opera in Madison, Wisconsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Madison, Wisconsin, is a city one might compare with, say, Worcester for its
size, for the way it is dominated by one spectacularly sited piece of
architecture (the high domed state capitol on a hill between lakes), for the
snare of its one-way system, and for its unlikeliness as a springboard for
new opera. Hitherto the local company has put on a couple of productions
each season: usually a favourite opera and a musical.
But a few years ago some proud and tenacious residents got it into their
heads that Madison Opera ought to present a new piece on the subject of
Madison's most famous son, or stepson, Frank Lloyd Wright, who attended high
school and college in the city. The next step was to find a Wisconsin
composer to do the job. And because Daron Aric Hagen, the eventual choice,
was staying at an artists' retreat in the company of Paul Muldoon when he
received the call, Madison's dream began to become real in Muldoon's words.
The resulting libretto is a curious and fascinating piece of work, as
lopsided and quaint and wondrous as anything created by Wright himself.
There are phrases, and sometimes whole miniature scenes, that are, as
Muldoon has bemusedly said, more direct than anything he might have done
without the cover of music. When, for instance, Wright is confronted by
slavering reporters and prudish neighbours on his return from Europe with
his mistress Mamah Cheney, he speaks to himself in the most everyday
language: 'The truth is that I feel nothing, not the merest hint of remorse.
Not a pang of guilt.' The brandy-doused resentment of Louis Sullivan,
Wright's erstwhile mentor, is also expressed plainly and forcefully, and
there are little moments of social comedy in what the chorus have to do.
On the other hand, many passages are deeply underlaid with allusion or, more
commonly, with subtleties of metre, rhyme and assonance. Mamah in Berlin has
a long solo in terza rima and Muldoon proves himself a virtuoso in the da
Ponte-ish trickery of enabling different people to sing different things
simultaneously in similar sounds. Most conspicuously of all, his libretto is
full of words and images that repeat themselves from mouth to mouth, so that
the individualities needed for characterisation - and, to a degree, plot -
are eroded by echoings.
'I know, I know, I know, I know, I know' is the simplest of these verbal
tics, its echoings echoed in turn by those of other keywords: 'kowtow',
'brow' (Shining Brow, the opera's title, is a translation of the bard's name
Wright gave to the house he built for himself and Mamah: Taliesin). 'I know,
I know.' There is nothing new. The people of the libretto - moments of
baldness or wit aside - seem to be caught up in a cat's cradle of words: of
words put into their mouths, of words which have their own lives, meandering
from mouth to mouth. Tides of words take the piece on; who speaks or sings
them is irrelevant.
The one character who has his own words is Carleton, the black chef at
Taliesin, whose hot utterance springs across the gap from ecstatic
African-American preaching to the Welshness of Wright's ancestry and of
Muldoon's immediately preceding poetic work: 'I am the hart. I am the hind.
I am the green and burning tree. I am the cloud no bigger than a hand. I
will go down in history.' It is Carleton who, on the plot level, is
responsible for the final catastrophe, the burning of Taliesin with Mamah
and her children inside, and who, below the plot, challenges the other
characters with the certainty and uniqueness of his language.
Significantly, this language is spoken - or, rather, declaimed - not sung,
while the orchestra stays silent. The composer's nobility is to leave
Carleton's self-statement outside the purlieu of music which oddly thrusts
this sophisticated libretto into a world compounded of Broadway, Peter
Grimes and Der Rosenkavalier. The dedication of the score to the memory of
Leonard Bernstein is apt.
In the performance, everything that enthusiasm could do was done. Roland
Johnson conducted a vigorous and spirited orchestra; the cast was led by
Michael Sokol in the lyric baritone role of Wright, intrepidly seeking
himself through the always confounding maze of words, with Carolann Page as
Mamah and the tenor Barry Busse splendid and vituperative in disarray as
Sullivan. Stephen Wadsworth's direction and David Birn's sets understandably
opted for straightforward clarity.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Arts: BBC governors skate on thin ice - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN WENHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC governors ought to be worried men and women. At the end of last year
their charter renewal process seemed to be going swimmingly. Government had
broadly endorsed the continuation of the status quo. The BBC countered with
a promise of ever-extending choice, within a more accountable organisation.
But now fault-lines are emerging, and look set to deepen.
The reverberating row about top BBC salaries refuses to die down.
Traditionally, these payments were loosely linked to the top end of the
civil service. This financial year top civil servant rates, Sir Robin Butler
and Sir Terry Burns apart, are a shade over Pounds 90,000. The BBC is now
being credited with doubling those monies. So, governors have plainly
brought the old policy to an end. What then is the new? And on what
principles is it based?
There is double danger for governors if they cite competitive pressure in
the market. In the first place, being led by the nose by what others do is a
recipe for broadcast inflation without end. Secondly, whenever the BBC too
cheerfully bends a knee to the market, then it calls in question the special
'non-market' funding protection offered by the licence fee.
Remember too that the licence fee is pegged to the Retail Price Index, as
the bulk of the BBC workforce knows only too well. An unexplained fattening
of differentials at the top therefore makes general staff relations ever
more edgy.
The governors would be wrong to hope that this problem will simply go away.
Commentators will hang on each and every emerging annual report for the next
twist in the story. If governors are regularly to be damned, there is a case
for their publishing details of their salary policy now, in full, and
putting their trust in public understanding. By chance the matching row over
the LWT share scheme gives them a neat opportunity, not - it is to be hoped
 -for making irrelevant comparisons, but simply in offering covering fire.
A full explanation would give some substance to the governors' promise of
'openness,' of which so far there is little sign. Rather the governors
dumbly close ranks when under fire, and so weaken any claim that they are
genuinely independent, or representative of the broad public interest. The
obvious cosiness between governors and its appointed management has
inevitably emboldened others to seek to usurp the governors' function. So,
both the ITC and the Radio Authority made a mark with proposals that they
might take under their wing the relevant BBC services, thus reducing the BBC
to but one client licence-holder among many others. It should be disturbing
to BBC governors that they have left the Corporation wide open to takeover
bids of this sort.
The governors need to be seen to stand back and govern, which means giving
management the necessary steer. Fortunately, opportunity is at hand. By now,
reports from public meetings should have convinced any open-minded governors
that the scheme for a Long Wave Rolling Radio News has little listener
support, and continues to arouse special hostility among adherents to Radio
Four. The governors have already said the scheme is on hold until reception
of Radio Four on FM can be improved to listener satisfaction. They will now
know that this too cannot be delivered except at exorbitant cost. Yet BBC
management continues to turn a deaf ear. If 'accountability' has any
meaning, then the accountable governors should require their management to
put the scheme to one side.
The BBC should press to retain an ability to offer extended commentary by
way of a split service when occasion demands, as it did in the Gulf and as
it may soon over Bosnia. This sort of editorial imperative is something
listeners understand and accept. But the broader expansion into what would
be a sixth free-standing network finds no following wind among the public,
and will create a running sore if pressed.
Greater long-term anxieties attend BBC management's introduction of what is
known as Producer Choice, setting in place an internal market of great
complexity and arguable value. It would be wrong to assume that BBC staff
are wholly hostile to these new mechanics; best intelligence is that one
third are wide-eyed believers, one third sullen sceptics, and one third
bemused agnostics. What concerns all three groups, and should concern the
viewers and listeners they serve, is that the process be seen to be
independently assessed, so that sensible modifications can be put in place
and benefits properly verified, not simply asserted. Here again is natural
governor business.
Unfortunately the recent record again gives pause. As part of the warm-up
for the new arrangements, Pounds 60 million or more of television monies
went unaccounted for. A gubernatorial explanation was promised but has yet
to arrive. There is also a stubborn reluctance to come clean about the
set-up costs for the new system, or for the monitoring of the system once in
place.
Yet, as the press now reminds us almost daily, the BBC is gaily recruiting
systems-minder after systems-minder, a massive buildup of what must surely
count as 'non-core' activity. Little wonder that the sceptics remain
convinced that the whole exercise is designed not to save money but to force
a casualisation of programme-making staff. Sceptics would further argue that
the internal pricing is skewed to that end.
The governors need to take these charges seriously. They have businessmen in
their number well-equipped to take a quizzical look, spot where the new
systems may be unproductively overburdensome, and then give the public a
balanced assessment. It would be useful too to have at this early stage some
idea of the expected outturn in terms of savings and operational efficiency.
In the broad, are we to assume that the changes will prove themselves by
enabling the BBC to live comfortably within its pegged licence fee
throughout the next charter period? That high prize might be worth the fuss.
Or, at the end of the exercise, will we be surprised by a supplementary
bill? If that turns out to be the end game, then the licence-payers may well
be moved to disbelieve grandiose management claims. And the BBC and its
governors will be skating on extremely thin ice.
Christopher Dunkley is on holiday. Brian Wenham was on the staff of the BBC
1969-1987, and is now on the Board of Carlton Television.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the exodus of recent weeks, Invesco MIM yesterday announced a handful
of senior appointments which confirm once again the steadily increasinging
American influence on the still UK-listed fund manager.
Significantly, the new chief financial officer is American Hubert Harris,
who joined Invesco in 1988 and is currently president of Invesco Services.
He replaces Ratan Engineer, the London-based finance director who left in
April. Harris was assistant director of the Office of Management and Budget
in Washington back in the Carter administration. Prior to that he worked at
Citizens and Southern, the bank where executive chairman Charles Brady and
others started before setting Invesco up. He is well plugged into the
Atlanta, Georgia community, from where Brady operates; Harris is on the
board of trustees of Georgia State University as well as a member of the
advisory board of the Atlanta committee for the Olympics.
Invesco has also brought another American non-executive onto the board
following the appointment of Sandy White last November. He is Bevis
Longstreth, a former SEC commissioner and currently a partner with law firm
Debevoise &amp; Plimpton.
Meanwhile Norman Riddle, newly appointed head of the European businesses,
has brought in James Robertson from his previous stable Capital House.
Robertson, who becomes finance director for the European division, had
worked with Riddell in building up Capital House, the fund management
subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, as director of finance and corporate
development. He qualified as a chartered accountant with Arthur Andersen
before joining the corporate finance department of Charterhouse merchant
bank.

FT  12 MAY 93 / People: Greener extends role at BAT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries is hoping to strengthen its clout in the insurance world by
giving George Greener (right), chairman and chief executive of Allied
Dunbar, responsibility for its other insurance subsidiary Eagle Star as
well.
The move follows the promotion of Martin Broughton, previously chairman of
Eagle Star, to the position of group chief executive and deputy chairman of
BAT from the beginning of last month.
Broughton remains managing director of the group's financial services
business, with Greener, now in charge of the whole of the UK, and Leo Denlea
who runs Farmers in the US, both reporting to him.
BAT says the elevation of Greener, who joined in 1991 after a 20-year career
with Mars, to the position of chairman of Eagle Star Holdings reflects the
belief that a more co-ordinated approach will give the group greater muscle
at a time of considerable regulatory upheaval in the industry, particularly
in the life insurance area.
'We believe people will take more notice of us if we are number four in the
market than if we are, separately, both the wrong side of ten' BAT commented
yesterday. Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star's combined premium income gives the
group a 6 per cent share of the UK life, investment and pensions market.
The group also hopes that the new format will increase its chances of
success in the international arena. ''We were beginning to find potential
international partners were unclear as to which bit of the group they would
fit into. Now there is one person for them to talk to' a BAT spokesman
added.
In the past, the ethos of the two operations could not have been more
different, with the brash Allied Dunbar sales technique contrasting sharply
with the more traditional approach of Eagle Star. Now both are moving
towards a multi-channel distribution strategy.
Moreover, BAT believes that whereas Allied Dunbar had been 'so focused on
its sales drive that it had rather lost sight of its market' one of
Greener's achievements has been to redress that balance.
Meanwhile, Clive Coates, finance director of Eagle Star, is promoted to
deputy chairman, while Sandy Leitch, deputy chairman and managing director
of Allied Dunbar, becomes its chief executive.

<TEXT>
The appointment of Sir Ewen Fergusson, Britain's ambassador to France until
last year, to the board of British Telecom as a non-executive director, is
more than just another lucrative pension for a retired senior diplomat.
High on the list of BT's current ambitions is to break into the closed world
of Europe's state-owned posts and telecommunications monopolies.
Britain has long been banging on the Brussels door to get the liberalisation
process moving. This week it appears to have got a commitment that most of
the Community's telephone calls will be open to competition by 1998.
So BT will soon need all the 'gen' it can get on the European scene, not
least in France, where neither the government nor the telecoms monopoly is
likely to put on much of a welcoming party for the British.

FT  12 MAY 93 / People: Benson picks up Costain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Costain, the UK construction group, yesterday moved to strengthen its board
further with the appointment of Sir Christopher Benson as chairman.
Sir Christopher, 59, is chairman of Boots the retailer and chairman until
July of MEPC property group. He is also chairman designate of Sun Alliance.
He takes over in June as chairman of Costain succeeding Peter Sawdy, 61, who
has been chairman for two and a half years during one of the most difficult
periods the group has faced.
The company last year made a Pounds 148.6m pre-tax loss after making further
substantial provisions against its housing and commercial property
operations.
In a bid to reduce its large debts, Costain recently sold its Australian
mining operations to Peabody Resources, part of Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate, in a deal worth Pounds 198m.
Costain has also received several approaches from potential purchasers for
its loss-making UK housebuilding operations.
It is thought to have wanted to appoint a high profile chairman to help
chief executive Peter Costain and a new management team reduce the company's
debt further and restore its fortunes.
The appointment follows the replacement of a number of senior executives
including Tom Slee, the former finance director, and Gordon Haworth, main
board director responsible for American operations. Keith Egerton, director
responsible for commercial property operations, also left the group
following Costain's decision to retreat from that sector.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Put to the green test -
Environmental advice is becoming big business, but there are calls for
higher standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Falkirk District Council hired a consultant four years ago to assess
the environmental impact of a proposed asbestos disposal site, the report it
received was far from comprehensive.
In exchange for their fee, officials were sent a meagre two pages of text
and a couple of low-quality maps of the area under examination. It was
hardly the basis for a detailed assessment of the risks to the soil and
water, the level of treatment of the waste or a consideration of alternative
uses for the land.
As legislative requirements and voluntary pressures have forced companies
and government agencies to take environmental issues seriously, demand has
grown for consultants to help meet their needs.
But the last few months have also brought growing calls for improved quality
from these consultants, as bitter experiences of the results take hold. Now
professional bodies are beginning to respond.
Carl Fuller of the Institute of Environment Assessment, who regularly
examines consultants' reports, says one of the most frequent problems is a
lack of consideration of alternative options during a review.
Consultants often fail to identify weaknesses in proposals, ignore the way
sites would change if a project did not proceed and make elementary errors
such as conducting ecological surveys in December when there is little
prospect of discovering the full range of fauna and flora in the area being
surveyed.
His thoughts are supported by research conducted by Norman Lee of the
environmental impact assessment centre at Manchester University.
Based on a sample of 85 of the 500 environmental statements in the UK
prepared during 1988-91, he found a gradual improvement over time, but that
even in 1990-91 two-fifths were still graded unsatisfactory (see table).
The demand for environmental consultancy is very large and partly externally
imposed. Legal requirements such as the 1990 Environmental Protection Act,
and other codes such as BS 7750, the British Standard on environmental
management, and Emas, the EC's new ecological auditing and management
scheme, are all playing a part.
A recent survey by Environmental Data Services identifies 339 entities which
it recognises as environmental consultants, with billings of Pounds 400m.
The institute's figures suggest the total of those using the label is nearer
700.
At the same time, there are no real barriers to entry and no regulatory or
other official body to ensure that minimum standards are maintained.
The National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies may examine
those wishing to be verifiers of company environmental statements for Emas.
But, in the far more lucrative market of general consulting, there is no
such independent scrutiny.
'The whole environmental business has expanded very dramatically,' says
Chris Luck, a director of Environmental Resources Limited (ERL). 'You become
concerned about the maintenance of professional standards. There have been
worries about how people will know whether they are going to get a good
quality service.'
Prime among the difficulties is the lack of adequately qualified staff. The
institute has taken a lead in tackling this problem through the creation of
the Environmental Auditors Registration Association scheme (Eara) last
October, backed by industry, government bodies and consultancies.
Eara maintains a register of those individuals who have reached one of the
three recognised levels of membership: provisional environmental auditor,
environmental auditor and principal environmental auditor.
Registration at the different levels depends on achieving a certain number
of points through professional and academic qualifications, training and
practical experience. Principals must also submit a written dissertation on
which they are orally examined. David Thompson, the scheme manager, says
there have been more than 500 applications. He hopes that there will be more
than 1,000 names on the register before the end of the year.
There are similar attempts to raise standards for businesses through the
Association of Environmental Consultancies - which currently represents 28
of the larger firms in the industry. At the end of last month, the
association finally ratified a code of practice and launched a registration
scheme. Companies are subject to a review conducted by individuals from two
or three other member consultancies, who look at systems and procedures.
They are supported by a team from Imperial College, London who examine a
sample of commercially-sensitive files on client work. There is a nominal
Pounds 750 fee.
Those that pass or have only minor shortcomings will be audited again in a
year, and then every two years. Those that require more work will be
re-examined after six months.
So far, 18 companies have been registered and can be expected to be audited
by the end of March next year. 'It is by no means a formality,' says Geoff
Mills, head of Gibb Environmental and chairman of the working group for the
scheme. 'There has been some real soul-searching from firms about applying.
But this is not a cartel. We would love others to apply.'
ERL was chosen as the guinea pig, and was visited last December. Luck says:
'Overall the process worked pretty well. It served to confirm our approach
and will ultimately enhance the quality of service we provide. We have
mentioned our registration to clients and in proposals and it has certainly
been very well received.'
That leaves two questions. First, how far credibility in a system of
self-regulation can be maintained. That may only be tested when the
institute and the association have to police and take disciplinary action
against members.
Second, whether in the absence of any formal legal requirements, the
reputation and the profile of the two schemes will be sufficient to persuade
potential customers to use those registered rather than the many continued
fringe players who are not.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Problems of achieving higher
standards - Worldwide Water / A look at EC policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVING the quality of water is one of the most ambitious parts of the
European Commission's environmental policy. Yet, nearly two decades after
some of the directives were passed, the Community is unable to tell whether
countries are complying with the rules. At the same time, water shortages in
Mediterranean countries are renewing pressure on standards.
The Commission has passed more than 200 'green' directives in the past 20
years but the regulations on bathing and drinking water and on treatment of
waste and sewage have attracted more than their share of attention. Surveys
have shown them to attract a high level of popular support in many member
countries.
More rules may be in the pipeline: the Commission needs to decide whether to
bring more chemicals under the regulation's scope and whether to incorporate
a recent tightening of the World Health Organisation's guidelines on lead in
drinking water.
Northern countries have, on the whole, complied with more of the rules than
southern - or so the incomplete figures available suggest. DGXI, the
Commission's environmental directorate, says it accepts that lack of data on
implementation of the directives has been a handicap in enforcing them. It
is up to national inspectors to sample the water, but the methods and extent
of testing vary widely between countries.
Consumer surveys grading beaches make up some of the gap, water companies
say, but are no substitute for systematic monitoring.
What is clear, however, is that the directives are among the most expensive
to implement of all the 'green' rules passed by the Commission. The UK's
water industry, in the middle of a capital spending programme which could
eventually top Pounds 45bn, estimates that half the sum is directly due to
the EC directives. Meeting the new WHO lead guidelines - which would mean
replacing miles of lead piping - could cost another Pounds 8bn, it says.
Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat, the UK's water regulator, has argued
that if the Commission keeps tightening the rules, water costs - and, in the
UK, customers' bills - will be trapped on a never-ending upwards
'escalator'. That prospect has led Eureau, the group representing national
water companies from all EC countries except Greece, to lobby for a revision
to the standards, or at least restraint in setting new ones.
Janet Langdon, director of the UK Water Services Association, which
represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies of England and Wales,
also argues that European countries should have the right to set their own
standards on the colour and taste of drinking water where there are no
health implications.
The Commission's environment directorate plans to hold a seminar in
September to discuss these issues. Although Eureau's members believe they
had received a sympathetic response earlier in the year, several are no
longer as confident.
Michael Swallow, director of the UK Water Companies Association which
represents the smaller water supply companies, says: 'We will be looking
with interest to see whether they have departed from the precautionary
principle' - the insistence that every trace of some substances, such as
pesticides, should be removed even where a health risk is not proven. He
adds: 'The WHO guidelines for 32 pesticides are less stringent than the
Commission's - we want to see how far the scientific basis will be
recognised.'
There are signs, though, that the Commission is taking the problem of
enforcement seriously. The UK helped start up meetings of each countries'
inspectors to help understand differences in monitoring methods.
Devising a workable route to higher standards is not the Community's only
headache - water shortages loom, too. The European Commission published a
report at the end of last year warming that economic growth in the EC will
become constrained by lack of fresh water.
The report, by the Birmingham-based consultancy Ecotec, argues that the
shortages will be most pronounced in Mediterranean countries, because of
increased industrialisation and growing populations. But it also said that
contamination of groundwater by industry and agriculture in industrialised
and heavily-populated northern countries will add to the costs of growth.
The past decade has seen some improvement in pollution control, the Rhine
and the Meuse, among the worst-affected rivers, have seen concentrations of
lead, zinc, arsenic, copper and mercury fall. However, the environment
directorate has conceded that the improvements are 'disappointing' given the
effort and money expended.
The result of Europe's pollution levels and high water standards, according
to the Ecotec report, is that the average cost of water in Europe, Ecu0.66
per cu m, is some two to three times more expensive than in the US or in
densely-populated Japan.
As EC countries become more alert to the rising cost of water and to the
impact on their competitiveness, it may force the Commission's environment
directorate to pick its targets more carefully and consider the economic
consequences more thoroughly than it has done in the past.
This concludes the series. Previous articles appeared on May 5, April 28,

FT  12 MAY 93 / Management: Running the charity superleague - Alan Pike
describes how the sector is trying to improve its management skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For managers in the more frenzied reaches of the private sector, the idea of
running a charity must feel like an invitation to retreat into monastic
life.
Reality, however, is different. Charities may be driven by philanthropic
motives, but they face most of the same financial and competitive pressures
as commercial organisations.
Thousands of small, local charities will always depend on volunteers for
their management. But government ambitions for the voluntary sector to
become a large-scale provider of state-financed welfare services are
encouraging moves towards an elite, super-league of big charities. Attention
is increasingly focusing, therefore, on how these large, business-like
organisations should meet their management needs.
A survey* by Ian Bruce, chief executive of the Royal National Institute for
the Blind and director of the Centre for Voluntary Sector and Not-for-Profit
Management (Volprof) at London's City University Business School, shows that
charities rely heavily on outside recruitment to find many senior managers.
According to the study, 53 per cent of top managers in the biggest 200
charities came from outside the voluntary sector - 33 per cent from
commercial organisations and 20 per cent from public-sector ones. The bigger
the charity, the more likely it was to recruit its chief executive and
senior directors from outside the sector.
'The survey asked only about individuals' last jobs,' says Bruce. 'Had we
traced their careers further back, we should almost certainly have
discovered an even higher proportion with backgrounds outside the voluntary
sector.'
The management needs of big charities are complex and it is therefore no
surprise that they sometimes buy in specialist skills. 'At the RNIB we are
running schools and hotels, managing a Pounds 50m budget, employing 2,000
people, training and managing volunteers and providing services of acute
importance to our clients,' says Bruce.
'It is quite a managerial challenge, something that those people in the
commercial sector who regard us as amateurs fail to appreciate.'
Even so, he believes too many senior posts in big charities are filled by
outside recruitment. 'Some outside talent is obviously good and brings in
new ideas. But if charities are recruiting a majority of their senior staff
from outside it suggests they are not doing enough to train and promote
their own middle managers. That is not good for staff morale or the
long-term development of the sector.'
Some charities take organised steps to develop managers internally - RNIB
runs its own management training scheme with South Bank University  - but
his research suggests that the sector gives insufficient attention to
management.
Volprof is undertaking a feasibility study to see whether this could be
remedied by sector-wide training and development programmes. And the
National Council for Voluntary Organisations this month set up a study group
chaired by Bruce to consider whether a formal Industry Training Organisation
for the voluntary sector should be established. The group will produce its
recommendations early next year.
Another incentive for the voluntary sector to develop the talents of its own
managers is that recruits from the commercial world are not always
successful. 'Some commercial managers cannot cope. They tend to be the more
inflexible ones,' says Bruce.
Bruce and his colleagues at Volprof have begun researching similarities and
differences between managing in the two sectors. Diana Leat, Volprof
visiting senior research fellow, believes many of the assumed differences
between commercial and voluntary organisations are based on oversimplified
views of both.
Rather than searching for differences between charities and commercial
companies, she believes the starting point must be within individual
organisations, regardless of the sector they are in. It is clearly
unhelpful, she says in a Volprof report, to put ICI and a market stall in
the same category just because they are both commercial organisations;
similarly, Oxfam has little in common with a village playgroup. But, she
adds: 'It may be more illuminating to look at the similarities between, say,
Apple and Oxfam than those between Apple and Pepsi.'
In any case, believes Leat, we may be witnessing a convergence in management
priorities between commercial and voluntary organisations to become more
business-like - many resulting from public funding changes, with charities
having to compete for contracts.
But, she suggests, there are equal pressures in the other direction, with
some characteristics more familiar to the voluntary sector becoming
increasingly essential to the success of modern commercial organisations.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Management: Sights set on a new target - James Buxton
describes how moving factory has helped to rejuvenate Barr &amp; Stroud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tom O'Neill, managing director of Barr &amp; Stroud, points to an L-shaped
stretch of desk space, indistinguishable from any other in an open plan
office. 'That's where I sit,' he says proudly.
He adds: 'It was only when I said that was where I was going to work that
other senior executives accepted the idea of not having their own offices.'
Barr &amp; Stroud, which makes equipment such as gunsights, periscopes and
rangefinders mainly for the defence industry, is claiming success in
breaking away from what O'Neill admits were the grossly inefficient
management and production methods of its past.
In common with other defence subcontractors the company is having to face up
to the competitive challenge posed by the ending of the cold war, and by
changes in the old cosy relationship with its customers. What makes its
experience unusual, however, is the galvanising effect which re-locating to
new premises appears to have had on the bottom line.
The move to a large, airy new factory in Glasgow - in which office space
merges into manufacturing areas - has helped Barr &amp; Stroud over the last
couple of years cut its production lead times from 15 months to seven
months, and raise the percentage of products delivered on time from a
slovenly 10 per cent to 90 per cent. Last year it made an operating profit
of Pounds 1.3m, its first since the late 1980s.
O'Neill admits that Barr &amp; Stroud, owned 50-50 by Pilkington and the French
company Thomson, was a product of the 'featherbedded' defence industry,
operating on cost-plus contracts. Before the move it was housed in Edwardian
plants in Anniesland, Glasgow.
Initial efforts at transforming the company through computerisation faltered
in the face of ingrained structures. 'With computerisation alone the company
would just have been automating inefficiency,' according to Mike Ward of
Andersen Consulting, which came in to advise Barr &amp; Stroud on its
transformation.
Just as the company realised it needed more sweeping changes, however, it
sold its old site to Safeway for Pounds 14.5m and was able to commission a
new Pounds 20m plant, designed by the architects Ryder Nicklin.
The reorganisation could consequently start again from scratch. 'The move
opened people's minds,' says O'Neill. 'They suddenly said: 'Why can't we do
this or that?' We wouldn't have made half the productivity gains we've
achieved if we'd stayed where we were.'
The new factory, at Linthouse on the banks of the Clyde, employs 700 people,
compared with the 2,100 who worked at Anniesland. Yet turnover between the
years to March 1990 and March 1993 has gone down proportionately less than
the workforce, falling from Pounds 62m to Pounds 52m.
From the start the company told staff it wanted to cut 800 jobs and achieve
a single status factory, in which the main differential between employees
would be their salary level. That meant reducing nine tiers of management to
four, scrapping the six different grades of canteen in favour of one.
Not surprisingly, says O'Neill, 'the biggest opposition to change came from
middle management, because they were the group most threatened and were
going to be decimated - what was happening really threatened their comfort
zone'.
O'Neill fired 22 of the 40 senior executives in early 1990 soon after taking
over as managing director, 'people who were not going to get on the train in
the direction we were going'.
He says he spelt out frankly to the workforce what was intended. 'We gave
them the bad news about the job losses first, then we listened to their
ideas. If people don't take ownership of change, they won't change their
behaviour.'
Instead of the old hierarchical structure staff now work in 12 teams, each
dedicated to specific projects. These include a civilian version of the
company's thermal imaging equipment, used for spotting objects and people in
the dark, which Barr &amp; Stroud is selling to police forces.
Each team includes designers, production planners, materials purchasers and
production controllers. Staff report to a team leader, rather a middle
manager such as the head of the machine shop as they would have done
previously. The four tiers of management consist of the managing director
(O'Neill), the operations director (Lawrie Rumens), the team leaders and
everyone else, from machinist to receptionist.
Rumens believes that as Barr &amp; Stroud moves closer to its medium-term goal
of achieving full computer integrated manufacturing, his job will disappear,
reducing the four tiers to three.
Barr &amp; Stroud says a system under which seven trade unions each had
negotiating rights has been reduced to a single bargaining group
Barr &amp; Stroud has cut 1,400 jobs from its workforce in three big waves of
redundancies and early retirement. The management dropped a compulsory
redundancy programme after a two-day strike in late 1991 and all
redundancies have been voluntary.
Stewart Ritchie, convener for the AEEU engineer's union, says the employees
like the new working arrangements. The management, he says 'are far more
open than they used to be about what's going on'.
The other big change which contributed strongly to cutting the workforce and
the size of the company's operations was the switch to outsourcing most of
its manufacturing. Here again, the move to new premises was an important
catalyst.
In the old factory Barr &amp; Stroud used to be vertically integrated, producing
much of the metalwork and most of the electronic components for its
products.
'We decided our strength was in designing and making systems,' says O'Neill.
'We wanted to concentrate on that and buy in the rest.'
The machine shop was slimmed down to 30 people from 200, and the same staff
reduction was achieved by the electronics section. Most electronic
components are now made or assembled by the US company Hughes
Microelectronics at Glenrothes, Fife, while optical components come from
Pilkington Optronics' plant at St Asaph in North Wales. Machining is done by
a company in the Isle of Man.
Now only 23 suppliers account for 60 per cent of all inputs - three years
ago the company had more than 3,000 suppliers. By simplifying the
manufacturing operation, stocks and work in progress have fallen from Pounds
22m to Pounds 7m.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Jobs: Pecking order changes - How top executive pay varies
in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WHAT on earth is the world
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or western Europe at any rate - coming to? In the good old days when the
Jobs column first started printing international pay comparisons, one thing
could be counted on. In any ranking of nations east of the Atlantic, Swiss
executives would strut yodelling on the summit.
These days nothing can be found in its proper place any more, as witness the
table to the right. Published as on previous occasions thanks to the Wyatt
consultancy group, it shows Europe's top 12 executive-paying countries.
Taken alone, the fact that the Swiss have had the skids put under them
wouldn't be upsetting. After all, they were knocked off the top the whole of
two years ago. But now the nation that displaced them, the Spanish, have
also been sent tumbling by the Germans. Indeed, the changes are such that
I've subjected them to some extra-curricular reckoning. But before turning
to that, I'll tell what the table does as it stands.
The figures in it, as distinct from the ranking itself, come from the
surveys made by Wyatt's Data Services arm in Brussels. The latest study
covers 1,569 companies of assorted sizes and types in 17 countries, and
gives a wealth of data far beyond the few bits printed here. Any reader who
wants the full report can obtain it, at a price, through Don McClune at
Wyatt's London office: 21 Tothill St, London SW1H 9LL; telephone (0)71-222
8033, fax (0)71-222 9182.
My extracts relate only to three sorts of managers: chief executives
together with directors in charge of finance and administration, and of
personnel. The figures cover holders of those posts across all companies
surveyed in each land, making no adjustment for size or kind of business,
the other currencies have been converted into sterling at the London closing
exchange rates of May 7.
In each category, the table gives basic salary, total money rewards
including bonuses, and a rough gauge of buying power. The three columns
headed 'lower quartile' refer to the executive who'd be a quarter of the way
up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same job and country, the
'median' trio to the executive ranked mid-way, and the 'upper quartile' set
to the one a quarter way down from the top. Finally come the standard
averages, each country's place in the table being determined by the chief
executives' average buying power computed from Wyatt's indices of
living-cost variances.
The trouble is that all such indices not only differ from one another, but
are anyway no more than a loosely approximate guide. For instance, none that
I know of includes housing costs in the 'basket' of goods and services on
which it is based.
So to give another slant on the issue, I've reworked the chiefs' average
buying-power using a different set of indices compiled by P-E International.
Here's the alternative ranking that results:

That should cheer up the Swiss a little, besides deterring the Germans from
crowing too much.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WORK of urban development corporations has proved expensive and has not
had much impact on inner-city communities, says a report published today.
The study, prepared for the Baring Foundation and the Joseph Rowntree
Charitable Trust, says the government has failed to give the corporations a
clear remit about their responsibilities to local communities, leaving each
corporation to decide for itself. The report singles out the corporations'
emphasis on property regeneration for criticism. The government, which funds
the corporations, should clarify their objectives, it adds.
The report says the government has been ambivalent about the corporations'
role in helping to create jobs.
It includes a mid-term analysis of the performance of the Tyne &amp; Wear and
Teesside development corporations, which it says have together spent more
than Pounds 300m in the past five years, becoming big operators in the
business of reconstruction.
But the report, by Durham University's department of sociology and social
policy, describes the performance of the two corporations in job creation as
disappointing.
It recommends that corporations should be less secretive and set up systems
to monitor community benefit. It predicts the government will conclude that
corporations turned out to be 'an expensive experiment with a high
cost-per-job and poorly targeted benefits'.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Jordan raps union 'barons': AEEU chief urges one member, one
vote for Labour party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL JORDAN, president of the AEEU engineering and electrical union,
yesterday accused senior colleagues in other unions of being 'barons'
involved in 'a conspiracy to protect their privileged position' in the
Labour party by opposing the principle of one member, one vote.
He said: 'It really is time that certain union barons started to look at the
real interests of the Labour party rather than trying to protect privileges
that have had their day.'
Mr Jordan added that the time had come to introduce a system of one member,
one vote and replace the current system, which gave trade union block votes
a powerful voice in selecting Labour candidates and electing the party
leader and deputy.
He said: 'Labour voters and individual party members will no longer put up
with conspiracies to defend interests. To fail to realise this is to hand a
weapon to the government.'
Mr Jordan added that Labour did not have the time to delay reform. 'It is a
nonsensical situation to have an internal wrangle inside the party over this
when we should be concentrating our energy on opposing an unpopular
government.' he said.
The AEEU leader poured scorn on the proposal by Mr John Edmonds, general
secretary of the GMBU general union, to introduce a new form of associate
membership in the Labour party to allow trade union levy payers to
participate in the election of Labour parliamentary candidates.
Mr Jordan said the registered supporter's proposal would be impractical. Mr
Gavin Laird, AEEU general secretary, said the idea was 'codswallop'.
Mr Paul Gallagher, leader of the AEEU's electrical section, said: 'We see a
fudge, a cop-out. The individual party members are being treated in an
insulting way by being told 'you cannot have a decisive say in electing
Labour candidates'.'
But the AEEU criticism seems unlikely to make much difference to the outcome
at this autumn's party conference, where trade union block vote opposition
to the introduction of one member, one vote seems likely to carry the day.

FT  12 MAY 93 / E Midlands confident on sales outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING output in the east Midlands remains sluggish, but business
confidence in the region is high.
These are the mixed findings of the latest regional business survey
conducted by Price Waterhouse, the accountants, and Nottingham Business
School, which is published today.
The survey, covering 973 companies, the vast majority of which employ fewer
than 200 people, notes that 66 per cent of companies across all sectors
predict an increase in sales over the next six months.
But the survey says 'manufacturing volumes show few signs of increasing with
only 27 per cent of businesses reporting that current utilisation of
capacity is above 90 per cent.' Six months ago, when the last survey was
published, the proportion was 29 per cent.
Economic recovery is signalled by a number of findings, however. For 39 per
cent of companies order books are fatter than in spring last year. Stock
turnover has started to speed up for 29 per cent of companies, compared with
24 per cent six months ago, and 39 per cent of businesses reported increased
profitability.
Yet companies expect the programme of pit closures in the Midlands to hold
back consumer spending and increase unemployment.
Reflecting the national experience, the speed of increase in the number of
unemployed people has slowed. Twenty-eight per cent of companies expect to
enlarge their workforce in the next half-year.
The balance in the labour market remains in favour of employers. More than
half the wage awards in the past six months have been less than 2.5 per
cent. Only 9 per cent of awards exceeded 5 per cent.

FT  12 MAY 93 / 'Green' project at Consett steel site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS WERE unveiled yesterday for the Pounds 100m transformation of the
former Consett steelworks site in County Durham into environmentally
friendly parkland, comprising 1m sq ft of industrial and commercial
premises, houses and leisure amenities amid woodland and open space.
The 700-acre hilltop site has stood empty since the works closed in 1980,
costing Consett its final 3,600 steelmaking jobs and turning the town into a
symbol of the last manufacturing recession.
Yesterday, after years of preparation, Derwentside District Council
announced it had chosen Dysart Developments, developer of Newcastle's Pounds
140m Business Park, to undertake the seven-year scheme. The council hopes
Project Genesis will create 4,000 jobs and confirm Consett's new 'green'
identity.
Reclamation of the site cost Pounds 10m in government money. The council is
transferring ownership to a charitable trust, which will lease the land to
Dysart. The Pounds 100m project cost includes Pounds 13m in UK and European
Community funds with the rest coming from the private sector.

LABOUR is to demand a statement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence

up to 2,000 troops in Belize to help provide peace-keeping troops in the

Shadow defence minister Mr George Foulkes said such a move would be 'an

have been avoided 'if the government had taken our advice to suspend all the

FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords setbacks for leasehold plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR's attempts to unite his party suffered a further jolt last
night when a revolt in the House of Lords led to ministers being defeated on
a Conservative peer's amendment to the Housing and Urban Development Bill.
Peers voted by 114 to 57 in favour of an amendment tabled by Lord Cavendish
of Furness that exempts about 60 stately homes from the government's
proposals for allowing leaseholders to buy their freeholds.
Later the government accepted an amendment imposing a residency requirement
 -so at least half of leaseholders seeking to buy a freehold must have lived
in the property for 12 months or more.
Ministers suffered a further setback when a technical hitch allowed through
a Labour-backed amendment on leases for some Housing Association properties
intended for elderly and disabled people.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs revolt on fishing measure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE a revolt by Tory backbenchers the government secured a majority of
25 (283-258) in the Commons last night to defeat a Labour attempt to reject
a fish conservation measure requiring British trawlers to stay in port for a
specified number of days, Ivor Owen writes.
Five Tory backbenchers joined with opposition MPs in voting against the
government. They were Mr David Harris (St Ives), Mr Sebastian Coe (Falmouth
and Camborne) and Mr Robert Hicks (South East Cornwall), Mr David Porter
(Waveney) and Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East).
About half a dozen other Tory backbenchers, mainly Euro-sceptics angered by
the fact that the restrictions imposed on British fishermen would not apply
to French and Spanish vessels, abstained. The government was helped by the
absence of some MPs from Labour and the smaller parties.
Mr David Curry, the fisheries minister, said the tie-up regulations would
come into force in September and October.
He promised that no further restrictions would be imposed on British
fishermen until the government was satisfied that those in other EC
countries were meeting their conservation targets.
Mr Gavin Strang, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, attacked the
government for failing to introduce a properly funded de-commissioning
scheme.
Senior Tory backbenchers will today renew calls for extra help for the
shipping industry.
Sir Giles Shaw, a member of the executive of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs,
has proposed a change to the Finance Bill to give the shipping industry 100
per cent first-year capital allowances.

government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Patten's Commons announcement yesterday of sweeping changes in
national curriculum tests slows down the timetable for implementing them,
but does nothing about the politically more heated topic of the tests for
1993.
National curriculum tests are being introduced in phases, and are now in
their third year in primary schools. Some tests, including those in Welsh
for 11-year-olds, were not planned to start until 1998, according to the
original timetable adopted by the Schools Examinations and Assessment
Council.
The tests had not been interrupted by industrial action until this year,
when they were first made compulsory in secondary schools. Tests for some
seven-year-olds involving continuous assessment will already be almost
complete.
Mr Patten had already launched a subject-by-subject review under Sir Ron
Dearing, the chairman of the the Schools Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, a new body which will govern both the content of the curriculum,
and the testing arrangements. Sir Ron's review is due to report in July, and
his recommendations could be implemented in time for next year.
Rather than wait for Sir Ron, however, Mr Patten has announced changes that
will result in some tests, such as those for 14-year-olds in technology,
taking place this year, but then being withdrawn in 1994. The same applies
to the assessments of seven-year-olds in history, and geography.
Tests for 11-year-olds, to have been made compulsory next year following a
pilot in 2 per cent of schools this year, are now to continue on a pilot
basis for another year.
His decision that tests for seven-year-olds would be restricted to the
'basics', and that the tests as a whole should be 'streamlined' are both
directly in line with recommendations made to Sir Ron last week in a
document jointly submitted by all six teachers' unions, and a group of
representatives of independent schools.
Teachers also welcomed the restriction of the core curriculum at the age of
14 to only three subjects, and his decision to look at using external
examiners for 11- and 14-year-olds. Both moves might help to reduce
workloads.
However, the basic principles of the national curriculum remain untouched.
Children are still expected to be assessed at four key stages - at seven,
11, 14 and 16, and at each key stage they will be separated into 10 levels,
using assessments.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten wins the gentle pat of
approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO gentle pats on the shoulder that Mr John Major gave the education
secretary during Commons' questions yesterday were an expression of
solidarity in the face of adversity, rather than of affection.
Once again, the government was in trouble.
Mr John Patten's emergency statement on schools' testing was the latest
expression of the shock pervading Tory ranks since last Thursday's
elections. Mr Patten rattled furiously through his prepared text, his voice
raised almost to a rant.
The government publicity machine moved to quash suggestions of panic. Mr
Patten had submitted a paper to colleagues last week, Downing Street said.
Yesterday's ad hoc ministerial committee on education reforms had long been
in the diary.
But there could be no denying that the Commons' statement had been brought
forward amid speculation at Westminster that the government was to
capitulate on this year's schools testing as a result of Mr Major's
determination to 'listen more'.
In fact, the trick was to offer concessions for 1994. Last night Mr Patten
appeared to have diffused the concerns of backbench Conservative MPs. The
cost had been the damage to his reputation caused by the impression of
Downing Street forcing him to act swiftly to quell a brewing storm.
For Mr Major the retreat added to the sense of floundering that has gripped
the Conservative party this week, drowning appeals for unity. Only hours
earlier the government's majority had been cut to 10 over the Budget
imposition of VAT on gas and electricity.
Two conflicting themes prevail: that the government has to be attuned to the
aspirations and perceptions of electors, but also needs to show the smack of
firm government. There is no agreement on how that should be translated on
individual issues.
Reaction of Tories to Mr Patten's statement suggested that some rallying
around the government had started. Attacks on industrial action by teacher's
unions was a point of common agreement. The education secretary's deliverly
slowed as he started to win plaudits from the Conservative backbenchers, his
characteristic cocky self-confidence resurfacing.
Sir Malcolm Thornton, chairman of the Commons' education select committee
and the most vociferous Tory critic of Mr Patten, said the package went, 'a
very substantial way' towards meeting legitimate criticisms of the tests.
There was 'no possible justification whatsoever' for disruption by teachers
unions, he said.
Privately criticism of Mr Patten by Tory MPs for boxing himself into an
unnecessarily fierce confrontation with parents and teachers was tinged with
some sympathy.
'It is not John Patten who has lost his nerve. Its the cowards in the
party,' complained one right-wing minister.
In contrast to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, there is less of a feeling
that Mr Patten's credibility at Westminster had been undermined to the
extent that his job is in question.
But there was still talk that Mr Patten could also be moved in a July
reshuffle.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major refuses to confirm Lamont's
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION ABOUT a summer cabinet reshuffle gathered fresh momentum
yesterday when Mr John Major refused to confirm that chancellor Norman
Lamont would present this year's second Budget.
Challenged repeatedly by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major
responded aggressively but stopped short of the requested assurance.
While it would be virtually unprecedented for a prime minister to comment on
possible cabinet changes in the way demanded, Mr Major's refusal to be drawn
reinforced expectations at Westminster that Mr Lamont will be moved in a
July reshuffle.
Coming in the wake of Monday night's embarrassing backbench revolt over the
imposition of VAT on domestic fuel bills, the prime minister's remarks added
to the impression of a government in disarray after last week's disastrous
Conservative performance in elections across the country.
His remarks contrasted sharply with the vote of confidence he offered Mr
John Patten, the beleaguered education secretary, behind whom he said he
stood 'four-square'.
At the very least they indicated Mr Major was keeping all his options open.
Arriving in the chamber to now customary Labour shouts of 'Resign],' Mr
Major was immediately challenged by Mr Smith, who asked: 'Can you tell us if
the Budget in November will be presented by the present chancellor?'
Mr Major retorted by branding the question 'a hoary old chestnut' and saying
he had 'not yet even begun to contemplate cabinet changes'.
He went on to praise Mr Lamont while avoiding giving a direct answer to Mr
Smith's question.
The chancellor's was 'an excellent record' that people would recognise long
after Mr Smith's 'undignified sniping' had been forgotten.
When Mr Smith repeated his question, asking for a simple 'yes or no' answer,
the prime minister responded more aggressively, referring to last week's
Labour mix-up over an article published in the leftwing Tribune newspaper by
Lord Desai, the party's economics spokesman in the Lords.
The Conservatives have plunged to their lowest poll rating for seven years
according to an ICM poll in today's Guardian.
The findings (with last month in brackets) are: Labour 43 per cent (46),
Conservatives 29 per cent (34), Liberal Democrats 23 per cent (15). The
figures do not add up to 100% because of supporters of other parties not
recorded.
ICM interviewed 1,458 voters last Friday and Saturday.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour leader ready to press on
electoral reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour party leader, is preparing to tell his party that
it should back the principle of changing Britain's electoral system -
provided reform is supported in a national referendum.
He is working on a plan intended to rally the camps opposed to and
supporting electoral reform, while leaving Labour, after its autumn
conference, with a clear statement on how it would act in government.
Deep internal divisions over electoral reform will be highlighted today when
Labour MPs debate the report of the party's electoral reform commission
under Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton University.
Mr Smith will set out his thinking at next Wednesday's meeting of Labour's
ruling National Executive Committee. The party leader is also ready for a
confrontation with trade union bosses.
In spite of opposition from many trade unions, Mr Smith wants this year's
conference to end their role in the selection of Labour parliamentary
candidates - although he may agree to defer a debate on the mechanics of how
the party leader is elected.
Mr Smith has told colleagues privately that he might consider breaking links
competely with the trade unions if a compromise cannot be reached.
Such threats are likely to be regarded as posturing but Mr Smith sees some
merit in the argument that a clash with unions could help improve Labour's
image.
Proposals that Labour should embrace electoral reform have already angered
the substantial section of the Labour party - including Mrs Margaret
Beckett, deputy Labour leader - that wants no change from the current
first-past-the-post-system for electing MPs.
The Plant commission recommended a French-style 'supplementary vote' system,
regarded as a compromise by supporters of proportional representation.
Mr Smith is cautious about reform but is understood have to have accepted
the case for change - although the extent to which he will back the Plant
report's conclusions is unclear.
He is expected to reject calling for a Royal Commission to consider
electoral reform that would have delayed any decisions.
Instead, Mr Smith will aim to appease supporters of first-past-the-post by
stressing that no change would be made until after at least one referendum.
Mr Smith is seriously considering a scheme proposed by Charter 88, the
constitutional reform movement, to the Plant Commission and based on a New
Zealand model.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown calls for 'new standards' in
industry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, yesterday called for 'new standards'
in industry after compiling a survey showing boardroom executives taking pay
rises of up to 212 per cent, with golden handshakes and share option awards.
'Banks, building societies, insurance companies and companies close to the
Tory party are all responsible for pay awards that cannot be justified on
economic grounds and in some cases where profits are falling,' he said.
'Continued silence from government ministers is not acceptable - it is time
for ministers to call for new standards.'

FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers resist oil tax pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN DORRELL, fin-ancial secretary to the Treasury, last night
underlined the government's determination to hold to the changes in
petroleum revenue tax announced in the Budget.
He insisted that the likely impact of the new regime had been carefully
examined before its introduction and provision made for up to Pounds 200m to
be available in the current financial year for any transitional relief that
was required.
The government secured a majority of 36 (289-253) to defeat a Labour
amendment to the Finance Bill designed to provide more wide ranging
transitional relief.
An amendment moved by Mr Alex Salmond for the Scottish Nationalists with a
similar objective was defeated by a government majority of 37 (287-250).
Mr Alistair Darling, a Labour treasury spokesman, accused Mr Dorrell of
failing to take into account that at least 10,000 jobs would be lost as a
result of the changes. He warned of the danger that the new regime would
result in exploration work being exported from potential oil fields in the
north sea to other parts of the world.
Sun Oil, the UK arm of the Philadelphia-based energy company, yesterday sold
a package of 10 North Sea exploration blocks to Amoco. The move effectively
takes Sun out of North Sea exploration although the company retains some
producing assets.
Sun said the move was not connected to the government's oil tax PRT changes,
but that its parent company had decided to reduce its exploration
expenditure.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs demand shipping support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY backbenchers will turn up the heat on ministers over a further issue
today, as senior Conservatives renew calls for extra help for the shipping
industry.
Sir Giles Shaw, a former trade minister and member of the powerful executive
of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, has proposed a change to the Finance Bill
to give the shipping industry 100 per cent first-year capital allowances.
Other senior Tories have backed his amendment. The opposition is expected to
support it at the debate tonight. On Monday a backbench rebellion over the
plans to extend Value Added Tax to domestic fuel cut the government's
Commons majority to just 10.
Today's move is the latest in a long series of Tory backbench campaigns to
try to persuade the government to assist the shipping industry.
The MPs are still finalising their tactics. If they do not press the matter
tonight then one option is to return to the issue at the next detailed
discussion of the Budget legislation later in the summer.
One rebel said yesterday: 'If people of our sort of calibre tell ministers
to take it seriously, then they've got to take it seriously, and I shall be
astonished if they don't'
But Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury economic secretary, is expected to stick
to the previous government line, saying ministers still believe it would be
difficult to justify the tax break. The last attempt to win tax concessions
for the shipping industry came in the 1991 Budget process when more than 100
Tory MPs supported the proposals but failed to obtain an effective vote.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Renewed demands for oil tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMANDS from the opposition benches for transitional relief for companies
adversely affected by changes in petroleum revenue tax announced in the
Budget were supported by Mr Roger Knapman (C Stroud) in the Commons last
night, Ivor Owen writes.
He stressed that the supply sector of the oil exploration industry needed
time to adjust to the new tax regime through the provision of a 'meaningful
transitional arrangement'.
Mr Knapman, speaking during the resumed committee stage of the Finance Bill,
suggested that it should be possible to devise a 'fiscally neutral' scheme.
Earlier Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, defended
the decision of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, not to consult the
industry in advance about the changes.
Mr Alistair Darling, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, said the
disruption caused to the industry by the chancellor's sudden announcement
could result in the loss of between 10,000 and 30,000 jobs.
He accepted that there was scope for adjusting petroleum revenue tax, and
possibly for limiting the allowances that could be claimed in connection
with exploration, providing the changes were phased in and permitted
transitional relief.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, for the Liberal Democrats, said his party would support a
Labour amendment to provide transitional relief.
Sun Oil, the UK arm of the Philadelphia-based energy company, yesterday sold
a package of 10 North Sea exploration blocks to Amoco. The move effectively
takes Sun out of North Sea exploration although the company retains some
producing assets.
Sun said the move was not connected to the government's oil tax changes, but
that its parent company had decided last September to reduce its exploration
expenditure.

FT  12 MAY 93 / MPs and OFT to attack CD prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MUSIC industry will today suffer the first of two expected attacks when
the Commons national heritage committee publishes a report criticising the
high price of compact discs.
The committee report, out this morning, is expected to be followed within a
few days by a recommendation from the Office of Fair Trading that the
industry's pricing policies be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Both the committee and the OFT are expected to concentrate on restrictions
on 'parallel imports'. The restrictions, set out in the Copyright, Designs
and Patents Act of 1988, permit copyright holders to control the import of
works.
The committee and the OFT have asked why CDs are cheaper in the US than the
UK and whether freer trade might result in lower prices for British
consumers.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, told the committee
last month that he had decided to examine CD prices in spite of the finding
by Sir Gordon Borrie, his predecessor, that there were no grounds for an MMC
inquiry. Sir Bryan told the committee: 'There is enough information there to
make me concerned about the situation.'
Music companies are resigned to a monopoly reference. They believe, however,
that they will be able to persuade the commission that parallel import
restrictions are essential to the health of UK music. They say cheap CD
imports would undermine the UK industry and deprive it of the profits
necessary for investment in new talent.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Timetable for N-waste store is 'unrealistic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIMETABLE for opening an underground store for nuclear waste at
Sellafield in Cumbria was attacked as unrealistic by a government advisory
committee yesterday.
The radioactive waste management advisory committee's 13th annual report,
published yesterday, said that 'disposal of radioactive waste is very
unlikely to take place in the repository any earlier than 2010', more than
three years after the target date.
The vast underground caverns, to be constructed by UK Nirex, the nuclear
industry's waste-disposal company, are intended to take up to 2m cubic
metres of low- and medium-level waste from the UK's Magnox nuclear reactors
and from British Nuclear Fuels' Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield - if
the controversial plant is approved.
The committee yesterday warned it might be difficult to find 'unequivocal
evidence' of the proposed store's environmental safety because of the
complexity of the geology and underground water flows near Sellafield.
Nirex said yesterday: 'We have set a target that we believe is technically
feasible, but it is conditional on factors not under our control, in-cluding
ground conditions'.
It added: 'We agree that the geological suitability of Sellafield is open to
question. That is why we are spending such a lot of time and money
investigating it.'
Professor John Knill, the committee's chairman, repeated the committee's
belief that there were 'no compelling waste management reasons' for a
reprocessing plant such as Thorp. He questioned whether BNF's proposed
policy of 'radioactive substitution' at Thorp would be environmentally
neutral, as BNF claimed.
BNF has reached informal agreements with Thorp's foreign customers to store
permanently the low and medium-level waste from reprocessing their fuel, but
to send back a 'radiological equivalent' of high-level waste. The pact is
intended to reduce transportation costs.
Prof Knill said: 'The full range of tests to prove that substitution is
environmentally neutral has not been carried out - at least, we have asked
for these tests but have not seen them.' Because different types of waste
had different rates of decay substitution that was neutral at one time might
not be at another, he said.
BNF said yesterday it regarded substitution as environmentally neutral and
had provided the committee with all the data it had requested.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Student loans repayment shift offers Pounds 4bn bonus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STUDENT LOANS should be repaid using a supplement to national insurance
contributions, a report by the London School of Economics says.
Dr Nick Barr and Professor Howard Glennerster of the LSE said this could
release more than Pounds 4bn a year for reinvestment in higher education and
attract investment from institutional investors.
They estimated that defaults in overseas schemes similar to the UK's new
system reached more than 10 per cent. Repayment in the UK was slowed by the
rule that former students did not have to start repaying the loan until
their earnings reached 85 per cent of the national average.
Linking to national insurance contributions would reduce defaults and would
mean that more students were obliged to make repayments, as the level of
national insurance non-payments was very low.
The LSE also suggests charging a real interest rate on the loans, which are
now linked to inflation, and a government guarantee of 15 per cent of the
borrowing. It thinks this would be sufficient to attract institutional
investors. It would also add a 'user charge' of 1 per cent of taxable
income, to be paid by employers of graduates.
Dr Barr said: 'If students could borrow from the private sector the public
expenditure savings would be immediate. Assuming full take-up, 1.5 per cent
real earnings growth, and the loan paying a 2 per cent real interest rate,
the combined annual yield from the loan scheme and the employer use charge
would be Pounds 4.2bn.'
English universities could save at least Pounds 30m a year by improving
their purchasing systems, the National Audit Office says in a report
published today.
It says more computerised purchasing systems and coding schemes should be
introduced, with better management controls.
The report says, however, that the savings could not be achieved 'by a
single-step change, but only through a continuous improvement as a
consequence of a deliberate migration towards more professional purchasing
and practice'.
Sir John Bourn, head of the audit office, said purchasing had improved in
recent years, although there was still room for improvement.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Surge in private renting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH EVIDENCE has emerged of growth in the private-rented housing sector,
reversing a decline which has been virtually uninterrupted since 1900.
Lettings by members of the Association of Residential Letting Agents
increased last year by an average of 13 per cent for each letting agent,
says a survey published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the
social research organisation. Lettings were up 21 per cent In inner London.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, welcomed the increase in private
renting. He said it confirmed surveys which showed that deregulation of
private renting had halted '75 years of decline'.
The survey also indicated, however, that the revival of private renting
might be shortlived. About one-in-five new lettings is owned by a homeowner
who is unable or unwilling to sell their home during the slump in housing
prices.
Mr Richard Best, the foundation's director, warned that many of these homes
would be sold if house prices started to rise again. 'The numbers of
lettings could fall again unless the government provides incentives,' he
said.
The survey found that the rates of return that landlords earn on their
investment varied between 6.1 per cent and 7.2 per cent, net of management
and maintenance costs. Members of the Association of Residential Letting
Agents believe that net returns need to be above 10 per cent to expand the
sector.
The best incentive for private landlords, according to association members,
would be to exempt rental income from income tax. The survey says this might
be enough to attract new investment to the sector at present rent levels.
Sir George repeated last week's commitment by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, to further action to make investment in private renting more
attractive. Yet he appeared to rule out a successor to the Business
Expansion Scheme, which offered tax relief on property investments and which
is due to end in December.
The minister said the aim was to encourage 'respectable institutional funds'
to invest long-term in the sector, as well as to encourage the return of the
private landlord. He was discussing proposals which would allow institutions
to invest in residential property through some sort of intermediary, such as
an investment trust. This would enable them to divorce themselves from the
direct ownership and management of such homes.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Telecoms group to start City service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of London's streets are about to be dug up by a new
telecommunications company laying its own network. It expects to offer local
services to rival BT and Mercury by the autumn.
City of London Telecommunications (Colt) has been granted a government
licence to build and operate its own fixed-wire London network within the
M25.
It is only the second company to be granted a licence as a public
telecommunications operator since the government opened the telephone-call
market to new entrants two years ago.
Colt, an offshoot of Fidelity, a US investment management company which has
several telecoms concerns in America, intends to spend 'tens of millions' in
the next few months on the first stages of constructing its own fibre-optic
network.
It will initially concentrate on the City, with construction starting in the
Fleet Street and Bishopsgate areas.
It hopes to offer private-network services in the City by October. It also
intends to offer leased-line and other services, some in conjunction with
new line resale companies, to provide a national and international
'one-stop' facility.
Mr Paul Chisholm, Colt's managing director and a former account manager at
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the leading US telecoms group, said he
planned to compete on price and quality.
Mr Edward Leigh, the technology minister, said that Colt would 'increase the
range of choice available to customers in the key financial and business
centre of the City of London'.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Car sales 'may be below 1980s levels until next century'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR SALES in Britain will not bounce back to the 1980s boom levels until the
next century, a report issued yesterday by the Henley Centre for Forecasting
says.
Although the number of drivers is expected to grow customers' attitudes to
car purchases have changed significantly during the recession. The report
says drivers are now accepting lower status or second-hand cars, and waiting
15 per cent longer before buying a new car.
'Customers are cannier now,' said Mr Jon Francis, of the Henley Institute,
which carried out the study for the car retailing and leasing company Lex
Service.
He said that in addition to the impact of the recession, improvements in car
manufacturing had allowed drivers to use their cars for longer.
The report predicts that car sales will increase by 10 per cent this year
and grow from 1.59m in 1992 to more than 2m by 1997 - about 250,000 below
the 1989 level.
Barring any significant tax changes, the company car market is expected to
grow by 27 per cent in the next five years, with a 3 per cent fall in the
number of sales representatives but growth in the proportion of skilled
managers.
At the same time the proportion of women company drivers is expected to grow
by 9 per cent to 37 per cent by 2000, prompting shifts in marketing and
servicing styles.
The report predicts that Britain's drivers will own an extra 1.4m cars by
1994, as increasing numbers of people pass their driving tests and car-based
jobs become more prevalent.
But the report also notes, that with customers expected to buy more
second-hand cars, prices in the used-car market could fluctuate rapidly  -
although the late 1980s boom has created a glut of four-to-six-year-old
cars, the recession has also sharply reduced the number of
one-to-three-year-old cars available.
The report adds that customers will increasingly prefer to use 'brand' name
outlets to service their cars.
It says customers have been increasingly spurning the type of 'high status'
cars that were popular during the boom of the late 1980s.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Snub for coal pension plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has signalled that it will reject a proposal from the trustees
of its staff superannuation scheme that part of a Pounds 1bn surplus should
be used to guarantee inflation-linked annual pension increases.
British Coal said that it had not yet given a formal response to the
proposals and had no timetable for doing so.
The trustees, who include representatives of both management and staff, sent
British Coal proposals in January to allocate half the surplus to scheme
members in accordance with the trust deed. Trustees said the scheme actuary
estimated that guaranteed index-linking would use up only Pounds 130m of an
estimated Pounds 1.017bn surplus as at 1992.
Pensions have been increased in line with inflation in recent years, but
future index-linking is not guaranteed. It is believed that there are
concerns about the ability to sell parts of British Coal if employers have
to provide index-linked pensions.
Guaranteeing inflation now will also leave the government with few
incentives to offer the trustees in exchange for their agreement to
surrender part of the scheme's assets. A similar plan has been proposed for
the British Rail pension scheme post-after privatisation.
Coal scheme trustees yesterday testified before the parliamentary select
committee on social security on their preferred method of running the
schemes after the disposal.
Sir Norman Siddell, chairman of the staff superannua tion scheme, said the
trustees would like to see the scheme split in two - with one pool of assets
dedicated to current and deferred pensioners, and another of assets
dedicated to those who remain employed.
The trustees said they would meet Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, next
week to seek assurances that there would be no worsening of benefits after
privatisation, that no future employer should be able to tap the pension
funds, and that new employers should be prohibited from transferring other
employees into the scheme.
MPs yesterday questioned the trustees about their dispute with British Coal
over the company's refusal to make a Pounds 104m payment into the scheme on
April 5.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Profit from sale of bank denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE in May 1991 of Impexbank, the trade finance bank in Istanbul which
Mr Asil Nadir used to own, did not give him a 'single penny', Mr Nadir
claimed yesterday, John Murray Brown writes. Mr Nadir's personal creditors
say the sale was in breach of an agreement by Mr Nadir.
In 1989, the last financial year before the sale, Impexbank reported profits
of TL3.6bn and assets of TL255.6bn.
Behind the present row is a battle between Mr Nadir and Mr Bulent Semiler,
also a native of northern Cyprus and an adviser to former Turkish president
Turgut Ozal, who died last month.
Mr Semiler has said the Eliyesil family, the current owners, paid Dollars
8.9m in full for the bank which Mr Nadir bought in 1988, and that Mr Nadir
was paid Dollars 4.9m immediately. A due diligence test after the sale
established the value of the bank at Dollars 6.9m
Mr Semiler is senior director of Impexbank, and through marriage is
connected with the Eliyesil family. He was also one of the main figures
behind the rescue attempt for Polly Peck International before it was put
into administration.
Mr Nadir said yesterday: 'I don't know what the situation is now. I've not
had the time to look after anything but I intend to.' He added that he
planned to travel to Turkey soon to reclaim his business assets. He
indicated he would dispute 'vigorously and totally' that and other sales of
his Turkish assets.

FT  12 MAY 93 / BA seeks to assure workers on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is telling its 45,000 UK employees that it will do
everything it can to safeguard their jobs.
However, it warns that it will continue cutting costs as the only
alternative to closure or disposal of loss-making UK operations.
The move follows the airline's concern that it may face mounting industrial
action.
It believes union positions are hardening over its globalisation strategy
and its efforts to create low-cost subsidiaries for its UK regional services
and the Gatwick-based European operations it acquired from Dan-Air last
year.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, said in Mexico City
yesterday that BA was not seeking to reduce employment nor cut staff pay.
'We are doing the opposite. We are enlarging and growing the company and
using the benefit of globalisation to ensure we achieve this.'
He said BA's growth strategy had seen UK employment rise from 37,000 to
nearly 49,000 during the past 10 years.
In a letter to all BA managers yesterday, Mr Ayling said: 'It is not our
intention to seek any reduction or deterioration in pay or conditions of
employment, except in the wholly exceptional circumstances where this is the
only alternative to closure or disposal of parts of BA which are making
unsustainable losses.'
This was the case with the UK regional operation and the Dan-Air business
He acknowledged that the globalisation strategy had created uncertainties
among staff.
Mr Ayling said: 'I wish everyone to know that we will do everything we can
in the years immediately ahead to ensure that the number of people employed
by British Airways in this country is not diminished.'
BA is facing industrial action from pilots, cabin crews and ground staff.
The unions fear BA's strategy could be the start of a broader policy to
reduce pay and conditions throughout the company.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Tireless campaigner for investment trusts: Obituary of
Philip Chappell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIP CHAPPELL, one of the pillars of the British investment trust
industry, died last week at the age of 63 after a long illness.
Chappell's diverse interests led him through a career in which he was at one
time a director of City merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, the chairman of the
National Ports Council and the chairman of the Economic Development Council
for the Food and Drink Manufacturing Industry.
But most recently he made his name as the intellectual architect of the
government's personal pensions legislation with a paper written jointly with
Lord Vinson in 1984.
He argued strongly for the right of the individual to control his or her own
pension, irritating Britain's powerful occupational pensions industry in the
process.
'He had unassailable integrity and absolutely believed in the personal
ownership of pensions. He would rarely concede the political need to bend
and trim his opinions,' said Mr Philip Warland, the chairman of the
Association of Investment and Unit Trusts, a trade organisation with
occasionally rival interests to those of the Association of Investment Trust
Companies, the trade association for which Chappell was special adviser.
In his role as a tireless campaigner for the virtues of investment trusts,
Chappell saw the assets of investment trusts soar. Savings schemes took
nearly Pounds 120m in each of the past two years, compared with less than
Pounds 1m in 1985, before he became their adviser.
As an adviser to the Parliamentary committee on social security Chappell was
influential in persuading legislators that individual ownership of pension
rights was a goal to be pursued.
But in other areas Chappell was not as successful. In 1980-81 he served as
chairman of the troubled computer group ICL, a move which former associates
say called into question his skills as a financier.
While the criticism may have been unfair, it was believed to have been a
factor in 1985 when, after 21 years as a director at Morgan Grenfell, he was
dismissed by its chairman Mr Christopher Reeves.
Chappell is survived by his wife and four children.

FT  12 MAY 93 / DTI 'ignored' military warnings on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR MILITARY advisers warned that the export of machine tools by British
exporters was contributing to a big build-up of Iraq's defence capability,
but had their advice ignored by the Department of Trade and Industry and
other government officials, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday.
Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Glazebrook, a retired army officer who was a
member of a Ministry of Defence working group that was supposed to vet
export licences to Iraq, said that concern about British exports had
deepened substantially after February 1989.
By then the group had been told of a secret government decision to relax the
rules banning the sale of defence-related equipment to Iraq - which was
withheld from parliament.
According to Lt-Col Glazebrook this led in to sensitive export licences
being allowed to accumulate and then to be approved virtually without
restrictions by the DTI, which overruled the advice of some MoD officials.
Lt-Col Glazebrook said his concern and that of other military advisers in
the MoD working group 'crystallised' in June 1989 after the group suspected
that a number of machine-tool export licence applications had military uses.
'The more applications were uncovered the more I realised that this was a
can of worms and that there really was a lot happening,' Lt-Col Glazebrook
said.
This concern was the subject of a detailed memorandum written by Lt- Col
Glazebrook that was among the documents the government tried to suppress 'in
the national interest' during the trial of three former directors of
Matrix-Churchill, the Coventry-based machine tools manufacturer.
The trial collapsed before the document titled 'British Assistance to the
Emerging Iraqi Arms Industry' was used in court.
But yesterday it was read virtually in full by the counsel for the inquiry,
Miss Presley Baxendale QC, as an important part of the evidence Lord Justice
Scott is accumulating about the extent to which the government may have
breached its own original guidelines governing defence exports to Iraq.
The Scott inquiry team has set itself the task of re-examining the
legitimacy of ministers' use of public-interest certificates to restrict
access to information about certain government activities.
Lt-Col Glazebrook said in his evidence that his views were not shared by
some Ministry of Defence officials who wanted to promote UK defence exports.
The DTI also backed the companies, warning Lt-Col Glazebrook that the
government would risk being sued in court if certain licence applications
were revoked.
The hearing continues today.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Country home sales revive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST IN the sale and purchase of country houses revived as the recovery
in the general housing market has spread, says a survey published today in
Country Life magazine.
The market for country homes, particularly in south-east England, fell in
the late 1980s and early 1990s as recession took its toll. The magazine says
losses at Lloyd's forced families to put ancestral homes on the market.
Country Life says most of the houses advertised in the magazine have come on
the market 'because of the three Ds: death, debt and divorce'.
A study of its advertising indicates, however, that a revival may be under
way.
It says that after a slow start to the year the number of advertisements has
risen sharply in April compared with the same month last year. The rise in
advertising has continued this month and is expected to carry on in June.
Studies by the magazine indicate that there has been an increase in sales.
It says the rate of turnover of houses in Surrey is double that in the
corresponding period in 1988, when the housing market was at its peak.
Foreign buyers have rescued the market for large homes in London. Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley, the estate agents, estimated that 70 per cent of their sales
were to overseas buyers.
The magazine says lower prices mean the proportion of houses for sale at
less than Pounds 250,000 has risen to 28 per cent compared with 18 per cent
a year ago.

THE COMMERCIAL property sector is set to raise significantly more money this
year than last year, when funding fell sharply, Savills, chartered

In the first four months of this year the property sector raised Pounds
1.38bn through loans, bonds and rights issues, a similar rate to 1990 and
1991.
Figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment show the
number of new homes started by housebuilders in the UK rose 7 per cent in
January, February and March compared with the first three months of last

His daughter Ms Gonul Guney said that her father was conscious and was being

Mr Guney, 61, has not been in good health since Mr Nadir absconded. He is

The hospital said it had been instructed by the family not to comment on Mr

FT  12 MAY 93 / HSE attacks over Brussels 'red tape'
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Health and Safety Executive yesterday accused the European Community of
imposing a mass of health and safety legislation on member states without
adequate thought or consultation, Diane Summers writes.
The executive is concerned that it is becoming a focus of complaints that UK
businesses are increasingly subject to excessively bureaucratic regulation.
It is anxious to remind the government that much of the regulation and
perceived red tape originates from Brussels and not from it.
Mr John Rimington, the executive's director-general, said the directives had
been constructed in 'smoke-filled rooms in Brussels'. He blamed, in
particular, the French for trying to get the directives to reflect their own
domestic laws and said some of the provisions were 'incomprehensible'.

THE Pounds 2bn London CrossRail east-west link must be built if Britain is

Channel tunnel and Jubilee Line extension to Docklands to get the go-ahead.
'The forces of inertia can be damagingly powerful and if you delay long
enough there will always be some change in circumstances that can be used to
warrant more paper studies,' he warned.

<TEXT>
STAFF AT Warren Springs Laboratories are expected to be told today that
closure of almost all of the government research centre is likely, according
to union officials, Bronwen Maddox writes.
Mr Jim Magee, national officer of the Institution of Professional Managers
and Specialists, said last night that Mr Douglas Cormack, the laboratories
chief executive, had told officials yesterday that the 'preferred option'
was the merger of about a third of the activities with other laboratories
and the closure of the rest.
Warren Springs, which has about 265 staff, is one of the DTI's five
laboratories, and is mainly engaged on environmental and energy research.
The DTI said last night 'no firm decision' had been made.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Independent newspaper seeks funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWSPAPER Publishing plans to raise a significant amount of money to develop
The Independent and Independent on Sunday to compete in the increasingly
competitive national newspaper market.
A range of financing options will be considered so that about Pounds 10m can
be devoted to improving the titles. They include the use of internal
resources, bank borrowing and raising capital from existing shareholders and
potential investors.
Newspaper Publishing confirmed last night that its two principal
shareholders, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, have made it
clear that they are willing to increase their stakes from their current
level of more than 18 per cent each to about 25 per cent each, which would
give them effective control.
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder, expects no early bid for
Newspaper Publishing but it is clear that a bid could easily be triggered
under Stock Exchange rules if El Pais and La Repubblica increased their
stakes and were seen to be acting in concert.
Raising money to improve the titles is seen as a counter-attack by Mr
Whittam Smith following the failure to buy The Observer.
He is looking for a new trade investor - if one were found that would reduce
the extent to which the stakes of El Pais and La Repubblica would increase.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR said yesterday that the Foreign Office was responsible for the
collapse of the last-minute Turkish rescue effort that ultimately forced
Polly Peck International into administration in October 1990.
The former PPI chairman, who jumped bail to flee to northern Cyprus last
week, said a credit package from Turkish state banks was ready to be signed
when a telex message arrived from the Foreign Office.
Mr Nadir said the telex contained a 'stiffer and more crude message than
Hitler's message to Chamberlain. It was none of their business to behave in
that manner'.
Speaking for the first time about the attempt by president Turgut Ozal to
salvage the group, Mr Nadir said 'there were lots of unanswered questions'
about the role of the Foreign Office.
'I don't think you should underestimate the political aspect of all this,'
he said.
'When the Turkish government tried to help a British public company, there
should only be gratitude from Britain not a threatening telex from the
Foreign Office,' Mr Nadir said.
One other attempt to help Mr Nadir was mounted, he said. In October 1990,
just before the administration order took effect, three Turkish banks had
pledged Pounds 57.5m. Mr Nadir did not name the banks but he said that the
reply of the creditors was: 'We'll have the money and then we'll think it
over.'
The creditors refused to provide 'a sensible standstill period' to waive the
re-payments on the PPI debts, and the initiative collapsed.

'I'm waiting to be accused of the Chernobyl disaster and the famines in

'When the Turkish government tries to help a British public company there

'The difference between myself and the administrators is that I am still
innocent until proven
guilty and they have been found guilty of gross professional misconduct. I

'You know confidence in a business is everything. When confidence is removed
at a strike by malicious behaviour, how can the companies operate. The mere

FT  12 MAY 93 / HSE attacks Brussels on red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEALTH and Safety Executive yesterday accused the European Community of
imposing a mass of health and safety legislation on member states without
adequate thought or consultation.
The executive is concerned that it is becoming a focus of complaints that UK
businesses are increasingly subject to excessively bureaucratic regulation.
It is anxious to remind the government that much of the regulation and
perceived red tape originates from Brussels and not from it.
As part of an exercise initiated by Mr John Major, prime minister, the
executive has agreed to undertake a review of about 400 sets of health
regulations to see if they can be simplified or abolished.
Mr John Rimington, the executive's director-general, said the EC directives,
six of which were incorporated into UK law at the start of this year, had
been constructed in 'smoke-filled rooms in Brussels'. He blamed, in
particular, the part the French had played in trying to get the directives
to reflect their own domestic laws and said some of the provisions were
'literally incomprehensible'.
The directives - which cover issues such as visual display units, the
carrying of loads and the provision of protective clothing - could 'well
have come more slowly and been better thought out', he said.

THE BATTLE for the television screens of Britain's accountants has hotted up
with a solicitor's letter from one of the two competitors demanding that
remarks allegedly made about its financial status be withdrawn.
Accountancy Television, part of the BBC Select late night TV broadcasts, has
sent a request to Television Education Network (TEN) that it dissociate
itself from statements purportedly made by sales staff. No response has been
received.
A potential customer has written to Accountancy Television about remarks
they claim were made to them by a TEN representative. Mr Chris Bunyon,
marketing officer for TEN, confirmed the letter had been received but denied
the allegations. 'It is not our policy to defame the opposition. We are not

<TEXT>
THE US-EC agreement over Airbus came under new attack yesterday by
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, who said the 1992
pact must be strengthened when it is reviewed in July, writes Nancy Dunne in
Washington.
The congressmen, a close adviser to President Bill Clinton on trade matters,
represents a Missouri district, where thousands of McDonnell Douglas jobs
are being lost to Airbus competition. The pact permits European governments
to continue providing subsidies for aircraft development.
Mr Gephardt called on the Clinton Administration to ensure that the
agreement is not adopted by other countries in the Uruguay Round.
In a speech to the Economic Strategy Institute, Mr Gephardt defended the
Administration's 'results-oriented' trade policy toward Japan. The US must
go further, investigating the practices of Japanese companies that act as
cartels in the US.
He said he would 'work day and night' to pass a North American Free Trade
Agreement if the supplemental agreements on jobs and the environment, under
negotiation, are effective. 'I don't want us to walk away from the table in
defeat,' he insisted.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has fired a potentially explosive shot into the ongoing battle over
trade with its main trading partners by accusing them of unfair trade
practices in a report released by the government yesterday.
The report from Japan, which is often on the receiving end of criticism
about its trade practices, aims to counter a widespread perception that it
is a frequent violator of international trade rules. It highlights the
extent to which Japan's top 10 trading partners, which are members of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, also resort to unfair trade
practices.
The US, which recently identified construction, architectural and
engineering services as areas in which the Japanese government discriminates
against foreign suppliers, comes in for heavy criticism for its tendency to
take unilateral action in retaliation for what it considers unfair trade
practices. This, Japan says, is counter to the spirit of multilateral trade
forums and counter-productive.
'The US is without parallel in imposing measures that force its trading
partners to abide by unilateral judgments,' the report states. 'In our view,
the unilateral approach often only impedes the settlement of problems that
are appearing. . . in the international economy.'
'The US and the EC are both guilty in particular of misuses and abuses of
the Gatt provision on anti-dumping duties.
'In the case of the US, arbitrary calculation methods of dumping are used
which either 'create' dumping where it does not exist or magnify its scale.'
The US is also guilty of blaming dumping for injuries caused by unrelated
factors, the report states.
The EC, meanwhile, has its own peculiar practices with regard to
anti-dumping which abuse the Gatt provision. In particular, the EC
calculation of price comparisons in the home market and in the export market
inflates the dumping margin.
The report prepared by the advisory committee to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry is the most comprehensive official response
by Japan to recent criticism by its trading partners of the country's
massive trade surplus and the underlying suggestion that the surplus is due
to practices that do not conform to international rules.
The report also contains a strong rebuttal of the new US administration's
position that Japan's stubborn trade surplus can only be reduced by seeking
measurable results in opening its markets to foreign products.
A results-oriented policy not only lacks objectivity, it mistakenly links
trade imbalances directly with inadequate market access, the report states.
The report concludes that multilateral forums and internationally accepted
rules are the best way to resolve trade disputes.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE American Farm Bureau, the most consistent advocate of farm trade reform
within the Uruguay Round, is warning that the US agriculture lobby may
withdraw its support if US negotiators accept EC offers on market access for
commodities, Nancy Dunne reports.
US and EC agriculture negotiators in Washington are scheduled to start today
the final push to get agreement before G7 leaders meet in July in Tokyo.
Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the Farm Bureau, has travelled thousands of
miles during the seven years of the Round negotiations, accepting what he
says is increasingly less for the US farm sector as the EC has proved
intractable on concessions.
However, the final straw could be what Mr Kleckner calls 'padding of the
EC's tariff equivalents' under the tariffication process, which converts
quotas into tariffs.
The Dunkel draft for a final act to the Uruguay Round proposes that Gatt
countries grant increased market access of 3-5 per cent. According to Mr
Kleckner and Mr Paul Drazak, also of the Farm Bureau, the French are pushing
for a settlement which could actually reduce market access in products which
already have more than 3-5 per cent.

Motorway dispute

<TEXT>
A DECISION by the Thai government to renege on the terms of a Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 636m) elevated motorway contract for Bangkok just as the road is due
to open has angered foreign and local investors, and threatens to undermine
efforts to finance future infrastructure projects in Thailand.
Foreign and Thai banks which have committed the equivalent of Bt20bn (Pounds
513m) to Bangkok Expressway (BECL), the construction consortium led by
Kumagai Gumi of Japan, are due to meet in Hong Kong today to discuss the
increasingly bitter dispute.
The banks have suspended loan disbursements to BECL since March.
BECL consortium members and lenders accuse the Thai Rapid Transit Authority
and the Thai government of breaching the contract on a number of counts -
notably in refusing to charge the toll fees specified in the contract.
The cabinet decided unilaterally last month to impose a Bt20 toll for cars
using the expressway system, instead of the contracted Bt30 fee, because it
feared political opposition.
BECL signed the 30-year contract to build and operate the road in 1988.
The expressway dispute is regarded as a test case by bankers and foreign
investors because Thailand is expected to seek billions of dollars in
credits in the next few years for much-needed infrastructure projects.
Bangkok is probably the most traffic-congested capital in the world andthere
are three elevated railway projects worth a total of about Dollars 7bn
planned for the city .
Eleven Thai banks agreed to provide up to Bt15bn in credit facilities for
the new expressway and several of them also have equity; a group of 31
foreign banks, led by DKB Asia, LTCB Asia, Credit Lyonnais and National
Westminster, agreed to lend the equivalent of Bt5bn; and the ADB provided
Dollars 40m in long-term credit and equity.

Foreign and Thai banks which have committed the equivalent of Bt20bn (Pounds

increasingly bitter dis-pute.
The banks have suspended loan disbursements to BECL since March
BECL signed the 30-year contract to build and operate the road with the
state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (ETA) in
1988.
BECL consortium members and lenders now accuse both the ETA and the Thai
government of breaching the contract on a number of counts - in particular
by refusing to charge the toll fees for motorists clearly specified in the
contract.
The expressway dispute is regarded as a vital test-case because Thailand is
expected to seek billions of dollars in credits in the next few years for
much-needed infrastructure projects.
Bangkok is probably the most traffic-congested capital in the world there
are three elevated railway projects planned for the city worth a total of
about Dollars 7bn.
Eleven Thai banks agreed to provide up to Bt15bn in credit facilities for
the new expressway and several of them also have equity; a group of 31
foreign banks, led by DKB Asia, LTCB Asia, Credit Lyonnais and National
Westminster, agreed to lend the equivalent of Bt5bn; and the Asian
Development Bank provided Dollars 40m in long-term credit and equity.
It was regarded as a commercial 'build-operate-transfer' project - one of
the first in Thailand - and there were no government guarantees or
subsidies. Predictable cash flow as specified in the con - tract is
therefore seen as vital by the lenders and investors.
The worst blow to BECL came when the cabinet decided unilaterally last month
to impose a 20-baht toll for cars using the expressway system, instead of
the contracted 30-baht fee, apparently because it feared opposition from
Palang Dharma, one of the Bangkok-based political parties in the coalition
government.

However, the final straw could be what Mr Kleckner calls 'padding of the
EC's tariff equivalents' under the tariffication process, which converts
quotas into tariffs.
The Dunkel draft for a final act to the Uruguay Round, proposes that Gatt
countries grant increased market access of 3-5 per cent. According to Mr
Kleckner and Mr Paul Drazak, also of the Farm Bureau, the French are pushing
for a settlement which could actually reduce market access in products which
already have more than 3-5 per cent.
They say tariffs would remain the same while prices under the Common
Agriculture Policy are reduced. This would increase the percentage of the
total price covered by a tariff, increasing the price gap between EC
products and the prices of foreign com- petitors.
Other US farm groups have grown disillusioned with the Gatt talks,
particularly as it has become clear that no Administration would be able to
convince the EC to to phase out all subsidies. They say the US gets little
from the 20 per cent reduction in domestic supports already negotiated; the
proposed agreements on cuts in export subsidies and food standards will be
useful but does not inspire much enthusiasm.

FT  12 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Buying an end to Indonesia's logjam - A
tortuous route to better infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS the businessman's nightmare: news that supplies for his factory are
delayed by port congestion coincides with a power failure which shuts his
plant, resulting in a default on important orders. An overloaded telephone
network foils all attempts to contact clients. Tired and out of pocket he
heads for home, only to get stuck for hours in a traffic jam.
It is on the cards in Indonesia, south-east Asia's largest country, where
existing infrastructure creeks under pressure of the weight of rapid
industrialisation. In its 1992 country report, the World Bank estimated that
more than Dollars 70bn (Pounds 45.4bn) of investment in power,
telecommunications and transport would be needed this decade.
Many businesses have seen it as an opportunity to offer private sector
participation in infrastructure projects. Their first proposals, however,
have suffered mixed fortunes, placing in doubt forecasts that the private
sector could provide Dollars 25bn in investment before 2000.
In 1990, Trafalgar House of the UK was close to agreeing a Dollars 350m
Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) toll-road project to connect the current
motorway system of Jakarta, the capital, to the city of Bandung, 60 miles
south east.
The contract, however, was not signed. The main stumbling block was an
Indonesian law that road tariffs can only be set by presidential decree.
Although some private sector toll-roads have been constructed by Citra
Lamtoro Gung, a local company headed by President Suharto's eldest daughter,
foreign banks are reluctant to provide finance unless state controls over
tariffs are eased.
One project that looks likely to proceed with private sector participation
is the launch and operation of two telecommunication satellites. Last month,
to the surprise of some government ministers, a Dollars 128m contract for
the satellites was signed between Hughes Aircraft Company of the US and
Satelindo of Indonesia.
Satelindo is 40 per cent owned by two state enterprises and 60 per cent by
Bimagraha Telekominido, a private company headed by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo,
President Suharto's second son. Satelindo won the right to own and operate
the satellites without an open tender, angering donors who have committed
millions of dollars to the telecommunication sector.
Ministers say the deal's financing is still uncertain, although Mr B J
Habibie, the technology minister, may have used an invitation to the US Exim
Bank last week to lobby for export credits. Indonesia's state aircraft
company, IPTN, which is run by Mr Habibie, is expected to build components
comprising up to a third of the satellites' value.
Brokers say Satelindo is planning a Rp700bn (Pounds 215m) bond issue next
year and will need Rp1,460bn in financing over the next five years.
Less likely to succeed is a private proposal to enlarge Jakarta's main port
of Tanjung Priok. In 1990 the state-owned port authority looked at options
for expanding the existing container facilities, with a capacity of about
1.1m TEU (20ft equivalent units) containers, to accommodate demand of 1.5m
TEU by 1996 and 2.4m TEU by the end of the decade.
Donors say a BOT proposal was received from a consortium led by the Humpuss
Group of Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, President Suharto's youngest son, and
including Mitsui of Japan and P&amp;O of the UK. The proposal was accepted,
without resort to open tender, in June 1991.
The project, however, required the resettlement of nearly 40,000 people from
a slum area. Concern over how this would be achieved and problems in
financing the high cost of the consortium's proposal - the civil works alone
came in at Dollars 200m - have hindered progress.
Ministers say the consortium's potential financial backers have withdrawn
and an alternative project is likely to proceed under state ownership with
funds provided by international donors. Sufficient new capacity, however,
may not be installed in time to prevent shipping companies demanding
surcharges to cover delays in using Tanjung Priok.
Problems in finalising private sector deals have also hit power sector
proposals. Twelve months ago Mission Energy of the US received government
approval to build, operate and own two 600MW units of the Paiton power
complex, worth Dollars 2bn, after a two-year battle by Indonesia's Bimantara
Citra Group, also owned by Mr Trihatmodjo, to win the contract.
Bimantara Citra has since joined up with Siemens of Germany to bid, without
apparent competition, for a further two 600MW units at Paiton.
Project officials say Mission Energy currently has a 36-member negotiating
team in Jakarta and talks are at an advanced stage.
There is much resting on the negotiations. As one government official noted:
'Everybody is looking to Paiton. It will set the standards for the future.'

FT  12 MAY 93 / Brussels warns US of tax retaliation
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Christiane Scrivener, the European Community commissioner for taxation,
has warned that US companies could face retaliation if the US acts
unilaterally on tax issues in a way that discriminates against European
businesses.
Mrs Scrivener, on a visit to Washington to meet US Treasury officials and
members of Congress, issued a particular warning about unitary taxation, the
formula used in the past by California, which is the object of a
long-running lawsuit by Barclays Bank.
Under the system, companies are taxed on a proportion of their worldwide
profits calculated by the size of their payroll, sales and assets in a
state, rather than on the profits they actually make there.
The US Supreme Court is expected to decide on Friday whether it will hear
Barclays' claim against the California unitary tax system, which the British
bank argues is an unconstitutional infringement of the federal government's
prerogative to regulate international commerce.
Mrs Scrivener said yesterday that she was concerned by the possibility that,
if the Supreme Court should eventually rule against Barclays, other states
might decide to adopt the unitary taxation approach.
She said that no retaliation was currently planned by the European
Community, although the UK has already passed a law authorising retaliatory
measures.

</HEADLINE>

   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUMBLINGS in Peru's armed forces have prompted coup rumours twice in little
over two weeks, again calling into question the political stability of
President Alberto Fujimori's administration.
Army discontent is not directed at the president. On the contrary, apart
from the usual complaints about pay levels, the military, like most
Peruvians, broadly support the government's economic and counter-subversion
strategy.
But sectors of the military have grown increasingly hostile to two of Mr
Fujimori's closest collaborators: armed forces chief General Nicolas
Hermoza, and Mr Vladimiro Montesinos, the president's intelligence adviser
and confidant, who control internal armed forces promotions.
General Rodolfo Robles, who until recently ranked number three in the army
hierarchy, has alleged the two men were implicated in a paramilitary death
squad. He claims that they were directly responsible for several recent
disappearances and extra-judicial killings.
Before making his allegations late last week, Gen Robles took refuge in the
US embassy in Lima with his family, claiming their lives had been
threatened. He has since been flown to Argentina where he is continuing to
call for the removal of both Gen Hermoza and Mr Montesinos 'for the health
of the nation'.
Gen Robles, who this week was stripped of his rank, is widely respected for
his defence of human rights.
The accusations were immediately denied by the government. Mr Fujimori, in a
series of television appearances at the weekend, did his best to limit the
damage and pledged support for both aides. He said that recent successes
against guerrilla organisations proved the 'efficiency' with which Peru's
armed forces and the national intelligence service were operating.
However, the accusations are likely further to arouse international alarm.
The Clinton administration has made it clear that human rights will be the
cornerstone of future policy in Latin America.

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S supreme court announced yesterday it will rule on May 20 on
whether to send President Carlos Andres Perez for trial on corruption
charges in a case that could force him from power, Reuter reports from
Caracas.
Mr Perez and two former ministers face charges of embezzlement and misuse of
funds in the purchase of Dollars 17m (Pounds 11m) at a preferential exchange
rate and sale of the dollars in the free market for about Dollars 10m in
profit.
The government has denied the charges but declined to specify how the funds
were spent. The 70-year-old president, who has survived two coup attempts,
riots and a host of political feuds since taking office in 1989, would have
to step aside if put on trial.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Talks on restructuring Dollars 44bn commercial debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS reopened yesterday between Brazil and the full committee of its
foreign creditor banks over a deal to restructure the country's Dollars 44bn
(Pounds 28.5bn) commercial debt.
Mr Pedro Malan, Brazil's chief debt negotiator, said in an interview before
the talks that the main item on the agenda would be redrawing the balance of
debt conversion options made by the banks in February. The banks chose
heavily in favour of the par bond option, an instrument fully guaranteed for
principal and one year's interest and consequently the most expensive for
Brazil.
The banks wanted 64 per cent of the total stock of debt in that option.
Mr Malan said this has dropped to 59 per cent after concessions by big
banks, but it far exceeds the 40 per cent maximum desired by Brazil.

</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday tried to regain momentum for his economic
programme by appealing to voters in middle America to help him take on the
'powerful lobbyists' who are beginning to line up against his proposals.
But as he spoke to high school students in Chicago, the White House was
already preparing to give ground on one important element of the package,
agreeing to abandon its proposal for an investment tax credit and instead to
accept a lower increase in the corporate income tax rate than it had
originally requested.
The investment tax credit has featured in Mr Clinton's economic programme
ever since last year's election campaign, but it has never won much support
from either business or Congress.
The proposal included a permanent credit for businesses with sales of less
than Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.2m), as well as a temporary two-year credit for
larger businesses, intended to stimulate the economy in the short run and
encourage companies to create new jobs.
Together, the two credits were expected to cost Dollars 24bn over five
years, but critics said they would at best only bring forward investments
that would have been made in any case.
Businesses have generally said they would prefer a lower tax rate. The
administration, which at first had tried to replace the investment tax
credit with other business investment incentives, now seems likely to accept
a corporate tax rate of 35 to 35.5 per cent, instead of the 2 percentage
point rise to 36 per cent it had originally requested.
Mr Clinton has been caught in a cleft stick over his tax bill as the first
flush of Democratic unity behind the new president has faded.
Flexibility on points such as the investment tax credit is the necessary
price for stronger support in Congress for the overall plan, but every sign
of that flexibility only goes to encourage more members of the US Congress
to press their own private amendments.
The proposed new energy tax is a particular target for changes.
Mr Clinton, buoyed by two days outside the confines of Washington, expressed
confidence that he could still drive his legislative agenda through
Congress, with the help of renewed backing for his plan from the voters.
'All I have to do, I think, is go out here and ask them to help me sell it
because the American people want something done about the deficit. They want
something done about the economy,' Mr Clinton said.

THE FUTURE of Brazil's latest finance minister hung in the balance yesterday
as President Itamar Franco came under mounting pressure to sack him over
alleged irregularities concerning Dollars 123m (Pounds 80m) in loans to
Ecuador and Peru.
Mr Eliseu Resende, who has been at the helm of Latin America's largest
economy for just six weeks, is under fire for allegedly favouring his
long-time former employers, construction group Norberto Odebrecht, by
approving government project financing of Dollars 115m to Peru and Dollars
18m to Ecuador. The financing, which enabled Odebrecht to win various
infrastructure contracts, was approved against the recommendations of the
central bank.
Yesterday newspaper editorials, business representatives and even the
president's political allies were clamouring for Mr Resende's dismissal. Mr
Franco cancelled all his appointments and summoned Mr Resende, who has
denied any impropriety over the loans, to explain himself.
Mr Franco is in a delicate position. Assuming office after the impeachment
of President Fernando Collor on corruption charges, Mr Franco has made
honesty the hallmark of his administration and cannot afford to retain
ministers whose integrity is in doubt, particularly in the key portfolio of
finance.
However, in the last eight months Brazil has got through three finance
ministers and two central bank governors. Last Friday Ms Yeda Crusius
resigned as planning minister, complaining that she had not been consulted
over the country's economic plan.
Another change would further damage government credibility and heighten
economic instability, pushing inflation beyond its current level of 30 per
cent a month.
Mr Aldo Lorenzetti, a director of the powerful Sao Paulo Federation of
Industries (Fiesp), said: 'We can't just keep changing ministers left right
and centre'.
A change would also harm international negotiations. At the last round of
talks with the International Monetary Fund two weeks ago, Mr Michel
Camdessus, IMF managing director, said: 'It would be nice if a Brazilian
economic team stayed in place long enough for us to understand what they are
trying to do.'

FT  12 MAY 93 / Quebec nationalists fight to retain French-only law
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH-speaking nationalists in Quebec are seeking to mount a campaign
against proposed relaxations of the province's French-only language law.
Premier Robert Bourassa's Liberal government has tabled legislation which
would overturn a 15-year ban on the use of English on outdoor commercial
signs, and abolish the Commission de Protection de la Langue Francaise,
nicknamed the 'language police'.
The draft legislation, known as Bill 86, also makes modest concessions on
the use of English and other languages in education by exempting some
immigrants from attending French schools and allowing English immersion
classes at French schools.
Bilingual signs and immigrants' language rights are sensitive political
issues in Quebec. Nationalists are expected to depict the latest proposals
as further evidence of the threat to their island of French culture in
English-speaking North America. About 80 per cent of Quebec's 7m residents
are French-speaking.
The fuss over Bill 86 is not expected to have a lasting impact. The Liberals
have a large majority in the national assembly, and Mr Bourassa's popularity
is high following a successful battle against skin cancer earlier this year.
Bill 86 is likely to be on the statute book by the end of June, well ahead
of the campaign for the next provincial election, which must take place
before autumn 1994.
Meanwhile, support appears to be waning for the Bloc Quebecois, the federal
wing of the separatist Parti Quebecois. Judging by recent opinion polls, the
BQ will capture no more than 25-30 seats - and possibly fewer - in the
countrywide general election later this year.
Mr Robert Keaton, president of Alliance Quebec, which represents the
interests of the province's anglophone community, said that Bill 86 'sends a
positive message that there's a legitimate place for the English-speaking
community in Quebec.'

<TEXT>
MR Salman Rushdie, the British author, said yesterday he had received
unequivocal support from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, in his
campaign to force Iran to lift its death order over his book The Satanic
Verses.
The Indian-born writer, in hiding for over four years since the fatwa was
ordered by the late Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's spiritual leader, said the
meeting was 'probably the most important day of the campaign.'
'It will send a message around the world - to our allies and to Iran,' he
told a London press conference. 'It is very important that the British
government is now leading from the front.'
Mr Major's first meeting with Mr Rushdie, indicating a further hardening of
Britain's line, is likely to incense Tehran, which claims Mr Rushdie's book
is blasphemous.
Downing Street said yesterday Britain had great respect for Islam, but added
that the fatwa did no service to its religion.
Mr Rushdie gave no details or proposals discussed with Mr Major, saying he
had undertaken not to reveal concrete plans. Relations between Iran and
Britain were 'frosty and might get frostier any second,' he said.
Downing Street said no specific action had been decided yesterday. The prime
minister had underlined his full support for Mr Rushdie's rights as a
British citizen and expressed concern that Iran had not repudiated the
fatwa.

ANGLO-CHINESE relations briefly returned to normal yesterday when British
and Chinese officials agreed to the release of 127.8 hectares of land for
sale in the 1993-94 financial year.
Included in this year's land disposal programme is 45.59 hectares for the
Black Point power station, located in the New Territories, which is due to
come on stream in 1996. It will be fired by natural gas piped from a gas
field near Hainan Island.
The result of the meeting of the Sino-British land commission cheered the
Hong Kong stock market.
The Hang Seng Index rose 102.74 points to end the day at 6,841.97.
However, British officials cautioned against too much optimism. Although the
agreement was greeted with a measure of relief, they pointed out that China
benefited directly from Hong Kong land sales and that it had no interest in
undermining the colony's property market.
Under the terms of the 1984 joint declaration, half of the proceeds of land
sales in Hong Kong accrue to the colony's post-1997 government. A special
fund set up to manage those proceeds has accumulated revenues in excess of
HKDollars 80bn (Pounds 6.6bn).
Still left unresolved by yesterday's meeting was the future development of
the colony's container port.
Last year the land commission approved the release of land for the ninth
container terminal, but China rescinded the agreement in retaliation for
Governor Chris Patten publicising his plans for wider political
participation in the colony.

MORE THAN 200 workers, most of them women, were killed by a fire in a toy
factory on the outskirts of Bangkok on Monday night in one of the world's
worst industrial accidents.
Thai officials said hundreds more were injured and taken to hospital
suffering from burns, smoke inhalation and limbs broken from jumping from
the building's upper floors.
Many of the dead were found piled up at ground-floor exits or crushed under
a collapsed staircase.
Mr Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the Thai interior minister, said yesterday as more
bodies were unearthed from the wreckage that he was establishing a committee
to investigate the cause of the fire, the state of the factory buildings and
its manufacturing processes.
The factory was operated by Kader Industrial (Thailand), a subsidiary of
Hong Kong's Kader Holdings.
It produced stuffed and plastic toys, including Babar the Elephant and
characters from the Muppets television show.
No outside fire escapes were visible in the wreckage of the three buildings
which were destroyed, or on a surviving four-storey building where the toys
were stuffed with foam.
Workers who escaped the blaze said there had been earlier fires at the
factory. They also said supervisors told them to stay at their posts when
Monday's fire was first noticed.
The tragedy has reminded Thais of the price they sometimes pay for an
'economic miracle' based on export industries and cheap labour. Hundreds of
thousands of Thais have flocked to the Bangkok metropolis from poor rural
areas to work as labourers, maids or prostitutes.
Corruption is widespread among low-paid government officials, and
environmental and safety standards are often poorly enforced.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Japan to reaffirm UN commitment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, is expected today to deliver a
strong reaffirmation of the country's commitment to the United Nations
peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, as opposition demands for an immediate
pull-out intensified.
The Japanese government has been under extreme pressure since the killing
last week of a civilian policeman in an ambush, and Mr Miyazawa has been
advised to make an address that shows the government is both concerned about
the safety of the peacekeepers and is committed to the UN operation.
However, the National Police Agency, which has responsibility for the 75
civilian police officers sent to Cambodia, continued to argue yesterday with
the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) over the
duties given to Japanese officers.
Officials at the NPA say Japanese police, who are not carrying arms, have
been given inappropriate responsibilities such as acting as bodyguards and,
in some cases, have not been given sufficient water or provisions by the UN
authorities.
Relations between Untac and the NPA have been strained since about eight
Japanese police officers returned to Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital,
without official approval after the killing of the Japanese officer. The
police officers have since returned to their posts.
A Japanese television news programme poll of 690 people last weekend found
that 52 per cent believe the police and 600 military personnel should be
withdrawn, while 37 per cent believe they should remain in the country.
The killing of the officer has stirred debate over whether the conflict in
Cambodia now fits the five principles which supposedly govern Japanese
participation in international peacekeeping operations. One of those
principles is that a ceasefire agreement is in place, and opposition parties
say the Cambodian ceasefire has collapsed.
Meanwhile, a six-member advance party left Tokyo yesterday for Mozambique,
where 48 Japanese military personnel are due to assist in another UN
operation.
The other members of the group are due to leave before the end of this month
and will co-ordinate transport operations.
Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, yesterday suggested that China
will not be a significant military threat to the region over the next five
years, but he warned that the country's rapid economic growth could be
accompanied by an expansion of military ambitions in about 20 years' time.
In a meeting with Mr Toshio Nakayama, the director-general of Japan's
Defence Agency, the prime minister said that the US-Japan-China triangular
relationship had to remain stable to ensure that China had no incentive to
build up its military capability.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Whale sanctuary vote set for today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTROVERSIAL proposal for a whale sanctuary in the southern oceans is due
to be voted on today by the International Whaling Commission, whose members
were bitterly divided yesterday over whether the proposal has 'scientific
merit'.
French delegates, aware that an original proposal for an indefinite
sanctuary would fail, now propose that the IWC, holding its annual meeting
in Kyoto, should introduce a 50-year sanctuary which can be reviewed in
2003.
However, Japanese officials said the proposal, which needs approval from a
three-quarters majority of the 32 countries represented, was 'unscientific'
and beyond the brief of the IWC. They were confident of mustering at least
10 votes, which would be enough to defeat the proposal.
The sanctuary, which has support from the UK, the US and Australia, would
cover the area south of the 40th parallel in the waters around Antarctica.
It would apply to all whale species, though it may not necessarily include
the 'research whaling' currently conducted by Japan, which takes about 300
whales a year in the region.
Japanese officials said the IWC had estimated that there were about 760,000
minke whales in the southern oceans. One representative said Japan was
likely to receive support from a range of countries including Sweden and
Mexico.
While the IWC's scientific committee found that the population of minke
whales is large enough to allow limited catches, the committee also
condemned Japan for the harvesting of striped dolphins in its coastal
waters.
The committee advised last year that there should be an 'interim halt in all
direct catches of striped dolphins', but Japan admitted at least 1,000
striped dolphins were taken in 1992, and harvesting was continuing this
year.

MR RAY O'Connor, a former West Australian state premier, was charged
yesterday with stealing and criminal defamation as part of a state
corruption investigation, Reuter reports from Perth.
Mr O'Connor, premier in late 1982 and early 1983, was charged with one count
of stealing and two counts of criminal defamation. He was released on his
own recognisance and will appear in court on Friday when formal charges will
be read.
Police allege he stole a cheque for ADollars 25,000 (Pounds 11,300) from the
Western Australian Liberal Party in April 1984 and criminally defamed Mr
George Cash, now the Western Australian mines minister, between March and
April 1987.
If found guilty, he could face a maximum jail term of seven years.
Mr O'Connor succeeded Sir Charles Court as premier in late 1982, but his
Liberal party government was ejected from office in February 1983 by the
Labor party under Mr Brian Burke.
Mr Burke also faces criminal charges in a separate case and will stand trial
in June on four counts related to ADollars 17,000 in overseas travel
expenses.
Prosecutors allege that Mr Burke, who was later Australian ambassador to
Ireland, claimed the expenses even though the travel was paid for by the
state.
They say that he used the money to repay an overdraft.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Confidence is casualty of Sharif's fall: Pakistan's
businessmen are wary of future of reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence is emerging as one of the principle casualties of the
recent downfall of Pakistan's reformist prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif.
'It's like the train has slowed down incredibly because the driver has
left,' was how one leading banker recently summed up the mood.
Pakistan's interim government, which has promised to hold national elections
on July 14, denies that newspaper reports of large-scale withdrawals from
foreign exchange bank accounts in the country reflect a nervousness among
savers.
Signs of fatigue continue to hamper stock prices on the Karachi Stock
Exchange, the country's leading stock market. While the market has recovered
its level before Mr Sharif's dismissal, businessmen do not see this as a
sign of any larger recovery of confidence.
The uncertainty centres on the future of economic policies and the outcome
of political developments. A programme of economic reforms was at the heart
of Mr Sharif's agenda whose 29-month-long government was sacked on April 18
by Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the Pakistan president, for alleged corruption.
Mr Farooq Leghari, the new finance minister, has said all economic reforms
will remain intact and has promised to press ahead with liberalisation
policies. Many businessmen accept that Mr Sharif's reforms will not be
reversed, because that would further damage the economy. But there are fears
of a slowing down in the pace of future reforms.
Businessmen also point to macro-economic problems and political uncertainty
as well as statements from the new government that the cases of factories
privatised under Mr Sharif will be reviewed to consider allegations of
corruption.
Mr Arif Habib, president of the KSE, said: 'Whenever a government changes,
the investors have apprehensions about future policies.' He said the
short-term nature of the government which replaced Mr Sharif did not help to
ensure continuity in policies. 'Uncertainty will prevail till after the
elections,' he said.
Mr Tahiq Khaliq, president of Karachi's chamber of commerce and industry,
said: 'New commitments (from businesses) have slowed down because of
uncertainty.' He expected few changes to take place until investors saw an
elected government come to office.
Last week Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate, said it was holding back on
plans to invest up to Dollars 400m (Pounds 259.7m) in an industrial complex
in Karachi until after the elections.
On the economic front, an on-going recession in the textile sector plus a
growing budget deficit has also added to the fears. Textile stocks make up
roughly a third of the 643 companies registered on the KSE. Projections of
low profitability, especially in the spinning sector, have pushed down share
prices, leading stock brokers said.
The interim government has announced a relief package for the textile
sector, with concessions on some duties, but it is too early to say how much
of a boost this will provide. The KSE index rose nearly 10 points yesterday
as a result, brokers said.
The budgetary deficit for the fiscal year ending in June is expected to
exceed Rs100bn (Pounds 2.43bn) compared with a target of Rs65bn. Mr Leghari
recently described the deficit as 'problem number one' and appealed to
businessmen to help resolve the country's economic problems.
His task of re-establishing confidence has become more difficult with signs
of conflict between key members of the interim government over the future of
the country's four provincial assemblies.
It has raised fears that Ms Benazir Bhutto's opposition People's Democratic
Alliance may pull its ministers out of the cabinet.
Mr Mian Habibullah, president of the Federation of Pakistani Chambers of
Commerce and Industry, said he opposed any review of the previous
government's privatisation efforts, adding that 'people (businesses)
invested in good faith'.
Other businessmen said such a review would only increase investors' fears
and could make it difficult for any future government to privatise the
country's deficit-ridden public sector industries.
Many other businessmen are convinced that if the new government does not
move quickly to establish fresh confidence through fiscal incentives and
further commitments to continuity of policies, signs of fatigue may spread.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Nigeria in new bid to agree debt relief deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABUJA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERNEST Shonekan, head of Nigeria's Transitional Council, will try to
revive the quest for official debt relief when he arrives in Paris for
informal talks with the French government and the Paris Club tomorrow.
His attempt to agree a med-ium-term economic strategy with the International
Monetary Fund before he leaves office following elections in August is
threatened by a deep split over the handling of the exchange rate between
the Central Bank of Nigeria and Mr Oladele Olashore, finance minister.
The latest round of talks with an IMF and World Bank team ended in stalemate
earlier this month, when Mr Olashore offered no positive action to float the
naira or remove the domestic subsidy on petroleum products, both
pre-conditions of an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility.
Although exchange rate policy is the responsibility of Mr Abdulkadir Ahmed,
governor of the central bank, Mr Ola-shore has insisted on the need to
control the parallel market, where the naira is worth about 70 per cent less
than the official rate of N21.99 to the dollar.
The IMF is also dissatisfied by the Nigerian delegation's fiscal stance for
the first quarter of 1993, according to those close to the talks. Nigeria
has reported revenue of about N31bn (Pounds 940m) to the end of March, about
N6bn below budget projection, in spite of higher than forecast oil prices
and production levels. The Fund estimates that revenue was around N45bn for
the period and wants to see full disclosure of oil proceeds by the
state-owned Nigerian Nat-ional Petroleum Corporation.
The probable source of the discrepancy is the oil revenue which goes
directly into 'dedication accounts' to pay for large infrastructure projects
and the military campaign in Liberia. The Fund has asked for a breakdown of
expenditure and a review of existing commitments, especially projects which
contribute little to productivity or could be taken over by the private
sector.
Mr Shonekan has tried to bring the dedication accounts into the overall
budget through the fiscal co-ordination committee, which he chairs. He has
also set up a budget monitoring committee composed of experts outside
government to review fiscal performance and recommend changes in budget
allocation.
The budget committee is due to disclose its first report on Tuesday
The IMF is also looking for more action by the government to mop up excess
liquidity and suspension of additional borrowing.
Government borrowing has been the main cause of inflation, which is more
than 60 per cent a year, and has reduced the supply of foreign exchange to
the private sector.
During the first two months of 1993 the government has slowed the growth of
broad money supply, which reached 56 per cent in 1992, and aggregate credit
fell 6.5 per cent during the same period as a result of firm controls on
spending.
Mr Shonekan will be accompanied to Paris by Mr Ahmed but not by Mr Olashore,
who is attending the African Development Bank's annual meeting. Mr
Shonekan's team is running out of time if it is to achieve its goal of
setting out a shadow IMF programme which the incoming civilian regime can
follow when it takes over on August 27.

<TEXT>
THE CRISIS threatening the fragile coalition of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli
prime minister, was temporarily suspended yesterday after Mr Aryeh Deri,
interior minister and leader of the ultra-religious Shas party, agreed to
rescind his resignation from the government.
Had the resignation gone into effect all five members of the Shas party
would have pulled out of the coalition, leaving Mr Rabin with only a tiny
majority in parliament.
While the break-up of the coalition would not have brought about the
collapse of the government, it would have severely limited Mr Rabin's
flexibility and denied him the broad base of support he seeks in parliament
to push through tough decisions regarding the peace process.
The coalition crisis came to a head on Sunday when Mr Deri tended his
resignation after Mrs Shulamit Aloni, the education minister and head of the
left-wing Meretz party, refused to respond to his ultimatum that she leave
her post.
The ultimatum was issued following a series of remarks made by Mrs Aloni,
which Mr Deri and party colleagues said were offensive to the religious.
Mr Rabin yesterday proposed a temporary solution under which both interior
minister and education minister will hand over their portfolios to the prime
minister for the coming week, during which time a portfolio exchange among
government ministers will be worked out to the satisfaction of Meretz and
Shas.
If a permanent solution is not found within a week, Mr Rabin is likely to
begin seeking new partners for the coalition among other parties.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Croat forces in Bosnian onslaught
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN Croat forces yesterday ignored United Nations warnings and their own
ceasefire pledges, pressing on with their military campaign forcibly to
forge a separate state at the expense of Bosnia's Moslems.
Fighting between Croats and Moslems intensified in south-western Bosnia's
main city of Mostar, with some 60 rounds of heavy artillery falling on the
area in a one-hour period and gunfire continuing throughout the day, the UN
said.
Bosnian Croat forces are attempting to seize control of the west bank of the
Neretva River, which runs through the city, and have captured the Bosnian
army's local headquarters. Under the Bosnian Croat vision of a 'Greater
Croatia' the Neretva river would be its eastern boundary.
General Philippe Morillon, the UN peacekeeping force commander in Bosnia,
was making for Mostar last night with the commanders-in-chief of the Croat
militia and Moslem-led Bosnian government forces to try to rein in the
combatants, the UN said.
UN officials said they were concerned about Moslem civilians in the area.
According to eyewitnesses, Bosnian Croat troops marched hundreds of Moslem
civilians down a track to detention in a factory yesterday after evicting
them from their homes in Mostar. None of the detainees had any possessions.
Many walked unsteadily down the slope, clutching their loved ones and
crying, guarded by Croat soldiers in front and behind, the witnesses said.
With international attention focused on the refusal by Bosnian Serb leaders
to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan, Croats appear to be making their own
land grab. Confident that they can push on with impunity, the Croats and the
Serbs have nearly completed the carve-up of Bosnia.
Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader who takes instructions from Zagreb,
was the first to endorse the Vance-Owen plan which aims to preserve a single
Bosnian state, divided into 10 provinces.
The HVO, the military wing of the Croatian Democratic Union, the ally of
Croatia's ruling party, eagerly approved the plan because it designates as
'Croat' provinces next to Croatia.
They appear convinced that over the next few years the provinces can be
annexed to Croatian territory, even if the plan is implemented. The Croatian
dinar is already in circulation and the Croat's checkerboard flag flies in
western Hercegovina.
Mostar, badly damaged by Yugoslav army bombardments last spring, has been
designated the capital of the self-proclaimed Croat state of Herceg-Bosna.
The continued fighting has blocked off the main land route to central
Bosnia, cutting off some 1.3m people dependent for survival on humanitarian
relief convoys. The UN also reported serious shelling and heavy machine-gun
fire in the dispute Jablanica-Konjic area, 50km north-east of Mostar.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Yeltsin adopts a hard line with foes of reform: President
ousts conservatives

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday began to deliver on promises to
remove conservative barriers to his government's reform path, following his
victory in last month's referendum.
He sacked Mr Yuri Skokov, secretary of the powerful state security council,
and Mr Georgy Khizha, deputy prime minister for the military-industrial
complex - both avowed foes of radical reform
At the same time, Mr Yeltsin told a meeting of leaders from Russia' regions
they should form themselves into a constitutional assembly to adopt his
draft constitution, by-passing the Russian parliament. Mr Yeltsin had
earlier hinted at such a role for regional representatives, but this was his
clearest statement of intent.
He told the leaders, called to discuss his draft, that 'this gathering in
future should be transformed into a Council of Federation which will
subsequently become one of the chambers of the future parliament. That is
why you, and not someone else, should work on the constitution and adopt
it'.
This suggests that Mr Yeltsin is prepared to see appointed representatives
become a part of the upper house of the bicameral parliament foreshadowed in
his draft - though the constitution says the Council of the Federation
should be elected.
In choosing to use the regional leaders as a legitimising forum for the new
constitution, Mr Yeltsin is turning to a group of officials who have mixed
views about his economic and political course, but who have shown over the
past year that their support can be secured in return for concessions,
especially in the sphere of tax privileges and retention of export earnings.
However, this will add to the flow of power from the centre to the regions,
often increasing bureaucratic delays and resulting in growing separatism in
the autonomous republics.
It will also mean that the long-delayed confrontation with parliament -
which would be abolished in its present form once a constitution is deemed
to be accepted - now appears unavoidable in the near future.
However, Mr Yeltsin and the parliamentary leadership have over the past year
made a series of increasingly strained compromises to avoid such an outcome
and may - in pursuit of the presently non-existent 'national unity', be
persuaded to do so again.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker of the Russian parliament and an
outspoken opponent of Mr Yeltsin's political and economic policies, is due
to speak today in parliament on the president's draft constitution. He is
expected to reject it as tantamount to the declaration of a presidential
dictatorship.
Further changes in the cabinet and administration are forecast. Attention
now focuses on the possibility of the return to the government of Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the former prime minister. This possibility was kept alive last
night when Mr Gaidar told the Liberal daily newspaper, Izvestiya, that he
would consider such an offer were it made.
The replacement for Mr Skokov at the head of the security council - which
deals with issues of foreign affairs and even of domestic economy as well as
of security - was not named last night. However, there was speculation that
Mr Sergei Stepashin, chairman of the parliamentary defence and security
committee and himself of centrist views, would be offered the post.
The Interfax agency said that Mr Stepashin refused to confirm or deny that
he would receive such an offer.

FT  12 MAY 93 / EC pushes 'safe areas' option: The US-European row over
Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS between the European Community and the US may have reached a
turning point as both sides struggle to bridge divisions over how to end the
civil war in Bosnia.
These differences have largely been papered over, mainly because EC
governments themselves have been torn over whether to support the use of
force to halt the fighting.
Their call on Monday to the US - and Russia - to send troops to bolster the
United Nations peace-keeping force in Bosnia represents a stiffening of
opposition to US plans to arm the Bosnian Moslems. It challenges Pentagon
military doctrine - that US ground forces must be under US control and have
a clearly defined mission, preferably backed by overwhelming force. Above
all, it contradicts the US belief that the Vance-Owen plan is dead.
To be sure, the allies are still hiding behind diplomatic code that 'all
options, including military, remain open'. But this may obscure a more
subtle shift in transatlantic relations. During the Cold War, the US took
the anti-communist lead and a grateful Europe usually followed; now, a newly
formed Anglo-French alliance has taken a lead of sorts and called on the
Americans to fall into line, ironically with ground forces belonging to the
old enemy, Russia.
France and the UK are the chief contributors to the UN peace-keeping force
in Yugoslavia, with about 6,000 troops in place. Their great fear is that
the US preference for arming the Bosnian Moslems and bombing Bosnian Serb
targets would put their own forces in the line of fire, ending all pretence
of UN neutrality and most likely leading to a humiliating withdrawal.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who toured Europe last week,
was left in no doubt that to pursue plans to lift the embargo would lead to
a split in the alliance. According to a senior UK official, the British goal
was to kill at all costs the plans to arm the Bosnian Moslems.
EC officials say the US secretary of state seemed more eager to hear about
the European game-plan for ending the Bosnian conflict than pressing the US
military version.
The view that Yugoslavia is a problem for the Europeans rather than the
Americans - as was held by the Bush administration - also emerged during
last week's talks between President Bill Clinton and an EC delegation headed
by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, EC
Commission president. 'Some of the US (military) proposals seem to be
window-dressing,' said one Brussels official. So what is the European
strategy?
First, EC leaders have placed their bets on President Slobodan Milosevic and
his transformation from war criminal to champion of the Vance-Owen plan.
They believe sanctions are responsible for the conversion, and aim to
capitalise on the split between Mr Milosevic and the Bosnian Serbs.
The next step is to test the Serbian president's pledge to seal the border,
possibly using the former Yugoslav army policed by civilian EC observers. Mr
Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, calls this the policy of
'asphyxiation'.
The second goal is to expand UN-led efforts to create 'safe areas' for the
Bosnian Moslems, consolidating the fragile ceasefire in six Moslem towns.
The model is Srebrenica, where 150 Canadian troops negotiated passage into
the town and persuaded Serbian artillery to hold fire. The UK's threat to
bomb the Serbs if they attacked may have been a further incentive. French
officials argue that securing 'safe areas' would provide the building blocks
for implementation of the Vance-Owen plan.
The Europeans' appeal for US and Russian forces stems in part from a
realisation that the current UN force is inadequate and it is stretching its
mandate continuously to keep the peace. This leaves the Clinton
administration in a dilemma: having insisted that the Europeans take the
lead, will it now dance to the European tune, knowing that sending US ground
forces into Bosnia would effectively sidetrack their preferred military
options - notably bombing.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Germany questions its role as Zagreb's chief supporter
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROATIA'S military support for the Bosnian Croats will come under sharp
criticism when Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, makes his first
visit to Zagreb on Friday.
During talks with President Franjo Tudjman and Mr Zdenko Skrabalo, the
Croatian foreign minister, Mr Kinkel is expected to ask why Croatia
continues militarily to back Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats, and the
new offensive against Moslem forces in western Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The visit coincides with greater questioning in the German media about
Bonn's decision to push through the European Community's recognition of
Croatia's independence in January 1991. That policy, spearheaded by Mr Hans
Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, punctured any semblance of
unity among EC states about how to deal with the unfolding crisis in the
former Yugoslavia.
Mr Kinkel, however, has become more openly critical about Croatia's military
involvement in Bosnia-Hercegovnia, and Croatia's attempts earlier this year
to regain control of the Krajina area of south-western Croatia which,
although a UN protectorate, is run by Serb nationalists seeking autonomy
from Zagreb.
'Mr Kinkel will keep stressing the need for a negotiated settlement as a
means of stopping the war. The longer the war continues, the more Germany
will have to bear the brunt of the refugee problem,' a Foreign Ministry
official in Bonn said. But requests for German economic aid to reconstruct
the Croatian economy are unlikely to be high on the agenda as long the area
remains unstable.
More than 460,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia have arrived in
Germany in the past 18 months. At the same time, Germany has been at the
forefront among EC countries in providing humanitarian aid to Croatia, which
includes financing a hospital in Karlovac, south of Zagreb, and setting up a
food and medical distribution network in the republic and extending into
Bosnia. Bonn has already allocated direct humanitarian assistance totalling
DM155m (Pounds 63m), in addition to DM196m towards EC aid for the region.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Russians use veto on Cyprus peace force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA last night cast the first veto in the UN Security Council since the
end of the cold war to kill a British resolution that would have made
financing of the voluntarily-funded UN force in Cyprus a mandatory charge on
all member states by assessment.
The force, which has served as a peacekeeping buffer since 1964, is facing a
serious reduction in strength, to about 1,500 troops, by the withdrawal of
the Canadian contingent.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, supported the proposal by
Britain, the biggest troop contributor, that it was time to end a financing
arrangement which places a heavy burden on countries supplying troops.
Russia has paid nothing.
The force, costing Dollars 47m (Pounds 30.5m) a year and in financial
difficulties virtually since its inception, is the only UN peacekeeping
operation subject to voluntary funding.
Western delegates were alarmed by the Russian action, which appears to pose
a serious threat to the continued presence of the force in Cyprus. Mr
Boutros Ghali is due to reopen negotiations on May 24 on a political
settlement with local leaders.
Mr Yuli Vorontsov, the Russian delegate, who is also the Council president
this month, did his utmost to avoid having to cast the veto - the first by
any member since May 1990 and the first by Moscow since February 1984 - but
evidently was overruled.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Spanish official lost for words in Brussels post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUDDEN resignation of the European Commission's director general for
social affairs has cast another embarrassing spotlight on how the EC fills
its senior jobs. It also calls into question how seriously the Community
takes its vaunted ambition of building a 'social dimension' into European
integration.
Mr Sigismundo Crespo, Spanish director general of DG5 (social policy) in the
Commission, left Brussels late last week, leaving a note for his secretary
saying he would not be back. He confirmed his resignation in a subsequent
sharply worded fax from Madrid. A furious Mr Jacques Delors, Commission
president, has now summoned him back, one senior official said yesterday.
Explanations for his departure vary. Mr Crespo was said by one official to
have suffered a family tragedy. He himself is understood to have complained
that his lines of communication inside the Commission had been deliberately
blocked.
Mr Crespo took over DG5 in October. However, it was known that the social
affairs directorate had been earmarked for a Spaniard as long ago as
February 1991, because a reshuffle of top Commission jobs left Spain one
directorate general short after it had conceded transport to the UK.
With Spain and other member states unyielding over their informal quotas of
top jobs, Brussels canvassed hard to get a Spaniard of high calibre. Highly
regarded Spaniards within the Commission, like Mr Eneko Landaburu, the
Basque head of regional policy, were not interested.
Mr Crespo, best known in Spain for transferring back to the unions the
assets seized from them by Franco, was sent from Madrid and found
immediately to be out of his depth.
His main handicap was linguistic. Though a French speaker, he was unable to
communicate in English with his boss, Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish
commissioner for social affairs. Mr Flynn has no French and had placed
British and Irish officials alongside and immediately under Mr Crespo,
hemming him in.
Senior officials in DG5 described their weekly meetings as 'like Basil
Fawlty and Manuel' in the TV comedy Fawlty Towers.
This cavalier behaviour with a department the Commission claims is vital
comes at a time when Brussels has been at cross purposes on social policy.
Mr Flynn has won support from the Twelve to prepare an EC-wide jobs
initiative. However, it emerges that Mr Delors has been working discreetly
on a similar initiative using his own network within the Commission.

FT  12 MAY 93 / France gets its Bundesbank, but a Gallic one: How the new
independent Bank of France will work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of prime minister Edouard Balladur is planning to divest
itself of a slice of national policy control by giving the Bank of France
autonomy in 'defining and carrying out' the country's monetary policy.
It was, in fact, in those terms that President Francois Mitterrand and
France's constitutional court raised a last-minute hitch to the change in
the central bank's statute. Could a French government, charged by the
constitution with running national policy, cut adrift so important an
institution as the Bank of France - created by Napoleon in 1800 and fully
nationalised in 1936 - before the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary
union (Emu) required it to do?
A compromise was found at a cabinet meeting on Monday. Article 1, the most
important of the 33-article draft law, states that the bank will operate
monetary policy 'with the goal of ensuring price stability' and 'in the
framework of the government's general economic policy'.
The latter phrase is intended to protect the government from any
constitutional charge of dereliction of duty, and is heavily qualified in
the same article by the ban on the central bank 'soliciting or accepting'
outside instruction on the conduct of monetary policy.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said he personally did not like
the phrase about the central bank operating 'in the framework of' general
government policy, and that he hoped it would be struck out when the EC
moved to monetary union. If Maastricht was never fully ratified, France's
plan for an autonomous central bank would still stand, he stressed, because
that form of central banking had proved its anti-inflation worth around the
world.
De-coupling the Bank of France plan from Maastricht in this way may also
make it more palatable to a parliament which contains - chiefly in Mr
Balladur's own RPR Gaullist party - more than 100 deputies who voted against
the EC treaty in the referendum last September. Mr Balladur, however, still
has an enormous majority and pro-EC remnants of the Socialist party to push
the plan through.
Part of his appeal is to give the new institution distinctively Gallic
colours. In contrast to the Bundesbank whose main responsibility is monetary
policy, the Bank of France would, in general terms, have all its
multifarious activities intact. Its 17,000 employees supervise commercial
banks, compile corporate data, run the payments clearing system, even
provide management advice to industry and conduct some private banking.
But inside the central bank would be created what Mr Alphandery termed the
'sanctuary' of a Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). It would have nine members
 -the bank governor and his two deputies (appointed for renewable six-year
terms), plus six outsiders.
The latter would be appointed by the government from a list of 18 provided
by various parliamentary and judicial institutions for staggered nine-year
terms which could not be renewed or revoked (except for serious offence). No
MPC member could have another job during his term, or anything but a public
function for three years after retiring.
The draft contains no definition of price stability. That, said Mr
Alphandery, would be for the MPC to judge, just as the Bundesbank council
does. It clearly states the government would still take overall exchange
rate decisions concerning EMS parity changes or fluctuation bands, and that
the MPC would decide day-to-day interventions in the foreign exchange
markets.
But, as with Maastricht itself, this still leaves a grey zone. Who, for
instance, would decide exactly where the franc should be within its EMS
band?
The plan contains no mechanism to arbitrate between government and bank. To
have included this, said Mr Alphandery, would have appeared to pre-empt the
consensus he hoped would emerge. However, he hoped the MPC would not be
stacked with 'the Parisian monetary intelligentsia' but have its six
outsiders representing 'the live forces of the economy'.
Another ambiguity is in accountability. The draft statute's only stipulation
is that the central bank governor continue to make his yearly report to the
president. But Mr Alphandery said he expected the governor to testify to
parliament at least twice a year as his US counterpart did, and to develop
an open press policy like the Bundesbank. 'This will be a plus for our
democracy,' he said.
The draft plan also clarifies the existing division of labour between the
Finance Ministry and the central bank on regulation of commercial banks -
who themselves have won a minor victory. The Bank of France is no longer to
seek to add to the 100,000 private accounts it holds for individuals (many
of them central bank employees) and companies.

ITALIAN magistrates investigating kickbacks to political parties made two
new arrests yesterday which further implicated the former Communist party in
the widening corruption scandal.
The ex-Communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) until recently has been
relatively untouched by the corruption inquiries.
Magistrates arrested Mr Renato Pollini, former administrative secretary of
the Communist party, and Mr Fausto Bartolini, ex-director of a building
company associated with Italy's powerful co-operative movement, as part of
inquiries into alleged kickbacks from the state railway system.
The arrests followed the issue of 14 cautionary warrants on Monday against
businessmen and Transport Ministry officials. The accused are alleged to
have connived in an arrangement to split kickbacks on railway orders between
Italy's main political parties. Among those sought by the magistrates are Mr
Franco Ferlin, an adviser at the time to Mr Carlo Bernini, a former
transport minister.
The PDS is fighting to defend its image after a recent stream of leaks and
arrests have prompted claims that its members participated in schemes
involving kickbacks on public-sector contracts. The party has denied
receiving kickbacks from companies dealing with the railways in the period
up to 1988 when it had a member on the rail board.
Mr Pietro Tognoli, a Bergamo businessman, was arrested last week on
allegations of having paid a 3 per cent kickback on a L200bn (Pounds 85m)
contract for track sleepers. According to press leaks, 60 per cent of the
L6bn was shared between the Christian Democrats (25 per cent), Socialists
(15) and PDS (20). The rest went to government officials. The PDS has denied
any involvement.
A committee of the lower house of parliament put off until next week
hearings on lifting the parliamentary immunity of Mr Bettino Craxi, former
Socialist party leader, and Mr Claudio Martelli, a prominent ex-Socialist
and former justice minister.

The hearings cover three requests from magistrates to investigate Mr Craxi
and one in the case of Mr Martelli.

A 1990 European Council convention aimed at combating money laundering will

Netherlands and Switzerland, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The treaty, signed
by 16 European countries, has already been ratified by the UK and Germany.
It is aimed at improving co-operation between police forces in tracing and

European convention does not cover fully the confiscation of money earned by

FT  12 MAY 93 / Poland to restart bank debt payments
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND is to resume limited interest payments on its Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds
7.8bn) debt to western commercial banks on May 20, Mr Krzysztof Krowacki,
its chief debt negotiator, said in Warsaw yesterday.
The resumption of monthly payments of Dollars 5m, or 10 per cent of the
interest due, follows a round of talks with the banks in London last week.
The annual interest payment of Dollars 60m is equivalent to the payments
Poland made on a Dollars 1.1bn revolving credit dating from 1983 which it
stopped servicing in January.
Poland, which ended interest payments on the bulk of its commercial debt in
the autumn of 1989, is seeking a 50 per cent reduction of its debt burden in
a deal comparable to its 1991 Paris Club agreement with western governments,
under which it will have to resume full interest payments in 1995 of around
Dollars 1.3bn a year on its reduced debt of Dollars 27bn.
Mr Krowacki said Poland is seeking a London Club agreement allowing it to
buy back a third of the debt and issue 30-year par and discount bonds for
the remainder.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Danish Referendum: Denmark's fishermen ready to sink treaty
 -Hugh Carnegy gathers views on quayside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Knut-Erik Vestfart and his brother Per, like many of Europe's fishermen, are
angry. Prices are at rock bottom for the cod, herring and other fish they
bring in from the Baltic and North Sea to their home port of Skagen, at
Denmark's northern tip. They want to catch more to compensate, but cannot
because they would exceed EC quotas.
Little wonder then, as they winch their nets aboard their 20-tonne
wooden-hulled vessel CK Vest and cast off for a night's fishing, that they
have no hesitation in saying how they will vote in next Tuesday's Danish
referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
'No]' exclaims Knut-Erik. 'In the Baltic I've never seen so much big cod as
this year but we can't catch them because of the Community rules. I'm sure
most of fishermen will vote No.'
The story is much the same all along the quayside in Skagen, which was
closed for three weeks last month by a fishermen's protest strike. It is
common also to find deeper resentments against the EC.
'I don't want Europe to become a new US,' says Marianne Henrikson, who works
in a dockside bar. 'We should buy and sell to each other, but not have the
same police or military. People fear the big countries, like Germany.'
But this is not the whole story either. Just a step away from the boats, a
less emotional response is evident that backs up forecasts that Danes will
reverse last year's No vote.
Kurt Rye Poulsen is chairman of the Skagen Fishermen's Association, which
represents 430 local boat owners and crew. Last year, he was forced to sell
his 150-tonne trawler because he could no longer make money fishing. He says
there are only 105 boats over five tonnes in Skagen against 200 a decade
ago.
He is campaigning hard for larger quotas - he disbelieves official reports
on low stocks - and a block on cheap imports from third countries.
Yet he and his association are recommending a Yes vote. 'Denmark has very
small waters, so most of the fish we catch is in EC waters. Most of our fish
is sold to other EC countries. I see big problems if we don't stay in the
EC.'
This is echoed by fish auctioneer Bach Andersen. He says things have never
been so bad in Skagen, where unemployment is 15 per cent. Cod prices are
down 40 per cent since 1990; quotas have fallen by the same proportion.
But he, too, will vote yes. 'Perhaps my heart says No, but my brain says
Yes. We cannot sell our fish in other markets. The solution is not to get
out of the system but to change the system.'
The fishing industry makes up 80 per cent of the local economy in Skagen,
the balance accounted for by tourism. Rune Larsson, the head of the local
chamber of commerce says he will vote Yes. He expects the majority of those,
like himself, in the fishing service industry to do likewise.
But he is far from confident about the outcome. He fears that what he sees
as rational arguments may be eclipsed as polling day approaches. 'The great
problem is that the discussion tends to be on a very emotional level.'

FT  12 MAY 93 / Waigel pressed to take over as Bavaria premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURMOIL within the German political establishment looks set to cause a new
upheaval in the government, with growing pressure on Mr Theo Waigel, the
finance minister and close ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to quit and take
over as state premier in his home base of Bavaria.
Reports yesterday said that Mr Waigel, a symbol of stability and key figure
in the ruling coalition, is set to return to Munich and replace Mr Max
Streibl, his protege within the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, as
prime minister.
The move could aggravate the current climate of uncertainty surrounding the
German government, by bringing an unfamiliar politician to the finance
ministry at a critical moment in the struggle to bring government spending
under control in the wake of German unification.
The leading contender for that job is said to be Mr Rudolf Seiters,
currently the interior minister in Bonn and former head of the chancellor's
office. However, Mr Seiters lacks any background in finance or economics.
At the same time Mr Waigel's move would be intended to bolster the position
of the CSU in Bavaria, where his party faces a growing challenge from the
far-right wing Republicans in next year's state, national and European
elections.
Mr Streibl is under enormous pressure to quit as Bavarian premier, because
of reports that he accepted free holidays from a business friend.
The whole reshuffle, confidently forecast yesterday by the conservative
newspaper Die Welt, depends on the outcome of a struggle for power within
the CSU, sister-party of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union in the ruling
coalition.
If Mr Waigel, the party leader, comes out on top, he will go home to replace
Mr Streibl, whose resignation is now taken for granted. If he loses, he will
stay in Bonn as finance minister.
His great rival for the state premier's job is Mr Edmund Stoiber, currently
interior minister in Bavaria, widely regarded as the strong man of the
party, and a close associate of the late Bavarian leader, Mr Franz-Josef
Strauss. Insiders say he does not want to go to Bonn, where he would be
offered the job of federal government interior minister, but wants to become
state premier himself.
In Bonn Mr Stoiber could be a positive asset to the federal government in
the promised position of interior minister. He is seen as a stern,
conservative advocate of law and order, likely to be a big issue in the 1994
elections.
On the other hand, Mr Kohl might prefer such a forceful character to take
over in Bavaria, leaving him the beetle-browed and good-humoured Mr Waigel
to soak up the unpopularity of being a penny-pinching finance minister.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Major stalls on Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT'S hold on the chancellorship was growing more precarious
last night after prime minister John Major refused to confirm that he would
present the first unified Budget in November, writes David Owen.
Mr Major - who minutes later said he was 'four-square' behind Mr John
Patten, his embattled education secretary - fuelled speculation about a
cabinet reshuffle by declining Labour calls to remove the question-mark over
Mr Lamont's future.
Coming within 24 hours of an implicit acknowledgement from Mr Major's office
that cabinet changes were under consideration, the exchanges reinforced
expectations at Westminster that Mr Lamont will be moved in a July cabinet
reshuffle.
Although he praised Mr Lamont for his 'excellent record' on inflation and
interest rates, the prime minister stopped short of giving the assurance
demanded by Mr John Smith, opposition leader, that the chancellor would be
in his post for the Budget.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Government retreats in row with teachers: Patten agrees to
streamline tests from next year but union boycott will go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night staged a retreat in its long-running battle with
teachers by announcing that mandatory tests in schools would be simplified
and streamlined from next year.
Its decision, rushed out in a House of Commons statement after a morning of
Downing Street crisis management, appeared to calm the rising discontent
among Tory MPs about the handling of the dispute by Mr John Patten, the
education secretary. But it failed to persuade the teachers to lift their
boycott on this summer's tests.
Mr Patten told MPs that in 1994 the tests for seven and 14-year-olds would
be restricted to the 'core' subjects of English, mathematics and science
(and in Wales, the Welsh language). The government will decide later whether
to add technology for 14-year-olds.
The row, which had set the government against most of the educational
establishment and prompted growing unease among parents, contributed to the
government's disastrous performance in last week's county council elections.
Earlier Mr Patten was said to have been 'incandescent' at press reports that
the prime minister's office had 'bounced' him into a climbdown.
A Downing Street official denied he had been the source of the reports. But
senior ministers confirmed that Mr Patten had been under intense pressure
from Mr John Major and cabinet colleagues to produce a formula to defuse the
row. Some colleagues believe Mr Patten remains vulnerable in the expected
July cabinet reshuffle, but yesterday, at least, Mr Major offered his public
backing.
From 1994 the content of the tests will be simplified and the government
will consider easing the burden on teachers by using outside examiners to
mark them.
The number of subjects for which teachers have to compile assessments of
classroom work will also be cut. Mr Patten, saying next year's tests would
'focus on the basics', delayed until 1995 the nationwide introduction of
testing of 11-year-olds.
But he refused to bow to teachers' demands that the far more complicated
tests due this year be scrapped. That left the teaching unions welcoming the
planned 1994 changes but refusing to lift this summer's boycott.
The unions, whose case has won unprecedented backing across all sections of
the teaching profession, are unwilling to conduct the tests before the
outcome of the full-scale review of the national curriculum by Sir Ron
Dearing.
By contrast, Mr Patten said this year's tests were essential to inform Sir
Ron's review. He appealed to the unions to respond by ending their boycott.
Privately, ministers were admitting the government's position owed much more
to Mr Patten's determination to avoid capitulating to the unions than to any
real hope the tests will go ahead. Mr Eamonn O'Kane, National Association of
Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers' deputy general secretary, said: 'What
he's proposed for 1994 doesn't go the whole way but certainly tries to open
up the issues we would want addressed.' But he criticised the decision to
press on with tests this year as a 'completely illogical and pointless
exercise'.
The government was further embarrassed last night by a revolt of five Tory
MPs over its plans to restrict fishermen's time at sea and by defeats in the
House of Lords on rights of leaseholders to buyfreeholds.

FT  12 MAY 93 / 2,200 jobs threatened at Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the long-established shipbuilding industry on Tyneside was
placed in jeopardy yesterday when Swan Hunter lost its bid for a vital
contract to build a 20,000-tonne helicopter carrier for the navy.
Swan Hunter described the surprise decision as 'potentially terminal'.
Labour MPs said it would force the closure of Swan Hunter and put 6,000
people in the north-east out of work.
The contract, believed to be worth about Pounds 170m, has gone instead to
VSEL, the submarine yard at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, in conjunction with
the Norwegian-owned Scottish company Kvaerner Govan.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said the VSEL bid won 'by
a very substantial margin of more than Pounds 50m'. Neither VSEL nor Swan
Hunter would comment on details of the respective bids.
Mr Aitken said the government had taken 'full account' of wider factors such
as Swan Hunter's future. But he added: 'The final judgment was made on our
normal technical and value-for-money criteria.'
The plan for a helicopter carrier was thought likely to be dropped in MoD
budget cuts but was revived in March. The ship, to be called HMS Ocean, is
designed to carry 12 helicopters, capable of landing several hundred Royal
Marines.
Swan Hunter was hoping to secure subsequent contracts for two large assault
ships, worth about Pounds 200m each. Work on current orders - completing
three navy frigates - will run out by the end of next year.
Swan Hunter's yard at Wallsend employs 2,200, compared with 4,500 when it
was privatised in a management buyout in 1986. The company is owned by 36
senior managers; it has no parent to fall back on.
Since it opened in the 1870s, it has constructed 2,700 ships, from the
famous Cunard liner Mauretania to the current aircraft carriers Ark Royal
and Illustrious.
Yesterday, with a terseness which underlined the seriousness of its
predicament, the management refused any comment beyond a brief statement
from joint chief executive Dr Roger Vaughan. It said: 'The order being
awarded to anyone other than Swan Hunter will have serious consequences.'
VSEL said the jobs argument was the same whether the contract went to
Barrow-in-Furness or the Tyne. The deal marks the submarine builder's return
to surface ship work after an 11-year absence. Under the contract, the ship
itself will be built at Kvaerner Govan on Clydeside and will be turned into
a military vessel at VSEL.
The work will sustain about 500 jobs at VSEL over the next 18 months. The
yard, which has cut its workforce to 7,700 from 14,300 in 1989, is still
expected to make further reductions.

FT  12 MAY 93 / France unveils its proposals for independent central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday outlined its plan to give the Bank of France
independence, shedding a tradition of tight political control over monetary
policy in the interest of anchoring inflation at a low level.
International experience has shown that 'those countries which enjoy the
greatest monetary stability are those which have entrusted the conduct of
monetary policy to an inde-pendent central bank', Mr Edmond Alphandery, the
economy minister, said.
The draft statute, which must be approved by parliament, provides for the
creation of a nine-member monetary policy committee within the Bank of
France. It would be composed of the bank's governor, his two deputies and
six outsiders, appointed by the government from a shortlist provided by
other institutions for nine-year terms.
He hoped that the committee would not be stacked with the 'Parisian monetary
intelligentsia, all out of the same mould', but would represent a diversity
of interests - even though the French central bank would not follow the
federal model of Germany and the US.
Achieving autonomy from its own government would not necessarily make the
Bank of France any less dependent on Bundesbank monetary decisions. But in
recent weeks France has not always waited for Germany to cut rates before
doing so itself.
The new centre-right government also plans to implement radical changes in
French industrial policy by taking a tougher line with France's
state-controlled companies. Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, said the
state would abandon the old interventionist approach and would, in future,
be more stringent about injecting extra capital into public sector companies
and less resistant to allowing international investors to take stakes.
Mr Longuet has already told Bull, the loss-making computer company which
last year received a FFr2.5bn (Pounds 300m) state injection, to produce a
new strategy to ensure that it no longer had to be bailed out by the
government. He said the government might be more amenable to international
investors taking stakes in Bull as IBM of the US and Japan's NEC have done.
France Telecom, the telecommunications group, is another candidate for
international investment. Mr Longuet said it should consider forging links
with other European telecommunications concerns, or industrial groups, to
take advantage of the liberalisation of the European Community
telecommunications market in 1998. France Telecom has already formed a
number of international joint ventures.
This shift in industrial policy is partly the product of ideology. Mr
Longuet, styling himself as a 'pragmatic liberal', rejected the old-style
French strategy whereby the government supported companies in sectors which
were considered to be strategically important. His approach is reflected in
the new government's privatisation programme, which envisages selling a wide
range of financial and industrial groups to the private sector.
Mr Longuet, who outlined his policy the day after Mr Edouard Balladur, prime
minister, unveiled his 'austerity' budget, said the approach was also due to
budgetary constraints.

FT  12 MAY 93 / Nadir pledges to fight disposal of Polly Peck assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KYRENIA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, said from his refuge in northern
Cyprus yesterday that he planned to move back into the com-pany's
headquarters on the island in the next few days and fight attempts in Turkey
to dispose of the assets of his former company, Polly Peck International.
Mr Nadir, who jumped Pounds 3.5m bail last week, said in an interview with
the Financial Times that he would go to Turkey very soon to pursue
'vigorously and totally' the assets of both Polly Peck and his personal
businesses.
'I do intend to challenge the sales of Polly Peck assets everywhere,' he
said.
Mr Nadir, who fled to northern Cyprus from Britain last week, claimed he had
a plan to recover the assets of Polly Peck and recompense the shareholders,
who, he said, 'have not got a chance at all in the hands of the
administrators'.
Asked what he would do about those who had to surrender the bail put up for
him in the UK, Mr Nadir said his 'supporters will be able to handle any
situation and nobody will be hardshipped'.
Dressed in a linen jacket and smoking constantly, Mr Nadir spoke in the
vaulted drawing room of his family house in Lapta. He played down the
urgency of his next moves. 'I will first visit my father's grave,' he said
while being served coffee on a Japanese lacquer table by a waiter in a
maroon waistcoat.
Mr Nadir's fightback plan was confirmed in London yesterday when it emerged
that he had begun to reclaim his personal assets in Turkey from the hands of
his UK court-appointed trustee.
Mr Nadir has successfully applied to the Turkish courts in the last two days
to revoke the power of attorney granted to his trustee in bankruptcy. This
has blocked action by the trustee to appoint new directors and take control
of AN Graphics, a printing company with assets worth several million pounds.
Turkish and Cypriot businesses of Polly Peck contributed about two-thirds of
the group's Pounds 161m pre-tax profit in 1989, the last full year before it
was forced into administration.
Mr Ismet Sezgin, Turkish interior minister, said last week that Mr Nadir
would be free to travel to Turkey.
Mr Neil Cooper, a partner at accountants Robson Rhodes, who is the trustee
in bankruptcy, confirmed that he was seeking legal advice on ways to fight
Mr Nadir's action.
'I feel disappointed because we were making some progress in the recovery of
assets,' he said. 'This goes against what Mr Nadir implied in his statements
(when he said) that he would be helping his shareholders.'
Although replaced by the administrators as director of the Turkish
companies, Mr Nadir is still director of the Cypriot companies, Sunzest, the
fruit export business, the Unipac packaging company in the Famagusta
freeport and three hotels.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Carclo poised to swoop for Arthur Lee in
agreed bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARCLO Engineering Group is expected to announce the agreed takeover of
Arthur Lee &amp; Sons, the Sheffield-based manufacturer of steel and plastic
products in which it already has a 29.9 per cent stake.
Shares in Arthur Lee were suspended yesterday lunchtime at 142p, valuing the
group at Pounds 47.6m. A minute later, Carclo's shares were suspended at
223p, giving the Leeds-based company a market capitalisation of Pounds
93.4m.
Neither company or any of their advisers would comment. However, a full bid
had been expected since Carclo raised its Arthur Lee stake to the present
level in October by paying GM Firth, the engineering group, 80p per share
for a 22 per cent stake.
Carclo, a card clothing, wire and engineering products group, has ridden out
the worst of the recession, thanks partly to the timely disposal of its
springs and forgings business for Pounds 21.6m to Hoesch, the German steel
group, in 1991. Although Mr John Ewart, Carclo's chairman, described the
Arthur Lee stake as a 'trade investment', he also said last year that he was
always on the lookout for acquisitions at the right price.
Carclo's pre-tax profits fell 30 per cent to Pounds 5.63m in the 12 months
to March last year, but its interim pre-tax profits increased by 28 per cent
in the six months to September and it was enjoying a stronger order book.
Fierce price competition and a decline in demand decreased Arthur Lee's
pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.12m to Pounds 861,000 in 1991, but they
recovered to Pounds 2.98m in the year to September 30. The group repaid
nearly all its borrowings last year after selling its loss-making bright bar
division and related steel stock-holding company for Pounds 7.5m.
Arthur Lee shares dipped to 65p in August last year, but were chased up to
their present level by the bid speculation.
Mr Peter Lee, chairman, said in January that Carclo's stake was 'a worry'
and 'not of our choosing'.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Court Cavendish prepares for market debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURT CAVENDISH, the UK nursing home operator, will today announce plans for
a flotation by way of a public offer and placing, likely to value the
company at between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m.
Dr Chai Patel, Court Cavendish chairman, said: 'The plan is to de-gear to
nothing, but we hope to raise more than the Pounds 24.6m debt we are
carrying. If we do not raise any new expansion capital, the market
capitalisation would be between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m.'
The company is the fifth largest in its sector in a fragmented market,
operating 1,202 beds in 24, mainly purpose built, homes. It plans to grow at
500 beds a year for the next three to five years through acquisitions and
joint ventures with health and local authorities as well as increasing beds
on existing sites.
A pathfinder prospectus for the UBS-arranged flotation, including full
accounts for the year to April, is due next month. It is expected that half
the shares will be placed with the rest offered to the public.
The market for nursing homes, which caters for about 10 per cent of people
aged 75 or older, is in flux because of new government funding rules.
However, the UK's ageing population means demand in the market should
increase.
Court Cavendish is joining a growing sector of the stock market including
Takare, Quality Care Homes, Associated Nursing Services and the most recent
entrant, Westminster Health Care which floated in March. It has a higher
proportion than its rivals - 60 per cent - of private or part-private
clients.
The company began operating in late-1988 and expanded the following year
with the Pounds 29m acquisition of 12 homes from Ladbroke, funded by venture
capital and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The initial gearing proved 'difficult' and the group was re-financed in
1991.
Foster's Brewing Group, which holds 43 per cent in equity converted from
Pounds 7.1m mezzanine debt, is expected to sell as is Ladbroke which has an
8 per cent equity stake.
Other venture capital backers - Kleinwort Benson, Grosvenor, Gartmore and
Legal and General - are expected to remain on board. Management expects to
hold between 5 and 10 per cent of the listed company.
Results have been affected by high interest charges since 1990. The company
estimates making Pounds 54,000 pre-tax profit in the year to April compared
with a Pounds 4.36m loss in the previous period.
However, it expects profits before interest of Pounds 2.67m after
exceptional costs of Pounds 134,000 associated with the flotation (Pounds
1.5m losses, depressed by exceptional costs of Pounds 4.53m).
Turnover is estimated at Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 13.3m) giving an operating
margin of 20.6 per cent (22.8 per cent), a little lower than rivals. The
company said margins were not directly comparable year-on-year because the
mix of owned, managed and leased homes fluctuated.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Ronson secures Pounds 4m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gerald Ronson (above), chairman and chief executive of Heron
International, the property group finalising a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing
which will save it from receivership, has agreed a Pounds 500,000 a year
salary and a five-year contract with the group's creditors.
The salary is index-linked and Mr Ronson will also get 75 per cent of his
annual salary paid into his pension scheme. Without inflation, the deal is
worth Pounds 4.375m over five years.
It has also emerged that Heron helped Mr Ronson pay his Pounds 5m fine for
his part in the Guinness affair. Heron gave him a bonus of Pounds 1.77m
because he 'would otherwise be unable to pay the whole of the fine from his
own resources', a Heron document said. Heron recovered the money from Mr
Ronson's pension entitlement.
One bondholder representative said yesterday that the salary package 'is on
the high side, but who else would they get to do this job?' He said the
decision by creditors to keep Mr Ronson showed a faith in his ability to
sort out the group's problems.
The representative said sacking top management 'is normally a pre-requisite
to getting the refunding in place. Creditors decided they would rather have
Ronson. He made a series of pretty poor judgments about the market, but as a
dealer in property he is not equalled'. Heron aims to sell properties to
reduce debt.
The new salary package represents a pay cut from Mr Ronson's current salary
of Pounds 1.3m a year. It will become effective when the restructuring is
completed and Mr Ronson hands over the chairmanship of the group to Lord
Boardman, a former chairman of National Westminster Bank.
Details of the new contract were in a document sent to Heron's bondholders,
who are being asked to convert each Pounds 100 of bonds into Pounds 29.80 of
senior debt, Pounds 7.28 of junior debt and 6.7949 new shares.

TMM, the Mexican shipping group, has launched a Dollars 200m bond issue in
the US domestic bond market, making it the first private-sector Latin
American name to tap the Yankee bond market.
The 10-year deal was increased to Dollars 200m from Dollars 150m in response
to strong investor demand.
The bonds carry a coupon of 9.25 per cent and were priced at 99.774 to yield
337 basis points over 10-year US Treasury bonds. Bear Stearns was lead
manager, with Goldman Sachs the co-lead for the deal. The bonds are callable
after five years.
TMM is Mexico's largest shipping company and operates ports and a trucking
company.
It is rated BA2 by Moody's and B+ by S&amp;P.

FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Wienerberger posts 30% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WIENERBERGER, the fast growing Austrian building materials group, suffered a
decline in operating profit last year - its first in more than a decade.
Operating profit fell 30 per cent to Sch626m (Dollars 56.48m) mainly because
a ferro alloys subsidiary fell into loss. Net profit was 42 per cent lower
at Sch378m. Group sales rose 11.4 per cent to Sch11.7bn.
Wienerberger shares, which have tumbled from a 1993 peak of over Sch3,500,
closed down Sch8 at Sch2,865 on the Vienna bourse.
In spite of the setback, the group, in which Creditanstalt-Bankverein has a
controlling interest, is paying a 34 per cent dividend, an effective
increase of 26 per cent because of the prior issue of share dividends.
Mr Erhard Schaschl, chief executive, emphasised that the core building
materials businesses continued to perform well and he forecast a profit
recovery in the current year.
The group's main problem stemmed from its 51 per cent owned Treibacher
Chemische Werke. Treibacher, acquired in 1989, makes ferro alloys for the
steel and automotive industries. The slump in demand and margins in world
markets caused 'a dramatic deterioration of the results which could not be
offset by rationalisation measures,' the group said.
Treibacher fell from a profit of about Sch30m in 1991 to a loss of Sch169m
last year. Mr Schaschl predicted it would return to profit this year.
The property division also disappointed, with turnover down to Sch283m from
Sch307m.

subscription price for flotation of its Malaysian subsidiary has been fixed
at Dollars 1.90 to value it at Dollars 98m (Pounds 24m).
The subsidiary, Golden Pharos, will be offering 35 per cent of its capital
to Malaysian institutional and private investors. Unigroup will retain 60
per cent, worth some Pounds 14m at the flotation price.
Mr Jerry Owen, chief executive of Unigroup, said the flotation provided both
companies with valuable cash injections which will substantially reduce
borrowings and strengthen the underlying value of the group.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Gas groups buy Russian helium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO BIG rivals in the world industrial gases business, BOC Group of the UK
and US-based Air Products &amp; Chemicals, yesterday announced identical
agreements to purchase helium from Russia and sell it mainly in western
European markets.
The deals promise to increase competition in the European market for helium,
which because of its cooling properties is critical to several new
technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging, used in modern body
scanners, and fibre optics.
No financial details were revealed, but parallel announcements from the two
western companies said they could each purchase up to 100m cu ft a year of
helium produced near Orenburg, 900 miles south-east of Moscow. BOC said the
deal would increase its total helium supply by about 10 per cent.
The long-team deals could allow both companies to expand their presence in
the 700m cu ft a year European helium market, which is growing at more than
6 per cent annually. Worldwide demand for helium was growing at more than 10
per cent a year in the 1980s, but has now tailed off to about 4 per cent.
The Orenburg plant is one of only nine helium sources worldwide. It
currently produces only gaseous helium, but is being fitted with helium
liquefaction equipment, enabling liquid helium to be delivered to the two
western companies by early summer. The liquid helium is easier to transport.
BOC and Air Products stressed that, although they have technically signed a
single agreement, they will be competing fiercely in European markets.
Air Products is the biggest seller of helium in Europe, and in some
countries such as France BOC has very little presence.
But the UK company said there was 'a fair chance that we will meet head-on
in the UK'.
The Russian parties to the agreement are SE Orenburggazprom, a division of
Gazprom, the Russian state energy company; and Cryor, a Moscow-based private
company.
The Orenburg plant produces nearly all Russia's helium. As part of the deal,
however, the two western companies will also receive deliveries of liquid
helium from the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research at Dubna and from the
Kurchatov Institute near Moscow.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Banque Indosuez pays Pounds 8.8m for
Sheppards

<TEXT>
BANQUE INDOSUEZ, the French investment bank, is expanding its UK interests
by paying about Pounds 8.8m for Sheppards, one of London's oldest
stockbrokers.
Indosuez has been in discussions since November with Sheppards' management
and its 51 per cent shareholder Banque Arabe et Internationale
d'Investissement, the Arab banking subsidiary of BNP.
Sheppards will be merged with the relevant areas of Indosuez's existing UK
businesses, Carr Kitcat Aitken, an institutional investment firm, and WI
Carr Investments, which specialises in private clients. That business will
be renamed Carr Sheppards.
Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman of Indosuez, said the acquisition
formed part of the group's long term international expansion strategy and
its plans to strengthen its private client business, where Sheppards is
well- established.
He said the merger should yield 'significant cost savings' particularly in
administrative areas and in central overheads. About 40 to 50 staff, a third
of Sheppards' total, are likely to be made redundant following the merger.
Indosuez, one of the largest subsidiaries of Suez, the French industrial and
financial group, experienced a difficult time in the past year because of
economic slowdown and the property slump in Paris. It saw net profits
plummet 87 per cent to FFr101m (Pounds 12.2m) in 1992.
Mr Jeancourt-Galignani said there had been a 'significant improvement'
during the first quarter of this year. The group had come under pressure in
France because of high interest rates and the slowdown, but had fared well
in its international and private banking business.
Mr Fred Carr, chief executive of Carr Sheppards, said the merger brought
together two of the oldest names in the City. WI Carr was founded in 1825
and Sheppards two years later. 'It's one reason we felt we should keep the
Sheppards name going on the private client side,' he said.
Sheppards, with funds under management of about Pounds 1.6bn, is thought to
have made profits of some Pounds 1m last year.

Israel's army radio said yesterday Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, was
planning to reshuffle his cabinet in order to defuse a coalition crisis. The
radio said Mr Rabin had agreed to the ultra-religious Shas party's demand to
move outspokenly secular leftwing Mrs Shulamit Aloni from the education
ministry. She had accepted the communications and culture portfolio instead.
The crisis was triggered by the resignation submitted on Sunday by Rabbi
Arye Deri, the Shas interior minister. He may now remain in his post.

FT  11 MAY 93 / WHO acts on allegations of vote-buying
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Health Organisation decided yesterday to tighten its financial
rules after allegations of vote-buying in the recent election of its chief,
Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, Reuter reports from Geneva.
In a resolution adopted by consensus at the agency's annual assembly, member
states asked Dr Nakajima to set a clear policy on granting contracts to
members of the WHO executive board, which implements the decisions of the
annual WHO assembly.
The move follows a highly critical external audit which found shortcomings
in six contracts awarded to members of the 31-member board before it
renominated Dr Nakajima in January.
Member states confirmed the nomination by 98 votes to 53 last Wednesday,
giving Dr Nakajima five more years as director-general of the United Nations
agency.
The external audit by Britain's auditor-general Sir John Bourn did not
directly link any of the contracts to Dr Nakajima, but pointed out that five
of them had been signed off by another senior Japanese official in the UN
agency.
Monday's resolution, which still needs the formal approval of the plenary
assembly, welcomed an announcement by Dr Nakajima last week that he planned
significant reforms of the agency. However it asked him to take further
steps to implement the auditor's recommendations.
Unesco's cash flow has improved significantly in the past few months, Mr
Frederico Mayor, director general, told a public meeting of its executive
board in Paris yesterday.
The organisation has received Dollars 116m from member state's since the
board last met in October, Mr Mayor said. The organisation, which is
perennially short of cash, was forced to borrow money last October, but Mr
Mayor said these loans had now been repaid in full.
Unesco now has a surplus of Dollars 30m, Mr Mayor said.
The head of the UN Environment Programme pleaded yesterday for more cash to
help Unep end bad planning and implement priority programmes.
Ms Elizabeth Dowdeswell, executive director, told a Unep governing council
meeting in the Kenyan capital Nairobi that without a stable budget the
environment watchdog would 'simply not have the means to implement the tasks
assigned to it.'

FT  11 MAY 93 / Debts cloud mayor's vision of Nmes reborn: Alice Rawsthorn
on a southern town's revival efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean Bousquet this month celebrated one of the highlights of his decade
as mayor of the city of Nmes in southern France with the inauguration of the
Carre d'Art, a spectacular new modern art museum and mediatheque designed by
Sir Norman Foster, the British architect.
The Carre d'Art was conceived as a counterpart to the nearby third-century
Roman temple, Maison Carree. It has cost FFr383m (Dollars 70.7m) and is by
far the most grandiose of all the buildings commissioned by Mr Bousquet
since he launched his ambitious architectural programme 10 years ago.
But instead of marking the summit of Mr Bousquet's achievements, the opening
of the Carre d'Art has been clouded by concern about the cost of Nmes' new
buildings in these difficult economic times.
Nmes was in decline when Mr Bousquet, the conservative chairman of the
Cacharel clothing company, became mayor in 1983. It was a sleepy southern
tourist town. Young people were drifting away, leaving an ageing population
behind them.
The new mayor was particularly frustrated by the contrast between Nmes and
neighbouring Montpellier. The two cities were the same size in the early
1960s. But Nmes had since shrunk, while Montpellier was thriving thanks
partly to the dynamic arts and economic policies of Mr Georges Freche, its
Socialist mayor and one of Mr Bousquet's local rivals.
Mr Bousquet started his own regeneration strategy. While President Francois
Mitterrand was flinging up the Grands Projets, his pharaonic architectural
schemes in Paris, Mr Bousquet initiated his own Petits Projets in Nmes. The
level of investment rose from FFr88m in 1982, the year before Mr Bousquet
became mayor, to a 1988 peak of FFr403m.
Nmes has emerged with an impressive collection of contemporary buildings,
including the Carre d'Art, the Nemausus housing project by Mr Jean Nouvel of
France, and a sports stadium by Italy's Mr Vittorio Gregotti. Mr Bousquet
has also drafted in famous French designers including Ms Andree Puttnam, who
overhauled the city's park benches, and Mr Philippe Starck, who created a
civic logo.
Mr Bousquet has undoubtedly succeeded in modernising Nmes' image. The
Georges Pompidou Centre in Paris even staged an exhibition dedicated to his
architectural policy. But his new buildings were intended to attract more
than critical praise. They were also supposed to encourage an economic
revival.
There are some positive signs. The exodus from Nmes has stopped. The
population has grown by about 4,000 to 133,607 since 1983 and 2,000 jobs
have been created.
But the city has also been left with heavy debts, and the level of
unemployment, at 17 per cent, is still well above the national average of
about 10 per cent.
Mr Bousquet now faces the challenge of reducing the debt and tackling
unemployment. He has stopped spending so much money, with investment falling
to FFr283m last year from its 1988 peak. The level of debt per inhabitant
has fallen from FFr3,802 in 1989 to FFr2,335 in 1992.
But Mr Bousquet's hopes of reducing it further by selling land to private
developers  - as Mr Freche did in Montpellier during the buoyant 1980s  -
could be impeded by the sluggishness of the property market. The recession
could also hinder his hopes of capitalising on the publicity generated by
Nmes' new buildings to attract investment.
At present local attention is distracted from these issues by the furore
over the dismissal of Mr Simon Casas, high-profile director of the Arenes.
Mr Casas, a former matador who relaunched the Arenes (arena) by bringing in
a string of celebrity bullfighters, unsuccessfully challenged one of Mr
Bousquet's allies for a conservative candidacy in this spring's
parliamentary elections. Three days after the elections he was fired,
triggering a blistering row with Mr Bousquet.
Once the row has died down, and the excitement of the Carre d'Art opening
evaporates, Mr Bousquet and the Nmois will have no more distractions from
the mundane matters of paying off debts and creating jobs in a chilly
economic climate.
Another Petit Projet is in the pipeline: a university for 4,000 students on
the site of the 17th century Fort Vauban. Mr Bousquet has also begun an
ambitious urban plan to redefine the city's boundaries, extend its green
spaces and link the ancient aspects of its architecture by new roads
including an 8km Grand Axe designed by Sir Norman Foster.

FT  11 MAY 93 / US softens its policy on Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Strobe Talbott, America's special ambassador to the former Soviet Union,
yesterday launched a softer US policy towards Ukraine, having apparently
realised that efforts to pressure Ukraine to fulfil its pledge to become
non-nuclear have succeeded only in strengthening Kiev's growing pro-nuclear
lobby.
'This visit demonstrates that a new, independent state and a new
administration in Washington have been able to turn over a new leaf in their
relations,' Mr Talbott said.
The most concrete result in the shift from cool relations to meetings, which
Mr Talbott described as 'cordial', was an American offer to act as a
mediator between Ukraine and its sometimes hostile neighbour, Russia.
'We told our Ukrainian hosts that the US would like to try to find a way to
serve as a facilitator in the complex relations that exist between Ukraine
and Russia, if that is acceptable to both sides,' Mr Talbott said.
These are reassuring words for Ukrainian officials, who in the past few
weeks have expressed fears that the US was willing to act in concert with
Russia in an attempt to pressure Kiev into surrendering its nuclear
missiles.
A sign of the thaw in the US-Ukrainian relationship was Mr Talbott's
last-minute meeting with the Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, who
had initially refused to meet the US envoy.
A senior Ukrainian official said that the US delegation had made an
important new proposal with regard to Ukrainian security. He said that he
expected an American announcement on this issue in the near future.
Finding an arrangement which assuages Ukraine's security concerns could have
a crucial impact on the Ukrainian parliament, which is scheduled to begin
debate about the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty next week.
Ukraine's tentative rapprochement with the US could also help clear the way
for assistance from the International Monetary Fund,.
Ukrainian officials have said that if the government succeeds in its
campaign to take tighter control over the central bank later this month they
could receive an initial tranche of Dollars 250m by the end of July.

FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tomkins surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conglomerate Tomkins shook off last week's gloom and jumped 13 to 236p,
making it the day's best FT-SE performer in percentage terms, after it
issued an upbeat report on the integration of Ranks Hovis McDougall, which
it acquired last December.
The company said the plans meant it would have to make a Pounds 90m
provision, but dealers were cheered by the restructuring proposals for the
bakery group and by confirmation that the final dividend would not be less
than 6.35p, as forecast at the time of the bid.
However, a further advance in the shares was checked by continued caution
from analysts and several said they would wait for this week's meetings with
the company before turning more positive.
UBS was reported to have been the day's big shopper and a hefty 10m shares
had been dealt by the close.
Overseas earners were boosted by the strength of the dollar, with
pharmaceuticals stocks standing out. Glaxo was further helped by a
presentation to leading securities houses. The company's comments yesterday
afternoon that it expected double-digit sales growth over the next three to
four years and 14 per cent profits growth were described as 'moderately
positive' by one analyst. The shares improved 19 1/2 to 613p. Wellcome
advanced 18 to 765p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' was lifted 16 1/2 to 485p
ex-dividend.
BAT Industries continued to recover from weakness prompted by the recent US
cigarette price war. There was also some delayed reaction to Friday's news
that a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco was ending a cigarette price promotion. The
shares gained 17 at 880p.
The threat of an MMC inquiry into the price of compact discs reflected badly
on Thorn EMI, although the shares managed to capture a little of the
recovery mood in later trading. They closed 4 off at 831p. NatWest
Securities, one of the stock's staunchest supporters, moved it to a
short-term hold, blaming the uncertainty that will now hang over the stock
for the several months' duration an inquiry might take.
Several insurers were still clouded by rights issue worries but securities
house Credit Lyonnais Laing prompted buyers of Royal Insurance, Legal &amp;
General and Prudential.
The house published a buy recommendation on Royal and raised its current
year forecast by Pounds 75m to Pounds 165m on the basis that recovery was
arriving faster than anticipated. Royal added 5 at 311p. The house also said
its top of the range current year estimate for Legal was too low and the
shares moved forward 10 to 456p. Prudential, highlighted as an
underperformer, improved 7 to 317 1/2 p.
Meanwhile, General Accident lost ground after last week's gains ahead of
first-quarter results due today. The market expects profits of Pounds 14m
against a loss of Pounds 29.2m last time. The shares were off 8 at one
stage, and although recovering with the market still closed 2 easier at
573p.
Suspension of two stocks in the engineering sector at the companies' request
raised bid speculation. Shares in Arthur Lee were suspended at 142p, while
those of Carclo, which holds nearly 30 per cent of Arthur Lee, were
suspended at 223p. There was talk that Carclo was about to launch a 160p a
share bid for the rest of Lee.
ASW continued to be powered by last week's favourable analysts visit and the
shares gained 16 to 233p.
Continued speculation of further disposals boosted Lonrho and the shares
firmed 2 1/2 to 107p, with sizeable dealings also reported in the traded
options market. International trading group Inchcape rose 8 to 591p after a
recommendation from SG Warburg.
Stores stocks felt the benefit of the recovery mood, among which Dixons put
on 6 at 213p, Kingfisher 7 to 595p and Marks and Spencer 6 to 348p. James
Capel was said to be enthusiastic on the sector.
Supermarket group J. Sainsbury advanced 12 to 468p as NatWest Securities
reiterated its positive stance.
In a perky builders merchants sector, Blue Circle rose 8 to 252p and Rugby
Group 6 to 270p. Both benefited from upgrades by BZW.

FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: WH Smith rebounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in retailer WH Smith had a roller-coaster session, starting weakly,
then ending the day showing a 27-point turnround. Worries over any
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into compact discs initially hit
the shares, which were down 8 at their worst, before news of a number of
upgrades drifted into the market and the mood changed dramatically.
The company has been talking to analysts prior to going into closed period
and the impression received was of improved trading, in particular at Our
Price and Waterstones.
In addition, because of low earnings per share growth this year, part of WH
Smith's share option scheme for employees will not be triggered, saving the
company around Pounds 4m, according to analysts. The 'A' shares ended 19
ahead at 465p. Kleinwort Benson and Hoare Govett upgraded their forecasts by
Pounds 10m, the former to Pounds 110m, the latter to Pounds 110.5m and it
moved from hold to trading buy.

FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ratners revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surge in the share price of Ratners showed no signs of abating as
investors continued to buy strongly into the heavily indebted jewellery
group. The shares have now jumped in value by 2.5 times in the past three
weeks. Yesterday a huge 30m shares were traded, thrice Friday's hefty total,
to close 8 1/4 up at 40p.
Stores analysts were at a loss as to why the shares are suddenly so popular,
although good results from the smaller Goldsmiths jewellery group yesterday
provided some encouragement. Ratners has been in its closed season since
January, barring any boardroom comment on trading. But privately the company
is thought to be concerned that an acknowledged improvement in sales may not
justify the recent share price rise. Ratners has previously said it expects
its results in 1993 to mirror last year's Pounds 25m loss.
Inevitable speculation has raised hopes that the company will unveil some
pleasant surprise with its results, either a disposal or a better than
expected turnround in trading. This has also been linked to rumours in New
York that Zale, the US jeweller, may soon emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on the back of improved business.
Other suggestions, however, have been that Ratners may take the opportunity
of the share rise to make a rights issue, a necessary step in its recovery
in the opinion of some stores specialists.

FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI leaps on US demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US INTEREST drove ICI shares higher once again. Traders took their cue from
Friday's dealings in New York and marked up UK prices at the start of
dealing yesterday.
The shares remained strong throughout the day and closed 41 ahead at 1284p.
However, turnover of 1.3m shares was thin even for a highly priced stock and
suggested more of a reaction than genuine interest.
The price has been volatile ahead of the detailing of the Pounds 1.3bn
rights issue, believed to be the biggest ever, to fund the impending
demerger. ICI's board will meet at 7.00am tomorrow and is expected to
announce a one-for-three cash call at around 600p a Zeneca share.
Subsequently dealing in the unofficial 'grey' market in the new ICI and
Zeneca shares will begin at 2.30pm.
US investors, who unusually are able to take part in the rights issue, have
been very positive about the prospects for the demerged companies,
particularly Zeneca, which generates 40 per cent of its sales in the US.
However, even optimistic houses in the UK financial community unconnected
with the issue believe that the shares are expensive above 1250p.

FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures moved sharply ahead on the first day of the new equity
account on hopes of a cut in UK base rates and on the release of encouraging
economic data, writes Joel Kibazo.
Initial selling of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index saw it
relinquish 4 points to 2,797 in the first half-hour of trading. But a more
positive mood on interest rates drew the buyers off the sidelines, causing a
turnround in the fortunes of the contract and sending it sharply ahead.
Further demand was encouraged by the release towards midday of official
statistics showing a rise in consumer credit but only a slight increase in
producer prices. However this led to a squeeze in the June future contract.
That squeeze continued in the afternoon as UK traders focused on the strong
performance of Wall Street, the June contract finishing at the day's high of
2,843, a jump of 44 from Friday's finish. However, turnover was modest at
8,488 lots by the official close.
Most of the activity in the traded options sector was in the two index
options. A total of 29,032 contracts had been dealt by the finish, of which
some 8,871 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,118 in the Euro FT-SE option.
Lonrho was the most active of the stock options, with a total of 1,535 lots
dealt, followed by BP with 1,124 traded. Fisons, Ladbroke and Glaxo were
also busy.

FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar strength helps blue chip
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recovery in UK equities gathered pace yesterday as a strong dollar
encouraged overseas earners and the political troubles of the UK government
revived hopes for a cut in domestic interest rates. Economic data showing a
rise in consumer credit but only modest growth in producer prices also
buttressed the stock market's hopes for inflation-free expansion in the UK
economy. A final flurry of optimism came in London when Wall Street gained
25 Dow points in early trade.
The FT-SE 100 Index broke through the 2,800 mark again in fine style,
closing 36.1 up at 2,829.8, the best of the day. But trading volume was
fairly modest at 587.5m shares, against 614.7m on Friday, and most of the
interest was in the Footsie-listed blue chips. ICI was a strong feature as
fund managers finalised positions ahead of the pricing tomorrow of the
Pounds 1.3bn rights issue of Zeneca shares.
A US house was believed to be operating a sizeable programme trade involving
investment in both UK and European equities. Firmness in stock index futures
followed the underlying stock market rather than leading it; last week's
selling of the Footsie June future, said to be by an institution moving from
equities into UK gilts, had evidently been completed.
The political uproar following last week's voting setback for Mr John
Major's government at both local and national electoral levels, culminating
in revived calls for the removal of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the
exchequer, rebounded in the stock market's favour. The pressure on the
government, it was thought, might force out the cut in UK base rates of
which the City of London has felt cheated.
But London equity traders sounded unimpressed by the base rate suggestions,
and pointed to the dollar's strength as the chief factor behind yesterday's
rise in share prices. The pharmaceuticals, oils and tobacco sectors all
stood out strongly for this reason.
Domestic stocks focused more on the Pounds 232m rise in consumer lending in
April, the largest monthly increase for two years. A number of important
retail groups are due to report progress over the next fortnight, including
Marks and Spencer, Grand Metropolitan and Allied-Lyons, and the stock market
is looking, yet again, for evidence that consumers are providing the driving
force behind the economic recovery.
With attention returning to the Footsie-listed stocks, the performance from
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was less striking. At 3,125.6, the Mid 250 was up by
16.1, or 0.5 per cent, compared with the gain of around 1.3 per cent on the
Footsie.
Market strategists remained optimistic towards equities. NatWest Securities
continued to urge clients to 'buy into weakness'. While holding its Footsie
range forecast unchanged at 2,700-3,000 for this year, NatWest has raised
its 1994 target from 3,200 to 3,300.
Strauss Turnbull, London securities arm of Societe Generale, is raising its
GDP forecast for this year to 2 per cent and for 1994 to 3.1 per cent. It is
lifting its end-1994 Footsie target to 2,900. Strauss has also become more
optimistic on UK interest rates as the Bundesbank continues to signal its
intention to cut German rates.

FT  11 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sell programs cut back early
Dow advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER posting strong early gains on short-covering by dealers, a round of
late afternoon sell programs left US share prices little changed at the
close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.09 up at 3,443.28, some 25
points below the day's high. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended just 0.49 ahead
at 442.80, while the Nasdaq composite closed 1.38 firmer at 682.82. New York
SE volume was 230.6m shares.
The week opened with investor sentiment still subdued amid growing concern
about the US economy, but there was some good news from Europe, where the
existence of a fragile ceasefire in Bosnia reduced the likelihood that
President Clinton would order an immediate military intervention in the
region by US-led UN forces. Last week, analysts attributed some of the
softness in markets to worries that US troops would soon become enmeshed in
the Yugoslav civil war.
Political factors aside, and in the absence of fresh economic data, the
markets yesterday were primarily hostage to technical forces.
At the opening, dealers bought stocks to cover recently established short
positions, both in the underlying cash and futures markets. This lifted
prices sharply in the first hour, and persuaded investors to join in the
buying, allowing the markets to gain some momentum for the first time in a
while.
Airline shares rallied initially, but ended mixed after the late sell-off.
AMR firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 67 7/8 , but UAL lost Dollars 1 at
Dollars 134 and Delta Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 56. USAir was unchanged at
Dollars 21 1/2 .
There was a similar pattern to trading in drug issues, which firmed early on
but ran into selling later. Johnson &amp; Johnson was finally Dollars  5/8 up at
Dollars 43 7/8 .
Eastman Kodak improved Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 50 3/4 after two broking
houses, Merrill Lynch and Wertheim Schroder, raised their ratings on the
stock, apparently in anticipation that the company will soon announce the
sale of an asset.
Some cyclical stocks were in demand, notably Caterpillar, up Dollars 1 at
Dollars 69 7/8 , General Motors, Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 40 3/4 , and
RJR Nabisco, Dollars  1/8 firmer at Dollars 5 7/8 . Philip Morris, which
rallied last week on news that a rival tobacco manufacturer was
discontinuing price cuts on its discount brands, made further strides,
finishing Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 52 3/4 in volume of 6.9m shares.
On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft moved ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 89 1/8
after brokerage firm Alex Brown made positive comments on the company.
Canada
LOSSES IN heavily weighted Northern Telecom and several forestry firms
offset an advance by gold shares and left the Toronto market little changed.
Overall activity was moderate.
The TSE 300 index was off 0.5 at 3,778.5, while declines narrowly led rises
by 341 to 320 after volume of 53.8m shares.
Eight of the 14 sub-group indices lost ground, led by industrial products,
off 1.1 per cent. The gold shares index climbed 1.5 per cent, while
conglomerates rose 1.2 per cent.
Traders said talk that analysts are downward revising Nortel's
second-quarter earnings estimates hurt the stock, which fell CDollars 1 7/8
to CDollars 43 5/8 .

FT  11 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei regains 21,000
level on late futures activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WAYNE APONTE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE short-covering in the futures markets triggered program buying that
erased the entire session's losses and lifted the Nikkei average above the
21,000 level for the first time since last year, writes Wayne Aponte in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 243.35, or 1.2 per cent, higher at 21,054.71,
after moving between 20,668.31 and 21,062.64. The last time that the index
settled above 21,000 was on March 4, 1992. The Topix index of all first
section issues rose 18.28 to 1,639,05, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
firmed 1.41 to 1,279.12.
Volume was estimated at 500m shares, compared with Friday's final 587m.
Advancing issues overwhelmed declines by 839 to 228, with 127 issues
unchanged.
The day's advance will provide a boost to investors in the short term, but
the question facing equity trading is whether the Nikkei will maintain
current levels.
Mr Masanori Hoshina, a manager of futures trading at Cosmo Securities,
described the gains made in the final minutes of trading yesterday as a
'mirage' which had minimal connection to fundamentals. Other brokers said
the market was still considered expensive and that institutional investors
pressed for revenue may sell into any subsequent advance above 21,000.
The pharmaceutical sector was targeted aggressively. Green Cross rose Y80 to
Y1,440 on a weekend report that the company will conduct gene therapy for
people infected with the HIV virus which causes Aids. Shionogi, a leading
pharmaceutical maker, gained Y83 at Y970, while Ono Pharmaceutical advanced
Y200 to Y5,900.
Foreign investors purchased shipbuilding issues. Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, the day's most active stock, rose Y10 to Y7,011, Mitsui
Engineering and Shipbuilding Y8 to Y477 and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries Y6 to Y535.
But profit-taking pressured Canon after the company cut its consolidated
pre-tax profits forecast on Friday by about 37 per cent for this calender
year due to the appreciation of the yen against the dollar. The shares lost
Y50 to Y1,480.
Other issues in the export-related sectors also lost ground: Sony slipped
Y40 to Y4,850, TDK Y20 to Y3,980 and Pioneer Electronic Y20 to Y2,580.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 230.99 higher at 22,953.57 in volume of
29.4m shares.
Roundup
MANY OF the region's markets were weaker yesterday.
HONG KONG met downward pressure from a slide in HSBC Holdings. The Hang Seng
index declined 62.42 to 6,739.23 in turnover that contracted to HKDollars
4bn from last Friday's HKDollars 4.7bn.
HSBC receded HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 68 and its Hang Seng Bank unit lost
HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 55.50. HSBC is plagued by suggestions that it
has been linked to the Indian stock market scandal. It has 23 offices in
India.
Cheung Kong dipped 30 cents to HKDollars 26.60, while Hutchison was
unchanged at HKDollars 20.40.
AUSTRALIA was unsettled by a lower earnings forecast from Brambles
Industries, the transport group. The All Ordinaries index closed 13.3 lower
at 1672.0.
Brambles weakened 94 cents to ADollars 13, its lowest since November 1990.
Elsewhere, BHP lost 14 cents to ADollars 13.90 and CRA slipped 22 cents to
ADollars 12.98.
Trade was subdued, with 256.9m shares worth ADollars 282.3m changing hands.
Falls outpaced rises by three-to-two. Brokers said that the market remained
nervous, waiting for leads from overseas or for more promising profits
results from the banks over the next two weeks.
BANGKOK closed slightly softer, although banks and finance and brokerage
firms recovered some early losses. The SET index fell to a low of 836.20 in
mid-afternoon trade before regaining ground to finish a net 3.55 off at
841.84. Turnover was thin at Bt1.9bn.
Bangkok Bank finished Bt1 ahead at Bt125 and Thai Farmers Bank was down Bt4
at Bt864.
MANILA was depressed by poor first-quarter earnings from Philippine Long
Distance Telephone, and the composite index declined 11.29 to 1,642.62.
Turnover amounted to 454.3m pesos, compared with Friday's 447.3m pesos. PLDT
retreated 10 pesos to 990 pesos and Manila Electric dipped 2.50 pesos to 315
pesos.
SINGAPORE closed mixed, although sentiment remained firm, with Malaysian
speculative OTC shares taking centre stage. The Straits Times Industrial
index was down a slight 2.80 at 1,772.02.
Malaysia's Khong Guan Flour advanced SDollars 26 to SDollars 326 on rumours
that the company would be used as a back door listing vehicle for a key
Malaysian government-linked firm.
KUALA LUMPUR was steady, with activity focusing on speculative and
plantation stocks, although profit-taking was widespread in the afternoon,
dragging down most shares from their day's highs. The composite index ended
3.59 up at 716.54.
BOMBAY saw a sharp early rally but prices came back from their highs as
public sector mutual funds took profits. The BSE index closed 11 higher at
2,230.75.
NEW ZEALAND slipped on weakness in the forestry sector, Fletcher Challenge
losing 8 cents to NZDollars 2.56 and Carter Holt Harvey 4 cents to NZDollars
2.92. The NZSE-40 index fell 21.30 to 1,557.04 in turnover of NZDollars 19m.

FT  11 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan sheds 1.9% on Fiat,
Generali weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES made a restrained start to the week with the outcome of the Danish
referendum on Maastricht continuing to weigh on some investors, writes Our
Markets Staff.
MILAN was hit by weak Fiat and Generali stocks and technical selling ahead
of tomorrow's expiry of monthly options contracts and Friday's end of the
monthly trading account. The Comit index shed 10.46 or 1.9 per cent to
532.62.
Some investors were also disappointed not to have seen a  1/2 point cut in
the discount rate from its current 11 per cent in response to the continuing
strength of the lira and Friday's confidence vote victory for Prime Minister
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
However, Mr Nicholas Potter of Credito Italiano International in London
believed that the new government would need to make progress on its
additional fiscal package before the Bank of Italy would move.
Fiat continued to be hit by last week's poor April car sales data and fears
of a dividend cut. The shares fell L271 to fix at L6,330 before easing to
L6,320 after hours.
Generali dipped L1,000 to settle at L37,950 and then slipped to L37,925
after-hours as analysts sought clarification of the complex Alleanza rights
issue, announced late on Friday, before concluding that it would not be
unfavouable for shareholders. Alleanza fell L672 to L17,035.
FRANKFURT closed marginally lower amid thin volume after early selling
tested the 1,600 level. The DAX index closed down 2.89 to 1,609.03 after
hitting a low 1,600.73, in turnover of DM5.3bn.
Most stocks fell in line with the index. Commerzbank, however, plunged DM15
or 5.1 per cent, to DM277 on worries over Hafnia Holding, the Danish insurer
which filed for bankruptcy yesterday. Commerzbank is one of Hafnia's leading
creditors. Investors were slow to react to an announcement by Hoechst and
Schering that talks were underway to merge the companies' agriculture
chemicals sectors. While traders said the move would help the companies save
costs, Hoechst fell DM2 to DM234, while Schering declined DM1 to DM768.50.
ZURICH put in a firm performance with the strong dollar and hopes for lower
interest rates behind a 16.5 rise in the SMI index to 2,179.1.
Trading centred on UBS bearers, SFr6 higher at SFr933, and Roche
certificates, SFr70 ahead at SFr4,520.
CS Holding added SFr50 to SFr2,530 after Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating
agency, said that it had left the rating of Credit Suisse unchanged.
PARIS was moribund ahead of the government's budget statement which came
just after the close. The CAC-40 index slipped 1.36 to 1,877.21. Among the
movers UAP, off FFr6 at FFr525, and Paribas, down FFr7.50 at FFr405.50, were
affected by news that Hafnia was filing for bankruptcy.
AMSTERDAM saw KLM move ahead Fl 1.10 to Fl 28.20 as the airline announced
closer co-operation with Garuda of Indonesia and made an upbeat statement on
plans with three other European airlines to defend market share. The CBS
Tendency index rose 0.9 to 108.8.
STOCKHOLM lost a little momentum in late trading after early gains on news
of an agreement between employers and unions in the industrial sector on a
new two-year contract for employees. The Affarsvarlden index closed down
0.30 at 1,068.40 in turnover of SKr1.2bn, with some profit-taking in
evidence following recent strong gains. Since the beginning of the year the
index has risen some 15 per cent.
COPENHAGEN was hit by a latest opinion poll over the Maastricht treaty
indicating a narrowing of the gap between supporters and opponents. The KFX
index lost 0.48 to 87.37. The index had been strong recently on hopes of a
positive vote on the May 18 referendum, but the latest Gallup poll taken
Sunday showed 46 per cent approved the treaty while 34 per cent opposed the
issue.
Den Danske Bank was hit by Hafnia Holding, the Dutch insurer, filing for
bankruptcy. The bank, a leading creditor to Hafnia along with Commerzbank of
Germany, fell DKr8 to DKr319.
ISTANBUL surged 6.5 per cent, the 75-share index rising 1.11 to 7,864.52.

FT  11 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Germany and France cast their shadows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of a continued rally in the Scandinavian markets, weakness
elsewhere in continental Europe depressed the region's overall performance.
Investors were unnerved by uncertainty over the Bosnian crisis which
threatens economic and political stability in Europe, and continued gloom
over the economic outlook. Germany moved lower amid a spate of corporate
earnings announcements, while France was depressed by poor economic
statistics.
The FT-Actuaries World index was virtually flat on the week, offset by the
relative strength in the US, which itself was helped by a firm bond market.
Lower interest rates and hopes of a 'yes' vote in the second Maastricht
referendum lifted Denmark. Mr Yngve Ness, manager at Unibank Securities,
believes that the market will be the best European performer this year. A
further cut in interest rates is expected after the May 18 referendum and
the bond yield curve is expected to normalise in the near term.
An increase in liquidity due to lower domestic interest rates has also
helped Finland and Sweden. However, among the Scandinavian markets, Sweden
remains vulnerable to the domestic political situation and a large budget
deficit, and may face profit-taking in the short run if interest rates fail
to decline further.
Mr Paul Brunker, strategist at Robert Fleming, reckons that dull trading in
France and Germany will continue in the near term. Among strong performers
in Europe, he selects Spain, which is likely to resolve the currency crisis
in the near term, and Italy, where investor confidence seems to be
returning.
Hong Kong was subdued on cautiousness over the Sino-British talks. However,
Mr Peter Lyon, strategist at Smith New Court, believes that due to the close
links between the colony's interest rates and US rates, the easing on US
bond markets will help Hong Kong.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Thoughts on a rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING money market dealers resumed speculation that the UK might cut base
rates again this year as Mr John Major's premiership remained under pressure
following electoral defeats last week, writes James Blitz.
For the last two months, the yield curve in short-dated sterling futures has
sloped upwards as dealers took the view that UK base rates had bottomed at 6
per cent.
However, the government's savage defeat last week in both the Newbury
by-election and the county council elections has led to some small
speculation that the government might be panicked into another base rate cut
to stimulate the economy further.
One major London dealer claimed he was looking for a  1/2 to 1 percentage
point cut in base rates because recent political embarrassment had raised
the possibility of a short-term setback in the UK's economic recovery.
Another factor compounding the hopes of the rate cut bulls was yesterday's
producer price inflation data for April.
This was on the modest side, giving the government a little more room to
ease policy if it so wished. Output prices rose an annualised 3.8 per cent
in the year to April, compared to 3.7 per cent in the year to March. Input
prices actually fell between March and April.
Last night, the futures yield curve once again reflected downward sloping
interest rates between June and September. The June contract closed at
94.05, a level anticipating three-month money at 5.95 per cent by the middle
of next month.
There was far heavier trading in the September contract, however, which
finished 9 basis points higher on the day at 94.15. At this level it is
pricing three-month money in the autumn at 5.85 per cent.
Short-dated interest rates in the sterling cash market responded similarly,
declining by at least  1/16 percentage point across the board.
The three-month sterling deposit rate ended at 5 7/8 per cent from a
previous close of 5 15/16 per cent. The one-year rate finished at around 6
1/32 per cent from a previous close of 6 3/16 per cent. This was in spite of
difficulties removing a daily shortage which was forecast in the morning at
Pounds 850m. There was late assistance of Pounds 355m.
Speculation of lower base rates was also felt by sterling, which fell 3
pfennigs against the D-Mark.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises close to DM1.61
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR rebounded sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, peaking at
DM1.6095 in European trading, as dealers switched their attention on to the
continuing recession in Germany and away from the slow upswing in the US,
writes James Blitz.
Yesterday's strong performance by the dollar appears to have had its roots
in the market's reaction to last Friday's worse than expected US non-farm
payroll figure for April.
Although the dollar lost ground in the immediate aftermath of those figures,
it bounced back late on Friday. By yesterday morning, the market appeared to
be taking the view that the dollar's upside must be strong if it refused to
weaken on a poor payroll figure.
Adding to the D-Mark's intrinsic weakness were new indications at the
weekend that the state of Germany's finances is in a poor shape.
At the weekend, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, underlined that
the forecast for Germany's budget deficit will have to be revised upwards
over the next few years. At the same time, IG Metall, Germany's powerful
engineering union, was also confident on Sunday that it would receive fresh
support for strike action in eastern Germany this week.
The perceived weakness of the D-Mark helped the dollar to a close of
DM1.6045, up more than 2 pfennigs on the day. The US currency finished New
York trading at DM1.6077.
However, sterling slipped sharply against the D-Mark as dealers grew
concerned that the new problems facing Mr John Major's government could
trigger another cut in UK base rates.
The government's savage defeat in the Newbury by-election last week has
already put Mr Major under pressure to sack Mr Norman Lamont, his
chancellor. For the first time yesterday, UK money markets were starting to
bet on another easing in UK monetary policy before the autumn.
The pound ended 3 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.4625 and 4 cents weaker at
Dollars 1.5350. Sterling was a full percentage point down on the day when
measured against its exchange rate index, closing at 79.9.
Mr Steve Hannah, director of IBJ International in London, believes there is
unlikely to be a resumption of the very negative psychology towards sterling
seen in early February.
He considers that new evidence that the UK economy is recovering and
Germany's difficulties should provide a floor for the pound at DM2.45.
Inside the European exchange rate mechanism, the main focus of the day was
on the Danish krone, which continued to slip against the D-Mark in the
run-up to next Tuesday's Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
Pushing the krone down was a poll showing support for the treaty slipping to
46 per cent, with 34 per cent opposed.
The krone weakened to around DKr3.8640 per D-Mark from a previous DKr3.8525.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian wool industry hopes
for Russian deals
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN wool industry should soon be able to announce a breakthrough
in its attempts to restart the wool trade with Russia, Mr Mac Drysdale,
chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, said yesterday, reports Reuter
from Sydney.
He told a news conference that negotiations over some projects aimed at
lifting wool demand in Russia, as well as in Europe and Asia, should be
finalised in the next few months.
'I think there will be a breakthrough in the Russian (market) . . . in the
next few months,' he said. 'Whether it comes in the form of equity in
Russian mills or whether it comes from some other enterprise . . . remains
to be seen.' There has been speculation that Australia could supply wool to
Russia in return for equity in processing mills.
Mr Drysdale said the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, which is
responsible for reducing the 3.96m-bale stockpile and the ADollars 2.28bn
(Pounds 1bn) debt, had been involved in negotiations over projects to boost
wool demand. Some negotiations had been taking place for years.
'Some of the projects . . . will be finalised in the next few months,' he
said.
Options to restart trade with Russia could include barter deals and joint
ventures, the AWC chairman said. 'As well as getting wool into (the former
Soviet Union) we have to make sure the wool is consumed there.'
Mr Drysdale said Australia's unofficial wool stockpile, resulting from
farmers delaying selling wool in the hope that prices will pick up, could be
as high as 180,000 bales.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentinian crop disaster
declared after heavy rain
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY RAINFALL in the province of Buenos Aires over the last week has caused
an estimated USDollars 100m worth damage to farms, officials said yesterday.
Buenos Aires province, which covers a large part of Argentina's fertile
pampas plains, produces most of the country's wheat, soyabean and maize
crops.
Mr Raul Sarachu, the provincial government's director of agricultural
economics, said yesterday that about 30 per cent of the province's maize
output and about 15 per cent of its soyabean production had been lost. He
said rainfall had been excessive all this year: 'It is an abnormal
situation. We have had a year's rainfall in three or four months.'
Earlier in the year, the south of Buenos Aires province suffered severe
drought. Since then constant heavy rain has fallen mainly on the province's
low-lying north-west and south-west regions, where drainage is insufficient.
Mr Sarachu, while warning that estimates were still unreliable said about 60
per cent of the total 5m to 6m hectares in the affected region were flooded.
The region produces 1.5m to 2m tonnes of maize a year, plus 800,000 to
900,000 tonnes of soyabeans and about 350,000 tonnes of sunflower seeds.
The provincial government has declared the area a disaster zone, allowing
farmers to reschedule loans from the provincial government's bank, and given
them a five month extension on tax payments. The farmers pay about Dollars
60m to Dollars 70m a year in local taxes.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Californian farm yields at high
water mark - Unrestricted irrigation and cheap immigrant labour give growers
a big advantage / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN BRITISH farmers discuss crop irrigation, they talk in terms of
sprinkling inches of water per acre. Maximum applications, even in a dry
summer, add up to the equivalent of about 6 inches of rain in a season, and
that is only normally used on crops like vegetables and potatoes.
Californian farmers, whose agriculture I have been studying for the last few
days, speak of 'acre feet' of water. It is not uncommon for them to apply
four or five feet of water to every acre of their land in a single season -
eight to ten times as much water every year as UK farmers do occasionally.
That said, the combination of all this irrigation with the reliable, warm,
dry climate enables Californian farmers to produce prodigious yields and
quality from what is essentially an area of marginal farming land, in other
words a desert.
Moreover, California claims to be by far the biggest producer of farm
products of all American states, including Texas. The fact that water can be
applied at will, whenever needed, means that the state can produce about 250
different farming commodities and, again in a US context, it is the most
significant producer of 30 of them. It does most of that on just 8 per cent
of the 40m hectares (100m acres) in the state, as only flat valley land is
irrigated.
Furthermore, the state's propaganda says California exports almost Dollars
5bn worth of its gross agricultural product of Dollars 20bn. Each
Californian farmer is said to feed 129 people, 97 in the US and 32 in other
countries. There is little doubt that many feel it is their right and
privilege to feed the world.
At least that is the way they are begining to feel again this year. A year
ago they were still suffering from a drought that had lasted for 6 years and
reduced production. The shortage of precipitation was not so much over
California itself, because most of the state gets only a few inches of rain
in a year. It was the lack of snow in the High Sierra and Rocky Mountains
that was the main cause of the problem.
It is the melting snows from these peaks that is trapped by a series of
enormous dams as it flows down the white water rivers each spring and is
then distributed via a complex network of canals providing the water for
much of the irrigation as well as for the fast-expanding cities on the west
coast.
Last winter however, there were heavy snows in the mountains and
significantly more rain than usual over much of California. For the first
time since the mid-1980s many farmers are able to use as much water as they
need for their crops and they have regained confidence that their
extravagant ways can continue.
The predominant method of irrigation is by the flood system - pumping water
from open ditches and furrows between the rows of crops until it soaks into
the soil and reaches their roots. It is undoubtedly the cheapest and most
primitive method of irrigation, dating back to biblical times. But it is
also vulnerable to the greatest waste of water by evaporation in the hot
sun.
A few farmers are using more economical sprinkler systems and some have
installed even more efficient drip irrigation, most appropriate for fruit or
nut orchards. But it is clear that most are buying their water cheaply
enough not to feel they need to adopt more economical methods. Indeed it is
well known that some still have a number of years to run on water leases for
which prices were fixed nearly 40 years ago.
Meanwhile, those farmers not fortunate enough to be alongside one of the
many canals that cross the valleys and who have to pump their irrigation
water from deep bore holes are reporting that they have had to double the
depth of their wells over recent years to find sufficient supplies. And the
deeper the well, the more the electricity or fuel oil is needed to pump
water out of it. These are the people who are taking more care to conserve.
I confess that I had expected that pressure from environmentalists, which
finds animated expression among many influential west coast residents not a
million miles away from Hollywood, would have forced California's farmers to
go greener. But in spite of publicity to that effect this does not seem to
be the case.
Except for small but noticeable pockets, there appears to be little attempt
by individual Californian farmers to address the environmental concerns of
the urban population. The landscape across the productive valleys is almost
devoid of vegetation save for massive crops of cotton, sugar beet, alfalfa
and the like, and, as with so much of US (and European) society, the guiding
rule seems to be: 'If it's there, use it and let the future take care of
itself.'
I am bound to say that, given the urban expansion of California, which is as
great each year as in many Third World countries, and the inevitable
increased demands this will impose on water resources, I did not share the
confidence of some of the farmers I met that all would be well for them in
the future. And without virtually unlimited supplies of cheap water every
year, most of them would be out of business.
The other benefit that Californian farmers currently enjoy is cheap labour.
Apart from the farmers themselves few white people work on the land.
Virtually all the labourers are Mexicans who have come across the Rio Grande
in search of work.
Some of the workers are legal with proper work permits, especially since the
US government announced an amnesty a few years ago to enable the illegals to
become legal without penalty. But since then it is estimated that at least a
further 2m illegal workers have come into the US and the authorities have
bowed to the inevitable and turned a blind eye to most cases.
At least half of these new illegal immigrants are estimated to come to
California for seasonal work, and although farmers claim to provide them
with reasonable minimum wages and conditions, they concede there are far too
many workers chasing too few jobs each year and employers would be saints if
they paid more than they had to under those circumstances.
Whether this will change if and when the North American Free Trade Agreement
is signed and Mexican workers are allowed even freer passage is unclear.
Although it seems unlikely that they will be able to find a better or more
convenient state in which to seek work than California.
It occurs to me, as I continue my tour, however, that these benefits of
cheap, essentially subsidised water and cheap, partially illegal labour, are
factors which are unlikely to be considered by the negotiators of any
settlement in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade aiming to produce
fair agricultural competition throughout the world.
Yet these hidden subsidies will give Californian farmers an enormous
economic advantage over their European cousins.

NORWAY's CRUDE oil production could reach 3m barrels a day in 1996 or 1997,
a 20 per cent rise over present levels, according to the energy and industry
ministry.
The minority Labour government's long-term programme sees crude output
peaking in 1996 at 2.5m barrels a day. But Mr Gunnar Myrvang, state
secretary of the ministry, said according to latest oil company reports, it
seemed that level could be achieved by 1994.
'In view of this and because of the potential for improved oil recovery and
prolonged plateau production from fields, I would, as an optimist, not be
surprised if Norwegian oil production increased to 3m barrels per day in
1996-97,' Mr Myrvang said.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese boost for gold demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIEVES HAVE been throwing grenades and using automatic weapons during raids
on Hong Kong jewellery stores to help satisfy China's sharply increasing
appetite for gold. Stolen merchandise is swiftly transported to the mainland
where the street price of gold, depending on the exchange rate used, is
equivalent to USDollars 550 to Dollars 600 a troy ounce, about Dollars 200
an ounce above the world market price.
This is one example provided by the Gold Fields Minerals Services
consultancy organisation of the way unprecedented gold demand in China is
extending well beyond its own borders. Jewellery producers in Malaysia, Hong
Kong and Taiwan are working flat-out to keep pace with demand from Chinese
wholesalers.
Mr Tim Green, GFMS's chief consultant, says jewellery shop raids have always
been a fact of life in Hong Kong but the number of incidents and their
ferocity have risen dramatically as local organised crime bosses have
brought armed gangsters in from China.
In its latest annual gold survey, GFMS says China emerged last year as the
world's largest consumer of the precious metal and private purchases
exceeded 350 tonnes - or more than was produced at all the US gold mines.
It also suggests that China's central bank might have bought a substantial
part - perhaps 250 tonnes - of the 400 tonnes of gold sold by the
Netherlands central bank late in 1992.
'In a nation with over one fifth of the world's population, the phenomenon
of gold purchasing, previously limited mainly to the southern provinces, has
expanded northwards, taking in Shanghai and now Beijing, where consumers
eagerly buy pieces of chuk kam (or 'pure gold') jewellery, sometimes
weighing up to 100 grammes each,' the survey says.
'In late 1992 and early 1993, with growing fears about inflation, workers
decided to spend rather than save their year-end bonuses, also to the
benefit of jewellery consumption.'
The survey warns that the present Chinese gold boom is similar to the one in
1988 at a time when inflation there reached 18 per cent, prompting
widespread hoarding of consumer goods and a surge in gold buying.
The situation was then brought under control by the authorities clamping
down with a two-year austerity programme that caused a sharp drop in gold
consumption.
However, 'the degree of market liberalisation and devolution of economic
control now make it unlikely that the authorities would repeat this policy,'
the survey suggests.
Apart from Chinese demand, hedging by gold producers and sales by central
banks will be the important determinants of the gold price this year, says
Mr Stewart Murray, GFMS chief executive. If supply from these two latter
sources 'proves not to be overwhelming, the prospects for sustained
investment demand, and consequently a continued recovery in the price, will
improve enormously'.
GFMS is owned by Gold Fields of South Africa, Newmont Mining, the biggest
North American gold producer, and Renison Goldfields, an Australian natural
resources group.
Other important points from the survey, widely considered to be the most
authoritative in the industry, include:
Total gold supply last year rose by 12 per cent from the 1991 level to 3,182
tonnes. This included a 3.7 per cent increase in newly-mined gold in the
western world, to 1,841 tonnes. When the former eastern bloc is included,
the increase was of 2.9 per cent to 2,217 tonnes;
Central bank and other official sales were the highest since 1968, at 910
tonnes. But substantial purchases reduced the net supply from this source to
599 tonnes;
Hedging by producers contributed a net 155 tonnes of accelerated supply;
On the demand side, total fabrication demand rose by 11 per cent to 2,859
tonnes, and therefore exceeded the combined supply from western world mine
production and old gold scrap by 583 tonnes.
Jewellery fabrication remained the most important component of demand,
rising 15 per cent to a record 2,461 tonnes and accounting for 86 per cent
of all fabrication demand.
Average western world gold production cash costs fell by 5 per cent to
USDollars 247 an ounce and total costs were down by 4 per cent to Dollars
300.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London metal traders 'can
survive copper losses'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL LONDON Metal Exchange trading houses suffered huge losses because of
the sudden and steep collapse in copper's price. But suggestions that the
LME faced a catastrophe similar to the 1985 collapse of its tin market were
dismissed last night by traders and exchange officials.
'The market has had a great shock. A large number of players have had their
fingers burned but they were people who could afford to have their fingers
burned. There is no chance of anyone going out of business,' said one
trader.
Mr David King, the LME's chief executive, said the market was 'deeper, more
liquid and has many more checks and balances', than in 1985. He said the LME
had joined a clearing house system since then and the exchange and its
members were operating under the 'umbrella' of the UK Financial Services
Act. 'The market is more professional and the probability of anything like
the tin collapse happening again is very remote.'
The three-month price of copper dropped by nearly one quarter, from Dollars
2,200 a tonne to Dollars 1,710, in only five weeks. Traders suggested those
who were badly exposed had granted options at 90 US cents to 95 cents a lb,
mainly to North American copper producers. Last night three-month copper
closed at 79.4 cents.
Mr Vivian Davies, chief executive of Brandeis, part of the Pechiney group,
insisted that, while options contributed to the speed of the movement,
copper's price had been fundamentally too high. 'The main problem was the
lack of liquidity. When volatility moves sharply it is inevitable, with
everyone trying to do the same thing at the same time, that the market dries
up.'

GOLD and other precious metals closed easier on the London bullion market,
with the New York markets failing to provide any new impetus, dealers said.
Gold fixed at Dollars 356.80 a troy ounce in the afternoon, 55 cents up on
the morning fix as the market absorbed the Gold Fields Mineral Services
survey showing record jewellery demand last year. Dealers said the market
had definitely found a new base for itself with good support around Dollars
352. London's robusta COFFEE futures were unable to sustain early gains with
roasters largely remaining sidelined except for a few enquiries for June and
July shipment Brazilian supplies. Dealers noted there continued to be
reasonable interest in options both in London and New York. Recent sharp
price swings in both directions have increased trade interest in using the
options market to hedge their physical supplies. On the LME three-month
ALUMINIUM was again hindered by overhead resistance above Dollars 1,150 a
tonne, with business mostly taking place below this level. However, news
that March IPAI producer inventories were down by 27,000 tonnes helped to
restrict the downward reaction.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Long-dated UK gilts recover lost ground -
Announcement of better-than-expected producer prices data prompts positive
reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government bond market reacted positively to the news of
better-than-expected producer prices at both input and output levels.
This was best reflected in the very long end of the market. The 8 3/4 per
cent gilt due 2017 gained just over a quarter of a point, recovering some of
the ground lost when the recent spate of good economic news created gloom in
the most inflation-wary camps.
An additional Pounds 250m tranche of the 2017 stock, announced on Friday,
was sold without difficulty by the Bank of England yesterday, along with
Pounds 350m of 8 per cent gilts due 2003.
Market sentiment was helped by the demand exhibited for these issues. Some
resilience was also shown at the shorter end of the market. The one area to
sag was the middle range, where the next auction is expected, although the
Bank of England has yet to make an announcement.
The 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2007 was down by about  1/8 .
While the market seems to have been little moved by the Conservatives'
losses in last Thursday's elections, one economist commented that gilts
might have responded more strongly to the good news on inflation without the
political setback and the consequent weakening of the pound.
ELSEWHERE, excitement focused on Denmark, where the government bond market
fell sharply in response to a narrowing of the gap between the 'yes' and
'no' camps ahead of the Maastricht referendum on May 18, according to recent
opinion polls.
A weekend poll showed 46 per cent of Danes intending to vote 'yes' with 34
per cent against. Before last June's surprise 'no' vote, the figures were
similar.
If the Danes repeat that rejection, a speculative attack would be expected
on the Danish krone, which weakened against the D-Mark yesterday.
The yield on the 10-year government bond rose to 7.76 per cent, compared
with 7.6 per cent on Friday night.
The Spanish peseta is seen as the next most vulnerable currency and Spanish
government bonds were also relatively poor performers on what was a
generally quiet day for continental European markets.
Trade in French government bonds was on ice ahead of the mini-budget
statement, which came too late in the day for the European markets.
There was little impetus in Germany. The next repo rate announcement is due
tomorrow but only a thin slice is expected to be cut from the 7.71 per cent
set last week.
One feature of the continental markets was that Dutch bonds continued to
outperform German bunds. With the guilder remaining strong, hopes are alive
that interest rates can continue to be cut independently of German ones.
Dutch 10-year bonds were yielding 12 basis points less than the German
equivalent, putting about 4 more basis points distance between them. One
economist said: 'It's a bit like holding German stock without east Germany.'
A SURGE in the Nikkei stock market index, pushing it over 21,000 for the
first time since March last year, undermined Japanese government bonds.
The Nikkei was driven by the view that the Japanese economy would soon show
signs of recovery.
Other negative factors for the bonds market were an abatement of the yen's
rise against the dollar and the rise in US Treasury yields.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 bond due 2002 rose from 4.35 per cent to
4.43 per cent in Tokyo trading, and the futures contract fell from 108.27 to
108.00. Both figures weakened further in London trading.
US TREASURY prices firmed at the long end of the maturity range on thin
trading yesterday on the heels of gains in the futures market.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 104
1/32 , yielding 6.804 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , to yield 3.758 per cent.
In the absence of fresh economic news, the market's attention was focused
firmly on the forthcoming quarterly refunding round. Over the next four
days, the Treasury is due to sell Dollars 16bn in three-year notes (today),
Dollars 10.75bn in 10-year notes (tomorrow), and Dollars 8.25bn in 30-year
bonds (Thursday). In addition, more than Dollars 38bn in three-month and
six-month bills and cash management bills will also be sold this week.
Initially, with so much new supply in the pipeline, participants were
reluctant to commit funds to the market, which left prices languishing near
their opening values during the morning session. In the afternoon, however,
longer-dated prices picked up ground in response to a rise in the June bond
futures contract. With the short end staying flat, the yield curve
flattened, a reversal of last Friday's trend. Analysts said this may have
been the deliberate intention of some of the trading by dealers during the
afternoon.

FT  11 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Eurocommercial paper market
shows decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurocommercial paper market, once one of the fastest growing sectors of
the international capital markets, went into reverse early last year,
according to figures published yesterday.
The decline has been caused in part by a switch by corporate treasurers to
longer-term borrowing, taking advantage of low long-term interest rates, and
in part by a fall-off in the credit quality of issuers of short-term paper.
Overcapacity in the Eurocommercial paper (ECP) market has already led to the
departure of several banks in the past four years, among them Merrill Lynch,
Warburg and Salomon.
Continuing shrinkage is expected to lead to further withdrawals from a
market which still has around 10 active dealers.
Figures from the Bank for International Settlements, published today, show
that a net Dollars 7.4bn of ECP was repaid in the last nine months of 1992,
cutting the amount of outstanding paper in the market by almost 10 per cent.
These repayments reversed a Dollars 7.7bn increase in the size of the market
in the first quarter of that year.
The fall-off was prompted in part by a switch by borrowers further down the
yield curve, and in part by a downgrading in the credit ratings of a number
of issuers of short-term paper.
The downgradings of Italy and of Scandinavian banks last year had a
particular effect on the market, said Mr John Ford, head of ECP at Citibank.
A ruling in France in March this year that Sicavs (money market funds)
should hold no more than 10 per cent of their assets in Europaper and other
unregulated investments has also stunted the demand for ECP from a group
that had been among the most active investors in Europe, Mr Ford added.
Competition from a number of domestic commercial paper markets also drew
borrowers away from the international market, but last year's move by the
German authorities to open up the D-Mark commercial paper market to foreign
issuers helped stem the decline of short-term paper, according to the BIS.

FT  11 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Doubts over EC investment law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE way that European countries choose to implement European Community law
on investment regulation could have an impact on the attractions of
competing European financial centres, according to speakers at a conference
in London yesterday organised by the Financial Times.
The Capital Adequacy Directive and the Investment Services Directive, the
cornerstones of EC law on the investment markets, leave considerable scope
for national discretion.
Commenting on the implementation of the ISD, Mr Bob Steel, head of equities
at Goldman Sachs in London, said: 'Upon the results of this process depend
many strategic questions for investment firms.' Mr Steel pointed to three
concerns about the directive, which will give investment firms authorised in
one EC state a passport to operate in all others.
First, there was still the possibility of new rules that would adversely
affect the efficient operation of market intermediaries.
Second, ambiguities in the text meant that the directive could be
interpreted in many different ways.
Third, the fact that the single passport for investment firms would be
introduced three years after a similar passport for banks which are active
in the securities markets would put investment firms at a disadvantage.
Mr Steel pointed to the compromise on market transparency that was struck in
the directive, allowing member states to restrict the extent to which
investors can use 'off-exchange' markets. Hampering the use of such markets,
which include London's Seaq International, could hinder the operation of
financial markets, he warned.
Mr Peter Baring, chairman of Barings, also called for close attention to the
implementation of the Capital Adequacy Directive in national law.

FT  11 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Finland taps Austrian
schilling sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPUBLIC of Finland yesterday tapped the Austrian schilling sector of
the Eurobond market with a Sch2bn, five-year deal - the biggest seen in that
sector.
Creditanstalt Bankverein of Austria, lead manager for the deal, claimed that
Finland was able to borrow on more aggressive terms in Austrian schillings
than in the D-Mark sector.
The bonds, which have a coupon of 6 7/8 per cent, were issued at 100.75 and
reoffered at 99.325 to yield 7.04 per cent. This represents a yield spread
of 39 basis points over the interpolated government bond.
The lead manager said that the deal would have some 'scarcity value', given
the absence of any government bonds in the five-year area.
Finland borrowed in Austrian schillings last year, launching an issue of
10-year bonds with a 8 1/4 per cent coupon which are now trading at a yield
spread of about 40 basis points over the relevant government bond.
Other dealers who follow the Republic of Finland's borrowings in the
international capital markets said that it was well ahead with its borrowing
programme for 1993, having chosen a wide variety of currencies and
maturities so far this year. Finland has an AA2/AA- credit rating.
'The feeling is that the worst is over for Finland - there's a greater
measure of confidence from investors,' said Mr Tim Skeet, senior
vice-president of Kidder Peabody's syndication desk.
The Eurobond market was unusually quiet yesterday, with the only other
substantial deal of the day a re-opening of an existing French franc issue.
The European Investment Bank has doubled the size of its recent 6 3/4 per
cent, five-year deal with a further FFr2bn of the bonds. The deal is being
lead-managed by CCF.
The bonds were re-offered at the issue price of 99.54 to yield 10 basis
points over the five-year government bond.
Some dealers suggested that the recent flood of Eurofranc deals may have run
out of steam.
Rumours are circulating in the market that Sweden may be planning to tap the
Euroyen sector with a fairly large five-year deal.
Meanwhile, in the Eurosterling sector some market experts have suggested
that there might be good swap opportunities for borrowers, who would be able
to borrow in fixed-rate sterling and then swap into floating-rate sterling
to give attractive sub-Libor levels of funding.
However, investor demand for Eurosterling paper is seen as being weak at the
moment.
Credit Suisse, the large Swiss bank, had its triple A long-term debt rating
and A1+ short-term rating reaffirmed yesterday by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
rating agency.
S&amp;P placed the ratings on creditwatch with negative implications in January.
In April, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the rating on the long-term
deposits and guaranteed senior Eurodebt of Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse
Financial Products to Aa2 from Aa1.

FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Canon cuts its profit forecast
as yen rises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CANON, the Japanese manufacturer of cameras and office equipment, warned
that profits for the current year were expected to be less than half its
earlier forecast.
The company blamed the appreciation of the yen, which has risen 11 per cent
this year and hit export revenues. Exports account for nearly 80 per cent of
the group's sales.
Canon revised its parent company pre-tax profits forecast for the year to
December 1993 to Y38bn (Dollars 345m), from the Y77.5bn it expected in
February. Sales have also been revised down, from Y1,100bn to Y1,060bn.
On a consolidated basis, Canon expects sales for the year to fall 3.5 per
cent from its previous forecast of Y1,980bn to Y1,910bn.
Pre-tax profits are revised down 37 per cent from Y102bn to Y64bn.
The rise in the yen's value - from about Y125 to Y110 to the dollar - had
reduced the company's expected revenues from exports by Y82bn, Canon said.
It plans to deal with the impact of the yen's appreciation through price
increases, cost-cutting and by transferring a larger proportion of its
manufacturing to its overseas bases, although it does not intend to increase
manufacturing sites outside of Japan.

The shares fell 96 cents to ADollars 12.98 (USDollars 9.20), their lowest

STIC is part of the Singapore Technologies group, which started life in the
1960s as the industrial branch of Singapore's armed forces.
It is now involved in a variety of activities, including computer software,
vehicle leasing, infrastructure projects and the operation of the Singapore
mint.
STIC says it made a pre-tax profit of SDollars 38.7m (USDollars 24m) in
calendar 1992.
The share offer will be made on the fixed price and tender system, with an
offer price in the region of Singapore 85 cents per share.
Mr Wong Kok Siew, STIC's president, said the proceeds would help the group
to expand overseas.
Keppel, a Singapore conglomerate with a large stake in the island republic's

FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nissan straightens out its
Spanish unit's battered balance sheet - The Japanese carmaker's plan to
inject Ptas15bn in new capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is to inject up to Ptas15bn (Dollars 130m) in
new equity capital into Nissan Motor Iberica as part of a financial
restructuring of its loss-making Spanish sub-sidiary.
The injection of an initial Ptas5bn will be announced this week, and the
provision of a further Ptas5bn is expected by the end of the year.
According to Mr Kiyoshi Sekiguchi, Nissan Motor Iberica managing director, a
third tranche of Ptas5bn may have to be injected by Nissan in 1994 to repair
its majority-owned subsidiary's battered balance sheet, if the losses cannot
be staunched this year.
Nissan Motor Iberica lost Ptas 14.4bn (Dollars 125m) last year, and it is
understood the losses have deepened in the first quarter of this year.
Mr Juan Echevarria, Nissan Motor Iberica executive chairman, warned that the
company did not expect to return to profit before 1995.
It has plunged into loss in the midst of an ambitious five-year, Ptas150bn
investment programme aimed at doubling its capacity to around 165,000
vehicles a year by 1996.
The financial problems of Nissan Motor Iberica, two-thirds owned by Nissan
Motor, could hardly have come at a worse time for the Japanese carmaker,
whose finances are under heavy pressure because of falling sales in Japan.
In Europe, Nissan's operations in Spain have tended to be overshadowed by
its activities in the UK, where it has invested more than Pounds 900m to
establish its first European car plant - now able to produce around 300,000
cars a year.
The investment in Spain is beginning to rival the spending in the UK,
however, and the Nissan group workforce of around 8,000 in Spain, including
7,200 in the Nissan Motor Iberica parent company, exceeds Nissan's UK
workforce of about 5,500, including 4,600 at the Sunderland plant.
Having completed the bulk of its investment in the UK car plant, Nissan is
attempting to transform the Spanish operations from a maker of outdated
commercial vehicles largely for the Spanish domestic market into a producer
of niche passenger vehicles to be sold across Europe.
Since last year, it has launched two new ranges from its main Spanish plant
in Barcelona, both aimed at the fastest-growing segments of the west
European car market.
Last autumn it unveiled the Spanish-built Nissan Serena, a 7-8 seat
multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) or 'people carrier', targeted to challenge
vehicles such as the pioneering Renault Espace.
Now it is launching the Terrano II, a four-wheel drive leisure/utility
vehicle to compete across Europe with the Land Rover Discovery, Mitsubishi
Shogun/Pajero and Opel/Vauxhall Frontera.
The Terrano II marks an important step in the development of Nissan's
European operations and its integration into Europe's motor industry.
For the first time, a vehicle engineered by a Japanese carmaker and produced
in Europe will also be supplied to a long-established vehicle maker in
Europe, namely Ford, for sale through Ford's network.
Ford has made repeated public attacks on the build-up of the Japanese
vehicle manufacturing presence in Europe, but it was prepared to turn to
Nissan to buy in a vehicle for sale under the Ford badge to cover a gap in
its product range.
The Nissan Terrano II will be marketed as the Ford Maverick with only minor
cosmetic differences.
Nissan Motor Iberica is planning to build up to 60,000 a year of the
four-wheel drive vehicle by 1995, of which 22,000 will be sold to Ford.
An important part of the design and development work on the Nissan Terrano
II/Ford Maverick has been carried out by Nissan in Europe rather than in
Japan.
Nissan's operations in Spain include not only vehicle assembly but
metal-stamping and foundry, machining and assembly operations for engines,
transmissions and axles.
Diesel engines and transmissions for both Serena and Terrano II are to be
built in Spain, while the petrol engines for the Serena are supplied from
Nissan's Sunderland plant.
Nissan Motor Iberica is planning to produce around 50,000 Serena vehicles by
1995, including a light commercial van variant to be launched next year.
It is aiming to raise vehicle output to 135,000 in 1995, of which around 80
per cent would be accounted for by the two new vehicle ranges. This compares
with output last year of 76,895. Of this number, only 11 per cent was
accounted for by the new vehicles - in the form of initial production of the
Serena.
With output of both new vehicle ranges located in Europe, Nissan has stolen
a march on most of its volume-car rivals both from Europe and from Japan.
In the market for MPVs, only the Renault Espace and the Chrysler Voyager
have hitherto been produced in Europe. The range of European offerings is
set to expand quickly by the mid-1990s, however, with new models promised by
two joint ventures - Fiat with Peugeot and Volkswagen with Ford.
Mercedes-Benz is also developing an MPV for production in Spain.
In the fast-growing four-wheel drive leisure/utility segment, four of the
'big six' volume carmakers in Europe - Volkswagen, Fiat, Renault and Peugeot
 -are still missing from the market.
While Nissan Motor Iberica has invested ambitiously in developing new
models, in modernisation of its plants and in reorganisation of its
manufacturing operations and sales network, its profitability has come under
heavy pressure.
The losses have been caused in particular by the rapid deterioration in the
Spanish domestic market. Sales of both cars and commercial vehicles has
fallen sharply and Nissan Motor Iberica's profitability in a previously
protected home market is being undermined.
While the commercial vehicle market has contracted sharply, Nissan's own
share of the market has fallen at an even faster rate. Its presence in the
Spanish car market is growing strongly, albeit from a small base. But the
market is shrinking alarmingly, with new car registrations in the first four
months this year a third down on last year.
'Our main objective is to expand into Europe. We cannot just concentrate on
the Spanish market; we must live off a bigger volume base,' says Mr
Sekiguchi. 'But our export markets are very tough at the moment because of
falling demand and, in the short-term, our exports do not compensate for the
very sharp decline in the domestic market.'
While the restructuring to be launched this week is aimed at shoring up the
balance sheet in the short term, Nissan Motor Iberica is seeking a dramatic
improvement in productivity in the medium-term.
By 1995-96, it aims to have doubled its unit output per employee. It plans
to cut around 600 salaried staff in the next three years from its
7,200-strong workforce. At the same time, the number of production workers
is supposed to remain unchanged, while vehicle output is planned to increase
from 77,000 last year to 100,000 this year, to 120,000 in 1994 and 135,000
in 1995.
'We are planning to increase production with no increase in the workforce
but only with productivity gains,' insists Mr Sekiguchi.

FT  11 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: China acts on treasury bonds
backlog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S decision last week to halt new issues of debt and equities
securities is a sign of how desperate the authorities are to clear an
embarrassing backlog of unsold state treasury bonds.
The March 1 issue of Yn30bn (Dollars 5.2bn) was originally due to expire on
April 30, but much to the chagrin of the Ministry of Finance, only Yn4bn
worth of bonds had been sold by the original expiry date.
The low return rate - five and three-year bonds carry coupons of 11 and 10
per cent respectively - coupled with first-quarter inflation of 15.7 per
cent make the bonds unattractive to the public who, it seems, would rather
speculate in shares.
The Ministry of Finance has extended the expiry date in the hope that bonds
will be sold, but prospects are not good. Trading prices have fallen below
their face value at most trading centres. The bonds were issued two months
early this year in the hope they would be sold before enterprise bonds flood
the market later this year.
The freeze on new debt and equity issues comes as China is making headway in
establishing a regulatory framework for its fledgling securities market and
is preparing to do the same for its mushrooming futures markets.
New regulations issued last week by the state council, China's cabinet, were
aimed at stiffening the country's stock market regulatory framework, pending
the promulgation next year of a new national securities law.
The new rules cover nine aspects of stock market activity, including public
offerings, general trading, corporate takeovers, continuous disclosure,
investigation procedures and arbitration of disputes.
Last week's interim regulations are also aimed at facilitating the listing
of Chinese companies on overseas exchanges. Nine state enterprises are
seeking listing in Hong Kong.
Publication of the new regulations caused the Shanghai index to plummet
because speculators were concerned at the effect stricter supervision would
have on the market's fairly lax regulatory environment.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission said the new rules were aimed at
regularising the activities of China's two stock markets: Shanghai and
Shenzen in a Special Economic Zone, adjacent to Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
CAMBIOR, the international gold producer, estimates its output will rise 75
per cent to 620,000 ounces this year, with its new Omai project in Guyana on
stream.
Mr Louis Gignac, president, said gold would remain the Canadian group's top
priority and estimated an average price of USDollars 360 per ounce for the
rest of 1993. The company would also, however, be diversifying into base
metals.
Cambior, which is also a major producer of niobium, used in steel
production, is spending CDollars 17m (USDollars 13.4m) on gold and base
metals exploration this year, half in North America and half in Mexico and
Chile.
First-quarter profit amounted to CDollars 876,000 or 2 cents a share, down
from CDollars 3.9m or 13 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 75m
against CDollars 44m.
Gold output rose 29 per cent to 107,000 ounces.
Mr Gignac said profits would revive in the rest of 1993 as operating costs
declined and gold prices stabilised.

Klockner-Werke steel mill

<TEXT>
THYSSEN and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's two largest steel producers, said
yesterday they would lead a consortium of European steelmakers to take over
part of the steel operations of Klockner-Werke. the embattled German steel
group.
The consortium wants to acquire the cold rolling mill in Klockner-Werke's
steel plant in Bremen.
'We will study this offer as carefully as any other. Negotiations with
foreign partners have been running for some time already,' Klockner-Werke
said.
The proposal depends on the success of the debt relief plan under which
Klockner-Werke hopes to write off DM1.7bn of its DM2.4bn (Dollars 1.5bn) net
debt.
The company's main creditors, including Deutsche Bank and other leading
German banks, have in principle agreed to the plan.
A final meeting of creditors is scheduled for June 7.
However, the debt relief scheme still depends on the approval of the
European Commission, which has a DM175m outstanding loan to the group. Last
week, the EC said it would not push for the loan's full recovery pending a
review of Klockner-Werke's restructuring plans.
The EC wants to make sure that significant production cuts are made by
Klockner-Werke to support the commission's overall plan to restructure the
European steel industry.
Klockner-Werke will present its restructuring deal to the EC on Wednesday.
The company plans to cut its raw steel production by 20 per cent, with a
blast furnace in Bremen set for closure.
However, it may have to consider reducing production of its hot rolling mill
in Bremen to satisfy EC demands, industry analysts said.
Like the EC, Klockner-Werke's competitors are eager to see significant
production cuts made to relieve the over-capacity crisis plugging the
European steel industry.
They have an interest in the debt relief scheme going through to prevent
Klockner-Werke from going into outright bankruptcy.
'A bankrupt steelmaker would be a danger because a competitor could buy it
for nothing,' a source in the German steel industry said.

accessible to western institutional investors.
The notes, carrying the guarantee of the parent company and an A1 credit
rating, are to be priced to yield just above Hungarian Treasury bills. The
180-day T-bills currently yield 16.5 per cent.
Credit Suisse First Boston, dealer and arranger of the issue, expects to
place about a quarter of the paper internationally. The opening of the CP
market has been driven by interest from international institutions.

180-day T-bills currently yield 16.5 per cent.
Credit Suisse First Boston, dealer and arranger of the issue, expects to
place about a quarter of the paper internationally.
The opening of the CP market has been driven by interest from international
institutions drawn to the relatively high yields on forint debt and sanguine
about the risk of devaluation.
For its part, the National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, said it would
permit foreign take-up now that forint interest rates were lower and the
margin for disruptive speculative investment had narrowed.
However, the NBH said that it would continue to grant licences only on a
case-by-case basis for the issue abroad of Hungarian corporate debt.
The market, officials said, was too thin to allow general liberalisation
which would bring sudden capital movements.

THE Canadian government has halved its stake in Cameco Corporation, one of
the world's biggest uranium producers, through a secondary issue of shares
to the public.
A group of underwriters, led by Burns Fry and RBC Dominion Securities of
Toronto, yesterday sold 5m Cameco shares to institutional and retail
investors at CDollars 20.50 a share. Before the sale, the shares were
trading at CDollars 21.25 on the Toronto stock exchange.
The bulk of the shares were sold in Canada, with European investors buying
less than 10 per cent.
The sale lifts the public's stake in Cameco to 51.5 per cent from 41.9 per
cent. The federal government now owns 19.2 per cent, with the remaining 38.9
per cent held by the province of Saskatchewan, where Cameco is based.
Both the federal and Saskatchewan governments aim to dispose of their entire
stake by October 1995.
The response to the Cameco issue was relatively subdued compared with other
share offerings by Canadian resource companies in the past few weeks. One of
the underwriters said investors appeared to be holding back, with the
uranium market weak and further parcels of Cameco stock expected to come on
to the market over the next year or two.
In addition to its uranium mines in northern Saskatchewan and processing
facilities in Ontario, Cameco is prospecting for gold and diamonds. The
company earned CDollars 8m (USDollars 6.4m) last year on sales of CDollars
305m. It produced 13.6m lbs of uranium concentrates.

FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Daiichi Housing rescue package
nears completion

<TEXT>
NOMURA Securities, Japan's leading securities house, and the Long Term
Credit Bank of Japan are close to an agreement for a Y40bn (Dollars 360m)
bail-out of Daiichi Housing Loan, their jointly-owned housing loan company
which is burdened by mounting bad debts.
The deal is the second financial reconstruction among Japan's eight housing
loan companies. These have been hit by the downturn in the property market
and land prices since the late 1980s. Earlier this year, a group of banks
agreed to bail out Nippon Housing Loan.
It is expected these two deals will lead to financial reconstruction plans
for the other housing loan groups.
Nomura and the Long Term Credit Bank have spent weeks hammering out the
agreement, after Nomura refused to accept the terms proposed by the bank.
The two companies both own 9 per cent of Daiichi Housing Loan, which was
founded by the Long Term Credit Bank in 1975.
Under the agreement, the Long Term Credit Bank will reduce to zero the
interest on its outstanding loans to Daiichi Housing Loan, worth about
Y210bn. The foregone interest income will cost the bank about Y5.4bn a year.
Nomura, which has strong capital reserves, will pay Y20bn to buy collateral
for housing loans which have since turned sour.
Both shareholders will each pay Y10bn for a new issue of Daiichi Housing's
shares.
Nomura estimates that the Y30bn it will be contributing to the rescue will
cost it about Y1.8bn a year.
It is not clear whether other lenders to Daiichi Housing, such as the
Norinchukin agricultural bank and Sumitomo Trust Bank, have been asked to
reduce the interest on their loans.

SMITH Barney Shearson, the US brokerage house created earlier this year,
confirmed yesterday that it would shed between 1,200 and 1,500 jobs this
year, mostly from the company's back office operations.
The lay-offs are part of a restructuring of the new company, created when
Primerica, the diversified financial services group which owned Smith Barney
Harris Upham, the Wall Street firm, bought American Express's Shearson
brokerage unit for about Dollars 1bn.
The merger made the new entity the second largest securities brokerage house
in the US, behind Merrill Lynch, long-time industry leader.
Smith Barney Shearson, which employs 26,500, said that some staff had been
notified of planned redundancies, and that the gradual process of lay-offs
would probably be completed by the end of this year.
The job cuts will come in the company's back office processing and clearing
operations, as well as in the administration, personnel and human resources
departments.
The roughly 11,000 stockbrokers who work for Smith Barney Shearson will not
be affected by the workforce reductions. In some areas, such as capital
markets, research and corporate finance, the firm is said to be hiring
staff.

<TEXT>
MARRIOTT Corporation, the large lodging and food services group, yesterday
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission details of its plan to
exchange existing bonds for new high-yielding debt securities, common stock
and cash.
If all bondholders participate fully in the exchange offer, Dollars 1.525bn
of existing bonds would be retired.
The offer was agreed in principle with some of the group's bondholders in
March.
Bondholders were upset by Marriott's plans to demerge its main operating
interests - the lodging business and food services operations - which would
leave behind Marriott's property assets and the bulk of the group's Dollars
3bn of debt.
Negotiations between Marriott and some of the larger US institutional
bondholders resulted in the exchange offer plan.
However, a second group of unhappy bondholders - led by the UK's Prudential
insurance group - continued to oppose the demerger plan, and so far has not
agreed to the settlement offer.
Marriott, which intends to put the demerger plan to shareholders at the June
22 annual meeting, said the exchange offer required holders of 85 per cent
of all relevant series of bonds and 51 per cent of each individual series to
agree.
In the SEC filing, it said the new bonds would have interest rates 100 basis
points higher and maturities extending about four years later than the
present Marriott bonds.
Up to Dollars 70m of Marriott common stock and up to Dollars 104m of cash
would be offered in the exchange.

<TEXT>
SIR JAMES Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, for the second time in a
month has sold a substantial stake in Newmont Mining, North America's
biggest gold mining group.
A consortium of Morgan Stanley International, Barclays de Zoete Wedd and
Gordon Capital Corp has bought 9.5 per cent of Newmont, or 6.5m shares, and
were offering them for sale at Dollars 45.50 each.
The group said the sellers were affiliated with Sir James and his close
colleague Lord Rothschild's J Rothschild Group.
In a statement, Morgan Stanley said that once the share sale was complete,
DIA Holdings, which is affiliated with Sir James, would hold about 19 per
cent of Newmont Mining, and Holdgold, a Rothschild affiliate, would hold 3
per cent.
Mr Gordon Parker, Newmont president, and other Newmont officials could not
be reached for comment. The offering was not registered with US regulators
and so was not open to US buyers.
On April 23, Sir James sold a 10 per cent stake in Newmont Mining at Dollars
39.50 a share to the US money manager, Mr George Soros.
The price of gold has risen by Dollars 33 a troy ounce since Sir James and
Mr Soros publicised their deal, but it eased back yesterday and closed in
London at Dollars 356.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 1.05.
Newmont shares fell Dollars  3/8 after the offering announcement, to Dollars
41 3/4 , in contrast to the April sale, when Newmont shares rose Dollars 3
to Dollars 45 7/8 .
Sir James acquired a 42 per cent stake in Newmont, then worth about Dollars
1.1bn by swapping timber assets with Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate. A 2.6 per cent stake was placed with institutions late last
year. Analysts said this year's gold rally provided a good opportunity for
Sir James to take profits.

A VALUE of SKr2.9bn (Dollars 396m) was yesterday put on Celsius Industries,
Sweden's leading defence group, when the government unveiled terms for the
company's privatisation.
It means the state will raise nearly SKr2.2bn from the sale of 75 per cent
of the company, making this the largest Swedish privatisation to date. Last
year, the government raised SKr2.1bn through an offer of shares in SSAB, the
steel group.
A total of 21m shares is being offered, with institutions paying SKr106 per
share and the Swedish general public and employees SKr100.
Around 21 per cent of the company will be owned by four Swedish financial
institutions, while 43 per cent will be offered to domestic and foreign
investors, Celsius employees and the general public.
The remaining 11 per cent will be owned by Nobel Industries, which gained
its stake in exchange for the sale of its defence electronics activities to
Celsius for SKr1.55bn in February.
Celsius says it will pay a dividend of SKr5 per share if 1993 profits reach
last year's level of SKr545m - its minimum forecast for this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARZOTTO, Italy's second-biggest clothing and textiles group which controls
Germany's Hugo Boss, yesterday deflated expectations of soaring exports on
the back of lira weakness.
Mr Pietro Marzotto, chairman, said first-quarter sales in 1993, adjusted for
currency movements, had fallen by about 8 per cent. Unadjusted turnover rose
by 4.7 per cent to L601bn (Dollars 411m).
The fact that volumes have fallen at a leading exporter in one of Italy's
most competitive sectors will disappoint analysts forecasting an export-led
boom in corporate earnings this year.
Mr Marzotto said demand for textiles and clothing remained depressed.
Although first-quarter group sales had been swollen by the lower lira,
notably against the D-Mark - swelling Hugo Boss revenues in lira terms  -
market conditions remained 'very difficult'. In D-Mark terms, Hugo Boss
sales had fallen by 2.7 per cent, he said.
The gloomy outlook came against virtually static group earnings for Marzotto
in 1992, the first year in which Hugo Boss has been fully consolidated. Net
profits were L40.1bn against L39.8bn,while group sales, swollen by the
acquisition, jumped to L1,952bn from L1,280bn. Adjusted for acquisitions and
disposals, sales fell 2.4 per cent last year. Mr Marzotto gave no earnings
forecasts for 1993, but said sales should approach L2,000bn.
Parent-company results differed markedly, reflecting the full impact of
financing charges for the takeover and write-downs on the Hugo Boss stake.
The parent company lost L44.7bn, compared with net profits of L25.2bn in
1991. Interest payments rose L12bn to L39.4bn, while a L79bn write-down was
made on the Hugo Boss stake. However, Marzotto is maintaining its dividend
at L280 per ordinary share.
Mr Marzotto defended the Boss takeover, which has greatly broadened the
group's international exposure and reduced its dependence on textiles and
threads. After the purchase, clothing accounted for almost 66 per cent of
Marzotto sales, compared with 47.6 per cent in 1991.
The group, which bought 63.8 per cent of Boss's ordinary shares in late
1991, and has an option on a further 13.8 per cent, has been increasing its
stake by buying further Boss shares.
Marzotto's stake in Boss's total share capital rose to 41 per cent at the
end of last year from 32.5 per cent and now stands at 43.3 per cent.

<TEXT>
GENERALE des Eaux, one of France's largest industrial holding companies, saw
net profits rise to FFr2.91bn (Dollars 545m) last year from FFr2.61bn in
1991 in spite of the slowdown in the French economy.
The group, which has extensive interests in water distribution, media and
construction, said it hoped to achieve another increase in net profits this
year, although it made no forecasts.
It stressed that it saw no sign of improvement in the general economic
situation, nor did it expect one in the foreseeable future.
Generale mustered an overall increase in sales of 6.3 per cent to FFr143.4bn
in 1992 from FFr135.3bn in 1991. Its international interests were affected
by the franc's strength following the September currency crisis, with sales
outside France rising modestly to FFr38.7bn from FFr36.5bn over the same
period. On constant exchange rates it would have made sales of FFr40.3bn.
In spite of the chilly economic climate, Generale increased its investments
to FFr13bn in 1992 from FFr11.5bn in 1991. It invested FFr3.5bn in its water
interests, FFr2.8bn in energy and FFr1bn in property.
Operating profits rose by 6.9 per cent to FFr5.95bn last year from FFr5.56bn
in 1991 when growth from water, energy and electricity interests compensated
for a decline in profits from construction and public works.
Generale, like other French property groups, was badly affected by the
downturn in the property market. It made a loss on its property interests
last year, but managed to bring that division back into the black with the
income from its estate agency activities.

strong demand

<TEXT>
FINLAND'S leading commercial bank, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), is
increasing the size of its FM930m rights issue after receiving subscriptions
for just over FM1bn (Dollars 186m).
The bank said yesterday it would issue a further 7.05m shares to three
Finnish companies to raise an additional FM70.5m.
The total FM1bn capital increase strengthens the group's financial position
considerably and raises its international capital adequacy ratio by more
than 1 percentage point to over 9 per cent.
The bank plans to raise a further FM2bn in the domestic and international
debt markets through a series of issues beginning in the autumn.
If these are successful and there is no further worsening in the Finnish
economy, it is confident it can survive the Finnish banking crisis without
direct state support.
KOP reported a FM3.7bn loss in 1992, but it expects its deficit this year to
fall to FM2bn after the cut in Finnish interest rates and reduced credit
losses.

<TEXT>
HAFNIA Holding, which formerly controlled Denmark's second-largest insurance
group, yesterday filed for bankruptcy with debts of about DKr6.3bn (Dollars
1.03bn), making it the country's biggest bankruptcy by a wide margin.
The main creditors include Den Danske Bank, with a claim of DKr1.2bn, and
Commerzbank of Germany with some DKr800m.
The Danish savings bank Bikuben, Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank, and
the Netherlands' ABN Ambro Bank are each owed about DKr600m. Denmark's
Unibank is owned DKr450m.
Hafnia Holding went into payments suspension in August last year. Its equity
capital was eliminated by the fall in the value of the group's shareholdings
in rival Danish insurer Baltica and Skandia, the Swedish insurance company.
Yesterday's decision to file for bankruptcy was taken by the committee of
inspection appointed by the bankruptcy court last year.
The committee concluded that there were no grounds for extending the
payments suspension. Mr Holger Lavesen, chairman of Hafnia Holding, said
yesterday that one reason why the group could not be reconstructed was the
poor international reputation which the Nordic insurance industry has gained
as a result of the collapse of the two big Danish insurance groups, Hafnia
and Baltica, and Uni Storebrand in Norway.
Hafnia has already sold most of its realisable assets, including its UK
pension management company Prolific and its Danish insurance companies.
The latter were acquired in March by Codan, the Danish insurance company
which is controlled by Sun Alliance of the UK.
Hafnia's remaining assets are a stake of just over 33 per cent in Baltica
Holding and 13.8 per cent of Skandia.
At the end of 1992 these shares had a value of about DKr2.5bn.
The Baltica shares were acquired in 1990-91 in an attempt by Hafnia to gain
control of Baltica, while the Skandia shares were acquired in late 1991 when
Hafnia and Uni Storebrand launched an unsuccessful hostile bid for the
Swedish company.

FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Terms for Celsius flotation
revealed

<TEXT>
A VALUE of SKr2.9bn (Dollars 396m) was yesterday put on Celsius Industries,
Sweden's leading defence group, when the government unveiled terms for the
company's privatisation.
It means the state will raise nearly SKr2.2bn from the sale of 75 per cent
of the company, making this the largest Swedish privatisation to date. Last
year, the government raised SKr2.1bn through an offer of shares in SSAB, the
steel group.
A total of 21m shares is being offered, with institutions paying SKr106 per
share and the Swedish general public and employees SKr100.
Around 21 per cent of the company will be owned by four Swedish financial
institutions, while 43 per cent will be offered to domestic and foreign
investors, Celsius employees and the general public.
The remaining 11 per cent will be owned by Nobel Industries, which gained
its stake in exchange for the sale of its defence electronics activities to
Celsius for SKr1.55bn in February.
Celsius says it will pay a dividend of SKr5 per share if 1993 profits reach
last year's level of SKr545m - its minimum forecast for this year.
There is no formal allocation for international investors, although shares
are being marketed overseas by four institutions - Banque Indosuez, Alfred
Berg Fondkommission, Enskilda Securities and Kleinwort Benson.
At least 6.5m shares (23.2 per cent of the total) will be available to
domestic and foreign institutions, although this could rise if the take-up
by employees and the general public is less than 5.5m shares (19.6 per
cent). The offer will run from May 17 to June 4.
The government believes Celsius will be able to take a more active part in
the broader restructuring of the European defence industry if it is in
private hands and has access to external risk capital.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TAKEOVER bid by Jeronimo Martins, the Portuguese food retailer, for
supermarket chain Ino-Supermercados has been contested by a minority
shareholder in Ino, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
The objection raised by a 19.9 per cent shareholder has led the Portuguese
Stock Exchange Commission to suspend trading in Ino shares on the Lisbon and
Oporto stock exchanges.
Jeronimo Martins owns 51 per cent of Ino indirectly through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Inovacao.
Jeronimo Martins, partly-owned by Booker of the UK and Ahold of the
Netherlands, operates 40 Pingo Doce supermarkets and the cash-and-carry
chain Recheio.
Acquisition of Ino would give Jeronimo Martins a further 53 Ino
supermarkets, seven cash-and-carry stores and three Feira Nova hypermarkets,
making it one of the country's top three supermarket chains.
Portugal's Es3,500bn (Dollars 23.82bn) retail food industry is currently
dominated by Sonae Investimentos-SGPS, running the Modelo supermarket and
Continente hypermarket chain, and Super Companhia Portuguesa de
Supermercados, which owns the Pao de Acucar supermarkets and Jumbo
hypermarkets.

<TEXT>
SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and agro-chemical group,
yesterday confirmed it was holding talks with Hoechst aimed at merging the
two companies' agro-chemicals operations.
A link with Hoechst, one of Germany's big three chemical groups, would give
Schering access to a bigger market and help insulate its agro-chemical
division from further losses.
The company, already in a rationalisation programme, said Hoechst had
'priority' in the negotiations, adding that it had been seeking a partner
for its agro-chemical division for some time.
However, Schering could not yet confirm the nature of the merger. 'Maybe it
might be in the form a joint venture. But it is too early to say. We have
not yet signed a letter of intent. We don't know when the talks will end,' a
spokesman said.
Schering is keen to stem the overall decline in its sales. In the first
quarter of this year, turnover in the agro-chemical division fell by 22 per
cent. Total sales declined by 8 per cent over the same period a year ago.
Hoechst also recorded an overall decline in sales for the first quarter.
Turnover fell by 5 per cent to DM11bn, and pre-tax earnings for the same
period fell by 28 per cent to DM243m.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: IBS raising Pounds 752,000 via share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Bioremediation Services, based in the West Midlands but
incorporated in Switzerland, is seeking to raise Pounds 752,000 net on the
UK capital market through an issue of shares which will be quoted in
Vancouver
The company, controlled by Mr Artur Haslimann, uses bacterial cultures to
break down waste and treat polluted or contaminated land and equipment.
It has operating subsidiaries in the UK, France and the US.
Griffiths &amp; Lamb, the stockbroker, is placing 2.02m shares at 47 1/2 p each.
The Vancouver quotation is to be arranged through the reverse takeover of
Hisway Resources, a shell company whose name will be changed to
International Bioremediation Services.
After the issue and quotation, Mr Haslimann will hold over 60 per cent of
the equity, but has immediate access only to 16 per cent. The rest of his
holding will be held in escrow, its release to him dependent on meeting
performance targets.
In the year to last October, IBS suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 131,000
but the offer prospectus forecasts pre-tax profits for the year ended May
1994 of Pounds 220,000 on turnover of Pounds 1m.
Funds raised from the issue will be used to bolster IBS's technical base,
now dependent on Wolverhampton University, and expand its markets both
through licensing agreements and joint ventures and direct sales of its
products and expertise.
IBS plans eventually to float its US subsidiary on Nasdaq.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Butte Mining plans to rebuild through
litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAMAGES CLAIMED by Butte Mining from former directors, advisers and
investors now total about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 637m) reported Mr David
Lloyd-Jacob, chairman. This compares with the company's market value of
about Pounds 3.4m.
Mr Lloyd-Jacob said litigation in Montana would be 'vigorously pursued and,
in the opinion of the board, our prospects for significant recovery are
good.'
However, he said the cases are not expected to come to trial for some time.
The UK Serious Fraud Office is also investigating the matters which form the
subject of the company's US lawsuit with a view to possible criminal
charges, he pointed out.
Butte's audited accounts for the year to June 30 will show write-offs,
write-downs and losses attributable to shareholders totalling Pounds 10.5m,
which sharply reduce but do not eliminate the company's net worth.
'Management intends to rebuild net worth in the next few years, primarily by
litigation,' said Mr Lloyd-Jacob.
Net assets are less than half of the called-up share capital and an
extraordinary meeting will be called to consider how to deal with this.
'Directors believe that the course of action already commenced and, in
particular, the US litigation give the best opportunity for the company to
recover its losses,' he added.
Butte incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 336,000 (Pounds 52,000 profit) for
the half year to December 31 on turnover down from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds
80,000. The loss was financed in part by asset sales.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Berisford in black and reaffirms
acquisition stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERISFORD International yesterday reported a return to profits and pledged
to continue its search for acquisitions despite being turned down last week
as a suitor for C&amp;J Clark, the shoe company.
Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive, said the group was assessing four possible
deals, mainly acquisitions of subsidiaries of larger companies.
Mr Bowkett said Berisford was 'seeking friendly transactions' but then
quipped 'a hostile bid would be a piece of cake after this'.
Berisford is understood to be considering claiming its costs, amounting to
less than Pounds 1m, for the abortive Pounds 184m bid from Clark.
Mr John Sclater, chairman, said the property and agribusiness group would
'continue to pursue with undiminished enthusiasm opportunities for our
management team to develop a broadly based industrial holding company'.
He said Berisford was disappointed not to have the chance 'to effect the
substantial improvement in performance that we believe we could have enabled
Clark's to implement'.
Berisford wished Clark well 'in resolving the substantial issues facing
them'.
Berisford shares returned from suspension and closed unchanged at 128p.
The group reported a Pounds 400,000 pre-tax profit for the six months to
end-March, compared to a loss of Pounds 57.4m which was after substantial
provisions.
However, the outcome included a Pounds 2.1m gain on the sale of the stake in
Hunter Saphir.
No new provisions were needed, Mr Sclater said, and the group 'is now on a
firm financial footing and ready to move forward again'.
At the half year end, Berisford had net cash of Pounds 3.2m (debt Pounds 15m
at the last year end). At its peak in 1990 debt was Pounds 1.2bn.
Turnover fell from Pounds 103.1m to Pounds 47.3m, although the fall in sales
from continuing operations was from Pounds 87.4m.
The loss from continuing operations was Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.2m) as the
agribusiness interests suffered a drop in cotton sales and the engineering
subsidiary experienced a price squeeze from motor industry customers.
Earnings per share were 0.3p (losses of 58.3p restated for the 5-for-1 share
consolidation and the use of FRS 3).
There is no interim dividend. Berisford last paid a dividend in respect of
the year covering 1988-89.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Clark rules out 'witch hunt' of directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
C&amp;J CLARK, whose shareholders narrowly defeated the proposal to sell to
Berisford at a special meeting last Friday, said yesterday there would be
'no witch hunt' of directors.
Seven of the 11 directors, including all the executives, had recommended
shareholders to sell to Berisford.
Mr Walter Dickson, chairman of Clark, has gone on holiday to Barbados for
two weeks. He said on Friday he would be 'considering his position'
following the vote. Some shareholders had attempted to oust Mr Dickson at a
meeting last October, at which the board was given a mandate to seek a
bidder for the group.
Speculation was that Mr Roger Pedder, a non-executive director who had
neither recommended nor opposed the sale originally, but who came out
against the deal on Friday, might become chairman if Mr Dickson left.
At the meeting a shareholder asked Mr Lance Clark, also a non-executive
director, who was a leading opponent to the sale, if he would continue to
support Mr Dickson as chairman if the resolution was defeated. He refused to
give that assurance.

Pex, the knitted products manufacturer, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds
908,000 for the year to January 31 after exceptional reconstruction costs of
Pounds 790,000.
Towards the end of the year the company, formerly known as Palma Group,

property values. The result was to improve reserves by Pounds 600,000. After
the year end, property was sold in Leicester for Pounds 1.4m which went
towards reducing debt.
The previous company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 278,000 for the 12

Turnover for the period under review was Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 17.2m).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Goldsmiths Group, the specialist jewellery and watch retailer, returned to
profit over the 12 months to February 27 with a modest Pounds 48,000
pre-tax.
The outcome compared with losses last time of Pounds 1.29m.
Profits at the trading level, however, expanded 92 per cent to Pounds 1.91m
(Pounds 992,000). Interest charges were slightly reduced at Pounds 1.86m
(Pounds 1.97m). Gearing was maintained at 108 per cent. The group has capped
Pounds 12m of its debt at 6.5 per cent for two years. 'This will allow us to
concentrate on maximising trading profit' said Mr Jurek Piasecki, chairman.
Turnover edged up 6 per cent to Pounds 42.9m helped by a stable market over
Christmas; the year saw eight branches closed and seven new outlets,
including two relocations, opened.
Mr Piasecki said there had been a 'distinct improvement' in sales since late
last year. Sales in March and April were up 10 per cent overall and 8 per
cent on a comparable basis.
A proposed single dividend of 0.3p is uncovered by earnings per share of
0.12p (losses of 6.09p). Last year's distribution totalled 1.8p, including a
final of 0.3p.

Losses at Select Appointments (Holdings), the USM-quoted employment agency
group, fell to Pounds 2.53m for the 12 months to December 31.
That compared with a loss, on an FRS 3 basis, of Pounds 1.8m for the
previous nine month period.
Turnover from continuing operations amounted to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 14.2m),
of which Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 10.4m) was attributable to the UK and Pounds
6.15m (Pounds 3.82m) to Australasia.
There was a loss of Pounds 1.47m at the operating level, against Pounds
809,000. UK operations recorded a deficit of Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 700,000),
while Australasia produced profits of Pounds 16,000 (losses of Pounds
109,000); interest payable amounted to Pounds 913,000 (Pounds 585,000) and
exceptional losses Pounds 153,000 (Pounds 407,000).
Losses per share, on the enlarged capital following a refinancing in October
1991, amounted to 1.06p (26p).
Mr Anthony Martin, chairman, said that during the first quarter Select had
seen a continued improvement in temporary business, but the permanent
recruitment market remained depressed. Nonetheless, he said results for the
first quarter were ahead of the comparable period of last year.

Turnover rose from Pounds 49.4m to Pounds 58.9m. Exports increased 58 per
cent to Pounds 11.9m and represented over 20 per cent of total sales,
against 15 per cent.
Mr Greenwood looked optimistically on plans for export growth to create a
better balance in the business. Exchange rates would be crucial, he
stressed.
In the yarn division Knoll Spinning experienced strong order books with
significant increases in exports. Yorkshire Yarn Dyeing saw rises in volume
throughput but pressure on prices and margins.
Fabric losses were eliminated with further improvement in the order book and
margins in home and export markets.
Losses per share were 8p (19.9p). The final dividend is 1p for an unchanged
total of 2p.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Prowting loses Pounds 4.87m after land
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEED for further provisions against its land holdings pushed Prowting,
the housebuilder, into pre-tax losses for the second consecutive year.
After a Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 22.4m) exceptional provision the group reported
pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.87m in the year to February 28, compared to
Pounds 17.7m, on turnover down by 4 per cent from Pounds 36.4m to Pounds
35m.
Mr Terry Roydon, chief executive, expressed confidence that this would be
the last write-down and said 'as 1993 progresses it is clear that the long,
debilitating recession in our industry is coming to an end'.
Losses per share were 7.9p (18.8p). As foreshadowed in November, the group
is cutting the total dividend to 3.4p (5p) with a second interim dividend of
1.7p, which was paid in April before the Budget tax changes came into
effect.
Before the exceptionals profits were Pounds 68,000, against Pounds 4.71m,
reflecting higher interest charges of Pounds 4.03m (Pounds 3.82m) and
lower-priced house sales. Mid-year net borrowings peaked at Pounds 42.4m
before a debt reduction programme resulted in year-end net borrowings
falling to Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 36.5m), for gearing of 48 per cent.
The number of units sold increased slightly from 273 to 290, but the average
price fell from Pounds 103,000 to Pounds 88,000. House prices generally fell
by about 8 per cent and there was a move towards first time buyers who made
up 30 per cent of sales against 23 per cent in the previous year.
As a result gross profits fell to Pounds 6.78m (Pounds 12m). Administrative
expenses were cut to Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 3.84m) leaving operating profits at
Pounds 3.87m (Pounds 8.37m).
The land bank includes 5,056 plots with planning permission or zoned for
residential use, equivalent to more than 15 years supply at current building
rates. After taking account of the necessary write-downs the average book
cost per plot was Pounds 11,600, down from Pounds 17,200 before the
provisions of the last two years.
Commenting upon the outlook Mr Roydon said the recovery in house sales was
patchy and confidence remained fragile.
However, he added: 'Barring any new economic setbacks I am confident that
sales volumes should show a significant upturn for the year as a whole
compared with the depressed levels of the last few years.'

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: CLS contracts help Sidlaw maintain mid-term
outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIDLAW GROUP, the oil services, packaging and textiles combine, reported
flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.6m in the six months to March 31, in spite
of a jump in turnover from Pounds 45m to Pounds 71.5m.
Sales benefited from a new Pounds 22.7m marine services contract to charter
and manage standby and supply vessels for BP and Conoco.
The deal did not contribute any profits, but it is an important part of the
group's strategy of developing Contract Logistics Services contracts, which
involve managing the supply chain to North Sea operators.
The group said it would try to achieve further cost savings for its
customers and could rent out surplus deck space on the vessels.
Disregarding the new contract, oil services saw sales marginally ahead at
Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 15.4m). Operating profits improved to Pounds 3.06m
(Pounds 2.73m), on the back of a higher contribution from the CLS contracts.
Activity was affected by lower levels of drilling and hook-up support work,
and by several weeks of bad weather. The division also absorbed start-up
costs for Supplylink, a joint venture set up to offer CLS to the oil
industry internationally.
On the packaging side the operating profits were flat at Pounds 2m on sales
of Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 18m).
Falcon Packaging was integrated into the division, but recession continued
to squeeze margins.
Operating profits from the Dundee-based textiles division declined from
Pounds 451,000 to Pounds 298,000 on sales which rose marginally from Pounds
11.6m to Pounds 12.3m. While jute continued to fall, yarns used in the
carpet industry consolidated progress made last year.
Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said: 'The group's businesses have come
through the recession intact and well positioned for growth as economic
recovery gather momentum. One again, oil services has increased its profits
and there are encouraging signs that business is picking up in packaging.'
Earnings per share fell to 9.2p (9.5p) but the interim dividend is stepped
up to 4.25p (3.75p).

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Cleaning side behind fall at Sketchley -
Shares gain 5p as company notes signs of improvement in the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKETCHLEY, the cleaning and textile rental company, yesterday confirmed that
profits fell last year and said it has started a 'massive discounting
campaign' to try to lift turnover at its 465 dry cleaning stores.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 6.02m to Pounds 3.11m in the year to April
2 due to recession. The fall, which included exceptional costs of Pounds
1.65m, was expected. Last month Sketchley warned that second half trading in
its dry cleaning division had been poor. At the interim stage the company
reported flat profits of Pounds 3.1m.
Sketchley's shares gained 5p to 97p after Mr David Davies, chairman, noted
signs of improvement in the economy. 'Any sustained recovery will be felt
relatively speedily by our divisions,' he said.
Turnover fell to Pounds 104m (Pounds 107m). Operating profits dropped
sharply from Pounds 8.64m to Pounds 5.83m, mainly because the dry cleaning
division turned from a trading profit of Pounds 1.76m to a loss of Pounds
198,000. The company said the division returned to profit last month. The
discounting campaign, which meant price cuts of 30 per cent or more, had
started well, according to Mr John Richardson, joint deputy chairman.
The textile services division was helped by winning new contracts and made
operating profits of Pounds 5.43m (Pounds 5.53m).
Interest costs fell to Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 2.62m). The company continued to
repay borrowings, which fell to Pounds 6.92m (Pounds 11.9m), and gearing
dropped from 31 per cent to 18 per cent.
The exceptional charge stemmed from a provision on an interest rate swap
agreement which was entered into in 1989, before the present management took
charge.
Earnings fell from 7.8p to 4.9p, or 6.6p without the exceptional. The
company is recommending a maintained final dividend of 2p to make an
unchanged total of 3p.
COMMENT
Three years after saving Sketchley, Mr Richardson and his fellow deputy
chairman, Mr Tony Bloom, show a new determination, and perhaps impatience,
to get the business moving. Price cutting, set to continue to the year end,
is a calculated risk which needs large volume increases or margins will
suffer. Meanwhile the two men are still looking for acquisitions and said a
Pounds 30m or upwards target would be suitable. Both are familiar with
managing larger companies, and acquisitions are likely to stray from the
textile services sector. The City, apparently, is supportive. Mr Richardson
said his institutions are ready to back a large takeover, as long as it
makes sense. Smaller shareholders will doubtless show similar
circumspection, especially since it is likely to herald a rights issue.
Profits this year of Pounds 6m put the shares on 14 times. Until the future
is clearer, that rating is about right.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Donelon Tyson halved at Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP setback in profits was experienced by Donelon Tyson, the
construction group, over the 1992 year. with the outcome halved at Pounds
1.6m pre-tax, compared with Pounds 3.1m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 80.9m to Pounds 63.5m and there was an operating
profit of Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 4.14m) after charging Pounds 491,000 (Pounds
542,000) interest relating to income producing property and crediting a
contribution from claims against the Department of Transport of Pounds
720,000.
In addition Pounds 871,000 (Pounds 1.45m) was written off below the line,
largely reflecting completion of the withdrawal from the industrial
insulation contracting business.
A maintained 1.2p dividend is payable from earnings of 2.4p (4.6p) per
share.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: API planning third leg as profits advance
by 46%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
API, the packaging group, yesterday announced a 46 per cent jump in pre -
tax profits from Pounds 1.34m to Pounds 1.96m for the half year to April 3,
on turnover 11 per cent higher at Pounds 32.8m.
Mr Michael Smith, group chief executive, also announced that the company
would soon be adding - by acquisition - a third packaging leg to stand
alongside the foils/laminates and converted film/paper products divisions.
Mr Smith said the advances were largely due to productivity increases and
rises in market share, rather than to any upturn within the packaging
industry in particular or the UK economy in general. He added that sales by
volume had climbed 14 per cent but that there had been some price erosion
after winning several large accounts.
Mr Smith said the prospective new leg would be higher-tech yet - since the
year - end the group has strengthened its balance sheet by Pounds 1.2m to
Pounds 2m net cash.
Of API's sales some 48 per cent are abroad - 15 per cent to the US, 27 per
cent to Europe and 6 per cent to the Far East.
Foils and laminates lifted operating profits to Pounds 1.37m (Pounds
759,000) on turnover of Pounds 20m (Pounds 17.6m), while converted film and
paper products made Pounds 1.14m (Pounds 900,000) on turnover of Pounds 11m
(Pounds 9.62m). Mr Smith said that both divisions were still pursuing
margins of 15 per cent; this time they were 6.8 (4.3) per cent and 10.4
(9.4) per cent respectively.
Again the blot was the heating and ventilating systems side which broke even
(Pounds 200,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 2.28m).
The interim dividend is lifted to 3.35p (3.05p), covered 1.9 times by
earnings of 6.4p (4.5p).

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RHM's milling side in Tomkins' sights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GREG Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, yesterday gave the first
details of how his Smith &amp; Wesson handgun and bicycle conglomerate is to
integrate Ranks Hovis McDougall, bought last year for Pounds 935m.
Most analysts believe that for RHM to be a successful acquisition Tomkins
would need to turn around the marginally profitable milling and baking
division, so it was not surprising most attention has alighted on this
cut-throat market.
But for observers of the bread wars that periodically hit supermarkets and
currently have suppliers in a tight grip, there were only crumbs of
reassurance that some of the imbalance will be removed from the market.
'We have a pretty open mind about Tomkins but still need a bit of convincing
that the milling and baking industry is going to turn around in the short
run,' said Mr David Lang, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.
Nevertheless, Tomkins has made a start and Mr Hutchings says British
Bakeries' 'capacity has (been brought) more into line with demand'.
Production is now 'concentrated in the efficient bakeries.'
British Bakeries has closed bakeries in Croydon and Exeter and a plant at
Taffs Well in Wales. Capacity has been cut at Wimbush bakery in Birmingham
and distribution depots at Liverpool and Preston have closed with Grimsby
depot soon to follow.
'I do not think RHM have done a great job,' Mr Hutchings says. 'There is a
huge amount of cost saving which we can do.' He says he is not planning any
price benefits - by increasing prices - but will be taking out capacity. In
the five months since Tomkins took control, 7 per cent of RHM capacity had
already gone.
There remains, however, the matter of the RHM challenge to ABF before
Tomkins took over. 'There is still a problem of relative market share before
we can see any balance returning to the industry,' said Mr Lang. 'They have
taken a lot of market share off the market leader (ABF) who is obviously
intent on getting it back.'
It is a view with which Mr Hutchings does not concur.
'I think it will settle down to those sorts of market-share numbers for
ever,' Mr Hutchings said. 'If they lose money, we lose money; if they make
money, we make money.' Tomkins has also recognised the value of the brands
it has taken over.
It said yesterday it would be increasing the brand advertising budget by
Pounds 8m over the next 12 months, a move that has reassured some food
analysts who suspected Tomkins would be tempted to milk the brands.
Elsewhere Tomkins says it has accelerated the search for savings,
particularly in labour costs, at Rank Hovis, the flour milling business
which has been hard hit the the poor breadmaking wheat harvest.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Division Group float becomes a reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL-BASED Division Group has become the first company involved with
virtual reality computer technology to float on the Stock Market.
Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester broker, yesterday placed 15.4m of the
shares at 40p each. The placing is equivalent to about 45.6 per cent of the
capital and values the group at Pounds 13.5m. The shares are expected to
begin trading on Monday.
Some 1.65m shares were sold on behalf of existing shareholders who are
retaining a substantial portion of their present holdings. The balance was
sold by the group to raise about Pounds 5m net.
Division has developed a complete virtual reality system based on personal
computers. In the year to March 31 1992 the group recorded a loss of Pounds
107,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.08m. In the five months to March 31 this
year it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 19,000 on turnover of Pounds
746,000.
The funds raised through the placing will be used to boost marketing and
fund research and development.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: John Wood ahead at Pounds 18.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN WOOD Group, the privately-owned energy contracting company based in
Aberdeen, continued to expand in 1992 but at a slower rate than in the
previous year.
Sales were up 17 per cent at Pounds 203.6m and pre-tax profits ahead 10 per
cent at Pounds 18.5m.
Mr Ian Wood, chairman, said that trading conditions had been more testing
than in 1991, with slower expansion in the North Sea where exploration
companies in particular were finding life more difficult.
'We needed to draw breath a little,' said Mr Wood. In 1991 turnover rose 44
per cent from Pounds 120.8m to Pounds 173.8m, and pre-tax profits jumped 78
per cent from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 16.9m.
The company, which claims to be the UK's largest indigenous oil and energy
service company, is working closely with Shell Expro in the North Sea and
last year won a five year contract worth about Pounds 150m overall from
British Petroleum for design and engineering services to three North Sea
fields.
The company won two large contracts for oilfield services in Kuwait where it
employs 1,000 people, and invested Pounds 1.5m in workshops in the United
Arab Emirates. In the US the group spent Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.7m) on two
acquisitions in the oilfield services sector.
In the non-oil sector the group invested Pounds 3m in a repair facility for
gas turbines at Aberdeen and won a five year repair and maintenance contract
with National Power.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Airlines of Britain in black and strong
start this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRLINES OF Britain, the holding company for British Midland Airways,
remained in the black last year despite a recession that has pushed some
direct competitors in Europe into substantial losses.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 834,000 in the year to
end-December on sales which moved ahead 14.5 per cent at Pounds 392m.
However, Sir Michael Bishop, chairman, said the airline rebounded from a
poor start last year to record a strong first quarter in 1993.
British Midland, the largest airline, made operating profits of Pounds
833,000 (Pounds 2.56m); losses at Loganair were reduced to Pounds 1.48m
(Pounds 1.97m) while Manx Airlines saw profit decline to Pounds 87,000
(Pounds 1.6m).
'We have kept the business in the black in one of the most difficult periods
I have seen in Civil Aviation,' Sir Michael said.
The first half had been affected by passengers trading down from business
class.
Passengers were now returning to the front of the aircraft, partly due to
the introduction of the Diamond Euro-class.
After British Airways' takeover last autumn of Dan Air, passengers had also
moved back to Heathrow from Gatwick, leading to a strong last quarter, Sir
Michael said.
Mr Austin Reid, managing director of British Midland, said that despite
recession the group had met its strategic target of expanding the
international side of the business.
International sales had grown from 15 per cent five years ago to 50 per cent
today.
Mr Reid said British Midland had regained some market share on the Belfast
and Glasgow routes after British Airways last month reduced the frequency in
its flights.
The increase in frequency in 1991 had been an attempt to 'marginalise us',
said Mr Reid.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: PhoneLink for USM with Pounds 40m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINDING THE metaphorical needle in a haystack must often seem easier than
retrieving information from an on-line database. The search techniques used
by most commercial operators leave a lot to be desired.
This suggests that PhoneLink, a three-year old computing services company
based on Merseyside, should warrant the gratitude of information users when
it floats on the Unlisted Securities Market.
PhoneLink has developed a novel method of finding stored information which
promises hitherto unheard of speed and simplicity. It is already finding
support in the database industry. Among the suppliers who have agreed to
provide electronic information to run on PhoneLink's computers are the
Automobile Association, British Rail, Ordnance Survey and the Royal Mail.
British Telecom will market its method of extracting telephone numbers from
its database as a service called BT Teledirectory, at present on trial with
some of BT's large users. IBM, the market leader in personal computers, has
reached agreement in principle to build special terminals and to incorporate
PhoneLink's software into its personal computers.
Some 25 per cent of the company is expected to be floated through a placing
sponsored by Allied Provincial Securities. The aim is to raise about Pounds
12m to continue the development and marketing of key technologies. At the
placing price, the company is expected to be capitalised at about Pounds
40m.
PhoneLink is the creation of Mr Trevor Burke and his wife Heather. Their
previous companies, Technique, which marketed computer-aided design software
for kitchen manufacturers and Profile UK, which supplied building industries
with planning application details, were sold to help launch the new company.
Its business case lies in its claim to be able to do simply and cheaply what
is at present difficult and expensive.
PhoneLink's method is called Tel-Me; it makes use of a swathe of
technologies including artificial intelligence and parallel computing. Among
its advantages, according to Mr Burke, is that costs per inquiry will be
lower than other UK on-line information services. Typically, a complete
enquiry, including connection time, should be processed within 15 seconds.
The use of software predictive techniques may mean that the right answer is
on the computer screen before the customer has finished typing in the
enquiry.
The Burkes envisage customers using Tel-Me to retrieve information from a
parcel of databases. A salesperson, for example, might investigate the most
effective routes between calls, check on hotels in the area and look at news
stories on prospective clients.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Tomkins sets aside Pounds 90m for integration of RHM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMKINS, the conglomerate which took over Ranks Hovis McDougall last year,
has cut 1,500 jobs and set up a Pounds 90m provision to integrate the
milling, baking and grocery products group.
Giving the first glimpse of how integration was progressing, Mr Greg
Hutchings, Tomkins' chief executive, said RHM and the cut-throat bread
baking market were exactly as had been anticipated.
He said Tomkins' preliminary results in the year to the end of May would be
'in line with market expectations' and would continue a 'record of above
average earnings growth'.
Tomkins' share price has underperformed the market since January. Last week
it fell further amid fears the group had underestimated the strength of the
dominant bread producer, Associated British Foods, and power of large
supermarket buyers.
Yesterday's announcement suggests there will be no early end to the baking
market's overcapacity and low profitability.
Mr Hutchings said yesterday that not all the provisions were to be used to
reorganise milling and baking, adding that the market would settle down to
the current 'relatively satisfactory situation' in which ABF had about 36
per cent of the bread market and RHM about 34 per cent.
'I think it will settle down to those sorts of market-share numbers for
ever,' Mr Hutchings said.
Mr Hutchings said the dividend for the year would be no less than 6.35p on
the enlarged capital. Tomkins' share price rose 13p to 236p.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Local giant gambles all to win US telecoms war: A monopoly
that wants to allow rivals to compete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MODEST-SIZED telephone service company in western New York state may be
about to show the Dollars 90bn (Pounds 58.4bn) US local telecommunications
industry the best route to prosperity in the next century. Or it could be
heading for a bloody nose.
Rochester Telephone has set the US telecommunications industry a-buzz with a
plan, announced in February, voluntarily to abandon its local monopoly
around Rochester and allow rival telecommunications businesses to compete
against it.
Rochester was the first of the monopolistic local US phone companies to
propose such a course. And while a second company, the huge, Chicago-based
Ameritech, has since weighed in with a competitive proposal of its own, the
Rochester scheme is in several respects more radical.
'We're convinced we're looking at something which will be the model for how
services are delivered in the industry in every company eventually,' says Mr
John Purcell, Rochester's corporate vice-president for planning.
At the very least Rochester has one of the most coherent strategies in an
industry which often seems to be fumbling as it tries to come to terms with
a fundamental change of environment.
The monopolies enjoyed by the local industry - which comprises seven
so-called 'Baby Bell' regional companies and a host of independents such as
Rochester - are beginning to break down, thanks to the new technologies of
high-capacity fibre optic cable and cellphones.
New competitors are starting to eat into the phone companies' most lucrative
existing businesses, and threaten to take a large slice of promising new
ones, such as interactive video to the home.
Rochester Telephone, which is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, has a
history of innovation. In 1970 it was the first US telecommunications group
to allow consumers to own, rather than lease, their own phones. And it was
the first local telecommunications company to set up its own long-distance
business in 1984, when this was made possible by the court-ordered break-up
of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
The company realised that slow population growth in the Rochester area would
not support its ambitious expansion plans. Hence its takeover of 37 local
telephone companies in 15 states over the past six years.
It now wants the New York state commission, which oversees its affairs, to
give it permission to divide its Rochester area telecommunications
operations into two separate businesses, each with their own boards and
balance sheets. Above them would sit a new holding company, responsible for
the 37 out-of-state phone companies and Rochester's cellular radio
interests.
One of the two, with the working name of R-Net, would take over the vast
bulk of the Rochester area assets - the basic telecommunications
transmission and switching network. It would become a wholesale seller of
these services to other telecommunications companies, which would add value
and retail the services on to the consumer.
The second Rochester company, dubbed R-Com, would be one of these competing
retailers. It would take on Rochester operations that involve marketing,
customer relations, voice mail, inside wire maintenance and yellow pages.
R-Net's prices would remain subject to regulation and it would have to sell
its services to both R-Com and newcomers at the same price. The retail
market, however, would be freed from price regulation.
Why destroy your own monopoly? The main reason is that competition is coming
anyway. The city already has a so-called 'competitive access provider' - a
company that uses its own fibre optic circuits to cream off bulk business
customers.
The provider is partly owned by the local cable television company, Time
Warner, which is itself building a fibre optic backbone into its network
that could ultimately be used for telecommunications traffic.
Rochester Telephone hopes that by taking the competitive initiative - and
simultaneously getting rid of much of the regulatory restraints that
accompany its monopoly position - it has a much greater chance of remaining
in the driving seat of an industry which, says Mr Purcell, is changing at
'warp speed'.
'If we are right and we see the way the market is developing, and we get
there first, we have a huge strategic advantage,' he adds.
The precise form of restructuring proposed by Rochester could also work to
its advantage. A stand-alone R-Net, offering one of the most advanced local
networks in the US to all comers, might be able to deter potential rivals
from building their own infrastructure.
The main dangers will be to R-Com, which seems bound to lose some of its
market share to new retail rivals. The key questions are how much, whether
this will be offset by a great expansion in the market as competition
fosters demand for new services, and the effect of these forces on prices.
Rochester, like other regulated phone companies, is required to subsidise
its residential services which are extremely cheap - Dollars 13 a month for
a basic service with unlimited local calling.
To win regulatory support for its plan, the company is proposing to keep its
residential prices static until 1995, with inflation-based increases between
then and 1998. Mr Purcell hopes that prices will rise after that.
The final advantage of the restructuring is that the new holding company
might be able to move much more quickly to raise capital and launch
takeovers - like a much more entrepreneurial business.
It is likely to be 1994 before the New York commission, traditionally in
favour of competition, decides on Rochester's plan. As it weighs up the
benefits to the consumer and company, a question bound to be asked is
whether any other company will dare take on entrenched Rochester.
Mr Purcell dismisses the fear: 'In the US telecommunications industry, for
the past 20 years, every time there's been a window for entrepreneurs to buy
wholesale and resell, they've jumped at the chance.' Why should Rochester be
any different?

FT  11 MAY 93 / GPA may seek protection from its creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group has established a working party to look at the implications of
examination, the Irish equivalent to administration, if talks with
bondholders prove unsuccessful.
GPA is understood to have lined up an examiner, although creditors could
request an alternative examiner.
The troubled aircraft leasing company remains confident, however, that its
meeting with bondholders on Thursday will lead to a moratorium on debt
repayments giving it valuable breathing space to agree a deal with a 'white
knight'.
The examination working party is one of five committees set up under the
overall restructuring, named Project Rebound. The other committees have been
set up to deal with bondholders, potential new investors, existing
shareholders and the aircraft manufacturers.
Mr Patrick Blaney was recently appointed to the board as chief operating
officer with responsibility for Project Rebound.
GPA hopes to secure a debt moratorium with bondholders, which hold more than
than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) of unsecured debt, when it meets them in the
US on Thursday. The meeting is being organised by Mr David Ying, director at
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York brokerage house.
The bonds are currently trading at around 15 per cent of their face value,
indicating that the market does not believe that they will be paid in full.
GPA has a temporary waiver of breaches on its banking covenants until May
17, when more than Dollars 50m of the bonds mature. A further Dollars 170m
of bonds mature by the end of June.
The group's lenders will only allow payment of the bonds if the group
succeeds in persuading new shareholders to inject up to Dollars 200m.
To this end the group is talking to GE Capital about the possibility of
selling assets in exchange for warrants to subscribe for shares at a later
date.
If the talks do not prove conclusive in the short term a debt-for-equity
swap with the bondholders is seen as inevitable.
GPA is already considering one option whereby shareholders could see their
holding in the company diluted to less than 5 per cent if bondholders swap
all their debt for equity.
Bondholders, some of which are being advised by Lazard Freres, are likely to
resist such attempts, although they may be willing to swap some of their
debt for equity.
The company has been in informal discussions with bondholders for the past
month. The talks are being led by Mr Mike Dolan, managing director of GPA
Capital.
According to one of the group's principal lenders, examination is being
carefully considered although it remains the least favourite option.
Examination gives a company court-ratified protection from its creditors for
three weeks while an examiner or reporting accountant considers the options
for its rescue. It then allows a further three months before formal
proposals must be put forward.
The group would not have to pay interest on its debt obligations or repay
any of the principal to secured or unsecured creditors if it was to go into
examination. Some of the group's core lenders oppose such a move, fearing
that creditors would be able to seize GPA's assets, mainly aircraft,
registered outside Ireland. Most of the banks also remain pessimistic about
the group's chances of negotiating a satisfactory deal with GE Capital.
Mr Jack Hersch, director of research at MJ Whitman, the Wall Street firm
specialising in bank debt trading, said: 'By negotiating with GE in a vacuum
it narrows the options for the remaining participants in the restructuring.'

FT  11 MAY 93 / French PM acts to curb deficit: Balladur moves to revive
economy and bail out social security system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDOUARD Balladur, the French prime minister, announced wide-ranging
measures yesterday to rein in France's growing budget and social security
deficits as well as giving its stalled economy a selective boost.
Acting after only five weeks in office, Mr Balladur said: 'It is no longer
possible to wait any more' before moving to reduce the deficits that would
otherwise rise to more than FFr400bn (Pounds 48bn) this year  - 5.8 per cent
of national output.
With a FFr7.7bn increase in alcohol and petrol taxes and a FFr21.5bn
reduction in current spending programmes, he said he hoped to restrain the
budget deficit to FFr331bn this year, or 4.5 per cent of gross domestic
product.
At the same time, he is giving a FFr12.9bn boost to housing, public works
and job-creating measures this year.
The broadest increase will be in the contribution sociale generalisee (CSG),
which taxes earned and unearned income. It is to rise from 1.1 per cent to
2.4 per cent, with much of its proceeds to be devoted to bailing out the
social security system.
Mr Balladur acknowledged the dilemma of increasing taxes during a recession,
which the government estimates will reduce national output by 0.1 per cent
this year.
The prime minister was speaking after a cabinet meeting at which the
government also approved the draft statute to give the Bank of France
autonomy in monetary policy. At the cabinet meeting, President Francois
Mitterrand questioned whether the constitution would allow the government to
surrender control over monetary policy before the Maastricht treaty on
European unity, which in the long term obliges it to give up that control,
comes into effect.
Mr Balladur conceded that it was 'a legally delicate matter', which would
require careful consultation over the precise timing of independence for the
French central bank.
Mr Balladur warned: 'The exponential growth of the deficit and the debt
risks deprive France of all margin of manoeuvre, in particular to pursue the
lowering of interest rates on which we have embarked.'
The new French conservative government inherited a budget that assumed 2.6
per cent growth this year. As a result, it overestimated revenue by about 10
per cent, or FFr124bn, and underestimated spending by some FFr44bn, Mr
Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister, said.
On the tax side, the government is counting on the increased CSG to bring in
an extra FFr25bn this year, as well as FFr7.7bn from alcohol and petrol
taxes.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Whaling ban wins strong US backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KYOTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government toughened its environmental policy yesterday, demanding
that the International Whaling Commission maintain a ban on whaling
regardless of scientific findings.
Pro-whaling nations such as Japan and Norway said the US decision increased
the likelihood that the body would collapse. An IWC scientific committee
report appeared to clear the way for limited catches in the north Atlantic
and in the Antarctic.
Most of the 32 countries represented at the IWC's annual conference, which
opened in Kyoto yesterday, are in favour of an extension of the decade-long
moratorium, although few have been as blunt as the US. Its stance suggests
that the usually accepted principle of 'sustainable development' does not
apply to whales.
US officials said the decision followed a policy review by the Clinton
administration, which concluded that a resumption of commercial whaling
would not be supported even if the 'requisite assessment and management
procedures' are agreed by the IWC.
The US went further than the UK and most other western countries, and may
prompt debate on a similar toughening of controls over fauna and flora
covered by other international agreements.
Mr John Gummer, the UK minister of agriculture, fisheries and food, said
yesterday that lifting the ban could not be contemplated until whale numbers
were verified.
A report prepared by the IWC's scientific committee made clear that there
appeared to be sufficient stocks for small quotas of minke whales in the
Antarctic and in the north Atlantic.
However, the UK still has concerns about the humaneness of whaling methods
and the enforcement of any future agreement on catches. UK officials said a
lifting of the ban was unlikely, but they also expect that a proposed vote
on a 'whale sanctuary' in the Antarctic will not succeed.
The Norwegian representatives said their government would reconsider its IWC
membership. Japan has also threatened to withdraw but is unlikely to risk a
clash with the new US administration.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Continental customers balk at paying UK company bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies are finding it increasingly difficult to persuade
Continental European customers to pay their bills on time - or at all.
One in five UK companies lost money as a result of non-payment by an EC
customer in the year ended March, compared with one in eight in the 12
months ended March 1989, according to a survey published yesterday by NCM, a
credit insurance company.
UK exporters must be cautious about seizing export opportunities in the EC
because of the growing risk of default or late payment, NCM warned. The
position in Germany has worsened markedly and even blue-chip companies in
some sectors face severe difficulties in making payments, said Ms Conni
Randall, NCM business strategy director.
News of the growing risk of doing business with other EC countries came the
day after a study by Manchester Business School for National Westminster
Bank showed that UK companies had difficulties obtaining payment from
domestic customers.
Customers in all the main EC countries were more likely to default on
payment than previously, the NCM survey showed. One in 11 companies
supplying customers in France experienced non-payment compared with one in
14 four years earlier. One in 25 companies experienced a default in Germany
compared with one in 35 previously.
Payments delayed significantly longer than was normal in individual industry
sectors rose by 63 per cent to an all-time high of Pounds 90m in 1992-93
against Pounds 54m previously. Delayed payments from Germany rose by 136 per
cent and from Italy by 115 per cent.
In contrast with the gloomy conclusions of the NCM and NatWest surveys,
payment delays in the UK are declining, according to the latest quarterly
review by the Association of British Factors and Discounters.
The average time taken to collect debts dropped to 57 days at the end of
March from 62 days at the beginning of the year.

Few French investors will be trudging into work this morning with red eyes
and weary step having combed through the fine print of the new government's
budget. Its main outlines had already been trailed, allowing the markets a
more measured contemplation of their effect. The government was always going
to face difficulties reconciling demands to reduce the projected FFr340bn
budget deficit and to stimulate economic growth. The rise in indirect taxes
on petrol and alcohol provided a touch of rigour in addressing the former
problem. A modest spending programme offered some encouragement for the
latter.
The bond market may appreciate this lack of drama. The equity market,
though, may begin to worry more about the underlying economic situation. The
government is now projecting a 0.4 per cent fall in market sector GDP in
1993, suggesting real damage to corporate earnings. Some support should be
provided by new tax incentives designed to encourage investors to switch
from money market funds into share savings plans ahead of the government's
privatisation programme. Further cuts in interest rates would provide a more
direct impulse. That, though, will depend on France's eastern neighbour.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's electronics manufacturers have failed to excite programme makers,
satellite operators or consumers with high-definition television. Yet,
judging by the negotiations in Brussels yesterday, they are still trying to
play pork barrel politics to keep their obsolete vision of the future
switched on. Both the Japanese system and HD-MAC, the European
high-definition television standard, use analogue technology similar to
conventional sets. Digital HDTV technology is, however, catching up. In the
US the Federal Communications Commission is due to select a digital standard
within the next year. Digital TV's extra capacity will leave analogue
standing, yet Philips and Thomson are still trying to get public money to
promote their old-style HD-MAC.
Waiting for digital TV would delay HDTV by at least 5 years. The equipment
would also be more expensive than that using HD-MAC. Perhaps digital
television will never attract enough interest to make people switch. But it
seems improbable that television companies or consumers will be prepared to
commit almost as much money to HD-MAC in the knowledge that a better
technology is just around the corner.
The urgency comes from electronics manufacturers who need new products as
existing technologies are rapidly becoming commodities. Unfortunately, they
cannot afford to wait for digital TV - hence their desire to fill the gap.
Margins in consumer electronics are falling worldwide. Most manufacturers
are trying to cut costs, but they cannot hang on to efficiency gains in a
competitive market. Companies like Philips with high labour costs and weak
balance sheets are poorly placed to compete. A little EC graft will not
solve the problem.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Past form suggests the government likes to react to political troubles with
a soothing cut in interest rates. That thought gripped both the foreign
exchange and equity markets yesterday, especially given the favourable data
on producer prices. Manufacturers' output prices are showing only a
restrained response to sterling's exit from the ERM. while input prices are
already feeling the benefit of its recent appreciation. A similarly positive
message from the retail prices next week - which is to be expected anyway
now there is no poll tax - might create an excuse for lower rates. It would
be rash to assume the government will use it.
The economy is stronger than it was at the time of January's surprise cut
and interest rates are, of course, lower. Yesterday's consumer credit data
show the recovery is taking hold, but the balance of payments is too fragile
to sustain consumer-led growth for long. If there has to be a quick
political response to the Newbury and local election results, it is more
likely to take the form of a cabinet reshuffle than a cut in rates.
A new chancellor would still confront old problems. Norman Lamont's last
budget failed adequately to address the medium-term strains on the PSBR,
while Newbury has increased the political obstacles in the way of reducing
it. A further rate cut might in due course soften the blow of fiscal
tightening. By steepening the yield curve, it would also facilitate the sale
of gilts. But the PSBR would finally have to come under convincing control.
Otherwise the markets may start to worry about the inflationary spectre and
interest rates would be on their way up again.

FT  11 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Tomkins' thin slices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomkins' latest trading announcement does little to dispel the view that the
conglomerate is more intent on rewriting numbers on bits of paper than
taking decisive steps to reshape Ranks Hovis McDougall. Tomkins' shares have
wobbled recently so it decided to release a progress report before entering
its closed period. Given current sensitivities about price-sensitive
information, such an approach is certainly to be commended.
That said, not a lot emerged. Much of the progress made has been pretty
standard stuff. Tomkins has chopped about 5 per cent of RHM's workforce  -
or 1,500 jobs. It has shut RHM's UK and US head offices. Some of RHM's
sacred cows - such as its research and development budget - have already
gone through the mincer. Tomkins will take a Pounds 90m provision to cover
such costs. Although the scale of provisioning is not large by the standards
of a BTR or Hanson, it still represents about 7 per cent of the purchase
price. David Tweedie would hardly approve.
As a piece of financial engineering, the acquisition's appeal is now
becoming apparent. The industrial logic, though, remains as opaque as ever.
The rationalisation of RHM's milling and baking businesses is proceeding
much as the previous management had already outlined. The great assault on
the industry's capacity problems has not yet been made. Meanwhile, the
competition may even intensify. ABF has lost several percentage points of
market share in the past few years. It seems rather keen to win it back.

IT IS convenient for a new government to blame unpopular decisions on its
predecessor. It is not surprising, therefore, that the new centre-right
government headed by Mr Edouard Balladur should have blamed fiscal austerity
on the Socialists. The tragic suicide of his predecessor, Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, will make this approach seem more bitterly partisan even than
usual. The main question, however, is whether the scale and the timing of
the proposed action is warranted.
For 1993, claimed Mr Balladur yesterday, the total fiscal deficit would, if
unchecked, be FFr410bn or 5.8 per cent of gross domestic product. His
government's intention is to limit the deficit to 4 1/2 per cent of GDP this
year and bring it down to 2 1/2 per cent of GDP, within the Maastricht
fiscal criteria, by 1997.
The government's 'medium-term financial strategy' rests on tight control of
public spending, which is to grow less fast than inflation in nominal terms.
Meanwhile, reductions in the deficit this year will depend partly on tight
control of spending, including limits on increases in public salaries, and
also on an increase in the 'general social contribution', a surcharge on
income tax, from 1.1 to 2.4 per cent of incomes.
Growing deficit
Mr Balladur made much of the unsustainable fiscal position he inherited. The
deficit has tripled in three years, he pointed out. Meanwhile, public debt
has risen 40 per cent since 1988, when he left office as finance minister,
to reach a third of gross national product. In the absence of decisive
action, he argued, France risks losing all margin of manoeuvre.
Judged by current British fiscal standards, let alone those of the Italians,
Mr Balladur protests too much. Nevertheless, recent data from the IMF show
that the French general government financial deficit is only below those of
Italy, the UK and (marginally) Canada among the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries. The IMF also suggests that the deterioration in the
French structural fiscal deficit will be 2.1 per cent of GDP between 1991
and 1993, only fractionally less than the estimated cyclical deterioration
of 2.2 per cent over these years. France shows, in more modest form, the
same development as the UK: a large fiscal deterioration in reaction to an
exceptionally tight monetary policy.
The difference between France and the UK is that the former has only limited
control over monetary policy. The soon-to-be-independent Banque de France
has managed to reduce its important interest rates five times since the new
government took power, as the credibility of the parity has grown.
Short-term interest rate differentials vis-a-vis the D-Mark have more or
less disappeared, while the differential on long-term bonds is less than
half a percentage point.
Question of timing
These reductions in interest rates are as much as can be expected from
improved credibility. From now on lower interest rates will depend on
reductions in German interest rates, which will be slow at the short end and
may be slower still at the longer end. But this means that French long-term
real interest rates may remain at around 5 per cent for an extended period,
while short-term ones may fall only slowly from their current levels of
around 5 1/2 per cent. It is little wonder then that the French economy is
expected to shrink, in the government's view, by 0.4 per cent this year.
The government's fiscal programme has to be judged against this bleak
background. It is not whether action needs to be taken at some point, but
its timing that needs to be questioned. Should the budget proposals allow
the French government to lower still further, or even reverse the interest
rate premiums against Germany, then they would be well timed. But should
they merely tighten the fiscal grip, while the monetary one remains as
severe as it is now, their economic wisdom would have to be questioned.
Politics is almost always more important than economics. For the government,
it may be better to impose ill-timed measures it can blame on its
predecessor than well-timed ones which would be blamed on itself. For the
French public, therefore, it is rigueur today - and more rigueur tomorrow.

Good news and bad news in a Mori survey soliciting executives' views on
corporate governance. Music to the ears of the sponsors - two executive
placement companies - is that most of those questioned were in favour of
changes which would boost the number and power of non-executives on company
boards.
More dispiriting, by contrast, is that not many supported a more objective
selection process to govern the employment of their services. The bulk of
positions still seem to be filled via the old boy network, and most of
Mori's interviewees opposed a majority of non-executives on appointments
committees.

Tony Ensor, the only casualty of the boardroom bust-up at Liverpool Football
Club, is nowhere near as well known as Graham Souness, the club's embattled
manager. But his departure raises an interesting question. Who advised the
board on the legal side of the Souness row?
Ensor may have been little known to many fans, but he is widely respected in
the Merseyside business community as the senior partner of Weightman
Rutherfords, one of the north-west's leading corporate law firms. He became
a Liverpool director after the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, and has been
a source of stability in the boardroom ever since.
Ensor's sudden exit must raise questions about how long chairman David
Moores, a member of the wealthy Littlewoods pools family who became chairman
in August 1991, can survive in the job. The least Moores should do now is
find another top-notch lawyer.

No wonder the Labour party wants to reform the House of Lords. Last week,
John Smith, the party leader, had to sack Lord Desai from his job as
opposition economic spokesman for speaking out of turn on the merits of
extending VAT.
Now Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, has had to squash another
embarrassing initiative. Observer hears that his independently minded mates
in the upper house had wanted to do a deal with the Tory rebels who oppose
the government's leasehold reforms. In the hope of defeating ministers today
during the final stages of the bill, Labour peers were intending not to
vote, which would have given the Tory rebels a free run at the government.
The Commons shadow environment minister had to point out to them that Labour
itself is not in favour of restricting the rights of tenants as the
landlords' lobby propose. Ministers are now hoping that the opposition's
efforts at whipping its troops are rather more effective than their own.

What is business success? The title of tonight's debate at The Royal Society

Observer is concerned the bishop is probably the only one who can come up
with a convincing answer - getting to heaven on time.

Suggestions, please, for a replacement for one of Britain's most baffling
local authority names - Langbaurgh.
The name, which is Saxon for long barrow and refers to the Cleveland hills,
crept on to the map following the 1974 local government reorganisation. Its
pronunciation, and spelling, have caused bother ever since. Some people even
thought it was in Wales, prompting Langbaurgh council to slip in 'on-Tees' a
few years ago.
Now the Local Government Commission has said Langbaurgh should become a
unitary authority, but under a new name. One idea is Redcar Council. The
only problem is that the council offices are not in Redcar, but Eston, near
Middlesbrough. Suggestions on a postcard to the town clerk.

The idea of giving Lord Gowrie, boss of Sotheby's Europe, the chairmanship
of the Arts Council when Lord Palumbo's term expires next March, sounds
rather persuasive at first sight.
During his time in government Gowrie, 53, was one of the few arts ministers
who knew anything about the arts and as a published poet and former dealer
in contemporary pictures he would enjoy mixing with his own kind. The
stumbling block is whether he can square chairing the council and still keep
his well-paid job at Sotheby's.
Although Lord Palumbo turned it into a full-time post, it doesn't have to be
so. His predecessor, Lord Rees-Mogg, got by with popping in twice a week.
The difficulty is that the chairmanship of the Arts Council is unpaid and
Gowrie is not rich, so he would probably want to keep his Sotheby's pay
packet. This shouldn't pose much of an obstacle for Sotheby's. True, recent
management changes have undermined Gowrie's role in the firm. However
Sotheby's New York, which calls the shots, loves having a Lord on its
letterhead, especially one with a high-profile job at the heart of the
British establishment.
The real problem may be concerns in Whitehall that Sotheby's, rather than
the council, would gain most from any such appointment. The hunt for
Palumbo's successor may not be over.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Gamble in the North Sea: UK oil tax reforms raise crucial
questions about resource management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few measures in the March Budget created as much of a rumpus as Mr Norman
Lamont's proposals to reform the taxation of North Sea oil. Apart from
opening up divisions within the oil industry, they raised crucial questions
about how the UK should manage this important resource.
The repercussions reach parliament today with the debate on the finance
bill, for which a senior backbench MP has tabled amendments intended to
cushion the impact of the changes. But the government, in the person of Mr
Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, who is responsible
for the measure, is refusing to yield. 'I have listened to all the
representations we have received, and none of them contained anything that
we had not considered before the Budget,' he says.
Although the debate will be about the extent to which oil companies should
be allowed to set their exploration costs against their oil taxes, the real
issue is how the UK should make the most of its remaining oil and gas
reserves. Should they be treated as a strategic asset and exploited to the
full or only as the market dictates?
Mr Lamont, the chancellor of the Exchequer, is proposing to cut the
petroleum revenue tax (PRT) on existing large North Sea fields from 75 per
cent to 50 per cent, and to eliminate the tax altogether on new fields. But
at the same time, he wants to end oil companies' right to set their
exploration costs against their total PRT bill. The effect will be to make
production from developed fields more profitable, but increase sharply the
cost of exploration for companies which have been able to take advantage of
the PRT offset.
In his Budget speech Mr Lamont described PRT as 'increasingly
anachronistic'. It was introduced in 1975 at a time of surging production
and high oil prices to ensure that the Exchequer got its fair share of oil
profits. Today, with the oil price close to a 20-year low in real terms,
there is less incentive to increase production at such a high tax rate.
The ostensible aim of the changes, therefore, is to adapt the North Sea tax
regime to the requirements of a mature oil province where further large
finds are unlikely and interest has shifted to making the most of developed
reserves.
But the underlying motive is also to boost tax revenues. The Exchequer's
earnings from the North Sea have fallen from a peak of Pounds 12.2bn in
1984-85 (more than half of it from PRT, and the rest coming from royalties
and corporation tax), to only Pounds 1.35bn last year, of which a mere
Pounds 50m came from PRT. Although the Treasury will lose from the cut in
the PRT rate, this loss will be more than offset, it says, by the abolition
of exploration allowances, leaving a net addition to tax revenues of Pounds
300m next year and Pounds 400m the year after that.
A third motive is to bring North Sea taxation in line with the government's
overall approach of reducing tax rates and eliminating allowances. According
to Mr Dorrell, PRT at 75 per cent is the highest rate of any tax in the
country and the abolition of allowances will stop oil companies effectively
exploring at the taxpayers' expense.
But in trying to boost its revenues and bring oil taxation in line with its
fiscal philosophy, will the Treasury actually damage the prospects for the
North Sea? There is a danger that Mr Lamont will kill the incentive to
explore at the very moment when the UK needs to make that extra push to find
its last, difficult, fields. Will oil companies reinvest the savings from
lower PRT to squeeze more out of the North Sea or will they just pocket the
money and spend it elsewhere? More broadly, there is the question of whether
the new tax regime will handicap the UK in the increasingly competitive
international market for oil company investment.
These various issues depend on how the outlook for the North Sea is viewed.
Contrary to popular perceptions, Britain's oil production has not peaked.
Output is forecast to reach record levels of more than 125m tonnes in the
middle of this decade. As for reserves, the UK has extracted a total of
1.6bn tonnes of oil to date, and has between 610m and 2.1bn tonnes of
recoverable reserves left. The Department of Trade and Industry estimates in
its latest Brown Book (its oil and gas annual) that there could also be
between 530m and 3.3bn tonnes to be discovered. In addition, output and
reserves of natural gas, which are playing a fast-growing role in the
country's energy balance, are both rising. So while the North Sea may be
mature in the sense that it is well explored and developed, it is far from
being played out.
The Treasury's view is that the days of jumbo discoveries are past, and that
the job now is to ensure that known fields produce their maximum yield. This
view is supported, predictably perhaps, by Shell and BP, operators of two of
the largest fields in the North Sea, Brent and Forties, who stand to gain
from the PRT cuts.
Mr Chris Fay, managing director of exploration and production at Shell,
believes that more than half of the North Sea's oil has either been pumped
out already or is currently under development. This leaves a quarter which
has been discovered and not yet developed.
'The Budget is rewarding successful exploration by reducing production
taxes, but any exploration must be carefully costed and justified rather
than be merely a gamble as was often the case under the old regime,' Mr Fay
said.
However, the Treasury's argument is strongly opposed by smaller companies
who have taken the lead in the North Sea exploration effort as discoveries
have got smaller. They warn that the abolition of PRT allowances will lead
to a sharp drop in drilling and appraisal activity. Where it is currently
worthwhile for a company to develop a field of 15m barrels, the new tax
regime would quadruple costs and raise that threshold to 60m barrels, these
companies say. The consequence will be fewer additions to oil reserves and
therefore, ultimately, less tax revenue for the Exchequer, to say nothing of
lost jobs and other social costs.
'It means that there will be a tranche of oil and gas reserves that will not
be exploited,' says Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer at Lasmo, the
independent company with large North Sea interests. 'They'd rather leave
that unexploited than give back the tax benefits. I hope that they have
struck the right balance.'
Judging by the concern shown by many backbench MPs, the public is also
worried that the UK will fail to make the most of its oil assets. The
combination of low oil prices, rising costs and harder-to-find reserves has
already led to a fall in the number of exploration wells being drilled. This
suggests that incentives to explore should be sharpened, rather than
reduced, these MPs believe.
But Mr Dorrell decries what he describes as 'the National Coal Board culture
of seeking to recover a resource regardless of the cost'.
It is not in the country's interest, he says, to provide tax breaks for
companies to develop oil and gas deposits which are not economic in their
own right. He believes it is the country's duty to leave them in the ground
for future generations to develop when technological advances or rising
energy prices make them economic. He wants to change the North Sea from a
low-risk, low-reward province to one where oil companies take more of the
risk, but also keep more of the profit if they are successful. If this
results in oil being left in the ground, that is what the market thinks
best, according to Mr Dorrell.
The threat of a sharp fall in exploration may have been exaggerated by
independent companies who stand to lose their tax breaks. As much as 40 per
cent of current exploration activity is being conducted by companies which
pay no PRT against which to offset the cost, Mr Dorrell says.
The other important uncertainty is whether the government is correct in
assuming that oil companies will reinvest their PRT savings in the North
Sea. Again, the oil majors are promising big benefits as development
projects are accelerated to take advantage of lower PRT. Mr David Simon,
chief executive of British Petroleum, said: 'The PRT changes will bring more
barrels out of the North Sea. Some projects will move up the pecking order
of priorities worldwide because of the new tax regime.'
BP yesterday announced it would develop nine oil fields in the central North
Sea earlier than planned because of the Budget changes. The company said
that development of the fields - the Eastern Trough Area Project, which will
cost between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn over the next five years - was
given a 'significant impetus' by the new PRT rules.
But the smaller companies take a different line. Mr Francis Gugen, finance
director of Amerada Hess, points out that even after the PRT cut, profits
from large North Sea fields will be taxed at 71 per cent by the time
corporation tax is added in. 'Why invest in something with that sort of tax
rate when you could invest elsewhere?' he asks. Amerada has said that it
will transfer exploration out of the UK North Sea if the Budget changes go
through.
Whether a flight of drill rigs out of the North Sea actually occurs depends
on how the UK stacks up against other oil producing regions. Under the new
regime, the rate of tax on North Sea profits would range from 33 per cent on
fields exempt from PRT, to 71 per cent on fields that pay it. This is a
relatively low rate by international standards (in Norway companies pay a
flat 78 per cent). But the abolition of allowances will put the UK at a
disadvantage to Norway which allows full tax relief for exploration and
where geologists believe there are still large fields yet to be discovered.
In spite of the high costs and maturity of the North Sea, a study by Wood
MacKenzie, the oil analysis group in Edinburgh, found that the UK still
compares well with other countries in its attractiveness for drilling. The
study was completed before the PRT changes, but Wood MacKenzie believes they
will not affect the appeal of the UK's oil and gas resources.
Wood MacKenzie plotted the number of commercial oil discoveries against the
number of wells drilled for nine countries in three distinct regions
worldwide: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam in south-east Asia;
Angola, Congo and Gabon in west Africa; and Norway and the UK in the North
Sea.
The analysts found that, in the past 20 years, the UK was behind only Norway
in the number of commercial oil finds. But because of its increasing
maturity, the UK slipped into sixth place when it was ranked on the success
of wells in finding commercial oil discoveries in the past five years.
The study also compares the countries on a risk-reward basis which ranks the
drilling success rate with the attractiveness of the fiscal regime. This was
conducted before the PRT changes. The UK ranked joint second with the Congo
after Vietnam.
But Wood MacKenzie stresses the importance of the host government's attitude
to the oil industry in attracting its migratory capital. Mr David Black, an
industry consultant at Wood MacKenzie said: 'One of the disappointing
features of this PRT change is that the UK was always regarded by the
industry as politically and fiscally stable: everyone knew how you played
the game, but this has been destroyed at a stroke.' Mr Black said the lack
of consultation over the changes and the retrospective nature of the move
had shocked the industry.
The industry still hopes that the Treasury will agree to transitional
arrangements to soften the blow and restore the UK's hospitable image. These
arrangements, proposed by Mr John Butterfill, MP for Bournemouth West, and
other senior Tory backbenchers, involve continuing tax relief for wells
where companies have made commitments to drill but have not yet started
work. This will be financed by raising the proposed PRT rate from 50 per
cent to 55 per cent until the end of 1996.
Mr Lamont is taking quite a gamble with his proposed reforms. If they work,
he will have called the oil industry's bluff about their potentially
disastrous impact. Britain will enjoy the double benefit of continued
exploration and more intensively managed North Sea fields. But if he has
misjudged the situation he may not only stifle new exploration, but he could
also kiss goodbye to billions of dollars worth of future North Sea
investment.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Off your bike, Mr Patten
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER LAST week's humiliating election defeats for the government, the prime
minister promised to pay more attention to the concerns of the electorate.
Close to the top of Mr Major's priorities should be the fiasco over the
testing of schoolchildren in England and Wales and indeed there were hints
last night that Mr Major might be ready to consider a tactical retreat on
this summer's tests. Two opinion polls yesterday indicated that teachers who
are boycotting the tests have succeeded in winning public support for their
action. A compromise is urgently needed to end the threatened confusion in
schools while preserving the government's aim of improving standards through
regular testing.
The opinion poll results make salutary reading for ministers. One showed
that 62 per cent of parents wanted this year's tests abandoned, while 51 per
cent supported the teachers' boycott of the new tests. The other found that
62 per cent of all adults accepted the unions' argument that the tests are
too complicated and time-consuming. Over three-quarters believed the tests
had been introduced too hastily - including 63 per cent of Conservative
voters.
It is not that the government has lost the basic argument over tests; both
polls show support for the idea of regular testing. Mr John Patten, the
education secretary, therefore seems to have pulled off a remarkable coup in
uniting so many against the English tests to be introduced this summer for
14-year-olds. In addition to alienating the teachers, the parents and the
general public, he has lost the support of independent schools, governors
and managers, and even two of his own advisers on testing.
Hidden agenda
Despite the breadth of opposition, Mr Patten promises to persevere with the
testing timetable. He rightly accuses some opponents of having a hidden
agenda which is opposed to compulsory testing. He rejects the calls of those
who want the extension of testing suspended until the completion of the
review of the national curriculum by Sir Ron Dearing. He says that people
riding bicycles fall off if they stop pedalling, a tempting analogy but
unfortunately not a pertinent one in the circumstances.
For in continuing to pedal so vigorously, Mr Patten threatens to cycle over
a cliff and destroy the testing bicycle altogether. With the united
opposition of all six teachers' unions, there is little chance of the tests
taking place in enough schools to validate comparisons based on them. Some
heads and teachers will make efforts to stage the tests. So, too, will some
governing bodies and education authorities. The consequence will be to sour
relationships with teachers who are boycotting the tests, to little
educational purpose. There may also be a further loss of confidence in the
policy among parents.
Tactical retreat
Worse, the boycott of the tests for 14-year-olds threatens to spread to the
tests for seven-year-olds. These are in their third year, and appear to be
running smoothly after initial teething troubles. By refusing to call off
the tests at 14, the government risks losing the worthwhile progress made on
tests at seven.
The most important task now facing ministers is to build a consensus on
testing which can command the support of all but the most die-hard opponents
of tests. It would be hard to come up with proposals for externally
moderated tests which would win the support of the most militant teaching
unions. But it should be possible to win back the support of the moderate
Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the head teachers' unions - not to
mention testing advisers, governors and, of course, parents.
It is time, therefore for a tactical retreat on testing for 14-year-olds.
Time is needed to devise less unwieldy tests confined to the aim of allowing
parents to judge the performance of schools rather than providing nationwide
comparisons of individual student performance. Ideally those tests would be
ready for 1994, so that the testing timetable slipped by only one year. But
more important than a timetable is the requirement for tests which command
the support of most, if not all, of the constituencies with an interest in
raising the standards of education in Britain's schools.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Letter: Assessment of Italian economy is detached from
reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FLAVIO PARINI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest and a little apprehension Franco Modigliani's
personal view on things Italian ('The year of the great opportunity', May 5)
and I believe a few of his statements cannot rest unchallenged. Mr
Modigliani is one of the brand-name economists that established governments
in Italy regularly call up to back up their assertions that Italy is well on
its way to recovery (economically, politically, morally or whatever is
trendy at the time).
The idea that the creation of more secure jobs will follow from developments
on the further ratification of agreements on the labour-cost front is nice,
but a little detached from reality. As Mr Modigliani himself points out
later in his article, deficit reduction comes from urgent cuts in public
expenditure and revenues from privatisations. Both these measures, if
implemented, require substantial restructuring of the inefficient public
sector where some estimates put the dimension of 'overstaffing' at some
300,000.
The role of the unions will now become closely intertwined with the new
political reality that has emerged and that will dominate the scene whatever
future political developments are likely to be: the role of the PDS (the
former Communist party) as a balancing force in coalitions (a role formerly
assigned to the now disgraced Socialist party).
To draw any conclusions without highlighting this would mean
over-simplifying the picture beyond reason.
A final consideration on interest rates: the very fabric of the Italian
economy rests upon the key assumption that taxpayers remain happy with their
returns and are willing to subsidise the gargantuan debt mountain. This in
itself distorts the picture versus its neighbours greatly and provides an
automatic downside.
I disagree with the statement that Italy is engaged in a rebellion against
the Bundesbank in that the way events, both at the time of devaluation and
ever since were handled, indicate precisely the opposite - a repetition of
the old game with the added spice of great political uncertainty.

<TEXT>
Sir, It comes as a shock to read of a British government claiming credit for
turning the people of our country into a reserve army of cheap labour
('Claim on wages attacked', May 4). And yet this is what Mr Major, the prime
minister, and Mrs Shephard, the employment secretary, are seeking brownie
points for. Come to Britain for the lowest pensions, the lowest wages, the
lowest social benefits in Europe  - this is what our government is saying to
German and other European companies, even if the case is exaggerated.
There was a time when British governments felt it to be their first
responsibility to improve living standards for the majority of people - to
be the best in Europe, not the worst. Now after a decade and a half of low
investment in industry and cuts in the social wage, the British government
is begging European companies to take advantage of our low standards. What a
commentary this is on the priorities of modern Toryism. And what a recipe to
drive down standards in Europe as country after country is encouraged to
scramble for bottom position in the league table of social benefits. As the
union representing more than half a million skilled and professional people,
MSF will use every avenue, including the European Court, to construct a
level playing field within Europe's developing single labour market.

FT  11 MAY 93 / A clean break at last: The sweeping national realignment of
Italy's political landscape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dust is yet to settle on what Italians have called the 'big bang'. But
the extraordinary break-up of the country's political system is beginning to
yield new alliances that symbolise the struggle to restore confidence in a
discredited state.
The national political realignment is taking place either within the
existing parties or by their splintering and forming new associations, as
politicians seek desperately to recycle themselves.
Prominent among them is Mr Mario Segni, the leader of the referendum
movement on constitutional reform, who in early April broke after 16 years
with the Christian Democrats. At the weekend he took the first steps towards
heading a new Roman Catholic centrist party - based around the year-old
reformist association, Democratic Alliance. The latter is still only a
movement to test the wind in the June municipal elections.
Another who is trying to recycle his standing is Mr Giuliano Amato, the
former Socialist premier, who is rethinking his previously announced
withdrawal from politics. Capitalising on his reputation as a skilful and
courageous premier, he is considering forming a new social democratic
formation. To the left is another grouping around the PDS. Meanwhile, both
the Christian Democrat and Socialist leaderships have said that they intend
to resurrect their own parties by changing their names and symbols.
Both the break-up and reformation have been held back until now because many
old guard politicians blocked it. At the same time, the reformers lacked the
courage to make a clean break.
The disintegration started nearly three years ago with the metamorphosis of
the old Italian Communist party into the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
However, the wave of corruption scandals unearthed by magistrates since
early last year has proved the biggest single catalyst in discrediting the
traditional parties that have ruled Italy since the second world war.
Three events radically altered the panorama: the fall of the Amato
government, the advent of a transitional administration under former
governor of the Bank of Italy, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and the outcome of
the April 18-19 referendums on constitutional reform.
Italy now has a government whose specific task is to introduce electoral
reform in line with the principles laid down by the referendum. The
overwhelming referendum vote ending public funding of political parties and
introducing reform of the proportional representation system was a profound
message of protest from the electorate.
Voters are no longer prepared to give their loyal support to parties which
never bothered to prepare programmes yet managed to remain in power through
unstable coalitions (the Ciampi government is the 52nd since the war).
Instead they want governments with specific platforms, which are answerable
to the electorate and which can be defeated at the polls. This would produce
the vital change-over of power which Italy has lacked, and which arguably
lies behind the consolidation of corruption.
Italy could adopt, as early as July, a first-past-the-post-system for
two-thirds of the deputies and senators, the remainder still being elected
by proportional representation to safeguard minority interests.
The prospect of fresh elections in October and the impending
municipal/regional elections in June, affecting 11m voters, provoked a
flurry of flirtations. The most striking new political force is the populist
Lombard League of Mr Umberto Bossi, which claims nearly a third of the vote
in the north. Mr Bossi seems content to focus on conquering the north and
playing for a devolution of power to the regions.
Few seem willing to withdraw from national politics, save those too tainted
by the corruption scandals to be publicly acceptable. In the latter category
are Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, against whom Milan
magistrates are seeking to press corruption charges, and Mr Giulio
Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat and seven times premier, whom
Palermo magistrates want to question.
Such elder statesmen, many now humbled, are likely to find themselves
overtaken by the all-engulfing nature of the changes that are uprooting a
whole political culture - and with it the dominant role of the state in the
economy. The need for this 'big bang' was evident in the wake of the general
elections in April last year. Even then it seemed likely that Mr Segni's
referendum movement would be able to gain sufficient signatures to prosper
with proposals to reform voting for the Senate.
The Amato coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, social democrats and
liberals was forced out of office because it was too identified with the
'partitocracy' - the carving-up of power and the institutions of state among
a corrupt party elite. Not only was the coalition undermined by losing five
ministers implicated in the scandals, it also lacked the moral authority to
carry out electoral reform, which all parties accepted as an essential step
towards renewing the political system.
The task has fallen on Mr Ciampi, 72, the first non-parliamentarian to head
a government this century. His was a choice of last resort, underlining the
bankruptcy of established politics. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro turned to
his unquestioned prestige when the parties were unable to agree on anyone to
perform this thankless responsibility.
Mr Ciampi nearly fell at the first hurdle when the PDS and the Greens pulled
out within 10 hours of his forming a cabinet. His position remains tenuous.
He has been obliged to rely upon the same slim majority as the outgoing
four-party coalition of Mr Amato.
His strongest card is the fact that if he loses parliamentary support there
is no alternative but immediate elections. This would be a recipe for
disastrously unstable government, with imponderable consequences for
economic management. The April referendum has introduced reform only for the
Senate; without a balancing reform in the Chamber of Deputies, different
electorate systems would apply for the two houses, which have equal powers
of veto over each other.
The length of the government will depend on whether a majority in parliament
believes Mr Ciampi's mandate is solely electorial reform, or if he has a
broader brief to manage the economy. The former implies elections by the
autumn once new rules are agreed; the latter a longer tenure, prehaps until
next spring, allowing the parties to regroup.
Mr Ciampi's hand is inherently weak because of the serious splits within the
parliamentary majority on which he must rely. These splits will become more
evident after the municipal and regional elections in June. If he survives
beyond the autumn, it would create the curious precedent of a non-politician
leading a democracy through a political crisis after its politicians
completely failed to do so.

Sir, Your leader suggests that it is in the wider public interest to
deregulate.
From a purely economic viewpoint, this may well be the case, although the
argument is far from proven - the impact of recovery of overheads, varied
contracts etc, may not yet have been fully accounted for in the rush to
achieve seven-day trading.
However, from a social viewpoint, the wider public interest is unlikely to
be served by turning Sunday into just another High Street trading day. The
traditional 'different-ness' of Sundays portrayed as a rest day or family
day, seems to me to be essential in the longer-term welfare of society. The
break of routine that the weekend, and particularly Sunday, provides is an
important contribution to the well-being of us all.
I am sure that our creator God knew best when a day of rest was included in
His blueprint for the pattern of life.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('Sunday trading', May 7) suggests that sectional interests
in the Sunday trading debate, and especially those who oppose deregulation,
are not making a genuine attempt to define the wider public interest. That
is not their job. It is the job of government to define and serve the wider
public interest, and gather such information as is deemed necessary to do
so.
In the case of Sunday trading, this process has been in work for many years,
and sectional representations have been balanced by many economic
assessments which, when they are independent as in the case of the latest
from London Economics, have produced results which can only be speculative
and imprecise.
Soon the issue will move on to parliament again, where of course sectional
interests are well represented. For this reason, the forthcoming
parliamentary consultation exercise is likely to lack the definition and
service of the wider public interest you rightly seek.
In the meantime, the leaders of the sectional interests will continue to
fight their corners, and they would be in serious dereliction of their duty
to their shareholders and members if they did not do so.

<TEXT>
Don't laugh, but I'm beginning to wonder whether Mr John Major really can
look forward to a prolonged tenure of office. This rush of blood to the head
will be explained in a moment. First, let it be assumed that similar
intimations of political mortality may have occurred to the prime minister
himself yesterday as he consulted colleagues on the vexed question of
whether or not to dismiss his chancellor in response to the clamour of
frightened Tories.
If so, he will be aware that a cabinet reshuffle alone will not restore calm
for long. For it is becoming plain that a chancellor here or there is no
longer the deciding issue. Anyhow, the time for Mr Norman Lamont to resign
was after lunch on September 16 1992, when his previously-proclaimed
policies crumbled. There can be no glorious departure now. A sacking, or
even a transfer, might be taken as evidence of panic. Mr Major has been
struggling since Black Wednesday to restore his personal authority. In so
doing, he has already used up six or perhaps seven of his political lives.
Throwing Mr Lamont overboard might not be sufficient to prevent Fate from
depriving him of the rest.
So much for doleful thoughts. The conventional wisdom, frequently rehearsed
in this space, is that the Tories will win the next general election in
spite of the upsets that have made such fools of them since they won for a
fourth time in a row in April 1992. To judge by most of the weekend comment,
this assumption has survived the drubbing the government took from the
voters last Thursday. Most of us have also made the calculation that Mr
Major will stay as leader.
Nothing tests your faith in the conventional wisdom more severely than a
change of scene. In London last week, the familiar arguments held sway.
Labour remains unmodernised, in thrall to the trade unions, and therefore
unable to count on winning seats in the south of England. The Liberal
Democrats can neither help such a Labour party nor attain an overall
majority on their own. Boundary revisions will help the Tories. The economic
recovery will favour the incumbents at the next election. There is no
obvious candidate to replace Mr Major. To cap it all, the Tories have three
or four years in which to regroup themselves. If they look like losing the
next election they will, of course, choose to lose Mr Major first.
Just a small hop across the water and this perspective changes. No sooner
had I arrived here in Venice for the annual conference of the International
Press Institute than doubts began to creep in. One reason is that so many of
the other representatives come from countries in which traditional
politicians, or existing heads of government, have lost or are losing
popularity. The first four examples that spring to mind are France, Spain,
Germany and Italy. The political uncertainties that prevail in Britain are
recession-driven, as in other European democracies. Britain's recession has
been running for longer than the others, so its electorate is more
disenchanted. Mr Major's favourite reverie, in which by 1996 Mitterrand,
Gonzalez and Kohl have all left the stage to him alone, may suffer from the
fault that he is currently dodging the largest fusillade of rotten eggs and
old cabbages.
Looked at this way, the well-known facts of British political life can be
re-stated. For a start, the two principal opposition parties are edging
closer to one another. Their leaders are saying 'no deals, no pacts', but
voters showed last week that they know how to combine to throw the Tories
out when they want to. The Conservatives are deeply divided. Their
anti-Maastricht and pro-Thatcher schismatics (not always the same
individuals) seem willing to fight to the death to destroy the party they
say they love. Mr Major is contrasted with his predecessor in the same way
as Mr George Bush was once compared with Mr Ronald Reagan. The
Anglo-American super communicators of the 1980s were replaced by grey
individuals who seem unable to get things done. One of those, Mr Bush, has
fallen. Ergo. . .
From a distance, you see a vague outline of the wood, not the trees. At home
among the thickets of British politics the killer question, 'If not Major,
who?' is asked by everyone, including his Thatcherite enemies. The latter
have no champion ready to take over the party and insufficient voters to
support a stalking-horse. Likewise, the remark 'Labour? You cannot be
serious' usually suffices to shut off contemplation of a Conservative
defeat. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, has his own answer to these
arguments. He says he is a patient man, playing a long game. It is as if he
wants you to believe that his recent lack-lustre parliamentary performance
(which belies his reputation) is the product of a deliberate stratagem,
which, roughly summarised, is to sit back and let the Tories tear themselves
apart.
This would make sound sense, if it was accompanied by quiet backroom words
designed to re-invent the Labour party. If that is happening it is very
quiet indeed.
Here in Italy, a different fancy presents itself. Until very recently, the
famous Italian political problems - organised crime, corruption, a
multiplicity of small parties leading to weak government - seemed insoluble.
Perhaps they still are. But, as the rest of the world has been witnessing
with some admiration, the Italians are undergoing a bloodless revolution.
The complexities are described alongside. The cheering reminder for
outsiders is that no political situation is permanent; quite surprising
changes can suddenly occur. We saw that in the communist states. Now we are
seeing it in a western democracy.
In London this may seem like pie in the sky. The log jam in British politics
seems unbreakable. The electorate holds the government in fair contempt. The
Labour party has not yet earned its trust. The likely consequence is a long
period of sub-standard administration by Conservative politicians of the
second rank. That is the conclusion to which you must come if you accept the
conventional wisdom, as I suspect I will as soon as I get home. Yet
something unpredictable may change this - the rise of a Northern League, as
in Italy, or a Ross Perot, as in the US, or a sensibly modernised Lab-Lib
opposition, as in so many British imaginations. If you wish to be optimistic
about British politics you must believe that the people do eventually bestir
themselves, even in the most complacent of democracies.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his story 'LWT managers likely to receive Pounds 55m payout' (May 7)
Raymond Snoddy quoted my description, 'an outstanding reward for an
outstanding performance,' but failed to report some of the most important
features of that performance. Since December 15 1982 the FT All Share Index
has risen 18 per cent; the LWT share price rose 304 per cent. LWT's market
capitalisation increased from Pounds 73m to Pounds 355m, and the IRR for LWT
shareholders was more than 50 per cent a year.
The scheme was not, as Lex describes it, a share option scheme; LWT's
managers risked approximately Pounds 3m of their money, and the scheme was
approved by LWT's shareholders. And finally, perhaps Bectu should ask
themselves whether their members were better to have been at LWT since 1989
than at the four companies which lost their franchise.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Arts: An artist ripe for reassessment - William Packer
admires the work of Graham Sutherland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 40 years ago, Graham Sutherland stood higher in reputation than any of
his contemporaries, higher even than his friend and associate, Francis Bacon
who, though no less radical, was still comparatively obscure. Sutherland in
the mid 1950s was Britain's pre-eminent and, after the Churchill portrait,
most controversial modern painter. By the time of his death in 1980, at the
age of 76, all that had long since changed. Indeed it changed with a
remarkable suddenness. One minute he was the cynosure of all attention: I
well remember in the early 1960s the excitement at the publication of the
latest monograph; the next, he was old hat, passe, a figure not merely
established but of the establishment, honoured, secure, predictable and
safe.
Two late decades of indifferent portraiture hardly helped his cause, but
then he is hardly the first artist so to suffer a decline. His reputation
languishes still and clearly he is ripe, even overdue, for reassessment. The
problem is that his career seemed to fall into three sharply distinctive
phases, and it has long been the received wisdom that his reputation, such
as it is, stands on the work of his middle period, from the late 1930s when
he turned to painting, to the early 1960s and the completion of the Coventry
tapestry commission.
Such a view is not altogether wrong. His work in the immediate post-war
period, when he had moved on from the earlier romantic landscapes to the
more intense and psychologically ambiguous imagery derived from natural
forms, is perhaps the strongest of all. That was the time of his closest
association with Bacon, their working relationship one of true equality and
mutual respect, each directly influencing the other.
But it is, for all that, too simple a view. In particular, it disregards the
significance to his development of the first period, when he was entirely
taken up with etching. Again the received wisdom has it that here was a
young artist limited both to and by his craft, who had at last to break free
of it to realise his true creative potential as an artist. It is all too
pat, too easy, and it is the great virtue of this small but quite
disproportionately important show of these early etchings, at The Fine Art
Society, to give the lie to it.
Sutherland was a student at London's Goldsmiths' College in the early 1920s,
where etching became his particular study. This was the time of the
so-called etching boom, when the market in prints was remarkably strong, and
naturally attractive to any ambitious young artist. Again the general
supposition has been that he was merely a follower, yet another fashionable
neo-Palmerian, filtering the romantic intensity of the young Samuel Palmer
of a century before through the work of such Edwardian topographical
illustrators as Frederick Griggs. In fact Sutherland was much more his own
man, looking not only to the example of Palmer but also more variously to
other masters, notably Rembrandt and Whistler, and refining a remarkable
technique in the process.
The etching market collapsed with the crash of 1929, but Sutherland did not
abandon the print for other means of income and expression. Rather, it freed
him to look about him, into himself, and to experiment and develop. It was
to be a slow process, marked by periods of teaching, and by the falling-off
of his practise in etching in favour first of lithography and then of
watercolour. But already, in the Pastoral and Garden prints of the early
1930s we can see the marked shift in his interest towards a more immediately
contemporary manner, and to the particular example, at once surreal,
romantic and organic, of Paul Nash. It is by this thread that we are led on
first to the more familiar Welsh landscape water-colours of the late 1930s,
and so to the oil paintings of his maturity in the 1940s. Sutherland may
have been a slow developer, but the young artist was a considerable artist,
even so. The work, early and late, is all of a piece.
The only disappointment is that this fascinating show should have so short a
run, but it does at least overlap with that of the later prints at
Marlborough Graphics, to establish the connection between the younger and
the older man. By it we may follow the evolution of the imagery, through the
such things as the Thorn Cross of the mid 1950s to the bestiaries of the
1960s and '70s, with their bees and fleas, tortoises and birds. But the
technical aspects are the more interesting  - for, with the larger scale and
the evident practical intervention of technical assistants, the intimacy and
intensity of the early work quite falls away. That old integrity of image,
object and practice has gone, and we are left with the image more or less
alone.
Also at the Fine Art Society is a true curiosity, a retrospective exhibition
of the work of John Downton, three years Sutherland's junior, who died in
1991. It is a first showing of the work for Downton was reclusive and, a few
works in the Royal Academy in the late 1930s apart, he kept his work to
himself. He was a painter of the head and the half-length, much influenced
by Florentine painting and working in tempera, the most desiccated and
painstaking of media. Yet he is redolent of his particular period between
the Wars, as it might be a minor Frampton, Brockhurst or Cowie, the image
isolated, psychologically ambiguous and remote. He is not a major discovery
but a discovery nonetheless, well worth the making. Who knows how many more
such there are, 'born to blush unseen'.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Arts: Le nozze di Figaro - Opera in Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the advent of period instruments Mozart's comic operas have become
ever more sprightly on stage. The authentic brigade has literally set the
pace with faster speeds, a quicker sense of humour, a twinkle in the eye,
which has made even conductors who work with conventional orchestras hurry
along to keep in the running.
At least, that is usually the case. Nikolaus Harnoncourt was himself once in
the vanguard of the authentic movement, but more recently he has taken his
standard and headed off in a direction all of his own. For the new
production of Le nozze di Figaro at the Muziektheater in Amsterdam he has
neither period instruments, nor the theatre's usual orchestra, but the Royal
Concertgebouw Orchestra in the pit - a real luxury, as the lovely wind
playing in the introduction to the second act showed.
Unfortunately, he squanders the glory of this situation fairly completely.
Harnoncourt seems to have set out in this production with the express
intention of wanting to prove a point. There is a theory that speeds in
Mozart have become exaggerated over the years, the fast getting faster, the
slow getting slower, and Harnoncourt is determined to do the opposite, no
matter how perverse the results may be. At the very apex of its tension and
excitement, where the second act finale should set the pulse racing, the
music slumped into an enervated, low-blood-pressure jog-trot.
It may seem impossible, but for the first two acts Harnoncourt and his
producer, Jurgen Flimm, actually managed to make this ever-fresh masterpiece
of comic opera boring. If the musical numbers were lifeless, the recitatives
were positively deathly - long gaps between every sentence, meaningful
looks, pregnant silences. The second act opened with a scene in which the
characters sat around on the Countess's giant white bed with long faces,
sighing deeply, stretching their limbs, the very picture of a bored
household lazing around with nothing to do all day. Whatever happened to
Beaumarchais's 'folle journee'?
If the remainder of the evening was better, it was no thanks to the
production. Although he may have been inhibited by the pacing of the drama
which was emanating from the pit, Flimm himself showed little inclination to
get any comic sparkle into the action. The Act 3 sextet when Figaro learns
the identity of his mother and father (Mozart's own favourite comic moment)
was drawn out at tedious length. One would not want to be around when this
producer was telling a joke.
The saving grace of the latter half of the evening was the greater
prominence of arias in the opera's structure. Here the singers were able to
dictate their own terms with some success. Olaf Bar's Count, in good voice,
burst into violent anger in his Act 3 aria. Charlotte Margiono's previously
unaffecting Countess found new depths in hers. Alastair Miles, asked to
portray Figaro as a dolt and unflatteringly costumed, suddenly came to life
late in the day with his trenchant final act solo scene.
With Iris Vermillion adding a nicely touching Cherubino, this was
potentially a fine cast. Best of all was the delightful Susanna of Isabel
Rey, who worked hard from curtain up to curtain down (a long evening) to
inject some spontaneity into the performance. When she was singing 'Deh
vieni', stretching out limpid soprano lines over the orchestra's tenderly
phrased accompaniment, the magic of Mozart's opera momentarily worked
afresh. At the end I checked the programme. Yes, it did say that we had just
seen a 'commedia per musica'. Somebody should tell the conductor and the
production team.
Further performances until May 29

FT  11 MAY 93 / Arts: The Barber of Seville - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Why is it that The Barber of Seville, with its strong plot, brilliant music
and several hit numbers, seldom delights in the theatre? The problem lies in
the plot, which almost completely lacks pathos, and which therefore requires
a robust comic sense that is surprisingly rare. The characters may be
commedia dell'arte archetypes, but they must be vivid, individual,
excitable, spontaneous, Mediterranean. And Seville itself - or a slice of it
 -must become real.
In English National Opera's staging, however, all the cartoon detail in
Tanya McCallin's sets announces 'Not for real' to us. Jonathan Miller's 1987
staging tells the story as if it were a creaky period curio. And the way
that, in John Abulafia's current revival, extraneous comic business has been
inserted to jolly things along can be held up as an object-lesson on how not
to stage comedy. Who could believe that the street in the first scene is a
real street? And why, since this long scene shows us little but Count
Almaviva and Figaro, does the production do nothing to flesh them out as
winning, three-dimensional characters and endear them to us?
Well, there is always the music to keep us going, and the current revival is
of a decent if undistinguished order. A virus kept Della Jones - whose
singing of Rossini's mezzo-soprano roles has been one of ENO's house
tressures for 15 years - from returning to the role of Rosina on Saturday.
The Australian mezzo Fiona Janes, who replaced her, was making her London
debut. She has a warm voice, and is a competent stage performer. But, like
Michael Lewis's Figaro, her Rosina is just a bright-eyed stereotype; and, by
strictest standards, both her and Lewis's coloratura is approximate.
The Barber can be wonderful comedy even when imperfectly voiced. But it
needs brio. Mark Shanahan, conducting, came nearer to supplying this from
the pit than anyone onstage, though there is more elegance and more fizz to
this score than he disclosed. Peter Bronder is not really a Count Almaviva -
with his Billy Bunter face, he is most at ease in the surefire disguise
scenes - but his energetic involvement in the situation is welcome. And
there is an unusual blend of virility and refinement to his singing that did
more to realise the potential of Rossini's score than anyone else onstage.
Arwel Huw Morgan's voice is well placed to give the right 'speaking'
emphasis to Bartolo's music - the nearer to speech Rossini's recitatives
become, the better - but something seems to hold him back from taking charge
of the character or the household. Richard Angas sang Don Basilio in big but
wretchedly throaty tones: a voice with less meat than gristle. Many in the
audience took more pleasure in the jokes and the singing than I could; no
wonder, since Rossini's score is so irresistible. This is, however, in no
way a Barber lit up from within.
In repertory at English National Opera until May 27

Last week in the major New York auctions the late Andy Warhol's art was
quite out of favour - which gives added poignancy to the Late Show Special
The War Over Warhol. This delves into the controversy over the Warhol
Foundation, which was intended to immortalise the artist and his works, and
to do good, too. As usual there are disputes over Warhol's will, the
Trustees, over everything, and so far the only beneficiaries are the
lawyers. (BBC 2 at 11.15).
Forty Minutes (BBC 2 at 9.50) has a knack of spotting off-beat stories. In
'Three Big Men' it follows the fortunes of the three strong British sumo
wrestling team in Japan. At the national trials in London there were just
three entrants so the team really picked itself. Their experiences among the
big men in Tokyo makes rivetting viewing.
The controversial Camille Paglia, the scourge of the feminists, is let loose
on the Lolita syndrome in Without Walls (9 pm on Channel 4). Also in the
usual double bill is Paul Eddy, a Provencal resident, who gives a very
different view of his adopted village to that propagated by neighbour Peter
Mayle.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Arts: Bournemouth Symphony - Brighton Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The musical part of Brighton's as ever well-stocked annual feast opened on
Friday evening with the first of two concerts by the Bournemouth Symphony
Orchestra, on the verge of their centenary season. The occasion brought the
professional debut in this country of the 12-year old violinist David
Garrett, playing Mendelssohn's concerto with such poise and spontaneity that
(apart from the light tone, inevitable from such a small frame and in any
case of fine quality), one could judge it as an adult performance.
What is more, and this meant as a compliment, one could safely concentrate
on the music. The concerto is no longer over-played, and when one hears it
done as here musically as well as with technical assurance brilliance, it is
a delight.
The main work was Mahler's Fifth Symphony. Now the BSO under their principal
conductor Andrew Litton, discreet and attentive accompanists in the
Mendelssohn, could let fly. This was a reading remarkable for combining
'speaking' intimacy with controlled aggressiveness. We were not spared the
snarls, the grotesqueries, the Bacon-like shrieks that may be hysterical
collapses or merely grimaces. Thanks to the admirably secure horn section,
the moments in the Landler movement when mountain vistas open up were fully
eloquent. The playing was so vital and immediate that for once I felt that
the dreary Dome was not such a bad concert hall after all.
The second BSO concert on Sunday brought a Festival commission in the form
of a Symphonic Mass by George Lloyd, duly receiving its world premiere with
the Brighton Festival Chorus. The composer, a sprightly elf with a mop of
silver hair, one month short of his 80th birthday, conducted himself.
'Symphonic' he says, because the Mass is not intended for the liturgy but
also, surely because the choral writing is straightforward, with much use of
unison, the orchestral material is usually developed (Lloyd is a prolific
writer of symphonies), sometimes beyond the necessary length. The purely
orchestral Offertorium on the other hand is surprisingly short.
Cries of anguish are heard, for example at the opening and again in the
closing Agnus Dei. Cheerful banality, however, breaks insistently through
with something resembling memories of wartime dance-band rhythms - short
phrases and metrical patterns much repeated. The scoring is bright, noisy
and professional, not unlike Eric Coates. There is a Russian-style chant
which would be more effective if used more sparingly.
Lloyd as conductor evidently enjoying himself hugely, appeared to make
little effort to keep the orchestra down. Huddled on an inner stage hung
with tone-devouring drapes, the choral sound was muffled and moreover riven
by obstreperous percussion. The large audience loved it none the less.
In the first half Lloyd lavished his enthusiasm on Elgar's orchestration of
Bach's organ Fantasia and Fugue in C minor. It was a pleasure to hear such a
vigorous reminder of the explosive effect this transcription had in the
twenties at a time when in England the discovery of Bach by the wider public
was still in progress and was being taken, by the organ world especially,
with oppressive solemnity.
In spite of masterly playing by John Lill, Rachmaninov's Paganini Rhapsody
suffered from the open lid of the enormous concert grand deadening the
woodwind. Since the interweaving of piano and orchestra was one of
Rachmaninov's wizard skills, this was a pity.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Business and the law: Trainees press case for loans - Legal
briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trainee Solicitors Group has approached UK clearing banks and building
societies in its search for an institution prepared to operate a centralised
loan scheme for prospective trainees.
Graduates hoping to qualify as solicitors in England and Wales must take the
new legal practice course. Fees for the nine-month course total Pounds
5,000, almost double the cost of the old Law Society finals course. Students
also need about Pounds 3,500 for living expenses.
Grants for the course are discretionary and presently only 38 per cent of
local authorities provide some form of assistance. The burden of funding has
thus shifted to the prospective trainee. This has raised fears that, unless
a loan scheme can be secured, the profession will only be open to those with
private means. Trainees will demand mandatory grants for the course and the
introduction of soft loans at a mass lobby of parliament next Monday.

FOLLOWING a decision by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, the Registry of
County Court Judgments has begun to register administration orders.
Administration orders, like judgments, will remain on the register for six
years.
Mr Malcolm Hurlston, chairman of Registry Trust which runs the register for
the Lord Chancellor's department, said the most frequent users of the
register were creditors seeking information on loans applicants who were
already in debt. The addition of administration orders to the register would
improve the quality of information available to lenders, Mr Hurlston said.
The trust expects to register about 11,000 orders a year compared with 2m
judgments. No orders dated before April 1993 will be registered.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Business and the law: Star of the silver screen - A legal
tool that may give a boost to Europe's film industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the film industry gathers in Cannes next week to see movies and be seen,
European film makers will reflect on yet another year spent in the shadow of
Hollywood.
In spite of the critical success of such films as Howards End and The Crying
Game the commercial success achieved by US studios continues to elude the
European industry. Mass-market films with international appeal, which the
Americans are so successful at making, remain a scarce commodity in Europe.
Many of the plans hatched in Cannes last year for European productions with
international appeal will have foundered on the difficulties of getting
bilateral or multinational co-productions off the ground. This year,
however, as they sit down with renewed enthusiasm to make plans which they
hope will revitalise the European film industry, producers will have with
them a new business tool - the so-called Model Co-production Terms. These
were drawn up by Denton International, a group of law firms from the UK,
Germany, Holland and Denmark, but were the idea of Eur-images, the
pan-European support fund of the Council of Europe for the co-production and
distribution of European feature films and documentaries.
The model terms aim to offer contractual solutions to the key issues - such
as ownership of rights, editorial controls, distribution patterns and risks
of insolvency - which co-producers face under Europe's various legal
systems, and to make it easier for European co-producers to apply for
Eurimages funding or for benefits under the European Co-Production
Convention.
Launched three weeks ago, the model terms have already received an
enthusiastic welcome from some European producers.
'Co-productions are definitely the way forward,' says Mr Nick Hobdell of
Screen Finance magazine. 'The ability to access European subsidies is
tremendously important. Big budget films are too expensive for individual
production companies to fund on their own.'
The success of the model terms will depend to a great extent on how far
European industry as a whole is in agreement with that view. A 1991 study of
the competitive positions of the European and US film industries produced by
consultants London Economics for the Madrid-based Media Business School
found the strategic options for the European film industry were not obvious.
Should it strive to find the means to challenge for a bigger share of the
mass-market box office by aiming to make and sell films across the
Continent, with continued expansion of European co-production? Or should it
accept that European film makers would on the whole do better to leave the
production of big budget feature films to the Americans and concentrate on
national success with each country's industry aiming to sell films in its
local market?
Current policy is directed towards encouraging European film makers to
challenge for a bigger share of the mass market by making and selling films
across the Continent. The policy is easy to justify in terms of commercial
goals. The American film markets, including video rentals and sales, were
worth nearly Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11bn) in 1992, and the European markets
more than Dollars 8bn. These markets are dominated by US producers. A larger
share of the overall market for European producers and distributors would
greatly enhance European film-making resources.
Promoting the European industry would also result in benefits for consumers,
giving them greater choice in the face of a US monopoly. Per capita
admissions to the cinema in Europe are half those in the US. Europeans only
go to the cinema on average 1.8 times a year while Americans go on average
4.6 times. Arguably this is a reflection of the way American themes and
popular culture dominate mass-market feature films. If Europe provided the
context, theme and backdrop of more of the world's films, perhaps Europeans
would go to the cinema in greater numbers.
The problem of how to put European policy into practice remains, however. Mr
Adrian Barr-Smith, a partner with solicitors Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens,
the UK arm of Denton International, believes it has been the lack of
guidelines for avoiding the traps and tricks of co-production which has been
holding European producers back.
One of the pre-conditions for applying for Eurimages funding (it has offered
co-production support in the form of refundable loans since 1988) is a
signed agreement between the co-producers. Similarly, an agreement is
required for producers to get access to the benefits available to national
films through the Co-Production Convention which should come into force
later this year once it has been ratified by five European countries.
This represents something of a Catch 22 situation. Co-producers cannot apply
for European funding until they have a co-production agreement and few of
them have enough experience of co-productions to know how to go about
drawing one up. The model terms should address that problem, says Mr
Barr-Smith, by providing a common starting point for reaching bi-lateral and
multilateral co-production agreements.
'The terms stop short of being a model agreement,' says Ms Angela Jackson,
one of the Denton lawyers responsible for drafting the model. 'It's more of
a menu or list from which they can choose the elements they want, a legal
'how-to'.'
Contracts are frequently signed late in the film business, she explains.
Producers like to hedge their bets, but they start hiring and setting up
shooting arrangements often without an agreement. The industry is founded on
trust, but then problems arise which producers find difficult to raise while
projects are in their formative stages. The terms will allow such issues to
be settled early on, rather than waiting for things to break down.
Denton stresses the importance of co-producers concluding agreements in
writing. A common problem in European co-productions is that meetings and
phone calls take place in different countries; letters and faxes are sent,
and letters of intent and deal memos signed. But later, when problems arise,
it is difficult to say with any certainty whether a binding written or
unwritten contract was made under the laws of any particular country.
Mr Barr-Smith is keen to emphasise that even if no contract is signed there
is still a risk under the various legal systems of Europe that a binding
oral agreement has been concluded. And even if no contract, written or oral,
has been concluded there may be a risk under some legal systems - under
German and Dutch law, for example - that legal consequences flow from the
mere breakdown of negotiations.
Ms Jackson and Mr Barr-Smith believe the model is a business first. If it
works, it could provide the basis for multinational co-operation agreements
in other sectors of industry, they say. In pharmaceuticals, for example, it
might be possible to draw up a similar model for multinational development
of drugs. But whatever the model's application in other industries, European
cineastes will be hoping the film industry gives it a favourable review.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Business and the law: Equal pensions ruling clarified -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of April the European Court delivered its preliminary opinion in
four cases brought before it seeking clarification of equal pension rights
following the court's Barber judgment of May 17 1990.
Advocate General Walter Van Gerven, delivering the opinion, said the equal
treatment principle may not be relied upon to claim entitlement to an
occupational pension acquired in connection with periods of employment
served prior to May 17 1990, except in the case of employees or those
claiming under them who have before then initiated legal proceedings or
claimed under applicable national law.
According to Mr Van Gerven, contracted-out and supplementary occupational
pension schemes are characterised by their 'accruing' nature - an employee
accrues pension entitlement on the basis of his or her periods of
employment. There is a distinction, therefore, between the creation of
pension rights on the basis of completed periods of service - at least for
fixed-benefit schemes as in the Coloroll case - or completed payments of
contributions, for fixed-contribution schemes, and the exercise of such
accrued pension rights when the pension first falls due for payment.
This interpretation largely coincides with that adopted in the 'Protocol on
Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community' annexed to
the Maastricht Treaty.
Mr Van Gerven also answered a number of further questions:
Which forms of occupational pension are subject to Barber?
Barber applies not only to contracted-out occupational schemes but also to
all other forms, including supplementary pensions.
Are sex-based actuarial calculation factors compatible with equal treatment?
Use of such factors constitutes, at least in so far as it results in
different contributions and benefits for men and women, unequal treatment on
the ground of sex prohibited by the Rome Treaty. Like Barber, the temporal
effects must be limited to after the judgment date.
Who may rely on equality principles applied to pensions?
Employees and surviving spouses, including those entitled to certain kinds
of widower's pension, may do so, subject to appropriate temporal limits.
It is immaterial whether an occupational pension scheme is funded
exclusively by employer's contributions or also by compulsory or voluntary
employee contributions. However, where only employees of one sex are members
of an occupational pension scheme, they will have no such right, provided
the employees within the company or division concerned are all of that sex.
May equality principles be relied upon against trustees?
Employees or those entitled under them may do so.
Trustees of occupational pension schemes are obliged by Community law to do
everything within their powers, even if that involves overriding
legislation, contracts or trust deeds, to ensure equal pension benefits.
National courts responsible for supervising trusts must comply with
Community law principles requiring effective and equivalent remedies.
However, questions relating to the liability of a pension scheme and that of
the employer in the context of equal treatment infringements, particularly
where the funds of one party (such as in Coloroll) are insufficient, can be
dealt with only at national level. National rules on liability must be no
less favourable than those which would apply to similar national claims and
be effective.
May future pension schemes reduce available benefits in the interests of
equality?
For past infringements, the only remedy is to increase the benefits to the
level of the advantaged sex. For future service, Community law allows
employers to reduce pension benefits provided they are the same for men and
women.
Cases C-109, 110, 152 and 200/91, Ten Oever, Moroni, Neath, Coloroll Pension
Trustees Ltd, Advocate General Van Gerven, Opinion, 28 April 1993.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Technology: The challenge of creativity - Philips is seeking
to go one step beyond simply coming up with new products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE can be no doubt that Philips, the Dutch electronics group, is a winner
when it comes to inventing successful new products. The music cassette, the
video-cassette recorder and the compact disc - to name just three of the
company's best-known inventions - were all born in Philips' laboratories in
Eindhoven, forming the basis of what was, until recently, a profitable
business in consumer electronics.
Now, as the company struggles to shake off losses in precisely this field,
Philips is seeking to go one step beyond simply coming up with bright new
products. The 102-year-old company is searching for ways to identify,
evaluate, develop and launch entirely new businesses, ones which will unlock
a stream of new revenue and keep Philips ahead of the pack, allowing it to
benefit from the profitable early years of a new product's life cycle.
The challenge, in short, is to foster a 'business creation' mentality in the
labs - and elsewhere in the company - as both a prelude and a component of
the decisive 'product creation' stage.
At the same time, Philips needs to overcome mistakes of the past, when its
research and marketing people were practically strangers to each other, a
situation that sometimes prevented the smooth translation of laboratory
successes into corporate profits.
The man throwing down the challenge is Frank Carrubba, a 55-year-old
American with a long background at Hewlett-Packard and IBM, whose
appointment in late 1991 was a mini-revolution for Philips, which had prided
itself on advancing its home-grown technological talent.
Carrubba, an executive vice-president who is responsible for industrial
policy, intellectual property and purchasing, as well as for technology,
says 'business creation' at Philips will begin in earnest on June 1, when
the group management committee forms a new sub-committee, the Technology and
New Business Assessment Committee. It is here that potential new businesses
will be reviewed at the most senior level in the company. Action may be
taken on some of them by the autumn, he says.
'The businesses that have been identified (at the pre-screening stage) have
come to a large extent from the younger employees in the engineering and
research community,' he says, declining to give any details. 'They've had a
whole series of ideas stored up inside them waiting for the company to
settle down long enough to listen to them.'
Researchers whose ideas move beyond the pre-screening stage will be allowed
to make their pitch to the group's senior executives. 'They have to be this
excited entrepreneur trying to sell to a venture capitalist,' Carrubba says.
The 'Silicon Valley' analogy is no accident. The appointment of a foreigner,
such as Carrubba, to the top research and development post at Philips is
part of the company's attempt since late 1990 to shake up its lethargic
corporate culture.
When he arrived from California in 1991, Carrubba found an R&amp;D apparatus
that had grown complacent after decades of riding the wave of the post-war
economic boom. 'Most companies, and ours was not different, saw challenge
and change as frightening things, something you worried about when you saw
it happening,' he says.
Because of its past successes, Philips had allowed some of its products and
businesses to reach maturity before starting to cast around for
replacements. One of Carrubba's main goals in business and product creation
is to seize upon new ideas more quickly and shorten the time from lab to
marketplace. Another is to break down divisional barriers and promote
'technological transfer' within the company.
So far, Carrubba believes Philips has made good progress, but more needs to
be done. Better communication between divisions, for example, remains
essential.
His new focus on business creation is the last phase of a wider effort to
enhance product creation. This latest challenge comes, however, at a time
when the company's research and development people are still recovering from
the turmoil that has enveloped Philips so far in the 1990s.
Since 1989, the year before Philips slid into deep losses, the number of
people who work in R&amp;D has been slashed by more than 30 per cent to 28,017
from 40,752. R&amp;D spending is also down sharply, from Fl 4.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn)
in 1989 to Fl 3.7bn in 1992, a decline of 20 per cent.
Less easily quantifiable is the effect on researchers of Philips' decision
that it can no longer afford to be in the forefront of developing every type
of technology. Nor can it continue to develop and build in-house every
significant component that it needs for its products.
Both changes were symbolised dramatically by the decision in 1990 by the
company's new president, Jan Timmer, to pull out of pilot production of
one-megabit static random access memory chips, a field that had meant much
prestige, but no profits for Philips.
Rather than trying to do everything itself, Philips was signalling it was
prepared to make difficult decisions about when to buy in expertise and when
to go it alone.
Though more open to considering outside suppliers than before, Philips has
committed itself to maintaining its R&amp;D command of core components,
technologies and competences, Carrubba says.
These are, in turn, closely linked to a list of 15 key 'president's
projects'. The complete list has never been made public, but it is known to
include Philips' three new efforts in consumer electronics (high-definition
television, compact disc-interactive and digital compact cassette) as well
as high-resolution monitors, cellular radio and active matrix liquid crystal
displays.
In spite of more limited resources, Philips has clearly been pouring money
into LCDs, an increasingly important product module in portable television
sets and lap-top computers, so that the company will not have to rely on
supplies from its competitors in the Far East.
Carrubba says the difference between these components and sub-micron memory
chips is that the latter have become 'off-the-shelf items that are available
at market prices on the open market and in volume'.
Philips also intends to remain the master of its own destiny in all facets
of signal processing, such as the manipulation, compression and enhancement
of images and sound.
'If we're going to be in businesses like audio, video, compact
disc-interactive or interactive media, without having that technology we
would be hung out to dry. Because anyone out there that owns those
technologies would be direct competitors, most likely, and they would be
able to manipulate our future. So we can't let that happen,' he says.
One example of a core competence is miniaturisation, an element which
Philips believes will be of growing importance to a wide range of products
and projects in future. If miniaturisation is central to Philips' business
prospects, then so are related technologies, such as the visualisation
skills needed to perform sub-miniature board assembly.
Miniaturisation is also a good case in point of how Carrubba is setting
about trying to break down divisional barriers and shorten the lead time for
the manufacture of new products.
The focal centre of miniaturisation work is now a prototype assembly line
which, until recently, was standing idle within the consumer electronics
division in Eindhoven. Researchers from corporate research, as well as
technical and manufacturing people from Philips' product divisions, now come
to the miniaturisation centre for training, where the prototype facilities
allow real hands-on work to take place.
For some divisions, miniaturisation may not yet be on the horizon, but in
the meantime the goal is to 'infiltrate' people with miniaturisation
technology experience into research and manufacturing throughout the
company.
'When manufacturing gearing-up begins, there will be 'champions' of that
technology in that business,' Carrubba explains.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Technology: Plotting a model economy - New software which
can be applied worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An Australian computer programmer turned economist has devised a set of
software which he claims can be used to simulate virtually any of the
world's leading economies.
Warwick McKibbin, who studies economics at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington-based think-tank, has sold his software to government institutes
in several countries including the US, Australia, Canada and South Korea.
His computer codes have been used by Japan's Economic Planning Agency to
work out the possible path of Japanese growth and by the US Congressional
Budget Office, the economics arm of Congress, to calculate how export and
import volumes will be affected by the proposed North American Free Trade
Agreement.
At the heart of the program is a computer code representing about 600
mathematical relationships linking economic indicators in the main regions
of the world, including Japan, western Europe, North America, the Middle
East and the former Soviet Union. McKibbin - who left school at 16 to work
as a programmer and later gained an economics doctorate at Harvard
University - can then add to this code up to 1,000 or so other equations
representing the economic features of the particular country he wants to
model.
In this way he can 'customise' his model, which runs on a cheap desk-top
computer, to suit the specific characteristics of individual nations.
The equations in McKibbin's model cover factors such as wage costs,
unemployment, prices of physical assets such as houses and the amount of
money being channelled through capital markets.
By linking these factors according to the ways they influence each other in
reality, the computer code provides a rough replication of how a specific
development - an increase in interest rates affects other factors such as
longer jobless queues.
McKibbin, aged 36, who worked for 16 years at the Australian central bank
and had a spell on secondment to the Japanese government, claims his model
is easier to use than other similar sets of computer code linking up
economic variables.
He says also it has done a 'good job' in simulating economic conditions in
specific countries, and for instance was successful two years ago in
predicting the budget deficits and build-up of inflation in Germany arising
from unification.
Computerised models are a well-known tool used by many economists to
simulate conditions in specific countries and so help in forecasting and
analysis of trends such as inflation or budget deficits.
However, they are normally specially designed to describe conditions in a
particular country and can only occasionally be adapted in the manner of
McKibbin's model.
With his wife, McKibbin has formed a company, McKibbin Software Group, to
sell his programs.
A basic model customised to simulate the economy of a particular country
costs about Dollars 15,000 (Pounds 10,000), with McKibbin charging extra for
special services including updates of the software.
He is looking to build on the company's current annual sales of about
Dollars 150,000, and one possible client in the future could be the UK
Treasury with which the Australian economist has had tentative discussions.
The Treasury already has its own purpose-built model of the UK economy which
is supervised by an in-house team of 30 economists.
However, the UK government department - which has been severely criticised
in recent years for misjudging the path of the domestic economy - is
increasingly trying to link up with outside economists to see if it can
improve its techniques of economic analysis.
Use of 'rival' models which work in a different way from the Treasury's
model might be one way to build up an alternative picture of what is
happening in the economy.

FT  11 MAY 93 / People: Smith New Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Terence Heiser, previously permanent secretary at the Department of the
Environment, has picked up another non-executive position, this time at
stockbrokers Smith New Court. John Gunn, former chief executive of British &amp;
Commonwealth Holdings, stepped down in January after six years on the board.
Hardly in the mould of the traditional Whitehall mandarin, Sir Terence, who
was raised on a council estate and left school at 16, has been much in
demand since retiring last June. He is also on the board of Abbey National,
J Sainsbury and Wessex Water.
SNC's chief executive Michael Marks, who is presumably something of a
meritocrat himself, having joined Smith at 17 in 1959, says he and his
fellow directors were 'hugely impressed with (Heiser's) wider business
perspective'. They would also value his 'general guidance on personnel
issues' - rather than anything as strictly 'commercial' as helping the
corporate finance department win more privatisation mandates.
Meanwhile, Sir Terence, who has not so far found it necessary to join a
London club, will perhaps find the atmosphere at SNC, which has never quite
shaken off its barrow-boy image, rather more exciting than at some of its
stuffier rivals.
At the same time SNC announced four executive additions to the board: Marc
Edwards, 44, in charge of Smith New Court Carl Marks' equity activity in the
US; John Evernden, 46, director of UK sales trading; Philip Jolowicz, legal
director of Smith New Court Securities; and Richard Margolis, managing
director, corporate finance, of Smith New Court Far East in Hong Kong.

FT  11 MAY 93 / People: Down from Oxford, again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colin Leach, who made himself highly unpopular in the City with the Ariel
project, is poking his head above the parapet again after 14 years at
Oxford.
Between 1972-1978, Leach masterminded the automated share dealing system
designed as a way for institutional investors to circumvent high minimum
commissions. Highly controversial at the time, Leach recalls 'not being on
speakers' with Sir Nicholas Goodison, the then chairman of the Stock
Exchange, and generally 'never so unpopular in my life'. So he retreated to
Oxford, where he had been an undergraduate, as fellow and bursar of Pembroke
College, and classics tutor at University College.
Now obviously deeming it safe to return, he becomes a consultant to Matheson
Securities, the agency private client stockbroking arm of Jardine Matheson's
UK financial services subsidiary. His brother Rodney is a director of Hong
Kong Land, a Jardine Matheson-controlled company.
And what of the timing of his return, just as the Stock Exchange is in deep
trouble with the failure of its paperless share settlement system, Taurus,
and with its whole structure indeed open to debate? Leach, who was also
working on a paperless system 20 years ago says: 'I haven't written a word
to the papers about Taurus. I leave it to those younger, fitter and more
foolish.'

FT  11 MAY 93 / People: Sir Peter Imbert tails Kroll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Peter Imbert, who retired as commissioner of the Metropolitan Police
earlier this year, has picked up his second new assignment, as a consultant
to Integrated Security Systems. He is also a non-executive director of
Securicor.
ISS, founded by ex-SAS officer John Wick nine years ago, advises governments
and companies on a variety of security issues from crisis management to the
design of large integrated security systems.
It has just three executive directors with eight retained associates and a
handful of consultants. Eighteen months ago the management bought itself out
from Lloyd's managing agents PW Kininmonth.
Wick says Imbert will be spending one or two days a week at ISS in the first
six months. One of his first tasks will be to advise on how to expand the
corporate investigation side.
'It irritates me immensely sitting as an Englishman in the middle of the
City that most investment banks think of Kroll Associates (which is
American) and not us,' Wick fumes from his office in Lovat Lane.
Sir Peter feels strongly about the need for ISS's type of work. 'Companies
and other organisations are just not well enough prepared to handle the
kinds of crises they face today - anything from armed robbery through
kidnapping to terrorist activities . . . Put bluntly, companies will either
survive or be defeated according to their readiness to deal with such
events.'

 -In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A new support organisation for both business and personal customers of the
banks has been established. The Independent Banking Advisory Service (IBAS)
will provide members with free advice on simple problems and a referral
service on to professional advisers, who will charge their normal fees, on
more complicated issues.
IBAS is a breakaway organisation from the Bank Action Group (BAG) but plans
to concentrate on providing advice rather than lobbying. Founder and chief
executive of IBAS is Eddy Weatherill, co-founder of BAG.
Membership of IBAS costs Pounds 45 plus VAT for businesses and Pounds 25
including VAT for individuals. IBAS says its strength is that it will be
able to concentrate on banking issues.
At present though IBAS is still building up a network of professional
advisers and prospective members should compare the range and cost of its
services with those provided by existing small business organisations.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Lack of finance feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shortage of expansion finance threatens to prevent businesses from taking
full advantage of the European single market. This emerges from a survey* of
more than 4,700 companies in all 12 European Community countries carried out
by accountants Grant Thornton.
Many companies in Europe have badly eroded balance sheets; face problems in
persuading customers to pay up on time; and have difficulty in raising
long-term debt and equity at affordable rates, according to the survey to be
published today in Brussels.
'European companies will be shackled in achieving the benefits of the single
market because the banks have got into difficulties,' said Patrick Brooke,
partner in charge of the firm's single market unit. The survey, one of the
most extensive of its kind in recent years, covered businesses, most of them
privately owned, with turnover of between Ecu1m-Ecu100m (Pounds
833,000-Pounds 83.3m) and between 10 and 700 employees. These account for
more than 90 per cent of all businesses in the Community.
The cost of finance emerged as the most common short-term constraint on
growth, mentioned by 40 per cent of companies questioned, while a lack of
working capital was mentioned by 21 per cent.
Customers have become more reluctant to settle their bills promptly, putting
further pressure on company cash flows. Sixty one per cent said it had taken
longer to collect their money over the previous year. A quarter of companies
waited 90 days or longer to be paid, with slow payment most prevalent in
Portugal, Italy and Spain.
Chasing up slow-payers by letter was the most common response but no fewer
than 33 per cent had taken legal proceedings. UK companies were most likely
to have taken this route with half initiating legal action.
Despite problems in raising finance, businesses were moderately optimistic
about their prospects. On balance - that is those saying better, minus those
saying worse - nearly a quarter expect to increase their turnover in the
coming year and nearly 20 per cent plan to increase exports. But they also
expect profits to remain flat in the year ahead and job numbers will be cut.
Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark were the most optimistic
overall, while France, Germany and the UK were most pessimistic about
output, jobs and profitability. Germany was less optimistic about exports
than most other countries.
The most expansion-minded companies - those considering making acquisitions,
diversifying and entering new markets - were in France, Spain and Greece.
Two thirds of French companies had produced market development plans.
Significant increases in spending on training and research and development
are expected but there will be only a modest rise in investment in plant and
equipment. On balance 22 per cent of companies planned to increase spending
on training while 15 per cent planned more R&amp;D. The UK came the bottom of
the league table in both areas, however.
Despite government efforts to promote the single market recently, very few
companies were aware of EC programmes. Only one in five companies knew of
one or more of the main schemes and only 3 per cent of firms had used one of
the programmes though Greece, with a 20 per cent uptake of programmes, was
an enthusiastic exception to the EC norm.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): One man's beef - A look
at difficulties experienced by a slaughterhouse / Cutting red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLIN Kinmond says his small slaughterhouse business could take on two extra
staff if he were not obliged by new European Community-inspired legislation
to employ a vet. Alongside a full-time meat inspector who keeps an eye on
the quality of the cut meat, since January 1 Kinmond has also been required
to pay for a vet to come in twice daily to look at the live animals before
slaughter. The meat inspector, employed under long-established legislation,
costs Pounds 30,000 a year while the vet costs another Pounds 1,500 a month,
Kinmond calculates.
'The vet has stopped us having an apprentice and a slaughterman and takes a
lot of money out of our profits,' comments Kinmond, a director of Bishop's
Castle Meat, a Shropshire company with 14 employees and turnover of Pounds
4.5m.
The requirement to employ a vet as well as a meat inspector came in as part
of the EC's Fresh Meat Directive. This was translated into UK legislation in
the form of the Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1992.
This legislation extended to smaller slaughterhouses - serving local or
national markets - the rules which had applied for many years to larger
slaughterhouses involved in exporting meat products.
Many small firms and the recently established Quality Meat and Livestock
Alliance blame these new regulations on the closure of about 200
slaughterhouses over the past two years. The Ministry of Agriculture
counters that only seven slaughterhouses have been closed for hygiene
reasons and says the rest, spurred by over-capacity in the industry, have
shut down for commercial reasons.
Bishop's Castle Meat has been able to bear the cost of the new regulations
but Kinmond is critical of the new legislative regime. 'The red tape is
ridiculous,' he says. 'We are not exporting. The meat inspector has been
doing his job for the 14 years we have been in business and our meat has
never killed anyone.'
Kinmond's complaint is that the vets who now inspect the animals make no
contribution to increased hygiene. All the animals come in from auctions
where they have been inspected, while the vets have only a brief training
which does not equip them to spot problems.
But the requirement for veterinary inspection is only part of the new
regulations. Slaughterhouses are also faced with a range of structural
alterations to bring their drainage systems, work surfaces and loading bays
up to scratch.
Very small slaughterhouses processing fewer than 20 units a week (a unit is
one cow, three pigs or seven sheep) escape the new structural regulations
but a swathe of medium-sized companies which were previously exempt have had
to come to terms with the tough new requirements.
Bishop's Castle Meat has spent about Pounds 200,000 on alterations (though
some went on a new boning room the company wanted) including stainless steel
surfaces and equipment and larger pens to hold the animals awaiting
slaughter. This last requirement leads to large numbers of animals being
brought together in the same space and increases the stress they suffer,
critics of the regulations claim.
The strictness of the new legislation is a classic case of UK civil servants
'improving' the initial EC legislation, comments Richard North, secretary of
the Quality Meat and Livestock Alliance. National legislation tightened up
on the EC directive; Ministry of Agriculture guidelines tightened up on the
legislation; and individual vets interpret the guidelines very strictly, he
says.
The directive calls for the slaughterhouse to have a clearly defined
boundary which has been translated into a requirement to have a wall or a
fence. One slaughterhouse owner had to build a wall costing Pounds 8,000
which cut off direct access from his house, says North.
As part of its opposition to the new rules the alliance is urging its
members not to pay vets' fees. Kinmond has just received a summons for
failing to pay. Ultimately, says North, the alliance is prepared to take its
fight to the European Court of Justice.
The Ministry of Agriculture said British representatives in Brussels had
argued successfully against some member states which had wanted a more
far-reaching directive. The legislation had to strike a balance between
public confidence in meat hygiene and not making the rules too onerous, a
spokesman said.
The Growing Business Page will highlight over the next few months businesses
entrapped by red tape. It will award a bottle of Laurent-Perrier pink
champagne to each one featured.
The owner-managers of independent businesses are invited to describe their
experiences - on no more than two sides of A4 please.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Stronger US-UK links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY BENNALLACK-HART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate links between London and New York are not limited to the
multinationals.
Next month sees the launch of a partnership between Wandsworth Enterprise
Agency and the National Minority Business Council, based in New York.
The aim of the venture is to provide small UK businesses run by members of
the ethnic minorities with help and advice in establishing international
trading links.
Similarly, the 500-or-so members of the NMBC, most of whom are based in New
York, New Jersey or Connecticut, will gain access to British expertise.
Small businesses often lack the resources to establish overseas links but
the joint venture between Wandsworth and NMBC will provide help with
training and organising trade missions, said Alex Amponsah, chief executive
of the enterprise agency. It may also open trading links with home countries
of recent immigrants.
The NMBC, a non-profit organisation, was established more than 20 years ago
and is funded mainly from membership fees, currently Dollars 275 (Pounds
179) a year, although it does receive public- and private-sector donations
and grants.
Its members - who include Afro-Caribbeans, Latin Americans, Asians and
Eskimos - are provided with a broad range of business advice.
John Robinson, president of the NMBC, hopes that the London link will lead
eventually to an umbrella organisation for all UK small businesses run by
ethnic minorities, on an equal footing with chambers of commerce. He already
has plans for further expansion, seeking ties with similar organisations in
Asia and the Pacific Rim.
The NMBC has strong ties with the Caribbean and has an affiliation in
Nigeria.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Opposition seizes on Tory disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID RENDEL, the Liberal Democrat victor in the Newbury by-election,
took his seat in the Commons yesterday - a day earlier than is the
convention - to vote against the government last night over the imposition
of value added tax on domestic fuel.
The decision is just one sign that the opposition parties are determined to
exploit the Tories' disarray and their own successes in last Thursday's
elections.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was quick to condemn ministerial
insistence that there would be no change in policy as a sign that the
government would be not listen to clamour for change.
'The British people don't want a prime minister that just listens, they want
a prime minister that hears,' he said yesterday, urging the government to
change course.
Labour believes there are tangible and straightforward changes that it can
press the government to make on testing in schools, on rail privatisation
and on the use of Group 4 Security in the prison escort service, apart from
the continuing attacks over the state of the economy.
The party plans to capitalise on its county election gains, hoping that in
the next election campaign the new experience of an administration with a
Labour input in some southern shires will give it a counter to Tory claims
of what Labour would do in power.
Some in the Labour party believe it should be possible to broaden its
support so that it is seen not just as an urban party but one with appeal to
the surrounding areas as well.
Although the Liberal Democrats will continue to attack Tory 'triumphalism'
at signs of recovery, their prime emphasis is on maintaining their own
momentum and retaining a high profile, rather than putting pressure on the
government.
The party held back some policy papers - to be published over the next
couple of weeks - so that they would attract maximum publicity after what
were confidently expected to be good results.
Speeches by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, tomorrow and at the party's
spring conference, will carry further his talk of 'new politics'.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers resist pressure over oil
tax plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE government is determined to face down backbench calls for a
revision of proposed changes to the North Sea tax regime - even if it means
suffering an embarrassing committee-stage defeat.
The 36-strong standing committee that will consider the Finance Bill appears
to contain a majority of MPs in favour of changing the government's Budget
proposals in line with a suggestion by Mr John Butterfill, the Tory MP for
Bournemouth East.
Mr Butterfill has tabled an amendment to the bill that would provide some
transitional relief for oil companies affected by the changes. The relief
would be paid for by levying for a limited time a higher rate of petroleum
revenue tax than the government proposes.
But ministers insisted yesterday, ahead of today's Commons debate, that PRT
would be cut from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, as set out in the Budget, and
that tax relief for exploratory drilling would be abolished.
The government indicated that its proposals would be enacted even if changes
passed in committee had to be reversed at the report stage. Some companies
have said that the government's changes would lead to a halving of
exploration activity and the loss of up to 40,000 jobs.
Ministers are understood to be sympathetic to the arguments advanced by the
offshore supply industry, which fears the consequences of diminished
exploration activity by their oil company customers.
But ministers believe many of these companies are large and sophisticated
enough to follow oil producers to other exploration sites if necessary.
Ministers also argue that the supply industry will benefit from the surge in
production they expect to follow enactment of the proposals.
Some support for this view came yesterday when British Petroleum said it
would bring forward a Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 2bn oil development project
because of the proposed PRT changes.
The company said yesterday its plans had been given 'significant impetus' by
the tax changes. The project, which involves BP and eight other companies,
will develop nine oil and gas fields containing 650m barrels of oil and
1,200bn cubic feet of gas.
The improvement in the economics of the project mean production will start
in 1998. BP said that under the old tax regime three of the fields would
have paid PRT, making them less profitable.
The government is also expected to argue today that changing its proposals
now would penalise companies whose forward-planning had accommodated what
was announced in the Budget. It is likely also to argue that the tax has
actually cost the Treasury some Pounds 900m in the past two years.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pro-European Conservatives seek
advantage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Euro-enthusiasts in the Tory ranks sought to seize the initiative in the
debate about Maastricht yesterday by publishing a pamphlet calling for a
positive approach to European union.
In a foreword to the paper - launched to mark Europe Day - Mr Douglas Hurd,
the foreign secretary, said that the Tories needed to show the British
people that membership of the European Community brings 'solid advantages
and opportunities'.
He warns that the Conservatives need to start work both for next year's
elections to the European parliament and for the next EC inter-governmental
conference in 1996.
'It is time to lift our eyes from the trenches,' he said.
The paper warns that the Tory party risks paying a heavy price in terms of a
poor performance in the Euro-elections, a loss of influence within the
community, and a fatally weakened campaign in the next general election if
it fails to unite around a positive message.
While ministers are likely to welcome the positive support for ratification,
other aspects of the paper, by Mr Ian Taylor, vice-chairman of the
Conservative Group for Europe, are likely to add to the government's
difficulties by highlighting splits within the party.
Underlining the government's commitment to rejoin the European exchange rate
mechanism, Mr Taylor urges ministers to put forward a plan to make the ERM
work, instead of merely talking about 'fault lines'.
'We are committed to the goal of economic and monetary union - so let us
come up with a way of getting there rather than implying that the Maastricht
timetable will not work,' he says.
Although this is one of the few weeks that the debate Maastricht is not
dominating events in the Commons, the divisions within the party are as
marked as ever in the run-up to the final Commons debate on the Maastricht
bill after the second Danish referendum, which takes place next week.
Tomorrow the Tory Euro-sceptics will once again put their side of the case
when the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward publishes a compilation of
Euro-sceptic arguments from the detailed committee stage debate on the
Maastricht bill, with a foreword written by Mr John Biffen, the former
cabinet minister.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: NHS waiting lists at record level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOSPITAL WAITING lists have grown by more than 8 per cent since the general
election to reach a record high of almost 1m, provisional figures released
yesterday by the Department of Health show.
The number waiting for treatment in the National Health Service rose to
992,324 in March, up more than 74,000 on a year before.
The worst performing region in the last quarter was North East Thames, which
recorded a rise of 10 per cent in people waiting less than a year.
This means the number of 11-month waiters has risen by 24 per cent in the
region over the past 12 months.
Government campaigns to reduce long waiting times have all but eliminated
delays of more than two years for operations, and cut the numbers waiting
between one and two years by almost a third. Just over 56,000 people have
been waiting for more than a year for treatment.
But the number of patients waiting up to a year for treatment has risen by
12 per cent since last April's general election.
The figures will fuel criticism that the government has reduced waiting
lists between one and two years at the expense of people waiting less than a
year with more serious conditions.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said the figures were 'a
disaster for patients' and he called for a review of government health
policy.
'These figures mean that 1,500 people have joined the waiting list every
week since the general election,' he said.
Mr Blunkett said that the figures underestimated the numbers and that Labour
party research showed some people had to wait more than a year before they
even appeared on official lists.
Mr Tom Sackville, the health minister, acknowledged that the waiting list
had grown but said that the figures showed that waiting times had continued
to fall.
'Half of all admissions to hospital are immediate,' he said. 'Of those
admitted from waiting lists, half are admitted within five weeks, nearly
three quarters within three months and 98 per cent within a year.'
Mr Sackville also said that the government would spend Pounds 39m this year
tackling long waiting times, bringing the total spent on this to Pounds 240m
over seven years.
Labour last night launched a Commons attack on government plans to merge
district health authorities in England, warning of a loss of public
accountability, but their call to annul the orders introducing the changes
was defeated by 235 votes to 187, a government majority of 48.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Chevening sale raises Pounds 1/2 m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLEAR-OUT of contents from the attics, basements and out-houses of the
foreign secretary's official residence, Chevening House near Sevenoaks in
Kent, yesterday raised in excess of Pounds 500,000, more than twice the
estimate.
Sotheby's had estimated that the 800 lots of run-of-the- mill late 18th and
19th century furniture, ceramics, pictures and silver, plus the flotsam and
jetsam from the kitchen, and a Brougham carriage from the stables, might
bring in Pounds 250,000.
The top price was Pounds 20,700 paid by the dealer Christopher Gibbs for a
large carved oak lantern stand of about 1890, which had been fitted for gas
lighting. It had been estimated to sell for about Pounds 2,500. Another
dealer, William Buck, paid Pounds 13,225 for a rare Worcester blue and white
'scratch cross' porringer of about 1745, estimated at Pounds 2,500.
The proceeds of the auction will be used to shore up the house and the
estate. The government provides no money for the upkeep of Chevening, which
was given to a trust by the late Lord Stanhope, who died in 1967. Under the
terms of the trust the Prime Minister can nominate the occupier of
Chevening, who can either be himself (or herself), another cabinet minister,
or a lineal descendant of King George VI. Mr Douglas Hurd has been the
nominated person since 1989.
Lord Cornwallis, chairman of the Chevening Trust finance committee, said
that a doubling of expenditure and a flat income from the estate over the
past 10 years might force the trustees to consider selling some of the more
important items of house furniture.

MS ANN CLWYD, the shadow heritage minister, strongly criticised the ITV
companies in the Commons yesterday for relying too heavily on programmes
imported from the US, Ivor Owen writes.
She warned that there was a danger that the BBC would become 'the only
significant source of original high-quality UK production'.
Mr Robert Key, junior heritage minister, denied that the ITV companies were
being swamped by American material and insisted that they were making
programmes which were held in high esteem.
Ms Joyce Quin (Lab Gateshead East) called for a review of the television
franchise system, but Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, said it was
too early to consider changes to the franchise arrangements which came into
effect at the beginning of the year.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Charging road users has high
political cost - Toll roads unleashed explosive anger among the Norwegians
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT secretary Mr John MacGregor yesterday came face to face with some
of the political risks and realities of introducing a system of charging
people for the use of London's roads.
On a fact-finding visit to one of the world's few road pricing schemes in
the Norwegian capital of Oslo, he learned that shoppers, the young and the
low-paid had emerged as some of the hardest hit by the charges. When the
system was introduced in 1990, there were attempts to blow up the toll
booths. It has remained unpopular, with the number of Oslo inhabitants
opposed to the scheme little lower now than the level of 60 per cent
initially.
However, Mr MacGregor was told that the proceeds from the tolls had
succeeded in financing the construction of new roads in the city, mostly in
tunnels, which had helped eased city centre congestion.
Mr MacGregor is visiting Scandinavia to see what lessons can be learned for
his own plans to introduce road charging to Britain, initially on trunk
roads and motorways and later in urban areas.
He intends to set out his plans for motorway charges in a green paper in the
next four to six weeks, but yesterday he said he would not take any
decisions on urban road charging until a Department of Transport study of
the issue had been completed towards the end of 1994.
The Oslo urban road charging system was introduced in February 1990 with
cross-party support to help finance a NK12bn (Pounds 1.138bn) programme of
urban road building and improvements to public transport. The city is now
ringed with 19 toll plazas where drivers pay an entry fee, either manually
in cash or electronically through a debiting system similar to the one
operating on London's Dartford Crossing.
The entry fee is NK11 for vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes and double that for
lorries, with discounts available for season tickets or multiple-entry
tickets. Only motorcycles, buses, cars being driven by the handicapped,
emergency vehicles and funeral processions are exempt from the charge.
When vehicles go through the electronic debiting lanes without a payment
being successfully deducted, their registration numbers are photographed so
that they can be traced.
Mr MacGregor was told that the violation rate was only 0.1 per cent, but
some drivers went to elaborate lengths to avoid being charged - for example,
covering their number plates with mud, bending the plates over so that they
were horizontal to the road, or driving on the tail of the vehicle in front
so that the camera could not get a clear view.
Officials from Norway's Public Roads Administration said the introduction of
road charges was estimated to have left total car journeys into the capital
5 per cent lower than they would otherwise have been.
However, a high proportion of better-off workers had received help with the
cost of an annual season ticket from their employers, while those who had
stopped making journeys were mainly the less well-off and among off-peak
users such as shoppers. The charges had also failed to produce any
detectable increase in the use of public transport.
Mr Olav Softeland, director general of the public roads administration, said
it was 'basically an unpopular thing' to start charging for roads that had
previously been free, and a 'hazardous thing' for a politician to put his
name to.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government staves off VAT revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night avoided a highly damaging defeat over its plans to
extend value added tax to domestic fuel, in spite of failing to stamp out a
surprisingly stubborn backbench rebellion.
The tightness of the result comes as an unpleasant reminder after last
week's morale-sapping election results that it is not just on Maastricht
that the government, with its majority now trimmed to 19, is vulnerable.
The government's determination to go through with the measure was
immediately pounced on by Labour, who said it showed ministers still
believed that they were right and the people were wrong.
On last night's principal vote the government scraped home by a majority of
10 (295 votes to 285), with two Conservative MPs - Mr William Powell (Corby)
and Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) - voting with the opposition.
A further five Conservative MPs - including Mr Geoffrey Dickens
(Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth) and Mr Michael Stern (Bristol North West)  -
abstained.
A Labour amendment to exempt charities from paying VAT on their fuel bills
was defeated by 297 votes to 286, a government majority of 11.
In what was a shaky start for the government to the Finance Bill's committee
stage, the focus of Tory misgivings was ministers' failure to outline fresh
steps to soften the impact of their plans on people with pensions and
savings marginally above the level entitling them to support from the social
security system.
In March the threat of a backbench revolt forced prime minister John Major
to promise extra help for 10m people on low incomes who stood to be hit by
the plans to extend VAT to domestic fuel from next April.
The move marked a rapid climbdown from earlier indications by ministers that
compensation would be limited to uprating income-related benefits in line
with retail prices.
Mr Powell said he would vote against the government 'with enthusiasm',
adding: 'I know my constituents would feel ashamed of me if I were to vote
for it tonight.'
He accused Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of making a 'very serious error
of judgment' in extending VAT into an area never previously contemplated by
the Commons.
He said it was this extension of VAT that had encouraged traditional
Conservative voters in Northamptonshire to stay at home in last week's
county council elections.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, took pains to emphasise both
the urgency of the need to tackle the public sector borrowing requirement
and the full extent of the benefits which pensioners and those on income
support derived from other government policies.
'It may be that the increases the government has made in help to the poorest
people have been so numerous and so large that the House is out of touch
with where we have now reached,' he said.
Details of the proposed measures to help those worst hit by the VAT
extension would be set out in the autumn uprating statement.
But he said it would be 'unrealistic to give extra help to all pensioners
over and above the retail price index effect' because 'we could be talking
about another Pounds 1bn on benefit.'
Later, Sir John Cope, paymaster general, said help would be provided for 8m
households.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS WERE last night trying to curb the extent of an embarrassing
revolt over the government's plans to extend value added tax to domestic
fuel, as the Finance Bill implementing the Budget began its Commons
committee stage.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, was forced to run a gauntlet
of backbench dissent in the wake of last week's morale-sapping election
results for the government.
Mr William Powell, the Tory MP for Corby, was the first backbencher to
pledge open defiance after a string of worried and sceptical Conservative
interventions during Mr Portillo's speech.
A common thread in their misgivings was the impact of the government's plans
on those with pensions and savings marginally above the level entitling them
to support from the social security system. Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, announced in the Budget that he planned to extend VAT to
domestic fuel from next April.
In a measured but determined tone, Mr Powell said he would vote against the
government 'with enthusiasm', adding: 'I know my constituents would feel
ashamed of me if I were to vote for it tonight.'
He accused Mr Lamont of making a 'very serious error of judgment' in
extending VAT into an area never previously contemplated by the Commons.
He said it was this extension of VAT that had encouraged traditional
Conservative voters in Northamptonshire to stay at home in last week's
county council elections.
Mrs Angela Browning, the Tory MP for Tiverton, expressed similar sentiments
and said that voters in the south-west were already having to find the money
to pay sharply increased water charges.
Mr Terry Dicks, Tory MP for Hayes and Harlington, attacked the government
for 'punishing pensioners' while subsidising the arts and contributing
significant sums to overseas aid.
Mr Portillo took pains to emphasise both the urgency of the need to tackle
the public sector borrowing requirement and the full extent of the benefits
which pensioners and those on income support had derived from other
government policies.
'It may be that the increases the government has made in help to the poorest
people have been so numerous and so large that the House is out of touch
with where we have now reached,' he said.
Details of the measures the government proposed to help those worst-hit by
the VAT extension would be set out in the autumn uprating statement.
But he said it would be 'unrealistic to give extra help to all pensioners
over and above the retail prices index effect', because 'we could be talking
about another Pounds 1bn on benefit'.
For Labour, Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief Treasury secretary, urged Tory
backbenchers to join the opposition in voting against the government, saying
it was the backbenchers' chance to show that 'even if the government cannot
listen' to the electorate 'perhaps they can'.
She said the government's proposals would make 'some of the poorest and most
vulnerable pay the price for the government's economic incompetence'.
She added: 'This VAT ex-tension paves the way for further VAT extensions to
children's clothes, newspapers and food.'

FT  11 MAY 93 / Pressure on Nadir as bank shuts HQ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KYRENIA,, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE POSITION of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Turkish-Cypriot businessman,
appeared to be weakening yesterday. Britain stepped up its diplomatic
pressure on northern Cyprus and Mr Nadir's privately owned bank announced
that it was closing its headquarters - the first indication of serious
trouble in his financial empire on the island.
In the strongest warning to northern Cyprus from the UK government so far,
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Foreign Office minister, yesterday warned that
sanctions had not been ruled out and that northern Cyprus's interests could
be badly damaged if it failed to return Mr Nadir to England.
Mr Garel-Jones said: 'The Turkish Cypriots should appreciate the damage it
could do to their interests if they were to acquire a reputation as a refuge
for fugitives.'
He added that if Mr Nadir travelled to Turkey then Turkey's reputation could
suffer similarly.
Mr Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, yesterday said that he had no
intention of returning Mr Nadir to Britain. Instead he urged the British
authorities to prosecute Mr Nadir in northern Cyprus.
In the first indication that Mr Nadir's troubles are affecting his private
businesses on the island, Kibris Endustri Bankasi, Mr Asil Nadir's privately
owned bank in northern Cyprus, is planning to close its Nicosia
headquarters. It told its landlords at the end of April that it intended to
vacate the premises. It has reportedly had problems meeting its rent
payments.
The northern Cyprus government has already put a general lien on all the
assets relating to Mr Nadir. This follows the failure to pay social security
and other official dues of 35bn Turkish lira (Pounds 2.28m) and TL40bn,
related to his personal debts to the government.
It is possible for Mr Nadir to be prosecuted in northern Cyprus because,
according to a provision in the criminal law of northern Cyprus, a citizen
can be tried and convicted in the local courts for a crime committed outside
the territory.
The UK's Serious Fraud Office has refrained from initiating such action
because the territory is not formally recognised by the UK.
Such a move would require the SFO to provide the information to proceed.
Meanwhile, BDO Binder Hamlyn, the accountancy firm, last night clarified the
work it had conducted on behalf of Mr Nadir in northern Cyprus.
Mr Nadir said on Friday that the firm had shown that monies allegedly stolen
by him were accounted for in the books of Unipac, the packaging company
based in northern Cyprus.
Mr Adrian Burn, managing partner in London, stressed that his firm had been
commissioned by Mr Nadir's former solicitors in 1991 to conduct a limited
review which reconciled bank statements with book entries for certain
specific transactions. He said: 'We were not asked, and did not form an
opinion on the whole picture. The transactions were consistent with the bank
statements and cash entries.'

FT  11 MAY 93 / Ministry admits overspend on EFA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence confirmed yesterday that the Eurofighter project to
build a joint combat aircraft with Germany, Italy and Spain was over its
budget. It said there was a 'slight overrun' on costs to the UK of just over
Pounds 1bn.
As reported by the FT yesterday, the present total cost estimate for the 250
aircraft the UK plans to buy is Pounds 13bn, including Britain's share of
development work.
The MoD said yesterday that this had risen 10 per cent in strictly
comparable terms since the project was launched, and described the increase
as 'not too bad' in view of the complexity and international nature of the
venture.
It said its projection in 1987 was a total cost of Pounds 7.8bn for a
reduced purchase of 200 aircraft. At today's prices, and taking the
additional 50 aircraft into account, the figure would be Pounds 11.9bn, it
said.
This contrasts with the government's declarations when it approved the
launching of development five years ago. Mr George Younger, now Lord
Younger, who was defence secretary at the time, told the Commons on April 25
1988: 'I would expect (the total cost to the UK) to be of the order of
Pounds 6bn to Pounds 7bn when it is completed.'
He added: 'There is no change in the United Kingdom's declared production
offtake, which remains 250 aircraft.'
The latest figure is also substantially higher than the MoD told the Commons
defence committee last year.
In a memorandum dated February 19 1992 it put the UK's costs as Pounds 2.7bn
for development and between Pounds 7bn and Pounds 8bn for production. It
made clear that this was based on a 'planning assumption' of 250 aircraft.
The Pounds 13bn total takes into account the results of a recent cost
overhaul.
The total costs of the programme have been obscured by differences in
accounting methods, but are expected to be about Pounds 32bn against the
Pounds 21bn expected in 1988.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Revenue quizzed BBC over Birt 4 years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC was challenged more than four years ago by the Inland Revenue over
the employment status of Mr John Birt, its director-general.
The Revenue, which has for years been tightening the rules for freelances
who work entirely or predominantly for one employer, wrote to the
corporation questioning Mr Birt's arrangement less than two years after he
became deputy director-general.
The BBC decided at the time to defend the practice. It is believed that the
BBC's tax advisers, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, were used to rebut the Inland Revenue
approach, which was not renewed.
It is unclear whether Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC, knew about
the Inland Revenue's approach, although he is ultimately responsible for the
remuneration of both the director-general and the deputy director-general.
A row erupted at the end of February when it was revealed that Mr Birt had
not joined the corporation's staff. Instead he was hired as a freelance
consultant, initially as deputy director-general, and was paid through his
private company, John Birt Productions. He finally joined the BBC staff last
week.
Mr Birt has also received contributions to his private pension from the BBC
in addition to his basic pay. These payments have never been disclosed.
The pension contributions were paid to John Birt Productions, a company
owned by Mr Birt and his wife Jane - this means that Mr Birt was paid more
than had been thought. The actual total is difficult to discern because in
addition to basic pay and pension money, Mr Birt's BBC expenses were also
paid through the private company.
In 1991, the last year for which accounts are available, the company's
'administration expenses' were Pounds 159,174. In that year there was a
payment of Pounds 36,167 to the company pension plans.
In January Mr Birt agreed a Pounds 200,000 pay package and the corporation
has confirmed that he had formally joined the staff and would be eligible to
join the BBC pension scheme.
It is not clear whether the private pension payments will continue on top of
the Pounds 200,000 package.
BBC executives who know Mr Birt believe that the additional payments for his
private pension are likely to continue in addition to his pay package.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Pharmaceutical industry seeks a tonic in bid for drug
bureau: The potential returns which may flow from the European Medicines
Evaluation Agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government and the pharmaceutical industry will today launch a
high-profile bid to set up the European Medicines Evaluation Agency in
London.
Potential gains from attracting the agency, which will control the safety of
medicines in the EC and encourage innovation and technical co-operation
between member states, extend beyond status and direct jobs. Britain has one
of the community's leading pharmaceutical industries and the presence of the
agency would be likely to stimulate its growth.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, will launch the campaign for
London's bid today with the backing of Mr John Major, prime minister. He
says in a note endorsing the bid that the case for siting the agency in
London is a 'powerful one'.
A brochure setting out the UK case enlists the support of a variety of
leading figures in pharmaceuticals and medicine including representatives of
Zeneca, Hoechst UK, Glaxo, Wellcome Foundation, Astra Pharmaceuticals,
London University and its medical schools.
Although it is possible that a decision on the agency's location may be made
at the Copenhagen EC summit next month, it is more likely to come later in
the year.
Rival bids are likely to come from Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and the
Irish Republic.
The British bid will emphasise that London's worldwide reputation as a
medical research centre, with more than half the nation's expenditure on
academic medical research going to the London medical schools, is
complemented by a well-established pharmaceutical industry.
There are 65 pharmaceutical manufacturers in the UK, 89 per cent of them
foreign-owned, employing 87,000 people. One fifth of these staff are
employed in medical research and development.
Britain is Europe's largest investor in pharmaceutical research and
development - spending in 1991 was Pounds 1.2bn or 22 per cent of the EC
total - and is second only to Germany as an EC exporter of pharmaceuticals
to non-community countries. Exports from Britain account for about 16 per
cent of the EC total.
Locating close to the predominantly London and home counties-based
pharmaceuticals industry would, say the promoters of the British bid, have
the additional advantage of guaranteeing the agency an adequate supply of
qualified and experienced staff.
The British bid will stress other advantages of housing the agency in
London, many of these related to communications.
Evaluating new drugs requires the exchange of massive amounts of
information. Supporters argue that Britain's telecommunications system,
allied to physical communications advantages such as the capital's airports
and the opening of the Channel tunnel, make London the natural choice.
English is also the internationally recognised language of medicines
regulation.
The agency, which is due to start work in 1995, will have 300 at first staff
with substantial information technology and archive support. It is estimated
that it will need 5,300 square metres of office space by the end of the
century.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Raw material prices held down by sterling strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UPWARD PRESSURE on raw material prices eased considerably last month,
reflecting the relatively stronger pound and a fall in world commodity
prices.
Prices of raw materials and fuel purchased by UK manufacturing industry rose
by 7.2 per cent in the 12 months to April, compared with a rise of 8.4 per
cent in the year to March.
The fall in the year-on-year rate was caused partly by a rise in the value
of sterling last month. The pound rose significantly against the dollar and
other European currencies, making raw materials cheaper for importers.
Imported materials and fuels account for about 66 per cent of British
manufacturers' costs of raw materials.
The official figures contained evidence that manufacturers are not yet
passing on the higher costs of imports to retailers.
The output prices index - the prices of manufactured products as they leave
the factory gates - rose by 3.8 per cent in the year to April, compared with
3.7 per cent in the year to March, with increases in excise duties in the
March Budget adding 0.2 per cent to the index.
The output prices index, excluding food, drink and tobacco,
is only 0.2 percentage points higher than a floor of 2.4 per cent reached in
November last year.
Mr Robert Lind, economist at UBS, said: 'The figures suggest that
manufacturers can afford to keep the lid on prices because they are
benefiting from lower unit wage costs.'
He added, however, that upward pressure on input prices should soon resume
as commodity prices recover.
The Treasury said the figures showed that inflationary pressures were
contained and fairly weak.
The Central Statistical Office said that falls in the prices of fuels,
metals and other imported materials were partly offset by higher prices for
home-produced food raw materials.
Between March and April the seasonally adjusted index of input prices fell 1
per cent, the first fall since August last year.
A growing share of the UK food market is supplied by imports, although home
producers are capable of supplying many of these foods more competitively,
according to Seymour Cooke, a consultancy specialising in food distribution.
The deficit on food worsened by more than Pounds 350m last year to exceed
Pounds 5bn, it said.
A report by the consultancy suggests there is no good reason why the UK
should not be a net exporter of foodstuffs. 'Yet the UK has a worsening
trade balance in food because its suppliers are too slow in responding to
market trends.'

FT  11 MAY 93 / Iraq arms papers still withheld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEY GOVERNMENT documents which could shed light on the extent to which
ministers sidestepped government guidelines on defence sales to Iraq are
still being withheld from the arms-for-Iraq inquiry it emerged yesterday.
The missing documents include details of a secret system for classifying
countries according to their perceived security risk, which was apparently
used by the Ministry of Defence in processing exports to Iraq.
Guidelines announced to parliament in October 1985 officially made defence
sales more restrictive both to Iraq and Iran. But it is thought the internal
classification system for Iraq remained unchanged from 1981 until August
1990, when Kuwait was invaded.
Reference to a classification system code-named Table X was made by a former
senior official of the Ministry of Defence, Mr Christopher Sandars, in
evidence at the start of the second week of the Scott inquiry's public
hearings.
Mr Sandars said that under an internal system set up in the ministry in the
1980s, British defence companies wishing to trade with Iraq dealt directly
with defence officials, some of whom were charged with promoting exports.
The inquiry heard that the opinions of these officials, in consultation with
the Foreign Office, were often 'fairly definitive' in deciding whether a
company was granted an export licence. The system of 'informal clearances'
brokered by an internal arms working group did not involve the Department of
Trade and Industry.
Mr Sandars was told by Lord Justice Scott that he would be required to
attend a fresh hearing after he had provided missing documents covering
Table X and other important areas of defence policy.
Mr Sandars was head of the MoD's Secretariat 13 in charge of defence sales
between September 1980 and December 1984. He subsequently served as
assistant secretary of state (Defence Export Services Administration), a
separate department which also oversaw defence sales.
It emerged last night that Mr Sandars remains a serving senior civil
servant. He was recently moved to the Cabinet Office's Defence and Overseas
Affairs Secretariat which co-ordinates policy between departments.
Sources close to the inquiry were playing down suggestions of a clash over
missing documents between Lord Justice Scott and the government although
they said the judge was determined to get all the documents he had asked for
before preparing his report later in the year.
The hearing continues today.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Channel tunnel may face delay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSMANCHE LINK, the consortium building the Channel tunnel, said yesterday
that the opening of the tunnel could be delayed until 1995.
Mr Philippe Montagner, TML vice-president, told shareholders that
construction of the tunnel was not nearly finished, in spite of what
Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator said.
He said that more than a year was needed to make software and to carry out
tests.
'The installations as such are on the verge of being finished but that is
not the case for software or tests, and in the best of cases over another
year of work is still needed today,' Mr Montagner said.
He said talks between Eurotunnel and TML were blocked and there was no
agreement on costs, the opening date or financing.
TML was ready to negotiate if Eurotunnel made an offer that could serve as a
basis of negotiation, he said, adding that a 1995 opening would only be
possible if 'perfect co-operation' between all parties in the project was
reached.
TML favoured a phased opening even if this was not planned in the initial
contract, he said.
Eurotunnel said it was sticking by a recent statement that, if it ccould
count on the co-operation of its contractors, the tunnel should be ready to
open in 1994.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Education department denies test clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department for Education last night vehemently denied reports that tests
for 14-year-old pupils were not to be compulsory this year.
Signs late yesterday that Mr John Major was considering a compromise on the
tests, which are due to be start next month, seemed to contradict Mr John
Patten, the education secretary. Yesterday he insisted that national
curriculum tests in schools will go ahead this year, in spite of opinion
polls showing that a majority of parents thought they should be abandoned.
'If we were to bring these reforms juddering to a halt now, I believe we
will find them extremely difficult to get back on the road again,' Mr Patten
said.
The education department said last night: 'It is not an option to call off
the tests for this year. They come at the end of three years' compulsory
schooling, they provide useful diagnostic information to parents and on top
of that they will be useful in the review of the national curriculum by Sir
Ron Dearing.'
Two teachers' unions, the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of
Women Teachers, and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, are
boycotting the tests. The largest, the National Union of Teachers, is
expected to join them when it announces the results of its ballot on a test
boycott on Thursday.
Mr Patten, speaking on the BBC's Today programme, denied that last week's
setbacks for the government in the Newbury by-election and the county
council elections meant that the tests should be made voluntary.
He said: 'We are at a critical moment in the introduction of our education
reforms. Sometimes the price of success is a period of unpopularity.'
The department yesterday stepped up the publicity campaign supporting the
tests by distributing an information pack called 'Testing: The Facts'. The
pack, which has been sent to trade unions, employers' organisations,
universities and church leaders, says that testing is inseparable from the
process of introducing a national curriculum.
Two polls published yesterday showed parents supporting the claim by
teachers that the tests should be abandoned.
In another setback for the government, the National Confederation of Parent
Teacher Associations has voted to ballot its members on a boycott by parents
of the tests.
The department ruled out making tests for 11- and 14-year-olds voluntary,
citing majorities among parents of 85 and 82 per cent respectively in favour
of these tests in the survey in The Independent newspaper yesterday.
Sir Ron Dearing, who has been appointed by Mr Patten to review the
curriculum and testing, tried to distance himself from the political row
surrounding the tests.
Four weeks ago he called for the tests to go ahead to provide him with
information to improve them next year.
Yesterday, he said: 'I don't think it's for me to get involved in what has
become an industrial relations issue.'

The Radio Authority, which regulates the commercial radio industry, served a

FT  11 MAY 93 / Customs acts on excise evasion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise officers uncovered 230 cases of illegal trade in tobacco
and drinks by cross-Channel shoppers during the first three months of the
year.
Eleven people have been charged with offences and prosecution of a further
113 is under consideration.
Since January 1 travellers have been able to bring unlimited supplies of
drink and tobacco from the Continent into the UK for personal consumption.
But selling the goods without paying higher UK excise rates is illegal.
Customs and Excise said yesterday that the 230 cases involved evasion of
about Pounds 324,000 in duty, of which Pounds 249,000 was accounted for by
2,500 kilos of tobacco.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Uncertainty grows over Independent ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY grew last night over the future ownership of Newspaper
Publishing, publishers of The Independent and Independent on Sunday,
following the failed attempt to buy the Observer, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The company declined to comment on reports that the two principal
shareholders, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy had let it be
known formally they each wanted to increase its stake from 18 per cent to 25
per cent.
Both companies bought part of their holding at Pounds 5 a share but the
latest package of shares went at Pounds 1.90 a share to Cerruti, the Italian
manufacturer of printing presses.
If El Pais and La Repubblica end up jointly owning a majority stake this
would call into question the position of the founder of The Independent, Mr
Andreas Whittam Smith, as both chief executive of the company and editor.
Last week Sir Ralf Dahrendorf resigned as chairman of Newspaper Publishing
partly because of opposition to the plan to buy the Observer but also
because of what he saw as Mr Whittam Smith's increasingly authoritarian
style of management. The company is urgently seeking a new chairman and Mr
Ian Hay Davison, already a non-executive director, is seen as favourite.
In the six months to March Newspaper Publishing had pre-tax profits of
Pounds 341,000 but the company is likely to face increasing competition once
The Guardian completes its expected purchase of the Observer.
As a result of the last re-financing, limits on the size of individual
shareholdings were removed. This means that Newspaper Publishing is now open
to takeover should it run into financial difficulties and need to raise more
capital.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Professionals who want manufacturing taken seriously:
Proposals to improve the image and status of engineers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of a much-criticised Pounds 100m business will meet today to hear
how a new relationship between head office and 42 diverse affiliates -
leading ultimately, perhaps, to a full-blown merger - could sharpen its
image and improve its products.
Another troubled British manufacturing company looking for a fresh start? Up
to a point, yes. The business is the UK professional engineering structure,
the 'board' is the Engineering Council, and the affiliates are the 42
professional institutions, big and small.
Collectively, the institutions and the council have a turnover of Pounds
100m, and their most important product is their engineers.
But the affiliates are not happy. Mr Terry Harrison, chief executive of
Rolls-Royce and a council member, said: 'Why is manufacturing industry so
undervalued in this country? It is more than a coincidence that the
engineering profession is also under-rated and undervalued by the government
and by the general public. The engineer is seen as the guy who has come to
mend the gas cooker.'
Mr Harrison and other industrialists on the council, including Sir Colin
Chandler, chief executive of Vickers, and Sir Anthony Gill, chairman of
Lucas Industries, are due to attend today's meeting.
The professions and the council, which acts as an umbrella body, have a key
role in attracting young people into engineering, developing the skills of
professional engineers, and setting standards.
A key to that is to raise the status of engineers among the general public,
the City, and the government.
Companies that employ engineers are watching the negotiations. Mr Neil
Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, said:
'The long-term success of the engineering industry and the profession are
interdependent.'
At today's meeting Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the council, will
outline proposals from a steering group for a 'new relationship' of
co-operation between the council and the institutions.
This could lead to the creation of a single body in which the institutions
are grouped into six divisions. The meeting foreshadows the start of a
nationwide exercise designed to stimulate debate of the reform proposals,
which were creating controversy even before the ink was dry.
Sir John sees two important industrial dimensions to the plans. The first is
the importance of a strong single body for setting standards of knowledge
and skills on which industry can depend.
The second is to develop engineering as a platform for a career in
management. 'We need to create an environment where engineers are more able
to reach the boardroom than under the present arrangements,' he said. 'There
are too many accountants in the boardroom, but that is the fault of the
engineering profession.'
Achieving this would require a more flexible system, producing engineers
with more 'interdisciplinary' abilities than are produced by the present
system, where each institution retains its right to accredit courses. 'All
industrialists are asking for this,' Sir John said.
The four big institutions have already said they believe the case for a
single body has not yet been made, and Sir John admits it will not be
possible to decide on that until the new relationship has been established.
But industry has welcomed the proposals in full.
Sir Colin, who chairs the council's standing committee on industry, said
issues such as standard-setting and developing engineering in the education
system were much better handled by a single body.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Abolition of Cleveland council is proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABOLITION of Cleveland county council and seven of County Durham's eight
district councils was proposed yesterday by the Local Government Commission
for England.
The commission, set up last July to review the two-tier local government
structure, recommends unitary councils for Cleveland and County Durham in
its first published recommendations for a mainland area.
It suggests areas in Cleveland north of the Tees should be restored to
County Durham and those to the south of the Tees to Yorkshire for ceremonial
and cultural purposes.
Under this proposal Stockton will have areas in both Durham and Yorkshire.
The commission proposes that in Cleveland the four district councils -
Hartlepool, Langbaurgh, Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees - should have
unitary status. It says there should be two councils in County Durham, one
for Darlington and one for the rest of the county.
The proposals, which will be put out to public consultation, were welcomed
by the councils which would survive, all Labour-controlled.
But Mr Paul Harford, leader of Labour-controlled Cleveland county council,
condemned the plans as a 'political fix' by the Tories - a claim strongly
rejected by Sir John Banham, the commission chairman.
The Teesside Chamber of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry
criticised the plan to abolish Cleveland county council.
Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, northern CBI chairman, condemned the return of areas
to Durham and Yorkshire for ceremonial and cultural purposes as 'crazy'.
He said: 'It will cause a terrible schizophrenia. It's marching boldly
backward to what we had pre-1968.'
The Association of District Councils welcomed unitary status for Cleveland's
districts and Darlington, but said the proposed Durham county council would
cover too big an area.
But Mr Robin Wendt, secretary of the Tory-dominated Association of County
Councils, disagreed. He said the commission had followed the right logic in
Durham, but needed to think again about Cleveland.
Sir John said in launching the proposals that the commission believed the
new structure would be efficient and cost-effective, and would reflect the
identity of communities. But if the public said the plans should be thrown
out, he said, they would be.
The commission said its proposals would save more than Pounds 25m a year -
an annual saving of Pounds 46 a household in Cleveland and Pounds 65 a
household in County Durham - once transitional costs of Pounds 28.8m have
been met. Of the 52,000 jobs in the councils, 50,000 would be unaffected.
The commission will make a final recommendation to Mr Michael Howard, the
environment secretary, by November.
It has started work on its review of Leicestershire. Proposals for
Derbyshire are to be published on Monday, followed by Avon, Gloucestershire
and Somerset on June 14 and Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire on
June 21.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Auditors told to be tougher on accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS' reports in the annual accounts of companies will be fundamentally
changed under guidelines announced yesterday by the Auditing Practices
Board.
Auditors will be required to take a firmer line in assessing whether the
accounts presented by the directors are a 'true and fair view' of a
company's financial position.
The audit statement will also be substantially expanded to include details
of the nature of the work carried out by the auditors and the
responsibilities of both them and the directors of the company.
Mr Nigel Macdonald, president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Scotland and chairman of the board's working party, said: 'This requires a
fundamental change recognising for the first time that not all readers of
accounts have a proper understanding of the respective responsibilities of
auditors and directors.'
Auditors will no longer have the option of expressing opinions that say the
accounts are true and fair 'subject to' the effects of financial
uncertainties such as outstanding litigation or contracts subject to
dispute.
Instead, they will be forced to qualify the accounts - rejecting the view
that they agree with the figures - unless they are satisfied with the
estimates and disclosures given by directors of these uncertainties.
In either case, they will be expected to provide details of any 'fundamental
uncertainty' with a description and details of potential risks and costs.
Mr Macdonald said: 'The standard has been honoured slightly differently in
the past than it will be in the future. We're trying to abolish auditors
sitting on the fence.'
Auditors will still have the option of issuing reports which are qualified,
unqualified, which disclaim opinion or present an adverse opinion.
The new report is still likely to be written to a standard form of words,
but will stress that the preparation of the accounts is the responsibility
of directors and the auditors form an independent opinion based on their
audit.
It says the audit is conducted in accordance with auditing standards, based
on a test examination of evidence relevant to the disclosures in the
accounts and the judgments of the directors.
This wording reflects a recommendation in the report of the Cadbury
committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, which was
published last December.
The new requirements closely reflect a consultation draft issued by the
board in May last year, and will become mandatory for companies with
financial year-ends after September 30. The board is urging voluntary
compliance before this date.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Profit at BNF hit by Thorp delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH NUCLEAR Fuels' annual profits have fallen by at least Pounds 60m,
partly because of the delay in starting its controversial Thorp nuclear
reprocessing plant, the company's newsletter reports.
The pre-tax profit for the year to March 1993, which BNF expects to be less
than Pounds 100m when finalised, has also been hit by the unplanned shutdown
of the facilities for handling fuel from Magnox power stations for 48 days
last year.
Mr Neville Chamberlain, BNF chief executive, warned that the delay in
starting Thorp, which BNF says is costing Pounds 2m a week, would also hit
the current year's earnings.
BNF had expected that Thorp, which has taken Pounds 2.8bn and nearly 10
years to build, would get an operating licence from the Department of the
Environment in January. The complexity of the decision, and a public
consultation which yielded 80,000 reponses, have led to delay, however.
The department's lawyers have warned that the government may need to
consider the economic case as well as the environmental and health factors,
even though a more full evaluation could delay a decision further. BNF
argues that no further assessment beyond the pollution inspectorate's report
is necessary.
Mr Chamberlain said recent leaks at Sellafield had no 'radiological
significance' and posed no health risks, but added: 'We have a lot to do in
educating the media, politicians and the public to help them understand
these concepts.'

FT  11 MAY 93 / Unions threaten to ground BA in a summer of discontent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS faces a damaging summer of industrial disruption on three
fronts, starting with a possible shutdown of its UK operations by its ground
staff during the spring bank holiday weekend.
The 18,000 ground staff and clerical workers are being balloted by the TGWU
general union to support strike action against contracting out and the
creation of subsidiary companies with what the staff say are inferior terms
and conditions of employment.
That result will be known on May 27, the eve of the holiday weekend. The
union made clear yesterday that if it got the yes vote it expected, it would
seek to ground BA's operations during the holiday.
Yesterday voting also started among BA's 3,000 pilots on whether to strike
over alleged threats to their pay and employment conditions.
Their union - the British Airline Pilots Association - is warning that BA
pilots could ground the company's entire fleet for the first time in 14
years. The result will be known on June 4.
To add to BA's mounting troubles its cabin staff at London's Gatwick airport
have already voted to take disruptive action. Their first strike was on May
2 and further 24-hour stoppages are expected in the next few weeks in
protest at what the cabin staff believe is a threat to worsen their terms
and conditions of employment.
All three conflicts share a common theme, the belief among its staff that BA
intends to drive down costs at their expense.
The point at issue in the pilots' dispute concerns the future of short-haul
flights from Gatwick airport since the airline took over Dan-Air last
November. Dan-Air's pay rates and conditions of employment were markedly
inferior to those at BA.
But the unions fear the troubles at Gatwick have a much wider significance -
that new agreements could undermine staff's benefits.
Earlier this year BA established a new subsidiary at Gatwick for the former
Dan-Air staff, European Operations Gatwick. BA then decided from May 1 to
move three of its existing short-haul European routes between Gatwick and
Frankfurt, Copenhagen and Malaga to the new company.
The pilots and cabin crew affected have been offered alternative work during
the next three years by either working on long-haul routes from Gatwick or
moving to London's Heathrow airport to work on BA's short-haul routes from
there. Cabin crew, and not pilots, have also been offered severance pay.
Mr Jock Lowe, BA's director of flight operations, said yesterday that there
was no question of any worker being forced to accept worse terms and
conditions of employment. He added that the 116 former Dan-Air pilots at
Gatwick would be brought into BA's master seniority list, enabling them to
enjoy existing BA wage rates and benefits if they move to work in other
parts of the company.
The pilots' association said that it was prepared to work with BA on
reducing its costs. Mr Chris Darke, association general secretary, pointed
to the agreement reached 18 months ago, which he said had made savings worth
Pounds 17m on BA's routes out of Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester.
He added: 'We are prepared for BA pilot's work to be transferred to the new
subsidiary company at Gatwick and negotiate a realistic cost base for its
operations there, just as long as none of our members is forced to accept
inferior pay and conditions.'
Yesterday Mr Lowe said he was confident the pilots would be 'sensible' and
not back their union's strike call.
BA pointed out that last year it lost as much as Pounds 35m on its Gatwick
short-haul services. On top of that BA inherited a Pounds 48m financial
liability as a result of its takeover of Dan Air.

FT  11 MAY 93 / School inspection tender attracts few bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST wave of putting school inspections out to competitive tender
failed to produce more than one bidder in more than half the schools
involved, it was announced yesterday.
The Office for Standards in Education, the government's body created to
inspect schools, said yesterday that of the 257 schools and groups of
schools due to be inspected next term, only 17 failed to attract bids, but
118 attracted only one bid.
The maximum number of bids attracted by any school was five, and 440
competitive tenders were received.
Professor Stewart Sutherland, Her Majesty's chief inspector, said: 'This is
a very encouraging response to what was always likely to be the most
difficult tender exercise, since there are only 370 inspectors on the
register so far.'
About 60 per cent of the bids came from inspectors with local education
authority backgrounds. Prof Sutherland said applicants were sifted before
acceptance on a training course, where the failure rate was about 10 per
cent. Ofsted said it planned to spend more than Pounds 55m in the next year
as it established new inspectors.
Labour condemned the results. Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary,
described the contracting-out process as 'inspecting schools on the cheap',
and said: 'The consequence of privatising the inspectorate is the
disintegration of inspection not the improvement of it. Today's news will
result in the total undermining of confidence in the new inspection regime.'
Ofsted denied this. It said: 'If people bid too high, they won't get the
contract. Single tenders are still competitive, and we have no reason to
think that single bids are less value for money than the others.'
On the issue of the test boycott, Prof Sutherland said tests for
seven-year-olds had proved useful.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Patten refuses to give ground on testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday insisted that national
curriculum tests in schools will go ahead this year, in spite of opinion
polls which showed a majority of parents thought they should be abandoned.
'If we were to bring these reforms juddering to a halt now, I believe we
will find them extremely difficult to get back on the road again,' Mr Patten
said.
Two teachers' unions, the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of
Women Teachers, and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, are already
boycotting the tests. The largest, the National Union of Teachers, is
expected to join them when it announces the results of its ballot on a test
boycott on Thursday.
Mr Patten, speaking on the BBC's Today programme, denied that last week's
setbacks for the government in the Newbury by-election and the county
council elections meant that the tests should be made voluntary.
He said: 'We are at a critical moment in the introduction of our education
reforms. Sometimes the price of success is a period of unpopularity.'
The Department for Education then stepped up the publicity campaign
supporting the tests by distributing an information pack called 'Testing:
The Facts'. The pack, which has been sent to trade unions, employers'
organisations, universities and church leaders, says that testing is
inseparable from the process of introducing a national curriculum.
Two polls published yesterday showed that parents supported the claim by
teachers that the tests should be abandoned. One in The Independent found 52
per cent of parents in favour of abandonment. The other, in The Daily
Telegraph, found that 77 per cent of the public believed that education
reforms had been introduced without sufficient preparation, and that 62 per
cent sympathised with the teachers' claim that the tests are too complicated
and time-consuming.
In another setback for the government, the National Confederation of Parent
Teacher Associations has voted to ballot its members on a boycott by parents
of the tests. The National Association of Head Teachers has already advised
its members not to hinder parents who withdraw their children on testing
days.
The department said the tests for seven-year-olds were already almost
complete, and there was no point making them voluntary at this stage.
Sir Ron Dearing, who has been appointed by Mr Patten to review the
curriculum and testing, tried to distance himself from the political row
surrounding the tests.
Four weeks ago he called on the tests to go ahead to provide him with
information necessary to improve them next year. Yesterday, he said: 'I
don't want to add to that. I don't think it's for me to get involved in what
has become an industrial relations issue.'

THE government's review of the coal industry has demonstrated that 'market
forces' is not an acceptable response to an energy policy, a study by the
Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University says.
The study advocates a more planned response to energy to take account of
some issues such as environmental protection which may not be considered in
a market approach.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Campus venture fund unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 500,000 venture-capital fund to exploit the commercial potential of
research carried out at Newcastle University was launched yesterday.
The Quantum Fund, which has backing from some of north-east England's
biggest companies, is intended as a rolling fund to help regenerate the
region's economy.
One of the largest British campus-based venture-capital funds, it will
provide injections of capital from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 50,000.
The fund will be managed by Nuventures, the university's technology transfer
company. Mr Robin Mackay, Nuventures business development manager, said:
'The fund is to bridge that gap between innovations which have a good
commercial potential but require additional work to get them ready for
industry.'
Applications to the fund, which will expect a return on its investments,
must be related to research at the university.
Outside companies wishing to exploit a university-developed product may be
eligible for funding, possibly in exchange for a royalty.
Investors in Quantum include Northumbrian Water, Northern Electric and 3i.

FT  11 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Japan to clarify bidding process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Construction Ministry yesterday issued proposals to clarify the
bidding process for public contracts in an effort to head off US pressure
for reform.
The proposals, made by an advisory committee, call for clearer and more
specific criteria to assess construction groups bidding for public works
contracts.
The process has faced mounting criticism following revelations that
construction companies made illegal political donations to influence the
outcome of bids. On April 30 the US warned Japan it would impose sanctions
if alleged discrimination was not eliminated.
Under the Japanese system the Construction Ministry pre-selects a company as
eligible to bid, rather than making an open invitation. Existing criteria
are generally vague references to the bidder's ethics, employment record and
financial strength.
The revised criteria will stress a contractor's record in comparable
projects and its technology. The new system will be tested on about 30
medium-sized public works projects valued at between Y200m-Y500m (Pounds
1.2m-Pounds 2.8m) each.
The committee also called for a review of the Construction Ministry's
methods for estimating the value of public works projects. The ministry has
been criticised for overestimating the value of projects, thereby allowing
construction companies to make excess profits which are in turn used for
political donations.

ANSALDO, the engineering arm of Italy's state-controlled Finmeccanica
engineering group, has won a L250bn (Pounds 109m) order for two refuse
treatment and electricity generating plants in Taiwan.
The order, for the group's Ansaldo Volund subsidiary, is for units in the
cities of Chiay and Tainan. The new plants will be capable of handling 300
tonnes and 900 tonnes of urban refuse a day respectively.
The order was won in conjunction with a local partner, Chung Sing, part of
the Taiwanese Kuang-Hwa group.
Ansaldo's Volund-Ecology division will be responsible for the combustion and
energy recovery aspects of the plants, while Ansaldo Energia will supply
electricity-generating steam turbines.
The group diversified into the waste treatment and environmental sectors
after Italy's 1987 decision to block the development of nuclear power.
In April 1992, the group bought Volund, a Danish company specialising in
incinerators, boilers and heat recovery systems, as part of its push into
waste management.
Belleli, the Italian specialist engineering group, has won orders worth
L60bn for oil and petrochemicals plant from Statoil in Denmark and Shell in
the US, along with Ssangyong Oil of South Korea

FT  11 MAY 93 / World Trade News: The 'plain folks' Kantor risks alienating
 -A Midwest mayor complains about protectionist trade policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 6ft 7in, the mayor of Milwaukee, Mr John Norquist, can pack a memorable
punch, which he did rhetorically last week with some telling jabs at the US
steel industry and protectionist politicians.
'Mickey Kantor (the US trade representative) says he doesn't believe in
trade theology. Well, I've got 50 unemployed longshoreman who don't believe
in trade theology either. They just want to work.'
The mayor took up the case of the dockworkers as well as Milwaukee's Paper
Machinery Corporation on a trip to Washington last week. The company, which
had been successfully competing against French and German companies, has had
to absorb a 10-20 per cent increase in steel prices since the US commerce
department put temporary tariffs on steel imports.
The tariffs, a result of the dozens of dumping and countervailing duty cases
brought by the steel industry against companies in 21 countries, could cost
hundreds more jobs in Milwaukee and other port cities and at the factories
which mould steel into products for export around the world.
Authorities at the Port of Toledo, which last year handled 50,000 tonnes of
leaded steel from Europe, say the tariffs have thrown 45 dock workers off
the job. The ports of New Orleans, Philadelphia, Long Beach, California, and
Houston also report job losses.
According to the Milwaukee city government, the steel suits have cost the
local economy about Dollars 2m in the first five months of the year; steel
imports have plummeted by an estimated 78 per cent. The warehouses are
almost totally empty.
Mayor Norquist is particularly irked at the 'sheer 100 per cent unalloyed
greed' of the steel companies, which he sees as too wimpish to compete.
Years of protection have allowed them to pour billions of dollars into
modernisation, but the money was gained on the backs of their customers, he
says.
The mayor has no patience with charges of dumping. 'If someone wants to set
prices under their cost of production, say thank you,' he says. 'The high
value products are those which use steel. If they do subsidise steel, that
makes our other products more competitive.'
President Bill Clinton aimed his presidential campaign at plain folks such
as Mayor Norquist, a Democrat and former lathe operator; the two met briefly
on the campaign trail. So Mayor Norquist decided to bring up the steel
tariffs with the 'populists' in the White House.
His message was dutifully received - by the aide of Mr Clinton's 33-year-old
political assistant, Mr Rahm Emanuel.
The administration has stood visibly back from the 'quasi-judicial process'
under which the commerce department determines how much dumping and
subsidies there have been and the International Trade Commission decides if
the US industry has been injured by the alleged dumping and subsidies.
'It's a judicial process that was set up by a political process to turn
normal competition into findings of illegal dumping,' the mayor says,
reaping scorn upon his fellow politicians. 'It is convenient for them to sit
back and say we didn't do it. . . It was this mechanistic formula when
actually they're making a policy decision to prop up an industry that
already has 85 per cent of the market.'
Mayor Norquist has fixed upon Mr Kantor, who implements rather than
originates Mr Clinton's trade policies, as the administration's bogeyman.
'Mickey Kantor doesn't know which products to penalise and which to
subsidise. When he's trying to penalise Germany and Japan, he's hurting
Milwaukee. He's decided to punish Milwaukee and punish Wisconsin to prop up
this industry that doesn't want to compete in the marketplace. All they want
to do is sit on their congressmen's laps.'
Mr Kantor has no role in the dumping/countervailing duty regime, but he has
defended it as necessary: 'I would say the US process, both in terms of fair
hearing and transparency, is probably as good or better than any process in
the world.'
While not directly involved in the countervailing duty suits, Mr Kantor is
suppressing a planned study by the ITC that might reveal the harmful impact
of 'unfair trade laws', a project proposed by his Republican predecessor. He
is also backing congressional opposition to proposals in the Uruguay Round
of multilateral trade talks which could open US trade law to challenges by
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
None of this means much to the people of Milwaukee who benefit little from
federal government projects. They want the 'change' Mr Clinton promised, the
mayor says - an end to meaningless free market rhetoric. They want to get on
with their business without government interference.

FT  11 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC challenge over US fuel economy tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC is expected this week to call for a dispute settlement panel under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to take up a complaint over US
environmental laws which tax cars heavy on fuel.
According to Friends of the Earth, an international environmental
organisation, the EC will initiate complaints against US corporate average
fuel economy (Cafe) standards and the so-called 'gas-guzzler' tax. The
Europeans are concerned that environmental requirements will affect the
export of certain classes of EC cars to the US.
In the US the fuel economy levels for corporate cars set an average fleet
standard of 27.5 miles per gallon, and vehicles with a worse mileage are
taxed. The 'gas-guzzler' tax penalises other passenger cars that achieve
less than 22.5mpg.
Should the US lose the case, it would be bound to raise as much of an outcry
as the so-called 'tuna-dolphin' decision, arising from the Marine Mammal
Protection Act. Under the act the US banned Mexican tuna caught with drift
nets, which also trap dolphins.
The EC is challenging the marine act as the US has imposed a secondary
embargo on EC countries which may be trans-shipping 'dolphin-unsafe tuna'.
Trade analysts worry that anti-environmental messages sent by Gatt could
make it more difficult to get congressional approval of a completed Uruguay
Round agreement.
EC objections to the fuel economy law, the 'gas-guzzler' tax and a luxury
car excise tax are listed in an EC report on US trade and investment
barriers.
'Although the Cafe tax applies theoretically to virtually all car makers
doing business in the US, in reality the only makers who have paid the
penalty are the limited-line premium car makers,' the report says. 'The Cafe
regulations are biased toward the full-line manufacturers (in other words,
domestic manufacturers) that make both small, fuel-efficient and larger
vehicles and limited-line manufacturers that produce mostly small vehicles
(Japanese manufacturers).
'Thus, the only Cafe penalties paid thus far have been paid by European
limited-line car makers. Full-line car makers, such as General Motors, have
been able to meet the Cafe standards by averaging the fuel economy of small,
fuel-efficient cars with large cars.'
In a letter to Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, Friends of the Earth
challenged the 'secrecy' surrounding the EC action as 'unnecessary,
undemocratic and unwise'.
'The EC cannot claim to be concerned about the development of the trade and
environment debate if it persists in attempting to define. . .whether or not
the environmental laws of another country are simply disguised trade
barriers'.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Wasmosy wins in Paraguay's presidential poll: The first
civilian leader for almost 50 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARAGUAY remains Colorado country. Voters on Sunday elected Mr Juan Carlos
Wasmosy of the Colorado party for a five-year term as head of state.
Paraguay's first civilian president for almost 50 years will after all come
from the party of General Alfredo Stroessner, the dictator of 34 years
deposed in a 1989 coup.
Riven by dispute between those faithful to Gen Stroessner's legacy and its
more modern wing backing Mr Wasmosy, 55, the party never-theless managed to
mobilise enough support to secure victory thanks to the loyalty of voters in
the countryside.
The official Central Electoral Board projected yesterday that Mr Wasmosy
would win 40 per cent of the vote, Mr Domingo Laino, of the Authentic
Liberal Radical party (PLRA), would gain 33 per cent and Mr Guillermo
Caballero Vargas, of the pro-business Encuentro Nacional coalition, 22.8 per
cent.
Although the 200 international observers, led by former US president Jimmy
Carter, reported some electoral irregularities, they said these were not
systematic and did not affect the vote's outcome.
Mr Wasmosy - the name is Hungarian - is an engineer, cattle rancher and
cotton farmer. A member of the Colorado party for 20 years, he made his
fortune in part from sizeable contracts for the Paraguayan-Brazilian Itaipu
Dam. One of his tasks as president will be to renegotiate the deal with
Brazil on Itaipu, a Stroessner-sponsored project notorious for corruption.
Mr Wasmosy has the support of Gen Andres Rodriguez, who led the coup that
ousted Gen Stroessner, and the upper echelons of the army. His democratic
credentials have been marred by the way in which he achieved the
presidential nomination in the Colorado primary elections in December.
His victory over the pro-Stroessner candidate Mr Luis Maria Argana was,
according to the US National Democratic Institute for International Affairs,
won by 'questionable, if not outright fraudulent means'.
However it almost certainly averted a coup by army leaders who assisted in
toppling Gen Stroessner.
Mr Argana's campaign description of Mr Wasmosy as a closet liberal
underlined the relatively small policy differences among the three
presidential candidates.
Mr Wasmosy is expected to support market-oriented economic policies and
increase the economy's outward orientation. Mr Wasmosy, who takes over in
August, will not have things entirely his own way, however. The Colorados
will be the largest party but will not have a majority in either house of
congress, where the PLRA ran them a close second; support from other parties
will be needed to push through legislation.
After nearly half a century of military rule, the institutions of the
Colorado party, the army and the state are inextricably intertwined.
The military, however, may see the chief benefit of the victory of their
candidate as security for their budget, which accounts for a fifth of
government expenditure and is outside congressional or presidential
oversight.
The Rodriguez government has already embarked on a policy of privatisation.
British Aerospace, for example, is examining the possibility of acquiring
Lapsa, the state airline which leases some of the UK company's aircraft.
The military, which manages most important state industries, could provide
strong opposition to this policy.
However the army is increasingly subject to external constraints: senior
officers are now regularly attacked in the press and the opening of secret
police files has led to charges of human rights violations.
Whether these constraints will increase over the next five years or whether
the military will maintain its hold on the state is the key question of Mr
Wasmosy's term of office.

FT  11 MAY 93 / PLO scales down peace talks team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PALESTINE Liberation Organisation yesterday virtually suspended its role
in Middle East peace negotiations in Washington, protesting at what it
claimed were unfulfilled pledges by Israel.
In an apparent response to the tough Palestinian action Israel quickly
announced it would allow the immediate return home of 25 more of the 400
Palestinians it deported last December, in addition to the 101 whose return
was agreed in January.
A PLO spokesman in Tunis said the Palestinian negotiating team would be cut
from 14 members to three. It would also suspend the work of three
sub-committees. However, the PLO has carefully stopped short of withdrawing
from the peace process, launched in Madrid 18 months ago.
The Palestinian decision follows two weeks of growing frustration in
Washington and worsening violence in the occupied territories.
Members of the negotiating team were bitterly disappointed by a new Israeli
document tabled last Thursday on ideas for an interim self-governing
authority in the West bank and Gaza Strip. They said it was little different
from previous proposals, offered no real transfer of authority, and
contradicted the whole basis of the peace process.
The Palestinians say Israeli troops have killed at least 18 Palestinians
since the peace talks reconvened last month, while the economy is suffering
because workers are banned from crossing into Israel.
They also claim Israel has reneged on a promise to speed the return of the
Palestinians deported last December to southern Lebanon, and to improve
conditions in the occupied territories.
It seems unlikely that the small Israeli concession on deportees will be
enough to persuade the Palestinians to return a full complement to the
Middle East peace negotiations.
The Palestinians had already halted work on the sub-committee dealing with
human rights. Work has now also been stopped on committees on
self-government and the issues of land and water.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Clinton goes on tour to recapture lost elan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday set out to recapture some of the elan of
his election campaign last year, and to garner from voters in the Midwest
the support that has been eluding him in Washington.
Troubled by his fast fading approval ratings in opinion polls and by the
obstacles he has found in Washington to his legislative agenda, Mr Clinton
took his case to a more sympathetic audience at a shopping mall in
Cleveland, Ohio.
Mr Clinton, who last week tried to 'refocus' his administration by adjusting
the White House staff structure, mocked those who have criticised him for
trying to do too many things at once, asking for help in pushing his
economic proposals through Congress as a whole, instead of allowing interest
groups to whittle away at each component. 'We've got to do it as a package.
If everybody goes around saying what's in it for me instead of what's in it
for us, the thing will come apart,' he said.
By whipping up public enthusiasm for his programme, Mr Clinton could
strengthen his hand with his fellow Democrats in Congress, whose first flush
of party loyalty has disappeared as fast as the president's stock has
fallen.
Back in Washington, however, his critics complain that the two-day
Midwestern tour showed Mr Clinton turning his back on the unforgiving task
of governing in favour of the more congenial pastime of campaigning.
With foreign policy issues such as the Bosnian conflict looming intractably
but unavoidably on its agenda, the new administration has been haunted by Mr
Clinton's promise to focus 'like a laser beam' on the economy. His principal
success in this sphere, the swift passage of a framework budget, was quickly
overshadowed by his failure to push through a much smaller short-term
spending package.
Some administration officials and many Democratic leaders are now worried
that the ambitious reform of the healthcare system, which Mr Clinton plans
to launch next month, will overload a Congress already choking on the
details of a budget plan it has passed only in outline.
A centrepiece of the budget proposals, the energy tax, is being attacked by
everyone from aluminium producers to farmers.
Democratic officials are even more concerned, however, by the persistent
sniping of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, whose poll numbers have
been rising as Mr Clinton's have fallen.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL begins a new round of talks with its creditor banks today with both
sides apparently anxious to finalise a deal restructuring the country's
Dollars 44bn (Pounds 28.5bn) commercial debt, despite its failure to secure
an IMF accord.
The eagerness to move ahead with the deal regardless has been partly
prompted by Brazil's lack of progress with the IMF; Mr Eliseu Resende,
finance minister, was sent away empty-handed from negotiations two weeks
ago. IMF officials voiced concern at Brazil's frequent changes of finance
minister and the new economic plan, which focuses on growth rather than
combating inflation, running at nearly 30 per cent a month.
Brazil had been hoping for the IMF accord in order to obtain funds from
multilateral institutions to cover half the Dollars 3.2bn needed as
guarantees for new bonds to be issued under the debt agreement worked out
last July. However, in recent weeks the Brazilians have been sending strong
signals that they are willing to put up all the money for guarantees from
their reserves, now at a historic high of Dollars 23bn.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's foreign minister, was in Washington
yesterday to meet Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, to request
American support for the deal's conclusion.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Coal miners select targets
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Mine Workers of America yesterday announced selective strikes
against three US coal producers in an attempt to win job security rights in
a new national labour contract, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
The strikes target Amax Coal, the third largest coal producer in the US and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Amax, the aluminium manufacturer, and the
smaller Arch Mineral and Ziegler Coal. The union promised to broaden action
until coal operators responded to its demands.
UMWA coal miners have been working without a contract since May 3, when an
extension to their contract expired. At issue is the union's insistence that
new mines opened by members of the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association
should automatically be staffed by union labour.
While the selective strike hits just as the US enters its heaviest demand
period for electricity - the summer air-conditioning season - observers say
the stoppage will not have a noticeable impact for several months. 'Most
electric utilities have fair coal stockpiles, and the US coal supply is not
100 per cent union,' said Mr Ralph Barbaro, an energy analyst.
Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of Hanson of the UK, is not targeted. A
month-long strike there in February ended when the union and mine owners
agreed to the two-month contract extension with the BCOA which expired this
month.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Whale-watching nets big cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 4m people a year pay to lean over the rail of a boat and scan the
waters for Moby Dick, according to a UK government discussion paper.
The report estimates that whale-watching - one of the latest temptations for
tourists - is worth more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 190m) a year. It argues
that whale-watching could be worth much more than killing whales for meat.
The figures, prepared with environmental groups, have been published as part
of this week's fierce campaign by anti-whaling countries and environmental
groups to stop the IWC lifting its present ban on commercial whaling, as
Japan and Norway want.
The report says that in the early 1980s whale-watching, mainly confined to
North America, raised only about Dollars 4m a year. But since 1981 revenue
from the excursions - including whale-spotting from aircraft - has grown at
an average of 49 per cent a year.
North America has by far the greatest number of whale fans: the US collected
more than 60 per cent of the estimated Dollars 320m worldwide revenues in
1991.
Japan and Norway, which have observed the IWC ban since 1987, earned an
estimated Dollars 3.8m and Dollars 1.6m respectively. In Norway's last year
of commercial whaling its catch of 387 whales made the country only NKr13m
(Pounds 1.23m).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government will come under pressure to review its peacekeeping
operations in Cambodia in a special parliamentary session on Thursday,
called in response to the shock provoked by last week's killing of an
unarmed Japanese policeman.
The opposition parties plan to grill the ruling Liberal Democratic party
over whether the mounting violence violates terms of the Paris peace accord
under which Japanese peacekeepers were sent to help pave the way for
elections this month. One condition for sending unarmed police was that a
ceasefire should be in place.
The killing last week of Mr Haruyuki Takata in an ambush on UN vehicles was
blamed on guerrillas from the Khmer Rouge faction, which is boycotting the
elections.
The government appears determined to sit out what it regards as a war of
nerves in Cambodia, while pressing for improved security for Japanese
personnel, but the opposition parties are likely to press the government to
consider withdrawing peacekeepers if the situation deteriorates.
The damage this would inflict on Japan's aspirations to a wider world role
were pointed out by Mr Goh Chok Tong, the visiting Singaporean prime
minister, who warned a withdrawal would signal that Tokyo no longer wanted
to play an international role.
To underline its commitment to UN peacekeeping operations, the Japanese
government yesterday ordered 48 troops to join UN peacekeeping operations in
Mozambique.
The United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia agreed that 41
Japanese civilians being sent to monitor the elections should be sent to the
south, near where 600 Japanese military personnel are engaged in engineering
work.
However, Untac has insisted that the 75 unarmed Japanese police cannot be
withdrawn from their posts to Phnom Penh as this might put other
peacekeepers at risk.
Royalist Cambodian guerrillas and the Khmer Rouge, long-time allies in the
civil war, exchanged artillery fire over the weekend in the north-west, UN
officials said yesterday, Reuter adds from Phnom Penh. The fighting was
apparently prompted by the killing of the Japanese police officer in a zone
nominally controlled by the monarchists.

INDIA'S central bank governor has vowed for the first time to penalise banks
involved in the country's biggest financial scandal, but gave no hint on the
punishment he envisaged, Reuter reports from Bombay.
'We are going to fix responsibilities and award punishments and penalties,'
Mr Chakravarty Rangarajan, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, was quoted
as saying in the Economic Times published yesterday.
'For banks as institutions, the RBI will affix responsibilities, while for
individuals, it will be done together with the senior management of banks,'
Mr Rangarajan said.
The scandal involved banks and brokers alleged to have colluded to siphon
money from the interbank securities market to pump into the Bombay stock
market.
Bankers said the RBI could impose fines, hold up promotions of individuals
involved, or seek their dismissal or transfer. As an extreme step it could
withdraw a bank's licence to operate in a particular financial sphere.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Syria's economy shackled by old institutions: Government
contradictions are hampering booming private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPLOSION in the number of privately-owned imported minibuses taxiing the
streets of Damascus has solved the city's public transport shortage but is
causing a headache for town planners charged with reducing traffic
congestion.
Such is the price of Syria's drive towards economic liberalisation. While
the past two years have witnessed a boom in private sector investment,
fuelling impressive economic growth, contradictions remain in the
government's efforts to establish a more market-oriented economy.
There are no plans to sell off the large, overstaffed and inefficient public
institutions. Foreign businesses are still deterred by an unwieldy two-tier
foreign exchange rate, and political liberalisation remains firmly off the
agenda. The regime is still cautious about how far it can go towards a free
market.
Economic change began in the 1980s in the wake of a severe shortage of hard
currency, with the government eager to repatriate some of the many billions
of dollars estimated to be held by Syrians abroad. It was spurred by the
demise of communism in eastern Europe and, in particular, the break-up of
the Soviet Union, Syria's leading ally, and by aid from the Gulf states
grateful for President Hafez Assad's stance in the anti-Iraq coalition after
the invasion of Kuwait.
The government focused on the liberalisation of trade and promotion of the
private sector. With 1991's Investment Law Number 10, the cornerstone of
reform, investors were able to import equipment duty free, qualify for tax
concessions, and repatriate profits in hard currency.
Since then, the government's investment office, overseen by Mr Assad
himself, has agreed to 757 private-sector projects with a total capital of
SPounds 96bn (Pounds 2.87bn). As a result private sector export earnings
have shot up from SPounds 1.47bn in 1989 to SPounds 6.37bn in the first 10
months of last year.
This, combined with an increased production of hydrocarbons and a booming
agricultural sector, resulted in real gross domestic product growth of 7 per
cent last year. Agriculture last year accounted for 26.1 per cent of gross
domestic product. Crude oil production averages 570,000 barrels a day and
export earnings from petroleum and associated products was about Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.2bn) in 1992.
Imports have also risen sharply because of an easing of trade restrictions.
Shops are now filled with a diverse range of goods, many not available
before Law Number 10, and there has been a marked increase in imported cars
and agricultural machinery. According to preliminary figures from the
Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, Syria's import bill last year rose by
28 per cent to SPounds 36bn compared to exports of SPounds 38bn
The government's growing confidence in the economy is demonstrated by the
1993 budget, approved by parliament last week, which allocates a 24 per cent
increase in projected spending to SPounds 123bn.
Despite the success of reforms so far, sources of investment have remained
limited to mainly Syrian, Gulf, Lebanese and Jordanian interests. Most
western companies are cautious of the remaining hangovers of a command
economy and Syria's outmoded infrastructure.
Daily power cuts and unreliable international telephone lines do little to
boost foreign confidence, although a regional electricity grid with Egypt,
Jordan and Turkey is planned for 1997 and Siemens of Germany this month
began the installation of 700,000 telephone lines.
The main deterrent to foreign investment, however, is the unwieldly foreign
exchange controls, with two exchange rates and severe prison penalties for
violations of these controls.
Mr Khalid al-Mahayni, Syria's finance minister, says the government is
committed to unifying the rates, but 'gradually, so as to avoid social
difficulties'. Hydrocarbon sales and custom tariffs are calculated according
to the official rate of SPounds 11.2 to the dollar, whereas 'all private
sector exports are treated by the exchange rate in neighbouring countries',
which closely shadows the free market rate of SPounds 43 to the dollar.
In the 1993 budget, private investment projects were calculated for the
first time at the exchange rate of neighbouring countries as a step towards
free market competition in the region.
Other planned reforms include new state-owned specialised banks for
investors and exporters, and a Damascus stock exchange. Syrian entrepreneurs
are unlikely, however, to be buying shares in privatised state assets.
Mr Mohammad al-Imadi, minister for economy and foreign trade and one of the
chief reformers of Syria's economy, says public institutions will be
reformed rather than privatised. 'We believe in the public sector. It plays
an important role in our infrastructure. The idea of our economic reform is
not to transfer ownership, it is to add to what we already have,' he says.
Reform of the public sector entails the promotion of export activities and
access to hard currency banking facilities rather than redundancies and
cost-cutting structural changes which would be strongly opposed by the
establishment.
Mr Imadi acknowledges that successful private investors will eventually seek
a political voice, but while Mr Assad remains in power such a scenario is
improbable.
Despite speculation that he suffered further heart problems earlier this
year, officials and diplomats in Damascus maintain that he is in good
health.
Although Syria has the potential to establish a successful mixed economy, a
free market will depend on the outlook of his successor.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KYRGYZSTAN replaced the rouble with its own currency yesterday, but people
in the Central Asian nation viewed the brightly-coloured banknotes with
distrust, Reuter reports from Bishkek.
The launch of the 'som' is aimed at strengthening Kyrgyzstan's economic
independence from Russia and shielding it from the rampant inflation
afflicting virtually all former Soviet republics.
However, bank managers and employees in the capital Bishkek said that demand
for the new currency was poor.
'Only a stupid fool would buy som,' said one owner of a private retail
outlet in Bishkek.
'Who will have confidence in it? There is nothing to ensure its value.'
State-owned shops were ordered to accept the new money at the official offer

FT  11 MAY 93 / Fiat board meets to take ethics into account: A company
scarred by Italy's widening corruption scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE meeting today of the board of directors of Fiat, Italy's biggest private
company, will be a more sombre occasion than that originally called to
approve last year's accounts.
The gathering has been overtaken by Italy's widening political corruption
scandal, in which Fiat has been pitched into the front line.
Almost a dozen executives have been arrested, interrogated or briefly
detained by magistrates investigating alleged kickbacks on public-sector
contracts or bribes to politicians or political parties.
The board has been summoned to approve a new code of business ethics, drawn
up by lawyers. Incorporating an existing document on internal issues, such
as conflicts of interest and insider trading, the code, modelled on similar
practice at IBM and General Electric, will guide Fiat managers when dealing
with bribery and corruption.
The magistrates' inquiries have moved steadily up the group's management
ladder to embrace, most recently, two of its three top executives, excluding
members of the controlling Agnelli family. Earlier this year, Mr Francesco
Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, spent 28 days in Milan's San
Vittore prison before being transferred to house arrest. Last month,
magistrates issued a cautionary warrant against Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, its
chief operating officer. Mr Garuzzo was placed under house arrest.
Other executives arrested or questioned by magistrates include Mr Antonio
Mosconi, managing director of Fiat's Toro insurance company, Mr Riccardo
Ruggeri, managing director of its New Holland farm and earth-moving
equipment business and Mr Paolo Torricelli, head of the Fiat Avio gas
turbines subsidiary. The last two are back at work.
The arrests reflect the main strands uncovered so far in the investigations.
Mr Garuzzo and Mr Ruggeri were formerly chief executive and head of the bus
division of Fiat's Iveco commercial vehicles subsidiary respectively. Iveco
has been implicated in alleged kickbacks on bus sales to Milan.
Mr Massimo Aimetti, Iveco's finance director, is also under house arrest in
Turin.
Construction is the second sector in which Fiat has been implicated. Apart
from Mr Mattioli, chairman of the group's Cogefar-Impresit building unit,
other executives interrogated include Mr Mosconi, who was managing director
of the Fiat-Impresit building unit, and Mr Enzo Papi, a former senior
manager in the group.
Fiat has also been embroiled in allegations of kickbacks on contracts from
Enel, the state electricity generating authority. The allegations have
resulted in the issue of cautionary warrants against Mr Torricelli, now back
at work, and Mr Mauro Bertini, head of Fiat Avio's gas turbines division,
who is under house arrest.
The group has also been investigated for alleged kickbacks paid by its
Savigliano railway equipment division. The inquiries resulted in the brief
incarceration of its head, Mr Giancarlo Cozza, now back at work.
The string of arrests, most of them in the past two months, triggered Fiat's
more co-operative approach towards the investigations. Last month, its
lawyers contacted Milan magistrates, proposing that Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's
chief executive, should volunteer to answer questions.
Though the magistrates denied they had done a deal with Fiat, the company's
initiative has led to a temporary halt in arrests and a relatively soft
reception for executives to whom cautionary warrants have been issued and
who have returned from abroad.
So far, Mr Romiti has appeared twice before the magistrates. On the last
occasion, he delivered a 20-page document, and six pages of appendices,
outlining political corruption. Other Fiat managers have since supplied
information. Mr Romiti also used the occasion to exhort other businessmen to
adopt a similar approach.
The change of heart has visibly eased tension between magistrates and the
company. It has also lifted the mood within Fiat itself.
However, last weekend, matters took a potential turn for the worse. In one
of the press leaks endemic in the investigations, Panorama, a weekly news
magazine, published extracts from Mr Mosconi's testimony. The report alleges
that Mr Romiti knew of the existence of foreign bank accounts in the
mid-1980s, long before previously indicated.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Ciampi set to clear second hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi looked set yesterday for a
comfortable victory in a vote of confidence in the senate, the upper house
of parliament, which is scheduled for later this week, writes Haig Simonian.
The debate marked his second parliamentary test within a week after last
Friday's successful vote of confidence in the chamber of deputies. It
coincided with a sharp rise in the value of the lira, reflecting increasing
support for the new government.
The currency was quoted at L916.88 against the D-Mark, its highest level
since early January. It started gathering strength last week as dealers
regained confidence in Mr Ciampi's government after a shaky start when four
cabinet ministers resigned within hours of taking office.
The upturn came as Mr Antonio Fazio, Mr Ciampi's successor as governor of
the Bank of Italy, told fellow central bankers in Basle that a recovery in
the Italian economy could not come through lower interest rates alone.

THE PROSPECT of serious industrial unrest in Sweden receded yesterday after
engineering unions accepted a 3 per cent wage rise over two years.
The pact averted an overtime ban affecting 400,000 workers, due to start
yesterday, and is expected to be a benchmark for wage talks in other sectors
of the recession-hit economy.
'This means there will probably not be a general strike or large industrial
conflict this year,' said Mr Mats Erikson, a spokesman for the LO blue
collar trade union confederation. Many of Sweden's big multinationals
welcomed the break-through and bond prices reacted positively.
However, disputes affecting Sweden's electrical and food processing
industries remain unresolved.

EC foreign ministers yesterday gave a broadly warm welcome to European
Commission proposals to accelerate the political and economic integration of
six former communist east European countries into the European Community.
France called for a study on how the Commission's bolder-than-expected plan
to liberalise trade with eastern Europe will affect EC member states, and
others said they needed more information before tendering their support.
Britain, Denmark and Germany signalled strong backing, with the UK
indicating it would like to see even more efforts to dismantle trade
barriers. Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, wants to make trade
liberalisation with eastern Europe a centrepiece of the EC summit in
Copenhagen next month.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Danes given tax incentive to vote Yes
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Danish government is putting the finishing touches to a tax reform
proposal which it will put forward later this month if the voters approve
the Maastricht treaty and Denmark's opt-outs deal in next Tuesday's
referendum.
The income tax reform is expected to provide for substantial reductions in
marginal income tax rates, especially for middle-income groups.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic prime minister, who heads a
four-party majority coalition government, is telling the voters that if
there is a Yes in next week's plebiscite, the second referendum on closer
European union, the government will devote its energies to bringing down
unemployment, currently running at 12 per cent.
The government's appeal to economic interest appears to have struck a chord
with the voters.
A poll in the business newspaper, Boersen, yesterday found that 40 per cent
of those planning to vote Yes next week said they would do so because it
would improve economic conditions. As Tuesday's vote approaches, the
substantial majority for the pro-Maastricht side earlier in the year has
begun to slip.
A weekend poll gave a breakdown among those who have decided how to vote of
57.5 per cent in favour to 42.5 per cent against, while a few weeks ago the
breakdown was 65-45 in favour.
The anti-Maastricht movements have taken heart from comments by Mr Martin
Bangemann, the EC commissioner for industry, to the effect that the
Maastricht treaty could be used to forge a federal Europe.
Ms Drude Dahlerup, a prominent figure in the left-wing-dominated
anti-Maastricht June Movement, said she was convinced Mr Bangemann's
statement in the Wall Street Journal would boost the No vote. 'It will help
people to see that the politicians are out to cheat them,' she said.
Denmark's four opt-outs - on defence, the common currency, supra-national
legal and police co-operation, and union citizenship - were specifically
designed to meet the electorate's fears that the country would lose its
independence and identity by implementing the Maastricht treaty.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's giant engineering union, yesterday started balloting
75,000 metal and electrical employees from Berlin-Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt
and Thuringia on whether they want to join 37,000 metal and steel workers
who have been on strike for just over a week. The results are expected
tomorrow.
It will also ask its members in western Germany to demonstrate tomorrow in
support of higher wages for their eastern counterparts. The demonstrations,
intended to convey a token sense of national solidarity, will take place at
lunchtime, not during work hours.
Union officials said they would continue the strategy of targeting more
enterprises each day as a means of keeping up the pressure on the employers
to reinstate a contract signed with the union in March 1991.
The contract aimed at equalising west and east German wages by next year,
which would have meant a 26 per cent pay increase this year for the metal
and electrical sector, and 21 per cent for the ailing eastern German steel
industry. The employers cancelled the contract because of the economic
deterioration in the two parts of Germany.
However, Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, was
optimistic yesterday that the strike would end 'by the end of this week'. It
indicated that both sides were using talks which resume tomorrow in the
Saxon capital of Dresden as a negotiating framework through which the strike
could end without either side losing too much face.
As it stands, IG Metall is prepared to put back the timetable towards income
parity, but wants to retain the principle of the original contract,
particularly this year's pay rises.
IG Metall might also be prepared to forgo special Christmas bonuses and
extra pay linked to productivity, in return for a guaranteed increase in the
basic wage. That would mean about 18 per cent for the metal and electrical
industry in the east.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Spain's election campaign turns to row over KIO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE last year of the Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) investment in Spain
by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) has taken centre stage in Spanish
politics ahead of next month's election. The opposition is calling for legal
action against the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, and members of the
government for failing to supervise Kuwaiti activities in Spain.
The issue threatens to reignite a row over Madrid's responsibility in the
collapse of the KIO's Spanish empire, which may yet destroy the country's
biggest fertiliser, chemicals and foods companies, with a potential loss of
30,000 jobs.
Unions and opposition politicians said last year that the government had
been negligent in allowing the Kuwaiti government's foreign investment arm
into Spain without scrutinising each of its investment proposals in cabinet
first.
The government has replied that it did not know that the companies through
which the KIO was investing in Spain were controlled by the state of Kuwait.
But according to a report published yesterday by the conservative opposition
People's Party (PP), which some opinion polls put slightly ahead of Mr
Gonzalez's Socialists, the government has been lying.
'The KIO is and always has been a part of the State of Kuwait,' said Mr
Francisco Alvarez-Cascos, secretary general of the PP.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, said earlier this year he had
always thought the KIO investments were private. Under Spanish law,
investments by a sovereign state require cabinet scrutiny and approval.
In the case of the KIO, the Kuwaitis moved billions of dollars in profit and
investment into and out of Spain between 1986 and 1992, it seems, without
the Spanish cabinet ever once asking to see one piece of paper.
Yesterday Mr Alvarez-Cascos produced a letter, written in June 1988 by Mr
Manuel Conthe, then director general of external transactions in the Finance
Ministry and since promoted to head of the Spanish Treasury, which strongly
contradicts the government's current position on the KIO.

FT  11 MAY 93 / UK comes close to wide-screen TV pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday came closer than ever to agreeing a European strategy for
developing advanced cinema-quality television, but blocked a deal after a
funding dispute.
EC ministers will discuss the issue again on June 16. Failure to agree then
could kill the Commission's seven-year-old ambition to back European
advanced television against US and Japanese competition.
Over the past 18 months, Britain has argued for changes in Commission plans
to kick-start the EC market for wide-screen television, and constantly
sought justification for proposed spending. It agreed yesterday that a
Danish compromise met many objections.
Brussels will thus start work on amending earlier legislation in line with
the proposed new strategy. It will also begin examining how to develop
European digital high-definition television, the technology Britain believes
will supersede EC-backed standards.
Mr Edward Leigh, British industry minister, indicated earlier that the UK
would oppose any funding plan which cost the EC more than Ecu150m (Pounds
118m) between now and the end of 1996. The other countries said they could
only agree to Ecu285m, against the Ecu850m first proposed by Brussels last
year. All but the Netherlands said they could even accept an Ecu226m plan.
Under the plan backed by 11 member states, the Community would put up
Ecu200m to develop programmes in the new wide-screen format, conditional on
equal industry funding. A further Ecu85m (to be boosted by Ecu21m of
industry funding) would be held in reserve for projects submitted later by
countries with less developed audiovisual sectors.

A CEASEFIRE was due to come into effect in the Bosnian city of Mostar last
night after a second consecutive day of Bosnian Croat attacks on Moslem-led
government troops, as Sarajevo radio accused the Bosnian Croats of blatant
'ethnic cleansing' of the city.
United Nations officials said there were fears for the safety of Moslem
civilians, who they said had been taken out of the town in buses after being
held in the town football stadium.
Moslem-controlled radio claimed yesterday evening that fighting was
continuing in the city. Croatian radio reported units of the Croatian
Defense Council (HVO) taking control of part of it.
Earlier in the day television pictures showed columns of smoke rising from
Mostar, already heavily damaged last year in attacks by the Serb-dominated
Yugoslav army. It also showed hundreds of Moslems apparently being marched
out of the city by HVO troops.
A UN statement said Bosnian Croat troops escorted 10 busloads of civilians,
including women and children, out of Mostar. The renewed fighting has
blocked a key humanitarian aid route to central Bosnia.
Unconfirmed reports yesterday said dozens of people had been killed and
wounded. Croatian radio said seven Croat fighters and one civilian had been
killed in fighting on Sunday.
A local priest appealed to all hospitals, which were under HVO control, to
treat the wounded equally.
Croatia condemned the newest outbreak of fighting between the one-time
allies, although Sarajevo radio claimed that regular units of the Croatian
Army were backing the HVO assault.
The fighting appeared to be an attempt by the Croats to exert full control
over the Mostar region, which has been designated as Croat under the
Vance-Owen peace plan.
Elsewhere, UN observers reached the eastern town of Zepa which is besieged
by Serbian forces.
They said that thousands of Moslems had fled the enclave and that only 50
people out of an estimated 30,000 remained in the town.
UN Protection Force spokesman Commander Barry Frewer, giving details of what
the observers had found, said: 'The township itself is almost deserted. The
majority of the houses have been badly damaged. 'There has been heavy
fighting, heavy shelling, people have fled into the hills,' he added.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Confusion over Belgrade border ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN Serb leaders yesterday accused their former Belgrade patrons of
barring them from leaving their self-styled state.
In often conflicting statements, officials of the self-proclaimed Serb
state, which covers some 70 per cent of Bosnia, said Serbian police had
refused to allow them to cross the frontier. The ban, if confirmed, would
signal another move by the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, to
punish the Bosnian Serbs for refusing last week to toe the Belgrade line and
support an international peace plan.
Just hours after they rejected the plan, Serbia announced it was cutting off
all supplies, except for food and medicine to Bosnia. Serb-held parts of
Bosnia, devastated by war, depend almost entirely on Belgrade.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said: 'We are just sad. We
know they are squeezed and blackmailed.' Mr Dragisa Jokic, his aide,
speaking from Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold, said: 'The president did
not even try to cross the border. But we received notice from the police
that our ministers were banned from crossing.'
But an official of the Yugoslav Interior Ministry denied the ban, reported
Tanjug, the Belgrade news agency. Even an aide of Mrs Biljana Plavsic, a
hardline member of the leadership, who first claimed to have been blocked at
the border, said: 'It is just confusion.'
Mrs Plavsic, who at Pale publicly snubbed Mr Milosevic by refusing to shake
his hand, said border police had handed her a notice which said officials
were not allowed in.
'They said they were sorry, but they could not let me cross into Yugoslav
territory,' Tanjug reported Mrs Plavsic as saying.
Mrs Plavsic managed to cross but did not reveal how she reached Serbia.

FT  11 MAY 93 / Balladur lightens welfare load on payrolls: Proposals to
ease social security pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday took a couple of steps towards
financing more of the French welfare state out of general taxation and less
out of the payroll contributions that help generate France's chronically
high unemployment
His two main proposals here are an increase from 1.1 to 2.4 per cent in the
so-called generalised social contribution (CSG) - a kind of income tax whose
proceeds go to funding social security - and a shift in some of the 'social'
payroll contributions, which employers have to make for lower-paid workers,
to the charge of the state. This shift will only involve some FFr4.5bn
(Pounds 535m) this year but eventually Mr Balladur hopes to transfer the
cost of all family allowances, running at nearly FFr200bn a year, off the
backs of employers and onto the state budget.
The problem which Mr Balladur is tackling is that France puts more of the
burden of its welfare system on its active workforce than any other EC
country. Social security contributions by employers/employees accounted for
44.2 per cent of tax receipts in France in 1990, compared with a Community
average of 28.4 per cent, 17.5 per cent in Britain and only 3.1 per cent in
Denmark (which has the opposite bias, loading virtually all welfare costs
onto general taxation).
This has given French employers a particular financial incentive to shed
labour, so that more than 3m are now out of a job. The more people drop out
of the active workforce, the fewer are left to finance the welfare system on
which correspondingly greater demands are made in a time of high
unemployment (hence, the deficits shown in the accompanying table).
But Mr Balladur's reforms do not go very far, though he has proposed setting
up a 'solidarity fund' to cover the accumulated social security debt, which
a government-ordered audit last week forecast - without yesterday's
corrective measures - would rise to nearly FFr135bn by the end of this year.
Increasing the CSG is a very useful of righting the imbalance in welfare
funding. It bears not only on salaries, but also on unearned income such as
dividends, and is therefore more 'progressive' than social security
contributions. But it was introduced in 1990 by the Socialists, and as such
is strongly disliked by Mr Balladur's conservative coalition.
As a sop to his supporters, Mr Balladur is proposing that the extra 1.3 per
cent in CSG payments should be deductible from individuals' income tax.
This will only add to the many deductions which taxpayers can take.
According to Banque Indosuez, only half of households pay income tax at all,
compared with three quarters in most other industrialised countries. For
those who do pay something to the fisc (tax office), deductions allow them
to take an average of half their disposable income out of their taxable
income. Mr Balladur was responsible for narrowing the income tax base when
he was finance minister in 1986-88. Now heading a government which promised
to put more into people's pockets than it takes out, he did nothing
yesterday to remedy his earlier acts. But he is looking to Mrs Simone Veil,
the ministerial overlord for social services, to find FFr30bn savings up to
the end of 1994 in the health system, Europe's most generous. According to
OECD figures, France spends an average FFr10,000 keeping each citizen
healthy.
Mr Balladur is proposing that the French should work a bit longer for a
slightly less generous pension. At present, they qualify for a full pension
after 37.5 years of work; this threshold would be raised gradually to 40
years. At the moment, pension levels are based on the average of a workers'
10 best-paid years; the level will now be calculated over a 25-year period.
But France still faces the problem that, along only with Italy inside the
EC, its pension system is still run hand-to-mouth, with contributions coming
in from the employed forming the sole source of money being paid out. Unlike
the other 10 EC states, France does not yet have private pensions funds,
invested in the stock market and providing a supplement to the state scheme.
