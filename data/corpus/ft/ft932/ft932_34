FT  04 MAY 93 / Upturn that can spell business ruin: An end to recession may
be a poisoned chalice for small and medium-sized companies. Charles
Batchelor assesses their chances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR

<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC upturn is likely to prove a mixed blessing. For many businesses
an increase in orders will be a welcome relief but for a significant
minority it will be the final strain on recession-stretched finances.
Mr Philip Mellor, marketing manager of business information group Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, said: 'With competition as tough and margins as tight as ever,
taking on that extra person or buying that extra piece of machinery to meet
a new order may be enough to put a company under.'
Pinpointing those companies most likely to succumb to the upturn is
difficult. Ultimately survival hinges on how well the business is managed.
But it is possible to sketch an outline of vulnerable businesses.
One at risk is a small company in construction or manufacturing with a high
borrowing level, and based in the south. The dangers attached to this
profile will be reduced if the management has a good relationship with its
bank and if it takes on only those orders which it can finance from
prompt-paying customers.
The smaller and younger the company the greater the risk of failure. New
businesses lack the managerial experience and financial resources available
to more established counterparts. One in three new companies closes in its
first three years, regardless of the economy.
Ms Barbara Bennett, corporate affairs manager at Trade Indemnity, a credit
insurance company, said: 'Smaller companies have little muscle to ensure
they get paid on time and are particularly vul-nerable to the one large
debt.'
Small sub-contractors in the construction sector, where slow payment from
main contractors is widespread, are at particular risk. But sub-contractors
in other sectors such as engineering, where there may be extended payment
chains down from the final customer, are also exposed.
Mr Robert Drummond, chairman of the British Venture Capital Association and
managing director of Grosvenor Venture Managers, said: 'Companies which
effectively act as bankers, giving credit to their customers but taking
little from their suppliers, will be most at risk.'
Manufacturing has a greater need for finance than the service sector.
'Anyone with a long production process, where the balance sheet is full of
working capital will suffer,' noted Mr Drummond.
The most recent business survey by the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce highlights the dangers. On balance 17 per cent of manufacturers
employing fewer than 20 people reported a worsening cashflow in the last
quarter of last year compared with just 4 per cent of service companies.
Larger companies all reported improved cashflows.
Worryingly, small manufacturers had the most ambitious investment plans. On
balance 14 per cent planned investments in plant and machinery while only 3
per cent of large companies, employing more than 500 people, planned similar
investments. Ms Fiona Johnson, economic adviser to the chambers, said: 'It
is the small-firms sector which tends to lead the economy out of the
recession.'
Another sector which may be at risk is stockists and merchants who do not
add much value to their supplies. Steel stockholders and timber and paper
merchants may make a profit on current stocks but new supplies will have to
be bought in. Sterling's devaluation will raise the cost of imports and
increase financing requirements, Ms Bennett said.
Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, said good
relations with a bank were essential in an upturn: 'Small businesses will
come out of the recession with their assets worth less and no profits . . .
They must have a good deal with the bank, making clear what they want and
providing the bank manager with the information he needs.'
Businesses which plan ahead will be the most likely to win their bank
manager's support. A survey for Barclays Bank showed service companies
tended to plan more than manufacturers, while companies in the north were
more convinced of the value of planning than those in the south.
But regardless of sector, size or location, survival through the upturn will
depend on companies not getting carried away by new orders.
Mr Mike Davis, managing director of Barclays Commercial Services, said: 'We
have seen companies which have been so relieved to get an order that they
forget the fundamental disciplines about making sure they get paid.'

FT  04 MAY 93 / Banks remain the key to staying afloat: An end to recession
may be a poisoned chalice for small and medium-sized companies. Charles
Batchelor assesses their chances

THE BANKS, as ever, hold the key to the survival of small and medium-sized
businesses.
Larger companies have access to the stock market and the international
capital markets, but smaller companies are disproportionately dependent on
borrowings and retained profits.
The banks have an estimated Pounds 40bn on loan to business and, having
taken losses on their small-business books, have tightened lending criteria.
Sir Peter Middleton, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, warned last week that
borrowing costs could rise for businesses both large and small. But the
banks say there will not be a shortage of funds.
Mr Mike Shaw, head of business services at Lloyds Bank, said: 'We don't have
a problem with the availability of funds and could double our lending if the
right proposals came along.' Mr David Laverack, head of small-business
services at Barclays, said: 'We have significant capacity to lend.'
National Westminster, the largest lender to small businesses, stressed that
access to finance ranked only eighth in the table of concerns in the recent
NatWest-Small Business Research Trust survey.
Mr Terry Bryant, deputy head of small-business services at the bank, said:
'There is less of an appetite for borrowings and the indications are that
people prefer to use their own savings.'
Businesses are having to put together more convincing business plans to
obtain bank finance. The banks have also shifted the emphasis of lending
decisions from a reliance on security to prospective performance.
There are some signs that the banks are more willing to provide equity
finance alongside loans.
Mr Michael Pearse, chief executive of Midland, urged recently that banks
should be more ready to swap debt into equity - not as a last resort but
also to help sound businesses put their finances on a more balanced basis.
In 1982-84, when Britain last came out of recession, the venture capital
industry was very small and still dominated by one large operator - 3i. Now
it numbers between 100 and 120 venture funds which invested Pounds 1.4bn
last year.
Worryingly, though, the venture capital industry is concerned about the
availability of finance. Independent venture capital concerns, which account
for just less than half of all the sector's investments, raised only Pounds
300m from institutional investors last year - the third successive annual
decline. Mr Robert Drummond, chairman of the British Venture Capital
Association, said: 'I did think we might run into a shortage of finance in
the late 1990s but the industry is using up its cash faster than I
anticipated and we could face a squeeze in the next 12 to 18 months.'
The factoring industry appears to face no such financing constraints. It too
expanded rapidly in the late 1980s and overcame much of the prejudice - that
it was last-resort finance for businesses in trouble - which dogged its
early days. It provided more than Pounds 1.3bn to more than 9,000 companies
last year.
Mr Malcolm Smith, managing director of Alex Lawrie, one of Lloyds Bank's two
factoring subsidiaries, said: 'There is no problem from the funding point of
view.'
Mr Mike Davis, managing director of Barclays Commercial Services, the bank's
factoring subsidiary, said: 'Companies which come through the recession with
weakened balance sheets will not be able to go to sources of conventional
(bank) finance. This is an opportunity for us to provide finance until the
customer's balance sheet is strong enough for it to go back to the bank.'

FT  04 MAY 93 / Cash shortage proves too tough for Midlands leather company:
An end to recession may be a poisoned chalice for small and medium-sized
companies. Charles Batchelor assesses their chances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR

WITHIN a few hours of the liquidator arriving at Ms Jennifer Bond's*
Leicestershire leather-processing business last Wednesday a Pounds 65,000
order arrived.
The order, for the tanning and dyeing of about 50,000 feet of leather, would
have kept the factory busy for more than a month.
But chronic underfunding had already brought about the demise of the
five-year-old business, and on May 11 a meeting of creditors is expected to
put it into voluntary liquidation. Ms Bond said: 'The recession has passed
but we can't finance the orders we are getting.'
Ironically the company's fate was sealed by its efforts to expand the
business.
It increased turnover from Pounds 300,000 in 1991 to Pounds 500,000 last
year by switching from the cheaper leathers and varied colours used in
women's shoes to better-quality leather for men's shoes, most of which are
dyed black.
The improvement in business increased the company's need for working capital
and put further pressure on its already overstretched finances. 'We were
very successful in opening up new markets but we didn't have the money to go
on,' said Ms Bond. 'We couldn't afford to buy in the chemicals or the other
raw materials.'
The problem of how to finance growth will be one confronting many businesses
if the economy continues to strengthen.
Managements must become adept at juggling their finances to avoid a cash
shortage. They have to get customers to make payments early, suppliers to
extend their payment terms and the bank manager to maintain, and where
possible, to increase the financial facility.
Ms Bond's company had barely established itself when the recession began to
bite and it lost money in 1991 and last year. She fell out with the bank
which had funded the business in its early stages and switched to one of the
big four clearers, which agreed to refinance the business provided it
factored its invoices.
Ms Bond has nothing but praise for the bank but says that she had problems
with its factoring arm. The financial squeeze tightened but after an
accountant's review, paid for by the bank, the bank manager agreed to put in
more money provided the shareholders also injected more capital.
While these agreements were negotiated the company could not order hides
from its overseas suppliers. For a while it was dependent on processing
other people's leather, a less profitable activity.
The company was unable to return to profit and finally Ms Bond decided to
call in the liquidator.
'They were underfinanced almost from the beginning,' said Mr John Talbot,
insolvency manager at the Leicester office of accountants Ernst &amp; Young,
which is handling the liquidation. 'The bank facility they had was used to
buy plant and machinery instead of being used for working capital. They have
picked up some orders but because they were underfunded they could not buy
the materials to work the leather.'
There are so few assets in the business that the bank waived its right to
appoint a receiver and has agreed to the shareholders' request to put the
company straight into liquidation.
If the creditors approve on May 11, the liquidator will sell off the plant
and equipment, the remains of the lease on the factory and any other assets
he can find.
Ms Bond, in spite of her disappointment at the loss of the business and
concern at the personal liability she may still face when the business is
liquidated, is relieved that it is all over. 'I feel better,' she said,
after her first meeting with the liquidator. 'It has been two years of 'ifs
and buts'.'

FT  04 MAY 93 / Claim on wages attacked: Government accused of exaggerating
savings to German businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH government advertisements in the German press aimed at enticing
businesses to move to Britain exaggerate the savings in labour costs, says a
study published today by the independent research group Incomes Data
Services.
A recent advertisement in Handelsblatt, the German business daily, said that
in Britain 'wages and social charges are significantly lower . . . the
labour costs index for Britain is 100 compared to 178 for Germany'.
The advertisement invited companies to 'find out more about how your firm
can profit from making Great Britain your place of business' by contacting
the British consulate in Dusseldorf.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has in recent months been promoting
Britain's attractions to foreign investors. In particular he applauded a
controversial plan by Hoover to move vacuum cleaner production from Dijon in
France to Cambuslang near Glasgow. The plan enraged the French authorities
and is being re-examined by Hoover as part of a cost-cutting programme.
IDS said the British government's claim in the German advertisement might
'fuel concern in other European countries about social dumping - the idea
that businesses will move to low-cost countries and thereby depress wages
and conditions of employment throughout the Community'.
IDS's study of official figures on comparative European manufacturing labour
costs indicates that German costs were likely to be about 33 per cent higher
than in Britain, rather than 78 per cent.
There were wide variations depending on the sector and size of company.
Britain had low costs in aerospace while labour costs were closer to those
of other European countries for vehicle production in companies of more than
1,000 employees, IDS said.
The figures also showed that Britain's main cost advantages in the EC came
from relatively low national insurance and pension contributions. In 1988,
however, when the last full EC comparative survey was carried out, nearly
half of British occupational pension schemes were taking a total or partial
contribution holiday. Taking this into account could add 4 per cent to 5 per
cent to the underlying non-wage costs in Britain, IDS said.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, told the French employers
federation in Paris that the 'real danger facing Europe is not one in which
jobs move within the Community, but one in which they are increasingly
moving out of the Community altogether'. She warned against the introduction
of 'extra layers of social protection'.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Engineers fear body blow from steel prices: EC ministers
will hear angry voices from the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL AND medium-sized British engineering companies are becoming
increasingly worried that an increase in steel prices of as much as 40 per
cent this year could endanger or postpone their recovery from the recession.
As European Community ministers meet in Brussels today to study the next
steps in the restructuring plan for the EC steel industry, angry UK steel
users are complaining that price increases are having damaging knock-on
effects for UK manufacturing. They say that the rises threaten to stoke up
inflation and hasten the return of a 'boom and bust' economy.
In particular, small companies are worried about being squeezed between
large steel suppliers and powerful end-users of their products - such as
vehicle makers or retailers - who refuse to accept any price increase.
This sentiment was supported by Mr Ray Gore, group purchasing director at
Wells-based Clares Equipment, which makes trolleys and shelves for
supermarkets.
Mr Norman Gledhill, executive director of the Mechanical and Metal Trades
Confederation (Metcom), said that price increases in basic raw materials
such as the latest steel price rises 'do very little to help the
competitiveness of British engineering in the attack on valuable export
markets.'
But the steel industry has strongly defended the price rises. British Steel
pointed out that the increases had not fully recouped - even in nominal
terms - the reductions in prices suffered by producers since 1990.
British Steel said prices for strip products had fallen by as much as 35 per
cent until the start of the recent round of increases. Implementation of a 9
per cent increase on July 4 will bring the increase since then to 19 per
cent.
Smaller steel users say their own big customers benefited most from the
price reductions of 1990-1992. They are now blocking attempts by suppliers
to pass the increases on - in fear of damaging their own fragile prospects
of recovery.
Mr Terry Barnes, managing director of Deeside-based Dixon-Bate, has written
to the prime minister about the steel price rises.
Dixon-Bate, which makes towing equipment, buys about five tonnes a month of
flat steel and sections from a stockholder which itself is supplied by
Allied Steel &amp; Wire in Cardiff.
Mr Barnes says he has had to weather four price increases, totalling 40 per
cent, so far this year. 'I've only been able to pass on a price increase of
about 2 per cent,' he said.
Dixon-Bate is considering buying East European steel instead, and Mr Barnes
has told ASW that a 40 per cent price increase will kill UK demand.
In reply ASW has told Mr Barnes that it is highly likely that selling prices
for its steel sections will be less this year than they were in 1990 and
little more than 5 per cent higher than they were in 1985.
The price rises are also hitting medium-sized companies. Mr James Watson,
managing director of South Yorkshire-based Coltran Products, has had to
accept a 6 per cent - or Pounds 22 a tonne - increase in the price of mild
steel rod it buys from a number of stockists which are supplied by British
Steel.
Coltran is the UK's largest manufacturer of laundry airers and buys
1,200-1,400 tonnes of steel a year. Mr Watson said he did not expect to be
able to pass the increase on to his customers, which include big retailers,
and it would be difficult to recoup the increases from any further internal
productivity improvements.
'We've moved towards becoming the low-cost producer, and we've taken market
share from competitors. But, coming out of the recession there are two
things that matter: cashflow, and having the funds to invest,' he said.
Further steel price rises are considered likely in the autumn but the
European steel industry is adamant that it needs the increases to recoup the
heavy losses of the past two years. The rises follow production cuts of 15
per cent to 20 per cent across Europe in the final quarter of last year.
Price increases have also been fuelled by strong demand from China.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Smaller companies lead recovery
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL manufacturing companies are leading the economy out of recession with
the first improvement in output for three years, the Confederation of
British Industry's Smaller Firms' Trends Survey published today shows.
On balance, manufacturers reporting an increase in output in the four months
to April outnumbered those reporting a decline by 4 percentage points. This
increase was lower than had been expected in January but contrasted with the
manufacturing sector as a whole, which recorded output broadly unchanged,
the CBI said.
Business optimism also rose by a balance of 33 percentage points, the
largest margin for six years. Export orders were the main area of
improvement for both small and large companies.
The survey, the first such by the CBI since the March Budget, covered 800
companies with fewer than 200 employees.
Further increases in output over the next four months are expected by 21 per
cent of companies on balance. A net balance of 25 per cent of small
companies expect orders to increase in the next quarter.
Small companies broadly expect to maintain their spending on plant and
machinery over the next 12 months but a balance of 16 per cent intend to
make further cuts in investments in buildings.
In general, small companies are more optimistic about investment than larger
ones. Small company spending on training and innovation is expected to
increase.
The rate of job-shedding has slowed markedly and is much lower than among
manufacturing companies as a whole. Small companies expecting to take on
staff over the next four months outnumber those expecting to cut jobs by 3
percentage points.
In export markets more small companies were able to raise prices than cut
them for the first time since April 1991.
Domestic prices, however, continued to be cut, although at a much slower
rate. Both export and domestic prices are expected to increase over the next
four months.
Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council, said:
'This is good news for the smaller sector and for the creation of wealth in
our economy as a whole.'
Britain has missed out as an innovator in the manufacture of specialist
equipment to protect the environment, says a report published by a House of
Lords committee today.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Women hindered in work training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS BELIEVE that the biggest barriers to women's training and
development are family commitments, the prejudices of male managers and
child care problems, an Industrial Society survey shows.
The survey, of nearly 400 member companies of the Industrial Society, looked
at general training issues and focused on the training and development of
women employees and secretarial and administrative staff.
On training generally, managers were slightly more pessimistic about the
level of their company spending on training than in a previous society
survey six months ago.
There was also a rise in the proportion of managers who were dissatisfied
with their company's training budgets.
The Industrial Society said one possible explanation for the latter finding
was that after a period of static or minimal growth in training budgets
managers were looking for an increased commitment to training in their
organisation, and they were dissatisfied with the position that they were
in.
On women's training and development the survey found that:
Assertiveness ranked top of managers' priorities for women-only training.
Managers rate the Equal Opportunities Commission as the most important
influence on policies for women's development and training.
Opportunity 2000, a private-sector-led initiative to promote women's
employment, was rated the least influential of the several bodies cited.
Creche provision is very rare during company training courses and 30 per
cent of managers said offers of training had been refused be-cause of family
commitments. About one in 10 managers said they had received complaints from
trainees about discriminatory language in their organisation's training
courses.
Complaints about sexual harassment were very rare.
The findings on secretarial staff suggested they were taking on a growing
number of managerial tasks and spending less time on more traditional
secretarial jobs.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Acquisitions 'suffer failure rate of 50%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF OF all mergers and acquisitions fail, a study published today by
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, shows.
The study, compiled from interviews with 100 top companies covering 50
acquisitions worth a total of Pounds 13bn, suggests that there has been
little improvement over the past 20 years. Similar surveys, in 1973 and
1988, showed that about half the acquisitions were regarded by management as
unsuccessful.
Coopers said that many companies, particularly medium-sized groups, needed
to seek professional advice at an early stage.
Often acquiring companies had brought professionals in to do 'due diligence'
 -verifying that they were buying what they thought they were buying - only
long after deciding to make the acquisition.
Failure was most often blamed on management attitudes - differences in style
and resistance to change in the acquired company. The study also showed a
remarkable number of acquiring companies which admitted they did little or
no planning before the takeover for post-acquisition integration.
Lack of knowledge of the target company or the relevant industry was another
common cause of failure.
Mr John Stuttard, Coopers acquisitions partner, said the survey might mask
an improvement in the record of domestic acquisitions and might indicate an
increase in the number of cross-border acquisitions, which could be more
problematic.
Mr Richard Stone, head of corporate finance services at Coopers, said
companies frequently discovered too late that opposing cultures could not
easily be combined.
'You have a three-to-six-month window within which you can bring about
changes,' he said. 'After that there is a tendency to be an absentee
landlord or for the management to go native and be imbued with the same
culture (of the acquired company).'

FT  04 MAY 93 / Judge reopens an explosive case: Jimmy Burns and David Owen
preview the arms-for-Iraq inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED allegations by a former civil servant that ministers connived in the
export of weaponry to Iraq have served as a curtain-raiser to Lord Justice
Scott's public hearings which start today.
Lord Justice Scott was appointed last November by the government to hold an
inquiry into whether ministers sidestepped the government's own guidelines
on defence-related and dual-use equipment to Iraq in the five years leading
to the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
The inquiry team has also set itself the task of re-examining the legitimacy
of ministers' use of public interest immunity certificates to restrict
access to information about certain government activities.
The two issues arose during the controversial trial of the three directors
of Matrix Churchill, the Coventry-based machine-tool company alleged to have
supplied parts for Iraq's so-called supergun.
During the trial documents emerged suggesting a secret policy to promote UK
exports of defence-related equipment had been followed until weeks before
Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait under the former government of Mrs Thatcher.
Four ministers serving in the present government - Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Tristan Garel-Jones - argued, with
the support of Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, for the documents
to be suppressed on grounds of national security.
While Matrix Churchill provides the starting point of the Scott inquiry, the
judge has made it clear in recent weeks that his investigations are not
limited to the company, which accounted for about 3 per cent of UK exports
to Iraq in the 1980s.
Since the start of the year Lord Justice Scott has been examining thousands
of government documents and pieces of written evidence. These are believed
to identify a range of officials, companies and banks involved not only in
direct trade with Iraq but also through third countries such as Jordan.
The judge has confirmed that International Military Services, a defence
company at one time owned partly by the government, is a subject of his
inquiry.
Those initially giving evidence in public, such as Sir Richard Luce, former
minister of state at the Foreign Office, and other former officials at the
Ministry of Defence and the Export Credits Guarantee Department, will be
expected to spell out government policy and how it was interpreted by
ministers. The officials were in office when the guidelines were first
announced to parliament by Sir Geoffrey Howe in 1985.
Public interest in the hearings is likely to increase as the judge calls
senior politicians, such as Mrs Thatcher and perhaps Mr John Major, to give
evidence.
Lord Justice Scott's forthright approach to his inquiry has left few people
either in or out of government with any doubt that he is determined to use
all the powers given to him as 'inquisitor' to penetrate the morass of
Whitehall and business secrecy.
One lawyer close to the inquiry said: 'Scott is a very, very sharp cookie
and has the bit between his teeth. Unless he is frustrated by 'outside
forces' he is determined to get there.'
Some Tory MPs hint privately that the judge's efforts to get to the bottom
of the clandestine trade may be helped by Mr Major's move to distance
himself increasingly from his predecessor.
If they are right, the acid-test of the inquiry's effectiveness may come if
it uncovers evidence of involvement by ministers still inside the cabinet.
Lord Justice Scott established his reputation as a member of the 'liberal
wing' of the English judiciary when he presided over the first Spycatcher
hearings in 1987 and refused government injunctions banning newspapers from
publishing extracts of the book by the former M15 officer Mr Peter Wright.
In the approach to the public hearings he has enhanced this reputation
further by blocking an apparent attempt by Sir Robin Butler, head of the
Civil Service, to have a virtual government veto on what is published once
the judge finishes his inquiry towards the end of the year.
In an exchange of letters to Sir Robin released publicly by Lord Justice
Scott last month, the judge makes clear that the test he will use in
deciding whether to conduct a hearing in closed session is whether
disclosure would 'cause serious injury to the interests of the nation'.
The government has been encouraging more openness at one level by telling
its civil servants they will be immune from prosecution under the Official
Secrets Act and contracts of employment.
Meanwhile the judge is confident that although witnesses will not give
evidence on oath, he will not be lied to.
What remains to be seen is whether the inquiry will produce significant
political fall-out or, to use former defence minister Mr Alan Clark's
phrase, prove as relevant as an old bag of chips.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Pressure on Patten grows over tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION to the government's national curriculum tests hardened at the
weekend.
The National Association of Head Teachers is advising its members today to
ask governors not to provide the Department for Education with test results
necessary for school performance league tables.
Two teachers' unions, the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of
Women Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers have voted to
boycott the tests, which are due to take place in June. The National Union
of Teachers seems certain to follow them next week.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the NAHT, said: 'There seems to be
little point in sending the results through to local education authorities
or to the examining groups or to the Department for Education if they are
going to be used by the government to produce league tables which clearly
are going to be something of a nonsense this year.'
He said that the advice applied only to this year's tests because of the
'peculiar circumstances' of the boycott.
The department deplored the move, saying it was the statutory duty of
governors to assist in producing league tables.
The position of Mr John Patten, the education secretary, could also be made
more difficult by the resignation, expected today, of Lord Skidelsky from
the Schools Examination and Assessment Council. Lord Skidelsky was an early
enthusiast for the national curriculum reforms.
All six teachers' unions have agreed on a submission to Sir Ron Dearing, who
is chairing Mr Patten's review of the national curriculum. They will ask him
to examine the curriculum in its totality, and broaden the remit given to
him by Mr Patten.
The NUT also released a survey of its members on the tests in technology for
14-year-olds. It found that 84 per cent said the tests interfered with
teachers' professional discretion and choices.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Competition cuts some food prices: Leading retailers forced
to respond to discounters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING COMPETITION from discount grocery chains is leading to lower retail
food prices in many parts of the country, a survey by Verdict, the retail
market research company, shows.
A survey last month of 60 stores operated by 14 food retailers found that
average prices for a basket of 40 items had fallen 2.2 per cent since
January in discount outlets and 1.2 per cent in nearby superstores operated
by leading supermarket groups.
Reductions were steep in soft drinks, which fell an average 19 per cent, and
frozen foods, which fell 12 per cent. The smallest decline, 2 per cent, was
in dairy products.
The survey, which contrasts with government figures showing a 1.9 per cent
first-quarter rise in food prices, was based on the cheapest comparable
products in areas where discount chains were operating.
Mr Richard Hyman, managing director of Verdict, said established chains such
as J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, which had previously dismissed the
competitive challenge from discounters, were being forced to respond.
'It is clear that the food retailing market is quite different from what it
was only two years ago,' he said. 'This is not a flash in the pan. There are
further changes to come.'
Many price reductions recorded in superstores reflected the recent launch of
cheap 'tertiary' brands, carrying little-known names and unsupported by
advertising. Prices of most established brand leaders had not yet been cut
sharply.
Prices were lower last month than in January in all the outlets surveyed,
except in stores operated by Asda and Tesco and by discounters Aldi,
Discount Giant and Kwik Save.
The difference between average prices in discount stores and superstores
widened to 9.2 per cent from 7.1 per cent in January. The cheapest discount
chain was the Danish-owned Netto, where prices were 16 per cent lower than
in superstores.
Meanwhile, another survey, by Corporate Intelligence, found that the growing
concentration of retail sales in the hands of a few large store groups has
been reversed in the past two years as smaller chains won back market share.
According to the survey, Britain's 10 largest retailers had sales, excluding
value added tax, of Pounds 42.2bn in 1991-92, Pounds 2.2bn higher than in
the previous year. But their share of total sales by the country's 600
biggest retailers fell to 47.6 per cent from 48.2 per cent.
This is the first fall in the aggregate market share of the top 10 groups -
which account for more than a third of retail sales - since the survey was
first published in 1987. Most of the fall was suffered by large groups in
non-food retailing.
The growth of food discounters is reflected in the rise of Kwik Save, which
overtook the John Lewis Partnership and Sears to become the ninth-largest
retailer in 1991-92.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Brown renews attack over boardroom pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOARDROOM PAY rises were highlighted by Labour yesterday, as the party
launched a new attack on the Tories with accusations of 'double standards'
in ministers' approach to wage restraint.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, focused on salary rises for directors in
companies where former Tory cabinet ministers are board members.
Among the examples he cited was BET, the contract staff supplier, where Lord
Tebbit, a former Tory party chairman, is a director and where, Mr Brown
said, the highest-paid director was awarded an increase of 69 per cent.
Mr Brown said Sir John Nott, a former defence secretary, was a director of
Hillsdown Holdings where, he said, a rise of more than 200 per cent was
awarded to the highest-paid director.
Last week Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, signalled a
renewed crackdown on wages as he argued that sustaining Britain's
competitive advantage would depend on controlling wage costs in particular,
and that wage restraint would assist in job creation.
Labour's offensive comes against a background of a 1.5 per cent ceiling on
public-sector wage rises in the current year, and the prospect of further
public-sector pay restraint in the next year as part of the government's
determination to keep to its spending targets.
Mr Brown, accusing ministers of 'double standards', urged the government to
give a lead in condemning 'this recession irresponsibility'.
He told a rally in Burnley there was a need for a change in practice from
the 'establishment elite' who received big pay rises while calling for
restraint among their staff.
Labour aims to press the government by putting down amendments for
discussion in the committee stage of the Finance Bill, which starts later
this month.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Tarmac chief to be TML co-chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOE DWYER, chief executive of construction group Wimpey, will later this
week stand down as the British co-chairman of Transmanche Link (TML), the
Anglo-French consortium building the Channel tunnel.
He will be succeeded by Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, one of
the five British members of TML which also has five French members.
TML is locked in a row with Eurotunnel, the project's operator, over which
of them should pay for the large rise in building costs.
Wimpey said that when Mr Dwyer took the job he indicated that he would stay
for about a year. He had done this and now wanted to con-centrate on running
Wimpey.
The consortium said Mr Simms would continue to represent the best interest
of contractors. There would be no softening in the campaign to get
Eurotunnel to pay for changes in design and contract conditions which had
pushed up the price of the job.
Negotiations between TML and Eurotunnel have ground to a halt. Wimpey said
Mr Dwyer might have remained longer if talks had been continuing and if he
had felt that there was a chance of a settlement.
Eurotunnel said it was being held to ransom by contractors over the Tunnel's
opening date, which has already been delayed by at least seven months
compared with an original target date of May 15 this year.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Tories shrug off Newbury poll rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORIES insisted yes-terday that they were still confident that they
would win the by-election at Newbury on Thursday, in spite of an opinion
poll showing their candidate 16 per cent behind Liberal Democrat Mr David
Rendel.
Both the parties have moved into top gear for the final days of campaigning,
with neither fully believing the poll putting the Liberal Democrats on 54
per cent, with the Tories trailing on 38 per cent in the seat which they
held with a 12,000-plus majority at the general election.
Mr Julian Davidson, the Tory candidate, said yesterday: 'I am very confident
that we will run a hard campaign over the last three days and that we will
win on Thursday.'
Last night the Tories held a rally with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, who was heckled by Euro-sceptics and had eggs thrown at
him by Communist party members.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday paid his third
visit to the constituency to urge voters to hold the government to account.
'A vote for the Conservatives will be used to endorse the Conservative
record of the last year. A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to force
a change of direction and a change of style for the next year,' he said.
In spite of the NOP poll in The Mail on Sunday, which was conducted by
telephone in the second half of last week among some 750 voters, Liberal
Democrat campaigners said they thought the result on Thursday could be very
close.
They are keen that the support they have attracted from former Tories and
the small number of Labour supporters in the constituency does not evaporate
with a perception that they look set to win by nearly 10,000 votes.
The Tories said that the poll did not coincide with their own findings, and
pointed out that opinion polls in the approach to the general election last
year understated Tory support.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Bottomley announces cut in grant for Aids charities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUTS IN government funding to two leading Aids charities and a more targeted
policy towards the disease were announced by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, yesterday.
The decisions reflect a government view that a once-predicted heterosexual
epidemic of HIV, the virus causing Aids, had not materialised and Aids
should take its place alongside other competing health priorities. Future
health education programmes will target high-risk groups such as homosexual
men and drug abusers.
Mrs Bottomley said on BBC Radio that the government's Aids strategy had been
'extremely successful and effective'. Britain had a lower prevalence than
other countries because it had taken Aids seriously from an early stage.
Aids now had to be seen alongside other conditions such as mental illness,
cancer and heart disease, she said. 'Now that the infrastructure is in place
we do not need to give it the kind of pump-priming priority as when it was a
new and strange disease.'
She said that the Terence Higgins Trust, which provides advice and support
about Aids, and the London Lighthouse residential centre did not require so
much central funding. Both organisations' grants would be reduced in stages
from Pounds 450,000 to Pounds 150,000.
Some Aids organisations see the government's actions as motivated by
pressure for public expenditure savings. More than Pounds 886m has been
spent on Aids funding since 1986.
Dr Les Rudd, director of the National Aids Trust, said: 'In the current
Treasury spending cuts, ministers seem to think Aids is a soft target.'
He said time should be allowed for consideration of Public Health Laboratory
Service figures, due to be published later this month, with which ministers
are expected to justify the policy of targeting high-risk groups. 'If these
figures justify a dramatic change in policy, they should be published before
that change in strategy is announced,' he said.

<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL, the troubled Channel tunnel operator, plans to pay part of its
fee to Bechtel, the US construction group, by issuing shares rather than
with cash.
The transaction, which will involve Eurotunnel issuing 2m new shares, comes
at a time of intense speculation about the group's finances because of
costly delays in the tunnel's construction schedule. The anticipated cost of
the project has escalated from Pounds 4.8bn in 1987 to the present estimate
of Pounds 8.4bn.
Eurotunnel, which said last month that it might need to raise up to Pounds
850m in additional cash by the end of 1995 because of the delays, plans to
seek shareholders' agreement for the Bechtel issue at a meeting on June 10.
It will also ask for permission to raise its nominal capital by up to
FFr1.92bn (Pounds 230m) to issue new shares and by FFr565m to issue
warrants.
Bechtel has since 1986 acted as an external consultant to Eurotunnel and has
seconded executives to work for the group. Eurotunnel said that it was
allowed to pay part of Bechtel's bill in shares under the terms of their
agreement.

FT  04 MAY 93 / The education policy that divided a town: John Authers on
how the Baker reforms have caused a stir at two of Penrith's schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENRITH has a problem. Only 30 per cent of youngsters from the town's
catchment area on the northern edge of the Lake District stay in education
after the age of 16, well below the national average.
The Education Reform Act awakened hopes in the town's two secondary schools
that something could be done to solve this problem. But the visions of the
two differ widely and these differences grabbed national attention when
Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, which had become grant-maintained, was
given the right by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to select pupils
on academic criteria.
Mr Patten had in effect created Britain's first new grammar school in more
than two decades. What started as a local education issue has now been
highly politicised. Critics fear that the move will turn the other secondary
school in the Penrith area into a secondary modern.
Until 1988 the two schools operated a cosy local compromise. Ullswater High
School educates children from the ages of 11 to 16. It used to have a formal
system of recommending its ablest pupils to move to Queen Elizabeth's at the
age of 13. There, ideally, they would stay until 18.
Both schools look the part - Ullswater has a sprawling cement and glass
campus with all signs printed in English, French and German, while Queen
Elizabeth's is a smaller stone building just below Penrith Castle. Honours
boards commemorate ex-pupils who achieve awards at university.
Mr David Robinson, a former schools inspector who was appointed head of
Ullswater in 1990, had other ideas. He believed that Penrith could encourage
more children to stay in education after 16 only if they were offered a
broader range of less academic courses than the rigorous selection on offer
at Queen Elizabeth's.
He decided to open a sixth form. He did not think this would be practical if
the school continued to send pupils to Queen Elizabeth's at 13, so he
stopped the arrangement for sending pupils there.
This angered Mr Donald Fay, head of Queen Elizabeth's, who believed the
county council was already starving his school of funds - a claim supported
by the temporary classrooms which surround the school's small main block.
Queen Elizabeth's asked for grant-maintained status, initially to allow it a
new source of funds. It also decided it would need to admit pupils from 11,
as the supply of pupils from Ullswater at 13 had dried up.
To do this the school's intake per year will need to be slimmed down from
about 120 to 90, and so Queen Elizabeth's asked for the right to apply
academic selection. About 110 have applied, and they will be assessed on the
basis of interviews and their work at primary school. There will be no
11-plus examinations.
Mr Fay is adamant that it was only Ullswater's move which provoked his
decision to apply for selection, and that he will not be turning Ullswater
into a secondary modern by doing so.
Mr Robinson is equally confident that Ullswater, which is roughly double the
size of Queen Elizabeth's, will succeed in attracting a fair proportion of
the Penrith area's academically able pupils, but describes Mr Patten's
decision as a 'betrayal'.
Penrith is deeply Conservative - the Labour party is not even running a
candidate in the county council election, while the local Conservative MP
increased his majority at the last election - but the issue plays a big part
on the doorsteps.
Ms Joan Robinson, leader of Cumbria County Council's Liberal Democrat group
and a Penrith councillor, collected a petition with more than 2,000
signatures opposing Mr Patten's decision, in an attempt to rebut his claim
that he had 'granted what the community had asked for'.
Ms Robinson said: 'I would have preferred to pool all the resources and make
sure that all the children in this area could have pursued the courses they
wanted. That would have allowed greater choice within that one school,
although not necessarily between two schools.'
Local Conservatives play down the issue. Mr Stephen Parry, Ms Robinson's
Conservative opponent and a governor of Ullswater High, says that both
schools will be needed if provision for 16 to 18-year-olds is to be
improved.
He is a keen supporter of Ullswater's Mr Robinson, and believes that many
parents will choose Ullswater but admits to feeling strong sympathy with
Queen Elizabeth's governors in their dilemma. He also attacks the Liberal
Democrats for making political capital out of the issue.
Education is probably the biggest issue of the campaign for Cumbria County
Council, which is narrowly controlled by a coalition of Labour and the
Liberal Democrats. Labour opposes selection because it 'takes choice away
from parents and gives it to schools'.
The Conservatives counterattack by claiming that the 26 Cumbrian schools
which have opted out did so, as did Queen Elizabeth's, to escape inefficient
council administration. They want the county to cut administrative staff
because the workload has fallen after the opt-outs, and to redistribute the
money to schools.
All three parties seem to accept that the Cumbrian status quo is likely to
remain after May 6.
The future in Penrith rests with the town's parents, and with its two
secondary schools. The issues raised there are bound to appear elsewhere as
the government tests its theory that creating a competitive market allows
better planning than leaving the job to local education authorities.

BRITISH COAL has warned private companies it will not let them take over the
corporation's unwanted pits unless it is on a long-term basis.
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said in an interview with The Times
that this approach was necessary to prevent companies taking over mines on a
'rape and pillage' basis. He said the corporation would revoke companies'
licences to run pits if they did not stick to the long-term approach.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Labour stresses its European credentials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is reasserting its European credentials with a policy paper designed
to emphasise its commitment to the social dimension of the European
Community and to contrast its position with that of the Conservatives.
Its release, in the week that the party will share a common cause with Tory
Euro-sceptics over the controversial amendment to the Maastricht bill on the
social chapter, emphasises Labour's determination that harrying the
government over the bill at Westminster should not damage its wider European
reputation.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the Commons, will announce today
whether she will allow MPs to vote on the amendment which excludes from the
bill the social protocol containing both the social chapter and the UK's
'opt-out' from it. A fierce row erupted when MPs were denied a vote on the
amendment in earlier discussion.
The amendment is supported by opposition parties and Tory rebels, leaving
the government facing a serious risk of a defeat that would be deeply
humiliating, even though ministers say that it would not wreck the treaty.
Labour believes, however, that if the amendment were approved the government
would be forced to sign up to the social chapter.
Acceptance of the social chapter provisions is one of the central themes in
the policy paper. It argues that the UK government's 'opt-out' will become
untenable because there will be strong pressure to consolidate the chapter
in the treaty in 1996, at the next inter-governmental conference.
It expresses doubt that ministers will want to remain isolated from deciding
such a central policy, given that 'at some future date it will apply with
equal force in the UK'.
The document will be discussed by the first meeting of the party's national
policy forum this weekend, and will go to the ruling national executive
committee next month, to form the basis of the committee's statement for the
annual autumn conference.
On the economy, the paper says that Labour remains fully committed to
working with other EC countries to encourage increasing economic
integration.
While expressing support for the principle of a managed system of fixed but
adjustable exchange rates, it is cautious on the prospect of sterling's
return to the European exchange rate mechanism.
'Any move to re-enter the exchange rate mechanism will clearly require the
adoption of policies designed to strengthen our weakened industrial capacity
and revive our depressed economy,' it says.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Baker Act provoking controversy on national testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREATEST power held by county councils has been eroded since their last
elections in 1989 by Mr Kenneth Baker's Education Reform Act, John Authers
writes.
The Baker act, which became law in 1988, is provoking controversy on the
issue of testing for the national curriculum, which it introduced. But it
also introduced the right for schools to opt out of local education
authority control and become 'grant maintained'.
Opted-out schools are funded directly by the Department for Education, and
so many of the powers previously held by local education authorities devolve
to Mr John Patten, the education secretary.
The 1988 act also introduced local management of schools. This aimed to
devolve power away from county halls by creating delegated budgets which
were paid to schools and then put under their control.
Both moves indirectly attacked county councils, which are responsible for
local education authorities outside the metropolitan areas. As the number of
schools opting out has increased, the work remaining for county councils has
decreased.
This has led county councils to fear that there is a link between
grant-maintained schools and the review of the structure of local
government, which is considering replacing two-tier authorities - involving
both counties and districts - with unitary authorities.
Education is the counties' biggest responsibility, and widespread opting out
would make it much easier to do away with county councils altogether.
Not surprisingly, education is proving one of the most important issues in
the campaign for the county council elections.

FT  04 MAY 93 / IMF to oversee currency trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund is to step up its supervision of the
economies of industrial nations in an attempt to head off currency crises
such as that which rocked the European Monetary System last September.
The plan, endorsed by the IMF's policy making Interim Committee at the end
of last week, could mean greater IMF intervention to influence the economic
policies of countries such as Japan which are running large balance of
payments surpluses with the rest of the world. Until now the IMF's main
preoccupation has been with countries with debt problems or in balance of
payments difficulties.
In his speech to the Interim Committee, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury
secretary, hinted that surplus countries could find themselves under
pressure to change policy. 'Policies that are sound under normal
circumstances may have a destabilising effect on markets in particular
conditions,' he said. 'The Fund must have the means to identify and call
attention to such risks.'
The Interim Committee gave the IMF a mandate to strengthen its surveillance
over the exchange rate and macro-economic policies of its members. As part
of this task it has also been asked to focus on regional developments.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, told the Interim Committee that it
would be the IMF's job to make sure that the existence of 'regional blocs'
did not undermine the world's open, multilateral economic system. According
to one official, this aspect of surveillance could result in the IMF being
asked to pass judgment on incipient tensions in the EMS.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spanish finance minister and Interim Committee chairman,
said it was the first time since the end of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange
rate system in the early 1970s that the IMF had been asked to try to reduce
exchange rate volatility.
He said that the fact that all the IMF's members - from industrialised to
developing and former communist countries - were asking the Fund to play a
more active role in monitoring and curbing exchange rate instability should
not be underestimated.
Although final details have to be fleshed out, it will be the IMF's task to
study exchange rate developments more close-ly and assess whether they are
consistent with member countries' macro-economic policies and economic
fundamentals.
One precondition of success, mentioned by Mr Bentsen, will be the
development of comparable data on member states' policies 'so we know what
we are looking at'.
According to Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, IMF staffers
will try to identify at the earliest possible opportunity whether tensions
are developing in economies that could trigger currency disturbances. The
IMF would then suggest measures that countries should take to try to avoid a
repetition of crises such as last autumn's upheaval in the European exchange
rate mechanism.
However, Mr Solchaga sounded a note of caution about the IMF's capacity to
achieve currency stability. Surveillance was a necessary but not sufficient
requirement for stable exchange rates, he said.
In an apparent reference to France, he pointed out that some countries with
'outstanding' economic credentials had been buffeted by currency speculation
in last year's crisis.
The monetary talks in Washington wound up on Saturday with a discussion in
the joint IMF-World Bank development committee of how best to encourage
private capital flows to developing nations.
The committee decided that host countries bore the main responsibility for
creating an environment attractive to foreign investors. But industrialised
countries should remove unnecessary institutional and regulatory barriers to
the supply of investment funds.

WHAT IS the best way to bring capital into a country? The answer, it seems,
is 'allow it to go out'. That is one of the most interesting insights
provided by the report on global economic prospects, published earlier this
month by the World Bank.* As the Bank remarks, 'in some cases the removal of
capital outflow restrictions appeared to have the (paradoxical) effect of
stimulating a net inflow of capital, presumably by reassuring investors that
it would be easy to repatriate their money should they wish to do so.'
Such successes are important, not least because capital flight has been
vast. Data on illegal capital flows can never be more than estimates, but
the figures the Bank comes up with are breathtaking. For Sub-Saharan Africa,
for example, it estimates the stock of flight capital at 80 per cent of
total gross domestic product, well above Latin America's 31 per cent. In
some countries the estimates are higher still: almost 200 per cent of GDP
for Gabon and around 150 per cent for Egypt and Nicaragua.
This is serious money by any standards. At the end of 1990, says the Bank,
the stock of flight capital stood at USDollars 700bn or 55 per cent of the
total debt stock at that time. Moreover, between 1986 and 1988 the flow of
flight capital was well over Dollars 50bn a year. In 1988 alone it was
Dollars 80bn. But over the past four years the flows have reversed, as money
has poured back into countries like Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.
Naturally, there is no simple way of measuring flight capital. The World
Bank's approach is to use components of the balance of payments to determine
a residual. Capital flight is measured by the difference between known
external borrowing plus foreign direct investment, on the one hand, and the
current account deficit plus the increase in reserves, on the other. How
accurately capital flight has been measured depends on the accuracy with
which these components are measured, which is to say not very accurately at
all. But these figures should still say something about orders of magnitude.
Capital flight may be a big elephant or a small elephant, but it is no
mouse.
The encouraging part of this story is that policy changes help. Overvalued
real exchange rates, which are a subsidy to capital exports, large spreads
between domestic and international real interest rates and penal taxation,
particularly of capital, are all reasons for capital flight. These can all
be modified. But behind them usually lie overburdened public finances.
Accordingly, the easy assumption that capital flight is itself a good reason
for not providing official external assistance is a bit simplistic. Such
assistance can allow a government which is determined to reform the room to
do so. Once it has reformed, however, and the capital has flown back,
further assistance should not be offered for such macroeconomic purposes.
Perhaps the most important conclusion of the Bank's analysis is that 'the
choice for developing countries is not between financial integration and no
integration. Rather, it is between two-way integration that permits capital
inflows and private institutional outflows and one-way integration that
consists of capital flight.' In any economy that allows people control over
funds, but denies them both a profitable and secure outlet at home, the
money is bound to fly out. It does not need to be a capitalist economy.
Russia is suffering chronically from capital flight at present. Those who
moan about the undesirability of 'shock therapy' fail to realise that it is
their advice - all too faithfully followed, unfortunately - which is
generating this crippling outflow.
It is in the interests of developing country governments to allow capital to
flow fairly freely. Provided they also allow people profitable investments
at home, money is just as likely to come in as flow out. Indeed, that is
what one would expect, since the best investment opportunities in the world
should be in poorer countries.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Asian bank caught in capital squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET

<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago in Hong Kong, Mr Kimimasa Tarumizu, president of the Asian
Development Bank, called on member countries to double the bank's capital as
an 'urgent priority' to some Dollars 48bn (Pounds 31bn). He pleaded with
members, particularly the recalcitrant US, to agree to the capital increase
by the end of 1992.
His pleas went unheeded. This year he will be making the same request with
even greater fervour at the ADB annual meeting starting in Manila today.
If the ADB's 52 members fail to reach agreement by the end of this year  - a
conclusion at the meeting this week is considered highly unlikely - new
lending could be sharply reduced some time in 1994 and limited to the amount
of loan repayments trickling back to the ADB.
The bank borrows money on international markets against its subscribed
capital of Dollars 23bn to finance projects in the poorer member countries,
and would find it easy to borrow more. But its own rules do not allow it to
commit itself to lending more than the sum of its subscribed capital and
reserves, currently about Dollars 27bn; it has outstanding loan commitments
of more than Dollars 23bn already.
Last year the ADB lent nearly Dollars 4bn, excluding soft loans which are
administered separately, and faces increased demand for financing from
China, India and other borrowing members, not to mention the six Asian
republics of the former Soviet Union which are expected to join soon.
'We are now bank to half the world, population-wise, and it also happens
that the two largest countries in the world started borrowing from us
comparatively recently,' said one senior ADB official yesterday. India and
China both began borrowing from the ADB in the second half of the 1980s and
together account for 28 per cent of total loans. Indonesia has taken another
33 per cent.
One problem facing the ADB is that the previous US administration of Mr
George Bush adopted a hard line in negotiations with other ADB shareholders
 -demanding that the bank make policy changes and lend more to the private
sector - while President Clinton's new team is incomplete and has yet to
make its views clear on the proposed capital increase for the five years to
1998.
The US and Japan are the ADB's two largest shareholders, with about 16 per
cent each, but the actual amount that Washington would have to pay if the
subscribed capital was doubled would only be of the order of Dollars 200m,
spread over the five years.
This is because as little as 3 per cent of the new capital is likely to be
paid in. The rest would be 'callable' in an emergency, and so far no
multilateral financial institution has ever had to use its callable capital.
The US administration, however, would be obliged to mention the daunting
contingent liability sum when it seeks to appropriate funds through
Congress.

FT  04 MAY 93 / S Africa tensions rise after killings

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA yesterday braced for more racial tension after five whites were
killed by blacks at the weekend, and a group of retired generals said they
might turn to violence to protect Afrikaners.
A man claiming to represent the Azanian National Liberation Army, the
little-known armed wing of the ultra-radical Black Consciousness Movement of
Azania, telephoned a local news agency to claim responsibility for the
murder of five whites in an eastern Cape hotel on Saturday night. But
another caller to a different news agency denied the claim.
The gruesome attack, which followed several similar killings in recent
months, has further exacerbated white fears. The Azanian People's Liberation
Army, the military wing of the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress,
has been blamed by police for most of these attacks.
The attack came on the eve of the funeral on Sunday of African National
Congress leader Oliver Tambo, which went off without incident. However,
white television viewers will have been further alarmed by live coverage of
the funeral, which involved a long parade by guerrillas of the ANC armed
wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, wearing full battle dress. Later, Umkhonto
guerrillas in camouflage directed traffic along the route through white
areas to the cemetery where Mr Tambo was buried.
Meanwhile, a group of former army and police generals say they will try to
mobilise right-wing whites behind the demand for self-determination for
Afrikaners. General Tienie Groenewald, one of the conveners of the
'committee of generals', has denied press reports that the generals aimed to
establish an army of the right, but said the group would turn to violence if
constitutional options proved unsuccessful. He said the group's aim was to
ensure that the government and the ANC did not ignore the views of
right-wing whites, and ethnically based parties such as the Inkatha Freedom
party, in constitutional talks.
Political analysts believed the group would find it difficult to unite the
fractious and divided right, composed of scores of small splinter groups.
But given the group's considerable potential support among the largely
right-wing armed forces, its formation could further exacerbate tensions.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPUBLICAN party prospects of picking up an additional US senator were
enhanced by results of the weekend primary for the seat vacated by Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, now treasury secretary.
The all-party primary was narrowly won by Mrs Kay Bailey Hutchison, the
Republican state treasurer, who beat Mr Bob Krueger, the interim Democratic
incumbent, by 593,479 votes to 592,982. Both won 29 per cent of the vote and
face each other in a run-off a month from now.
Democratic concern stems from the fact that the Republican share of the
primary vote - Mrs Hutchison's plus that won by the two Republican
congressmen who finished third and fourth - comfortably exceeded 50 per
cent. Mr Richard Fisher, a nominal Democrat whose views and style resemble
those of Mr Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential candidate,
scored just 8 per cent, most of which may also be added to the Republican
camp in the run-off.
This is potentially bad news for President Bill Clinton, and for the
Democrats, whose 57-43 lead in the Senate has proved insufficient to break
opposition filibusters.
A further test comes today in Wisconsin in the election to fill the House of
Representatives seat of Mr Les Aspin, now defence secretary.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Menem unveils medium-term plan to spur 43% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem unveiled at the weekend a medium-term
strategy which he promised would generate economic growth of 43 per cent and
create 1m jobs in his last two years in office. He wants to bring annual
inflation down to 4 per cent by 1995, when his term ends.
Opening a new session of Congress on Saturday, Mr Menem said he would
further open the economy to foreign trade and reduce taxes to help lower
companies' operating costs.
The thrust of his strategy is to force companies to become more competitive
and invest more. Alarm is growing over Argentina's increasing reliance on
foreign capital and its current account deficit, forecast at Dollars
8bn-Dollars 11bn (Pounds 5.1bn-Pounds 7bn) this year against an estimated
Dollars 8bn in 1992.
Mr Menem announced gradual cuts in corporate taxes and said companies would
be able to buy foreign capital goods and trucks without paying any import
duties.
Local capital goods manufacturers, though, will be entitled to a subsidy of
15 per cent of their sales to offset the impact of foreign competition.
Mr Menem also said government-owned banks would increase lending to small
and medium-sized farms and companies.
The government's Banco de la Nacion Argentina will lend these sectors
Dollars 4.5bn this year, rising to Dollars 6.2bn in 1995, at below market
interest rates.

FT  04 MAY 93 / California tax system dispute worries Europe
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission said yesterday it was worried about recent
developments in a 10-year-old dispute over California's system for taxing
foreign companies.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, EC tax commissioner, said that the US
administration's decision not to support Barclays Bank, the British group,
in its test case against the Californian system had given rise to
'considerable concern' in various member states, notably the UK.
Under its unitary taxation system, California calculates corporate tax not
on profits made in the state itself, but on a proportion of a company's
worldwide earnings.
Barclays, which has been fighting the system for 10 years, is seeking in the
US Supreme Court a reversal of a California Supreme Court decision which
went against it.
Mrs Scrivener said that she was 'concerned about the impact which an adverse
decision in the US Supreme Court could have on Community-based businesses
operating in the US.'
However, she did not indicate whether the Commission would try to retaliate
if Barclays was defeated.

THEY are proud and intelligent, good-natured, with beautiful eyes, and
communicate in a language of murmurs and grunts.
What is more, continues Nancy Abeiderrahmane, warming to her theme, you can
eat them, ride them, wear them, sleep on and under them: their hair is woven
into tents, their wool is turned into carpets, their treated skin becomes
leather. You can also milk them.
Camels are close to Mrs Abeiderrahmane's heart.
British born and a citizen of Mauritania by marriage, Mrs Abeiderrahmane
runs a pioneering camel milk dairy - Laitiere de Mauritanie - in the
country's capital, Nouakchott. It has earned her one of the prestigious
Rolex 'awards for enterprise', presented every three years by the Swiss
watchmaking company.
In Geneva for the ceremony, Mrs Abeiderrahmane recounted the hurdles she
overcame when establishing the first dairy in Africa to pasteurise camels'
milk on a commercial scale. And thanks to the discovery of a new enzyme, it
is the first in the world to produce camel's cheese, soon to be exported to
France.
The benefits for Mauritania, a mainly desert country in northwest Africa,
could prove considerable, she says. They include savings in foreign exchange
spent on imported dairy products, improved nutritional standards, curbing
the drift of labour from countryside to city, and combating desertification.
And what serves Mauritania could well apply to a swathe of countries across
Africa's arid Sahel zone, through Sudan and Somalia on the east coast, as
well as northern Kenya.
Mrs Abeiderrahmane, 45, studied as an industrial engineer in Barcelona,
Spain, and has lived in Nouakchott since 1970. But it was not until 1987
that she found time from the demands of rearing four children to put her
technical expertise to practical effect.
By then Nouakchott's population had grown dramatically. From around 500 at
independence in 1960 it had risen to nearly 500,000, almost 25 per cent of
the nomadic population of a country almost twice the size of France.
A way of life had ended. As nomads, they got their milk from their animals -
750,000 camels and 1.25m cows. As city dwellers, they came to rely on
imported products, over 50,000 tons a year of sterilised or powdered milk,
often of poor quality and a drain on Mauretania's scarce foreign exchange.
Mrs Abeiderrahmane decided to process locally produced camel milk, sold raw,
in buckets. First she had to resolve technical difficulties that arose, then
raise the money, and finally overcome consumer resistance to the new
product.
For two tough years - 'I was manager, secretary, accountant, foreman, and
driver' - it was touch and go.
The camel herds were scattered, their yields low and collection expensive,
and prejudices had to be overcome. Many Mauritanians believed imported
European milk was somehow better - though camels' milk is higher in vitamin
C, potassium and iron, and lower in fat.
Today the milk, packaged in cartons under the brand name Tiviski, has
sufficient sales to put the balance sheet into credit for the first time.
Meanwhile, income from regular collection of their milk makes city life less
appealing for the network of nomadic herders.
There's more to be learnt from Mrs Abeiderrahmane. The female camel requires
up to four times less fodder to produce a litre of milk than a cow; and in a
drought the camel, unlike the cow, does not dry up.
The camel is also environmentally friendly: its wide-splayed hooves do not
damage the fragile surface of arid or semi-arid terrains of the Sahel in the
way that the sharp surfaces of cows' hooves do.
It's the stuff of Mrs Abeiderrahmane's vision. For a thousand years camels
plied the great trade routes between Africa and Asia. The ship of the desert
will adapt to the needs of a different age - as an environmentally friendly,
fodder-efficient, foreign exchange-saving, low-fat dairy of the dunes.

UP TO 500 Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked the strategic town of Siem Reap in
northern Cambodia yesterday, pushing civilians ahead of them as human
shields, according to United Nations peacekeepers, Reuter reports.
It was the biggest attack on a town since Cambodia's four warring factions
signed a UN-sponsored peace pact in 1991 that the Khmer Rouge has since
abandoned. The guerrillas attacked before dawn but one UN military observer
said the assault was disorganised.
The Khmer Rouge has threatened to use violence to disrupt elections
scheduled for May 23-27.

KHMER ROUGE guerrillas firing automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades
attacked a provincial capital in northwest Cambodia yesterday, AP reports
from Phnom Penh.
Guerrillas were firing on the airport runway at Siem Reap, said UN
officials. The Kampuchea Airlines commercial flight which many foreign
tourists take from Phnom Penh to visit the famed temples of Angkor just
outside Siem Reap was cancelled.
UN military observers in Siem Reap, 225 km northwest of Phnom Penh, had long
been preparing for an attack, building bunkers and installing razor wire
around their compounds.
A UN interpreter said the Khmer Rouge attacked at 5 a m and fighting was
continuing at 9 a m. The Bangladeshi infantry battalion, which is posted
there to protect UN workers, did not answer their phone. The Khmer Rouge has
boycotted the UN operation to guide the country through democratic elections
this month.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Murders set to bring passions to the boil: Stefan Wagstyl
and Mervyn de Silva report from Colombo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS last speech before being killed by a terrorist bomb at the weekend,
the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa of Sri Lanka issued a grim challenge
to his political enemies: 'Assassinate me by whatever means but please do
not assassinate my character.'
Such is the violent nature of Sri Lankan politics that the president's fatal
wish was fulfilled during a May Day parade last Saturday. A tough
street-fighting populist, who preferred village life to mixing with the
elite of Colombo, Mr Premadasa died, as he had lived, milling with a crowd.
The president was assassinated by a suicide bomber just over a week after
one of his main political rivals, Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, was shot dead at
an election rally.
The prime suspects for both killings are the Tamil Tigers, the common name
for the LTTE separatist movement which has been fighting for more than a
decade for a homeland in northern Sri Lanka for the minority Tamil
community, in defiance of the majority Singhalese.
Although the LTTE has denied responsibility, police say the evidence seems
to point to the Tigers.
Whether or not the Tigers were responsible, the assassinations raise serious
questions about Sri Lanka's future political stability. If violence spreads
it could undermine the hard-won economic success that has made Sri Lanka's
living standards the envy of other developing nations.
A crucial test will be how Sri Lankans behave on Thursday at the president's
public funeral in Colombo and at provincial assembly elections due later
this month.
As Mr Gamini Dissanayake, a close associate of Mr Athulathmudali, says: 'The
assassination of both the president and Mr Athulathmudali add up to a
national crisis. It sends entirely the wrong signals to the world.'
Much will depend on how Sri Lanka's politicians react. Mr Premadasa was an
authoritarian ruler whose departure leaves a vacuum at the top of the ruling
UNP party.
He came from a poor background and was regarded as an outsider by the
political elite, such as Mr Athulathmudali, a former president of the Oxford
Union. But the UNP could not afford to do without Mr Premadasa's rapport
with the island's rural masses.
Mr Premadasa became president in 1988 at a low point in the UNP's fortunes,
just after the signing of an unpopular agreement with India which let India
put 60,000 troops into Sri Lanka to try to tame the Tamil Tigers. Many
Singhalese showed their resentment by supporting an armed nationalist
insurgency. Mr Premadasa was judged by UNP chiefs to be the only man to win
back the disaffected Singhalese.
He largely succeeded, primarily by securing departure of the Indian troops,
though also with some tough repressive measures against the insurgents. He
also gave strong impetus to a long-running economic reform programme.
He pushed ahead with privatisation, cut import tariffs and overhauled the
financial markets in a bold effort to open Sri Lanka to domestic competition
and foreign investment.
The economy grew at an average annual rate of 5 per cent in the three years
to 1992 - a creditable achievement given the cost of the war against the
LTTE. Foreign investment soared from under Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) a year
in the mid-1980s to around Dollars 200m last year.
However, the price of success was a revolt in the UNP, led by Mr
Athulathmudali, who led a breakaway group which tried to impeach Mr
Premadasa. They failed last year, resigned their seats to create a new
party, the DUNF, which claimed to be the true inheritor of UNP ideals.
The split left the way open for a revival in the fortunes of an alliance of
socialist opposition parties headed by the SLFP, led by the veteran former
prime minister, Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, matriarch of a leading political
family whose own husband had also been murdered when prime minister (in
1959).
A month ago, Mrs Bandaranaike was poised to do well in the forthcoming
provincial election. Then, Mr Athulathmudali's death created sympathy for
the DUNF. Now, the ruling UNP hopes for a boost.
In Colombo yesterday, white flags, signs of mourning for the president,
fluttered around many buildings; but earlier, fire-crackers had been set off
in some districts to celebrate his departure.
A senior government official said yesterday the UNP had rallied around Mr D
B Wijetunga, the acting president. He said Mr Wijetunga would now have
little difficulty securing a parliamentary majority allowing him to stay in
office until the end of Mr Premadasa's term in December, 1994.
Whether or not they carried out the killings, the LTTE could profit from the
confusion. A caretaker government is unlikely to give as strong leadership
to the fight against the Tamils as Mr Premadasa. Also, Mr Premadasa
advocated a two-prong policy of armed action coupled with tentative efforts
at political dialogue.
The senior official said the new government may now face a backlash from
Singhalese demanding revenge against the Tigers. Such demand could play into
the LTTE's hands by reviving international concern about the Tamils - not
least from India.

SRI LANKA, which has been thrown into political crisis by the assassination
at the weekend of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, will make no immediate
changes in economic policy-making, a senior official said yesterday.
'There will be no change in the economic programme,' said the official, a
close adviser to the late Mr Premadasa, who was killed by a suicide bomber
who plunged into a May Day parade.
He said the ruling UNP party had sufficient votes in parliament to ensure
the election of its presidential candidate, Mr D B Wijetunge, the prime
minister and acting president.
The government was yesterday trying to ensure calm in the country,
especially in the capital, Colombo, where Mr Premadasa's public funeral on
Thursday is expected to attract large crowds. So far, no violent incidents
have been reported and a curfew imposed after the killing on Saturday was
lifted within a day.
Besides the president, about 20 other people died in the blast in Colombo.
It was the second political murder in just over a week, following the
shooting of a senior opposition leader.
Businessmen said yesterday the assassinations could create uncertainty about
the country's economic future. Shares fell by about 1 per cent on the
Colombo Stock Exchange in busy but calm trading.
Mr Stanley Jayawardena, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the securities watchdog, and a leading businessman, said: 'The uncertainty
could have an effect on business. Foreign investors who are not too far down
the track with an investment may decide to wait.'
Mr Premadasa was widely praised in the business community for his economic
policies, including one of Asia's fastest privatisation programmes and most
extensive deregulation campaigns.

<TEXT>
PERU'S economic team, led by Mr Jorge Camet, finance minister, is in Paris
today to renegotiate the country's Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.1bn) debt with its
Paris Club group of creditor countries.
The Peruvian proposal seeks to reduce 1993-95 debt servicing from about
Dollars 1bn (equivalent to one-third of annual export earnings) to between
Dollars 300m and Dollars 350m a year. 'It's a pragmatic proposal aimed at
reducing servicing in line with Peru's ability to pay,' said Mr Eduardo
Valdivia, Peru's chief debt adviser.
Talks with the 17 creditor governments are likely to be tough. But since the
IMF has already approved the current three-year economic programme, Peru is
expected to get most if not all the conditions it seeks.
Ultimately, however, the only realistic solution to Peru's debt burden
appears to be wide-scale forgiveness. Peru proposes to tackle that question
with Paris in three years' time.

FT  04 MAY 93 / IG Metall begins strike: Talks today raise hopes of a
settlement in wage dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, is braced today to step up
its strike action in eastern Germany, which began with stoppages at
factories and steel plants in two states yesterday.
But in a hopeful sign last night employers and union officials in the state
of Saxony agreed to hold negotiations this morning to try to resolve the
dispute.
They agreed to this after a four-hour preliminary meeting that also involved
Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the state's premier.
The strike, the first officially held in eastern Germany since 1933, is over
union demands that employers reinstate a cancelled contract aimed at
equalising wages in eastern and western Germany by next year.
The stoppage yesterday affected five steel plants in Berlin-Brandenburg and
19 metal and engineering sectors in Saxony, as well as the state's four
steel plants. In all, more than 14,000 workers came out in support of IG
Metall, but with less enthusiasm than expected by the union which is
dominated by westerners in eastern Germany.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, president of IG Metall, told workers in Dresden: 'We
didn't want to strike. We were forced into it by the employers. But we will
strike as long as is necessary and we will win.'
Before Mr Biedenkopf's latest mediation attempt, Mr Steinkuhler warned that
the five eastern German states would be engulfed in an indefinite strike
unless the employers returned to the negotiating table and gave the metal
and engineering sectors a 26 per cent pay increase this year, and the steel
sector a 21 per cent rise.
These claims were part of the original wage contract, signed between IG
Metall and the employers and eastern German managers in March 1991. But the
collapse of the east European and Soviet markets, combined with recession in
western Germany, forced employers to cancel the contract. They have since
recommended pay increases of about 9 per cent.
Both Gesamtmetall, the metal and engineering employers' association, and
Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' association, yesterday said
they would not reinstate the contract. 'We simply cannot afford it,' steel
employers said, adding that much of the sector was already heavily
subsidised and saddled with large debts.
IG Metall claims east Germany should not be turned into a low-wage economy,
even if that makes the region competitive in the long term. Its strategy now
is to increase the number of plants affected by strikes. More than 50
enterprises have been selected in the metal and engineering sectors in
Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and Saxony and steel plants in the five states.

THREE of Belgium's most wanted men yesterday put the country's prison
service and police to shame with an audacious armed break-out from a
Brussels jail. The trio were still on the run last night after releasing the
last of four hostages.
The escape may set the farcical seal on what was supposed to be Belgium's
'trial of the century' - that of the notorious Haemers gang, nine people
accused of 15 bloody armed hold-ups and the 1989 kidnapping of former prime
minister Paul Vanden Boeynants.
It will also put further pressure on the Belgian political establishment,
which is already under stress from rumours of political and business
corruption as well as the more familiar strains of holding together a
coalition government.
Two of the Haemers gang were among the prisoners to escape yesterday
morning, as riots broke out at two Brussels prisons.
Their trial was supposed to have begun last month but was already in a state
of surreal suspension, following the court's failure to round up enough
jurors and potential jurors. It could resume in September, assuming the two
defendants are recaptured, and the government can rush through emergency
legislation changing the rules for picking juries.
Mr Patrick Haemers, leader of the gang, has escaped custody before, fleeing
to Rio de Janeiro in 1986, before being recaptured in 1989. This time he was
not among those to make the break for freedom; his lawyers are exploring a
more orthodox way of securing his release.
They argue that he has already served an unreasonably long prison term while
awaiting trial - nearly five years - and that it is affecting his health. A
Brussels court yesterday rejected their request that he be temporarily
freed, but Mr Haemers' lawyers are likely to appeal against the decision.
Haemers' alleged accomplices, Mr Philippe Lacroix and Mr Basri Bajrami, were
sprung from St Gilles prison, in a Brussels suburb, yesterday morning along
with Murat Kaplan, Belgium's self-styled 'Getaway King'. Several other
inmates also tried to escape during the riot, but were recaptured.
The trio immediately took four prison officers hostage using two handguns
and three grenades and escaped in a stolen BMW, before leading the police
across Brussels, leaving behind them a trail of abandoned getaway cars and
hostages.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is set to slide into recession this year with the economy declining
by 0.1 per cent, according to the latest government forecast, because of
further cuts in industrial investment and a fall in export growth.
The Commission des Comptes, the public accounts committee, suggests gross
domestic product in 1993 will follow the downward trend begun in the final
quarter of 1992, falling in real terms by an average of 0.1 per cent.
This decline will reflect slightly slower growth in consumer spending of 1.1
per cent, against 1.4 per cent in 1992, and a continued fall in industrial
investment of 3.7 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent the previous year.
Import growth is expected to slow from 3.8 per cent in 1992 to 2.7 per cent
this year, but the Commission also forecasts a sharp reduction in export
growth from 7 to 1.7 per cent.
The sluggish economy could complicate the new centre-right government's
attempts to reduce the general budget deficit, which is expected to reach
FFr330bn (Pounds 39.6bn) this year. The government yesterday continued its
cost-cutting efforts by announcing there would be no new increase in public
sector salaries for 1993.
Mr Andre Rossinot, public services minister, said the government would stick
to the 6 per cent increase in the total public sector salary bill agreed by
the last administration.
The pay freeze forms part of the efforts of Mr Edouard Balladur, prime
minister, to cut government expenditure.

<TEXT>
THE DANISH government and the European Commission yesterday moved quickly to
dampen controversy caused by a leaked note by a senior EC lawyer saying
Denmark's exemptions from the Maastricht treaty are probably unenforceable.
Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister, insisted that the treaty
opt-outs are binding in international law. A senior EC official declared
that the leaked private opinion by Mr Donald Allen, a British lawyer at the
European Commission, was a 'non-story.'
Weekend publication of the note just two weeks before the second Danish
referendum on the Maastricht treaty on May 18 is an embarrassment for the
'Yes' campaigners. Part of their appeal rests on their contention that
Denmark won new, legally binding treaty exemptions on monetary union,
defence policy and immigration at the EC summit in Edinburgh last December.
In practice, the issue is less clear-cut. Danish opt-outs are more a clever
piece of Brussels drafting which spells out previously agreed exemptions but
does not amend the substance of the treaty. This would have required
re-ratification of Maastricht, an unacceptable risk for member states.
Mr Allen, 63, sent a private note siding with the opinion of three British
legal experts and noted Euro-sceptics who attacked the legal status of
Denmark's opt-outs. But after the contents of the note appeared in the
British press last weekend, Mr Allen beat a hasty retreat.

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission is concerned that the EC-wide plan to support the
ailing west European steel industry could be derailed by member states'
attempts to subsidise their national producers.
EC industry ministers meet today in Brussels to discuss the progress of the
plan so far, in the wake of the Commission's rejection last week of German
proposals to restructure Ekostahl, the east German producer, and scepticism
about a new rationalisation plan from Ilva, the loss-making Italian
steelmaker.
The Commission has not yet submitted formal proposals to the ministers on
any of the most controversial state subsidy cases, but it is pressing for a
special meeting in July to consider German, Italian and Spanish steel aid
plans together.
On Friday, Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, told Mr Michele
Tedeschi, the managing director of Iri, the Italian state holding company
which controls Ilva, that the Commission needed to have a clearer view of
the subsidies involved in the new plan, and the reduction of capacity it
might involve.
Iri claims the plan involves no state aid, and is based on the behaviour of
a private sector shareholder.
Commission officials fear this may herald lengthy negotiations which could
jeopardise decisions on the other state aid cases, and the EC industry's own
restructuring plan. 'It's out of the question to come to a decision on the
Spanish plan, or on Ekostahl, if at the same time we drag our feet on Ilva,'
said one senior official.
The Ilva restructuring plan involves creating a company, Nuova Siderurgica,
specialising in flat laminates. Nuova Siderurgica, with assets of L2,770bn
(Pounds 1.19bn) and net shareholders' funds of L1,900bn, would be profitable
and have a 'balanced' financial position, according to Iri. Net borrowing at
the group would be just a fraction of Ilva's L7,583bn net debts at the end
of last year.
Other Ilva operations and shareholdings will be sold to raise L2,700bn. The
proceeds would go to lower Ilva's debts. The group, Europe's fourth biggest
steelmaker, reported a net group loss of L2,309bn last year on sales of
L10,087bn.

BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer, is close to completing the redesign of
a vital component for 747 jumbo jets. A new type of fuse pin used to secure
an aircraft's engine to the wing is likely to be available by late summer.
The redesign follows two airliner crashes in which Boeing 747s are believed
to have lost engines - in October 1992 when an El Al aircraft came down on
Amsterdam and the 1991 crash of a China Airlines 747 in Taiwan.
According to Boeing, investigations into the cause of the first crash showed
that fuse pins may have broken. Inspections have revealed that water
droplets, trapped in the tube-shaped fuse pins, could lead to microscopic
corrosion, which might develop into cracks. The new fuse pin designed by
Boeing is made of stainless steel, which is not susceptible to corrosion.
However, the company said that before the pins could be installed in
aircraft they had to undergo extensive testing and be certified by the US
Federal Aviation Administration. National regulatory agencies will determine
whether a retrofit is mandatory or voluntary. There are more than 900 Boeing
747s in operation.

The governorship is among the most coveted in the Italian public service

FT  04 MAY 93 / IG Metall begins strike: Engineering and steel stoppages in
protest at wages in east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, will today step up its
strike action in eastern Germany unless the employers reinstate a cancelled
contract aimed at equalising eastern and western wages by next year.
The strike, which started yesterday and is the first officially held in
eastern Germany since 1933, affected five steel plants in Berlin-Brandenburg
and 19 metal and engineering sectors in the heavy-industry state of Saxony,
as well as the state's four steel plants. In all, over 14,000 workers came
out in support of IG Metall, but with less enthusiasm than expected by the
union which is dominated by westerners in eastern Germany.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, president of IG Metall, told workers in Dresden: 'We
didn't want to strike. We were forced into it by the employers. But we will
strike as long as is necessary and we will win.'
Last night, Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of Saxony, tried to mediate
between the union and employers, but Mr Steinkuhler said he did not expect
any immediate results from the meeting. Instead, he warned that the five
eastern German states would be engulfed in an indefinite strike unless the
employers returned to the negotiating table and gave the metal and
engineering sectors a 26 per cent pay increase this year, and the steel
sector a 21 per cent rise.
These claims were part of the original contract, signed between IG Metall
and the employers and eastern German managers in March 1991. But the
collapse of the east European and Soviet markets, combined with the
recession in western Germany, forced the employers to cancel the contract.
They have since recommended pay increases of around 9 per cent.
Both Gesamtmetall, the metal and engineering employers' association, and
Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' association, yesterday said
they would not reinstate the contract. 'We simply cannot afford it,' steel
employers said, adding that much of the sector was already heavily
subsidised and saddled with large debts.
IG Metall has responded by saying eastern Germany should not be turned into
a low-wage economy, even if that might help make the region competitive in
the long term.
IG Metall's strategy is now aimed at increasing day by day the number of
plants which will be affected by strikes. Over 50 enterprises have been
selected in the metal and engineering sectors in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania
and Saxony and steel plants in the five states. Metal and engineering plants
in the remaining three states of Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and
Berlin-Brandenburg will be balloted if a compromise cannot be found over the
next week or so.

FT  04 MAY 93 / West would take strain of Bosnian deal: Experts estimate
70,000 international troops could be needed to monitor peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPLEMENTATION of the Bosnian peace plan brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen in Athens at the weekend will present the international community - and
the western allies in particular - with huge problems.
The plan, which comes into effect 72 hours after the United Nations Security
Council has approved it, probably within the next few days, will require an
international force estimated by experts at between 50,000 and 70,000 men.
It has been notoriously difficult for the UN to persuade reluctant member
nations to contribute the necessary forces for peacekeeping operations round
the world. But Nato has come to the rescue in the case of Bosnia by offering
to take on the task on behalf of the world organisation.
Few pledges have so far been received from individual countries, but Nato
planners had some good news at the weekend when the White House announced
that the US was working with Nato allies on the creation of peacekeeping
ground forces.
Such forces could include Americans if a peace accord was implemented in
Bosnia, Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said.
If Nato becomes the main instrument for peace enforcement in the former
Yugoslav republic, that will solve at least one American problem. The US has
always been reluctant to place its troops under UN command, but has had no
such objections against a Nato commander, not least because the alliance's
commander-in-chief is traditionally an American.
More difficult, on the other hand, will be the incorporation of any Russian
and other eastern European troops into a Nato peacekeeping force, although
the problem may well be solved by the reluctance - or inability - of any of
these countries to make troop contributions.
France, too, has serious reservations about an overall Nato command, since
it is not a member of the alliance's integrated military organisation. The
problem does not appear intractable, however. The whole peace enforcement
operation could still be put under the umbrella of the UN, with Nato acting
as its military executant.
Another big problem is the speed with which troops would be deployed; they
need to be on the ground quickly. Under the plan, all heavy weapons have to
be withdrawn from Sarajevo within five days of a ceasefire coming into
effect and from all other frontline positions within 10 days. All Serb,
Moslem and Croat forces must be withdrawn to the provinces designated by the
Vance-Owen plan to their three communities within 45 days.
It is clear that all these redeployments will require the presence of UN
troops to oversee and monitor them.
Yet the logistical problems are enormous, according to Field-Marshal Sir
Richard Vincent, chairman of Nato's military committee, and it remains
doubtful whether troops can be deployed as rapidly as the peace plan
demands.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Seeds of peace fall on inhospitable ground: Laura Silber on
prospects for the Vance-Owen initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina aims to reinvent a state
on the ashes of war. But the chances for the treaty to take root remain
remote.
Under intense pressure from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and
increasing threats of military intervention, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, on Sunday caved in and initialled the Vance-Owen peace
plan. If implemented, the agreement would abolish his self-proclaimed Serb
state, which covers nearly 70 per cent of Bosnia.
Mr Karadzic tomorrow will have to persuade hardline deputies to the
self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament to back the plan, which last week they
unanimously vetoed on the grounds that it transformed a 'brilliant military
victory' into a defeat. The plan calls for Bosnian Serbs to give up nearly
half the territory they now control.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators, detailed at the
emergency summit this weekend 'clarifications' to their plan which calls for
the division of Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces roughly along
ethnic lines. At the assembly session Mr Karadzic is likely to point to
these clarifications as 'concessions' which have made the plan acceptable.
Bosnian Serb leaders have stressed the importance of a corridor, running
across northern Bosnia to link Serb-held territories in Croatia and Bosnia
with Belgrade.
The mediators have also won an undertaking that Moslem or Croat troops will
not be allowed to return to provinces allocated to their ethnic groups where
there are Serb communities. Instead, they will be policed by UN troops.
But western diplomats say the apparent concessions are little more than a
face-saving mechanism to enable Serb leaders to present the plan as a
victory for Serbian interests.
Lord Owen's strategy, in part, was based on driving a wedge between leaders
from Serbia and Bosnia. Tough new sanctions were imposed on the rump
Yugoslavia after Bosnian Serb deputies rejected the plan, which heightened
Belgrade's fury against the Bosnian Serbs.
'If you look at the fine print, the concessions do not match Serbian claims,
or as they appear in Milosevic's speech,' said a diplomat referring to a
strongly-worded letter from the Serbian president and his Yugoslav
counterparts. In the first public criticism of Bosnian Serb leaders, they
warned that the intransigence was endangering 10m citizens of Yugoslavia,
comprised of Serbia and Montenegro.
Further, Mr Milosevic clearly exerted pressure on deputies to the Serbian
parliament in Belgrade to vote in favour of his letter, which was tantamount
to their approval of the Vance-Owen plan.
Bosnian Serb leaders previously rejected the plan as it did not give them
adequate guarantees of a secure northern corridor joining territory
designated as Serb.
The plan in its endorsed form envisages a 10km, increased from 2km,
demilitarised zone around a UN-monitored throughway. The agreement prohibits
the transport of troops or military equipment in this zone.
It also names 10 other UN 'blue routes' in Bosnia which will link ethnic
provinces.
Serb leaders also heralded the proposal on troop withdrawal as another
concession. It is relevant only in areas designated as Moslem where the
Serbs are in full control and proscribe Croat and Moslem troops from moving
into areas assigned to their control in 'province five', the area along the
strategic Drina River valley, even after the planned withdrawal of Serb
troops.
Peace negotiatiors have called for the despatch of 70,000 UN troops, to be
drawn up from Nato, including the US, and possibly Russia to protect
minority groups, in this case Serb communities. 'Province five' was mostly
Moslem until a year ago when Serb forces expelled or killed tens of
thousands of people in the valley.
Critics of the Vance-Owen plan point to the weaknesses of the peace plan in
Croatia, agreed in January 1992, which failed to demilitarise Serb
paramilitary troops and enable the return of refugees.
It is likely the agreement will be dogged at every step by the spectre of
the UN peace deal in Croatia. UN officials defend the Croatian plan for
stopping mass killing and destruction, but concede it was weakened by the
lack of political negotiations.
Conference negotiators have set out to avoid this pitfall by writing a
detailed political formula calling for elections to be held in each of the
10 provinces within 18 months. The UN troops will protect the minorities at
least until then.
The plan's success hinges in part on the extent to which Serbs are ready to
give up their idea of uniting Serb-held territories within a Greater Serbia.
It also hinges on whether Croatia will allow the independence of adjacent
Croat-designated territories.
Sarajevo, the besieged Bosnian capital, is to be demilitarised under the
plan. Over the next week it will be an indicator of whether Serbs are ready
to reach a peace in Bosnia.
If the plan is approved, the key to implementation will be how quickly the
UN Security Council responds to troop deployment.
Negotiatiors are also aware that the chance of reversing the horrors of war
is slim. As Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the peace talks, said: 'We have
now done the easy part.'

FRANCE believes that Britain shares its 'reservations' about the use of air
strikes, designed to cow the Bosnian Serbs but which also endanger the 7,500
peacekeeping troops the two countries have in the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Edouard Balladur, French premier, said yesterday on the eve of his trip
later today to London for his first meeting in office with Prime Minister
John Major that he hoped to achieve a 'homogenous' Anglo-French position on
the way forward in Bosnia.
'We are very concerned not to take counter-productive measures, which
instead of calming the fighting could increase it,' he told journalists. He
believed that opinions were divided on the issue of possible air strikes to
reinforce United Nations sanctions and the Vance-Owen peace plan, even
within the US administration. The premier will meet Mr Warren Christopher,
US secretary of state, in Paris this morning.
On the other main subject of today's meeting at Downing Street, Mr Balladur
said he hoped to convince Mr Major that Europe should not rush ahead with
the Gatt trade negotiations, but that it should take the time to prepare 'a
durable, balanced agreement taking account of all European interests'. He
did not accept that 'any agreement is better than none at all'.
France will shortly be sending its EC partners its detailed comments on all
15 trade sectors treated in the current Uruguay Round. Mr Balladur said he
would discuss with Mr Major the need for Europe to win concessions in
several of these areas - in particular copyright protection, services and
dispute settlement.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday kept up pressure on Bosnian Serbs ahead
of the vote tomorrow by their self-styled parliament on the Vance-Owen peace
plan, signed by Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic on Sunday.
Bolstering warnings delivered in Europe by Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, President Bill Clinton said in brief comments prior to a
meeting with Mr Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, that the US was
ready to support a United Nations peacekeeping effort with a substantial US
military involvement.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, said Nato was working on a
peacekeeping plan with the UN. She noted that although Mr Clinton had ruled
out a unilateral deployment of US ground forces in Bosnia, participation in
'the implementation of a mutually agreed peace treaty' was under
consideration.
Mr Clinton scheduled another afternoon meeting yesterday with senior
advisers, at which the US contribution to a peacekeeping force was again to
be discussed.
Some controversy centres on the command of such an operation.
Although the US force still in Somalia reports to a Turkish general
appointed by the UN, it is assumed that the Pentagon would be uncomfortable
if it enjoyed less than effective control over an operation as dangerous as
that in Bosnia.
Nevertheless, the administration is taking cautious - if temporary -
satisfaction from the perception that its threat to use military force in
Bosnia seems to have been influential in bringing about the provisional
Athens agreement.
There is also a more palpable sense of vindication that US support for
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia has paid immediate dividends in the
Balkans. Pressure from Moscow on Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president, is seen as instrumental in getting Mr Karadzic to sign the
Vance-Owen plan.
This qualified sense of achievement is, however, tempered by the awareness
that the war in Bosnia is far from over and that Mr Karadzic's signature may
yet mean nothing.
'I want to evaluate them (the Bosnian Serbs) by their actions,' Mr Clinton
said yesterday, repeating his weekend comments of the importance of 'deeds,
not words'.
Before he agreed to put 'one American soldier there. . . we're going to
watch events,' he said, adding he would talk 'directly to the American
people about it'.
US participation in a peacekeeping force would not be politically risk-free
at home, especially if it involved the deployment of 20,000-30,000
personnel.
A Newsweek poll published yesterday found 60-27 per cent opposition to
sending ground forces, while a Time-CNN survey found 52 per cent believed
the US had already done enough to stop the fighting in Bosnia.
The administration hopes, however, that politicians and the public would be
more willing to support an allied peacekeeping operation under a UN umbrella
and with Nato's engagement than a unilateral approach.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Netherlands 'likely to escape recession'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE outlook for the Dutch economy is 'mediocre', with growth likely to fall
below 1 per cent in 1993 before rebounding to around 2 per cent in 1994,
according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Despite its predictions of a lacklustre immediate future, the OECD seems to
provide additional support for the widely held Dutch view that the economy
will probably be able to escape the recession plaguing neighbouring Germany,
which is the Netherlands' biggest trading partner and accounts for up to 30
per cent of its exports.
Like most other European economies, Dutch growth is faltering. 'But in the
Netherlands this cyclical episode is likely to be relatively mild, in part
because of the absence of many of the imbalances that typically characterise
the end of a period of expansion,' the OECD says in its biannual report on
the country.
However, it cautions that its predictions of a muted downturn were based on
projections made in late February and that the German economy has
deteriorated further since then. It warns that Dutch growth rates may have
to be revised downwards to take this into account.
The OECD cites a number of strengths in the Dutch economy. Inflation, which
increased to 4.1 per cent in 1991, is already falling and is significantly
below that of Germany. The current account surplus is healthy and the
guilder strong, a factor that has enabled the Dutch central bank to trim
interest rates independently of the German Bundesbank several times in the
past six months without affecting the currency's firmness.
An important weak spot in the economy is the labour market.
Although 'narrow' unemployment is about 6 per cent and low by international
standards, there are nearly 1m people receiving disability benefit out of a
population of only 15m, suggesting a large degree of 'hidden unemployment'.
The Paris-based organisation believes the Dutch government should
concentrate on tightening the disability scheme and on correcting structural
imbalances in the field of competition, in particular, where the Netherlands
has traditionally scored poorly compared with the rest of the OECD.
It notes that the Netherlands is already starting to change its policy on
cartels and price-fixing, and urges swifter introduction of market forces in
the public sector. Deregulation and privatisation should be considered in
utilities, health care and public transport.

THE annual meeting of the World Health Organisation yesterday voted
overwhelmingly to bar the rump Yugoslavia from the work of the 185-nation UN
agency, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
The resolution to oust Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, was
passed by 125 votes to three, with 26 abstentions. Russia, Zimbabwe and
Yugoslavia voted against the resolution.
The move was sponsored by neighbours Albania, Croatia and Slovenia, west
European countries, and Moslem nations such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran
and Turkey.
WHO officials stressed that the decision, which follows a similar vote in
the UN General Assembly last year, did not affect the organisation's
humanitarian programmes in Serbia, Montenegro and other former Yugoslav
republics. It has about 50 staff in the rump Yugoslavia.
Yesterday's resolution says the republic cannot automatically assume its WHO
seat and must reapply for membership.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Yeltsin's enemies trip up with an own-goal

TELEVISION pictures of Communist demonstrators charging Russian police on
May Day are the latest contribution to a vigorous media campaign which is
proving President Boris Yeltsin's most powerful weapon against his political
opponents.
After blaming the media for the president's referendum victory, the hardline
opposition scored an own-goal on Saturday when up to 300 people were hurt
during the first violent demonstration in Russia since the demise of the
Soviet Union.
Having relied on aggressive advertising and sympathetic coverage of the
conflict with parliament to win last month's referendum, the Yeltsin camp
has moved quickly to exploit what it described as a provocation by
neo-Communists who could not cope with defeat.
Almost every news programme over the weekend replayed footage of the
violence.
In an ironic twist, pensioners at the May Day rally included Mr Vladimir
Kryuchkov, the former Soviet KGB chief who once accused pro-Yeltsin
demonstrators of wanting to seize power and who is now facing trial for his
part in the 1991 coup.
Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, said hardline deputies
who organised the demonstration had to bear responsibility for events.
Suggesting there would be tough action to prevent a recurrence of violence,
he said society had to prevent holidays being turned into a 'struggle with
the people'.
Mr Yevgeny Kiselyov, the respected TV journalist who interviewed Mr Filatov,
described Sunday's violence as 'an attempt to achieve success by naked force
on the part of those who suffered defeat in the referendum'. In defiance of
any possible ban, the unrepentant National Salvation Front (NSF) has already
announced a rally for May 9, the anniversary of the Soviet defeat of Nazi
Germany.
Mr Mikhail Astafiev, a deputy and NSF leader, described coverage of the
weekend events as a 'falsification'.
The media are motivated by a mixture of pressure from government paymasters
and voluntary support, born of a perception of Mr Yeltsin as the lesser of
two evils in the conflict with his opponents.
Such a perception, for instance, motivates the pro-Yeltsin line of Izvestiya
newspaper which has spent months fighting off attempts by Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, the parliamentary chairman not known to embrace press freedoms,
to take it over.
On Friday, Mr Khasbulatov, who blamed Mr Yeltsin's victory on media
'terror', disbanded parliament's media committee to rectify the
'Goebbels-style lies' of the president's media chief.
Shorn of all members except for its chief, a deputy from the hardline
Russian Unity bloc, the committee was accused of disobeying instructions to
allocate air-time in proportion to the factions represented in the
conservative-dominated parliament.
Having started off with a distaste for anything smacking of Communist-style
propaganda when Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar first launched radical economic
reforms a year ago, the Yeltsin administration is now making full use of the
media. It remains to be seen whether it will put its advantage to good use.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Peace plan may be rejected, warn Bosnian Serbs: Karadzic
expects hard struggle in assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BOSNIAN SERB hardliners yesterday warned that it was far from certain their
self-styled parliament would ratify a Bosnian peace agreement, signed under
great pressure by their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, in Athens on Sunday.
The fate of the plan, brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the United
Nations and European Community mediators, now depends on the outcome of a
meeting of the assembly in the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters at Pale, near
Sarajevo, tomorrow.
Both Lord Owen and President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who played key
roles during the hastily convened summit of the Bosnian warring factions in
persuading Mr Karadzic to sign the agreement, have expressed confidence that
the Bosnian Serb assembly would finally endorse it. Mr Milosevic has even
indicated that he would go to Pale to address the assembly.
But Mr Karadzic, who has announced that he will resign if the parliament
rejects the peace plan for a third time, said yesterday he expected a hard
struggle to persuade the parliament to back it.
Under the plan, Bosnia would be divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces,
largely on ethnic lines, and the Bosnian Serbs would have to give up more
than one-third of the territory they now occupy.
Even more discouraging were the remarks at the weekend of Mr Momcilo
Krajisnik, president of the Bosnian Serb assembly, who said Mr Karadzic's
signature did not in any way mean actual acceptance of the agreement.
'I believe it must be reworked and cannot be accepted in its present form,'
he said.
Meanwhile, Nato's offer to take on the peace-keeping task on behalf of the
UN, which is already overstretched by its commitments around the world,
received a boost yesterday when the White House announced it was prepared to
contribute ground troops to such an operation.
Nato military experts have estimated that implementing the Vance-Owen peace
plan will require at least an extra 60,000 troops, of which the US would be
likely to contribute at least a third.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the House of Commons select committee
on defence, said Britain could possibly provide some 10,000 peace-keeping
troops.
At the same time, the US has made it clear it wants the international
community to keep up the pressure on Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs -
including the preparation of military options - in case the Bosnian Serbs do
not honour the peace agreement.
A statement to this effect was issued after five hours of talks in Britain
on Sunday between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, Mr John
Major, prime minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, defence secretary.
The statement said the US and UK would continue to develop 'a common
position with our partners and allies on stronger measures to be taken if
the Serbs fail to implement the peace settlement. Several options are under
consideration, including military steps'.
However, no reference was made to well-publicised British reservations about
the desirability of military action.
Mr Christopher yesterday met the foreign ministers of Spain and Greece on
the second day of a mission aimed at building a consensus among western
allies on the need to take military measures if the Bosnian Serbs do not
implement the peace plan. He later flew to Paris and was due to visit Nato
headquarters in Brussels.
In the US, NBC television yesterday reported that US special forces troops
were already in Bosnia, gathering intelligence and selecting potential
targets for air attacks.

The Spanish peseta has regained some of its strength in the European
exchange rate mechanism grid, rising from bottom place to
second-from-bottom. Its rise has partly been due to last week's strong
indications that the Bundesbank will continue to cut Germany's short term
interest rates this month, reducing pressure on the peseta/D-Mark cross
rate. Bank of Spain intervention has also supported the currency, although
dealers remain concerned that this has led to a heavy depletion of official

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S opposition Social Democrats, the main challengers to the rule of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, were thrown into disarray yesterday by the sudden
resignation of their leader, Mr Bjorn Engholm.
His decision to quit as party leader and as premier of Schleswig-Holstein,
ostensibly for misleading a parliamentary inquiry in his home state, leaves
the party adrift less than a year before the start of a series of 19 local,
state, national and European elections.
Mr Engholm announced his move at an emotional press conference, after he had
admitted lying about his inside knowledge of a 'dirty tricks' campaign
against him by the rival Christian Democrats in Schleswig-Holstein in 1987.
He said the affair had damaged his political credibility, without which he
could lead neither his state nor the SPD. He remains one of the most popular
politicians in the country, alongside Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former
foreign minister, and Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of the CDU.
The SPD announced that Mr Johannes Rau, its most senior vice-chairman, prime
minister of North Rhine-Westphalia and the party's challenger to Mr Kohl in
1987, would take over as leader until a new party chief could be elected.
Leading candidates include Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of Lower
Saxony, and Mr Rudolf Scharping, prime minister in the Rhineland Palatinate.
However, Mr Schroder is blamed for harming Mr Engholm in recent weeks by
allowing his own ambitions to be known.
Mr Rau admitted that the affair was 'a heavy blow' for the Social Democrats,
who have been struggling to gain a clear political lead in spite of the
current sharp economic recession and squabbling within the ruling coalition.
Political observers in Bonn remain baffled at Mr Engholm's decision to quit
for lying about the precise moment at which he knew of the dirty tricks
campaign being conducted against him by Mr Uwe Barschel, the CDU premier in
Schleswig-Holstein. The question was whether he knew before the polling day,
or only afterwards.
Mr Barschel's press spokesman revealed at the time that he had co-ordinated
a series of smear stories against Mr Engholm. As a result of the
revelations, the elections were rerun, with victory for the SPD, and Mr
Barschel was found dead in a hotel bathroom in Geneva, having apparently
committed suicide.
In recent weeks, it has emerged that Mr Barschel's press spokesman had
received DM40,000 (Dollars 25,000) from one of Mr Engholm's closest aides,
in apparent payment for information about the dirty tricks campaign.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Extra supervisory powers for Bank will be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW LEGISLATION to revise the Bank of England's banking supervisory powers
will not be introduced until 1994 at the earliest.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, promised last October that the government
would act to give the bank express powers to refuse or revoke authorisation
of banks where proper supervision was impossible.
The pledge was part of the government's response to the inquiry headed by
Lord Justice Bingham into the supervision of the collapsed Bank of Credit
and Commerce International.
In July last year, the Bank of England asked for a new, explicit power to
deal with banks that could not be supervised effectively, whether on
structural or other grounds.
Lord Justice Bingham concluded that such banks could be dealt with under the
existing Banking Act, but accepted that explicit powers should be given if
that would strengthen the Bank of England's hand.
Responding to the Bingham report, Mr Lamont said he would vigorously pursue
all its recommendations, and would introduce legislation when parliamentary
time allowed. There were, however, far too many bids from departments for
legislation in the new parliamentary session that will begin in November,
and the banking bill was eliminated early on by the government's business
managers.
The only bill that is in the schedule as a piece of Treasury legislation is
a 'technical and essential' measure on European Community finance.
Ministers appear to have taken into account that the intense political
pressure over BCCI is past its peak, and that progress has been made in the
non-legislative areas of Bingham's recommendations. The Bank of England, for
example, has set up new legal and investigative units in an attempt to
assess better whether banks are being managed honestly and prudently.
Even so, MPs who have been campaigning on behalf of BCCI's UK depositors are
likely to be angered by the apparent relaxation in the government's attitude
towards this aspect of recommended changes after BCCI.
MPs will have an opportunity to raise the issue with Mr Lamont during the
inquiry by the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs into the role of the
Bank of England.

FT  04 MAY 93 / BAe and Matra set to merge missile units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace is on the verge of merging its Dynamics missiles
subsidiary with the guided weapons business of the French Matra-Hachette
conglomerate, creating one of Europe's largest guided weapons companies.
The two companies are expected to announce this week agreement to form a
joint company combining their respective guided weapons operations. The new
company's annual turnover will be in excess of Pounds 1bn.
According to today's issue of Flight International magazine, the British and
French governments are 'aware of the situation' and are likely to give their
blessing.
The merger is a significant step in the consolidation and rationalisation of
Europe's defence and aerospace industry, accelerated by the reduction in
government defence spending since the collapse of the eastern bloc.
BAe, one of Britain's largest manufacturing companies, had wanted to form a
partnership with other European defence groups for its missiles operation as
part of its recovery and restructuring strategy.
Two years ago BAe sought to merge its lossmaking guided weapons business
with that of the French-based Thomson-CSF group, but the deal collapsed.
Thomson-CSF has since linked up with Short Brothers of Belfast to develop
short-range ground-to-air missiles.
BAe was in talks with the private Matra group last year for a possible sale
of its space activities to the French company, but the two failed to agree
on a price. However, they maintained close contact and have been negotiating
a merger of their missiles businesses for some months.
With 5,000 employees, BAe's Dynamics division is the larger employer, but
the two missiles businesses have about the same turnover. Matra's missile
sales totalled around FFr5bn (Pounds 600m) last year while BAe's Dynamics
subsidiary had annual sales of around Pounds 500m.
Matra has long wanted to forge a European partnership for its defence
activities in preference to taking part in a restructuring of the French
domestic missiles industry with the state-controlled Aerospatiale and
Thomson-CSF.
The BAe/Matra move coincides with an intensification of missiles
collaboration talks between Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF, as well as between
Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace.
It is also in line with a wider BAe strategy of strengthening its aerospace
activities through overseas partnerships. It recently merged its regional
jet activities with Taiwan Aerospace, and is engaged in talks with Casa of
Spain and other manufacturers about rationalising its turbo propeller
commuter aircraft business. BAe declined to comment on reports of the
merger.

FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (10): The deals keep flowing in -
Property company / Profile of New World Development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTACTS and capital are the key pre-requisites for getting deals in
Southern China, and New World Development has both in abundance. The Hong
Kong property developer has already committed to 51 separate projects in
China with a total value of more than Dollars HK50 bn.
Pouring this amount of capital into a politically-volatile emerging market
such as China might be considered rash, but to New World's managing director
Henry Cheng Kar-shun, the strategy holds compelling logic.
He claims: 'If you don't have confidence in China, you shouldn't invest in
Hong Kong,' arguing that the risk profile of the two 'countries' has become
broadly similar, as a result of their continuing economic inter-dependence.
Like most elder businessmen in Hong Kong, Henry Cheng's father, Mr Cheng
Yu-tung, should understand the concept of China risk; at the age of 14 he
was forced to flee to the Portuguese colony of Macau, to escape the turmoil
of the Sino-Japanese war. But as with many refugees from the mainland, New
World's founder and chairman shows no qualms about returning home.
But he is doing so cautiously. In spite of the growing list of deals, New
World has invested less than Dollars HK2bn so far, and the company has moved
away from its traditional core business of property, into less risky areas
such as power stations and roads.
The China push is effectively a combination of opportunity and necessity.
New World is Hong Kong's third largest property developer, owning more than
4m sq. ft. of property in the world's second most expensive property market.
But the company lacks a sizeable local land bank for future development,
leaving it without the basic raw material for its prime business.
Like Hong Kong's manufacturers in the 1980s, New World has therefore decided
to make use of cheap resources across the border, and in just two years of
fervent negotiation, it has built up a China land bank which is ten times
the size of that in Hong Kong. A few of the mass residential developments
for which it is known in Hong Kong are being replicated in China, but most
of its property projects are to be constructed in phases over a lengthy
periods of time. In addition, the ability to pre-sell flats before
construction has even started, allows the company to launch projects which
are effectively self-finance.
The other main prong of the company's China strategy is infra-structural
projects, such as roads and power stations.
There are three keys to investment in China, according to Mr Henry Cheng:
'You have to understand the thinking of the Chinese people, you have to have
good relations with Chinese officials, and you must want to invest there as
a long-term investor, rather than attempting to make quick money and then
running away."
Relations with local officialdom are probably the key factor, and
competitors claim that Mr Cheng Yu-tung is exceptionally well-connected. Mr
Cheng hails from the city of Shunde, near the provincial capital of
Guangzhou. Like most Hong Kong businessmen, he has taken care to foster
local goodwill through the standard funding of hospitals and schools. This
has been a shrewd strategy, since the mayor of Guangzhou (Canton) Mr Li
Ziliu happens to share Mr Cheng's birthplace. New World's first big China
projects were a Dollars HK2.4bn deal to construct a 600 MegaWatt power
station and a section of the Guangzhou ring road; both are joint ventures
with Mr Li's Guangzhou municipal Government.
Fortunately for the company, it is investing in projects which have already
progressed beyond the planning stage, but which need capital support and
some project management expertise; the company can easily provide this. The
power stations have a guaranteed rate of return, and the highways have fixed
pre-arranged tolls. The key variable is the traffic, but on the company's
Guangzhou ring road project, vehicle flow is already three times the
projections in a 1990 feasibility study.
Mr Michael Green, research analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says: 'It is a
very sound strategy. The only real risk that they face is a currency risk,
but they have significant protection against that.'
Unlike other China investors such as Hopewell Holdings and Wharf, the
Cheng's have not gilded their expansion strategies with visionary terms;
they admit their only motive is profit, but the deals keep flowing in.
It took Hopewell Holdings more than a decade to negotiate its Super-highway.
But in two years, New World was able to sign up five highway projects; and
with the planning already undertaken by local government, the pay-back
period is shorter.
However, Mr Henry Cheng agrees that projects in Guangdong are becoming more
competitive - an example is the fact that his own company is already
constructing a 129-kms toll road alongside the proposed Phase II of
Hopewell's Super-Highway, from Guangzhou to Zhuhai.
So New World is already turning its attention northwards. It is to construct
a power station in Guangxi Province, and has signed property deals in
Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan and Tianjin.
Hong Kong companies have a poor track record for investing outside the
restricted but cozy borders of the colony, and New World is no exception,
with its poorly-timed Dollars US540m purchase of the Ramada Hotel group in
1989.
China represents the first real opportunity for Hong Kong companies to
expand into a business environment which they understand and recognise,
albeit through an excess of corruption and bureaucratic red tape.
Mr Cheng argues that 'Hong Kong needs the support of China, and China needs
the help of Hong Kong. It is mutually beneficial, but ultimately, China can
grow without Hong Kong.'
He intends to ensure that China has no choice.

FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: UB firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Biscuits were firmer in a stronger market, boosted by a broker buy
note, and renewed bid speculation ahead of the long holiday weekend.
The buy note from agency broker James Capel was based on recovery prospects
for Keebler, the US unit. The shares rose 16 to 426p also helped by a return
of bid speculation although most analysts were sceptical and the turnover of
3.3m shares provided little opportunity for stake building. Recent
speculation has focused on Cadbury Schweppes off a penny at 461p, and Hanson
up 1 1/2 at 231p, as likely bidders.
The composite insurance sector was given substantial support by Credit
Lyonnais Laing ahead of the first-quarter results season which gets underway
later this month. 'We think there is good momentum in the composites,' said
Mr Charles Coyne at CLL. The broker is particularly bullish about Royal
where it sees its current year forecast of a Pounds 4m loss as 'extremely
conservative.'
Commercial Union, rated a buy by CLL, settled 5 higher at 591p after
confirmation that the group's exposure to the Bishopsgate bomb outrage will
be no more than Pounds 25m. Royals eased to 318p.
Barclays added 7 to 429p and NatWest eased 3 to 458p after Kleinwort Benson
reaffirmed its switch recommendation. Press suggestions of big losses by
marketmakers SG Warburg and Kleinwort Benson, after the setbacks in equities
and derivatives this week, were rejected by senior traders around the
markets. Warburg shares rallied 9 to 652p and Kleinwort put on 4 to 393p.
A buy recommendation helped Reuters Holdings to an early rise. Kleinwort
Benson said the news and electronic information group had hit its lowest
rating since flotation in 1984. The shares were up 14 in early trade but the
gains were flattened out and closed 5 higher at 1259p.
Conglomerate Lonrho was the most heavily traded stock in London yesterday as
chart analysts predicted that the share price would hit 150p over the medium
to long term.
The shares will be helped by the higher price of precious metals. The stock
gained 5 to 98 1/2 p on , turnover of more than 13m.
Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries bounced 18 to 856p ahead of first
quarter results on Wednesday.
Pharmaceuticals Group Smith &amp; Nephew was actively traded, the shares closing
slightly firmer at 148 1/2 p on turnover of 10m. The volume reflected 5m
shares dealt at 147 1/2 p and a further 5m at 148p. Old bid speculation
returned and the company held a presentation at a Society of Investment
Analysts lunch earlier in the week.
Vague bid stories earlier in the week supported Lasmo which edged off the
bottom of the Footsie 100 list of companies and Lasmo shares were firmer at
152p. Fisons, the health and household company, dropped to the bottom of the
Index.
Packaging and paper group David S. Smith lifted 12 to 350p after announcing
a small acquisition.
Growing concern that the compact disc industry might be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission prompted Thorn to ease a penny to 847p.

FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Better first quarter results than expected from Shell Oil, Shell Transport's
US subsidiary, prompted renewed heavy US buying of the UK's two oil majors.
Shell Oil's profits of Dollars 239m compared with Dollars 183 for the same
period last year and were seen as best set of quarterly numbers since 1989.
The shares, unsettled earlier in the week as a number of big US institutions
switched out of the stock and into BP, staged a modest rally yesterday to
close 3 1/2 up at 554p on turnover of 5.8m. But specialists said they felt a
closer scrutiny of Shell US's numbers would trigger a strong response in
Shell shares when the London market reopens on Tuesday.
'These are super figures,' said Mr Nick Clayton, oil analyst at Smith New
Court, who said Shell's streamlining is now coming right after years of poor
performance by the company. Mr John Toalster at SGST, the French-owned
stockbroker and renowned bear of BP, said: 'The true recovery story in the
oil majors is not BP but Shell.'
BP boosted earlier this week by big switching from Shell, nevertheless
continued to gain ground following renewed US support. 'What's good for
Shell is good for BP,' said another oil analyst. BP set to announce first
quarter figures next Thursday rose 7 to 292 1/2p.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Irish Company News: Dublin sells remaining Greencore holding
 -Institutions take 30.4% stake after ADM pulls out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government has disposed of its remaining 30.4 per cent in
Greencore, the sugar, malting and milling group, to institutional investors
for a total of IPounds 70m (Pounds 68m) after ADM, the US food company,
pulled out of talks to buy the stake.
The deal valued the 25.4m shares at 275p each, a discount of about 7 per
cent on recent trading levels.
The government said yesterday that ADM 'decided not to continue further with
the discussions due to their long duration and public nature'.
News of ADM's interest leaked last February, pushing the shares above what
was believed to be ADM's offer of 260p.
Greencore's management had encouraged ADM to make a bid as part of the
company's strategic development plan aimed at using ADM's financial and
marketing muscle to expand into the European market.
Domestic political pressure, however, forced Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance
minister, to put the government's shares out to tender with the intention of
finding an Irish buyer.
No other offers came forward, however, after the Greencore board made it
clear that they favoured ADM.
Mr Gerry Murphy, Greencore's chief executive, said yesterday: 'We are
pleased at the successful placing of the government's holding which removes
the market overhang of our shares.'
Asked if he felt that the sale had been badly handled he said: 'It has to be
said one can only be disappointed. This has gone on so long and a lot of
effort was put in.
'But we have an excellent working relationship with ADM and all our options
are still open and we can still work with them in joint ventures as long as
it makes commercial sense for both companies'.
Mr Ahern acknowledged that 'ADM went away because of the public
controversy'.
He attacked what he called 'the politics of the negative left', referring to
opposition politicians who had objected to the sale to an overseas company.
Objections had also come from the Labour Party within the government
coalition.
Following the failure of the public tender, Mr Ahern said: 'What I was not
prepared to do was to let ADM walk away and then allow the overhang to
remain. Greencore has excellent strategic plans and ADM were part of those.
'I would hope that Gerry Murphy and his colleagues will continue to look for
partnerships, maybe with ADM or others that is for them to decide, but they
will certainly have my full support.'
The government continues to hold a 'golden share', which is intended to
prevent Ireland's sugar quota within the EC being transferred to another
company outside Ireland, which would threaten the livelihoods of thousands
of farmers who supply Greencore with sugar beet.

FOOD markets are wonderful, exciting and evocative. The colours they
generate, their scents and smells and bustle all paint a picture of how, not
so long ago, we all used to shop.
If you go with an open mind as to what to buy, markets can be inspirational
and vividly demonstrate just how the year is evolving - from the first
bundles of English asparagus to the first summer fruits (in France, the
first cherry crop is still despatched from Ceret in the Pyrenees to the
Elysee Palace) to the melon market of Cavaillon, to wild mushrooms and the
onset of autumn and the truffle markets of Piedmont.
Over the next few months Weekend FT food and drink writers will be visiting
some eye-catching markets, starting this week with Giles MacDonogh in Venice

SABENA, the parent company of the Belgian national airline, made a loss of
BFr975m (Dollars 30m) in 1992, Reuter reports from Brussels. Comparative
figures for 1991 were not available.
The loss was due to a general depression in airline business, increased
competition and lower revenue on cargo, the company said. The strength of
the Belgian franc against other currencies also weighed on the company.
Last month, the Sabena group announced a 1992 consolidated profit of BFr6m
against a 1991 loss of BFr2.44bn.

Liquid Carbonic will pay Dollars 15.2m to the state treasury and invest
Dollars 5.2m in the two plants it has bought.
BOC said it was committing Dollars 30m to the plants over five years.
The five Polish enterprises reported revenues worth Dollars 42.6m in 1991.
Poland's industry ministry was advised in the deal by Midland Montagu and

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROSS-PARTY group of MPs is to look again at whether the Bank of England
should be independent, as part of an extensive inquiry into the Bank's role.
The Treasury select committee's investigation will cover the Bank's
relationship with the government and with parliament - both in its own right
and in the light of the Maastricht treaty - and also its supervisory
activity. Ministers have repeatedly made it clear that they do not support
the idea of giving the Bank independence, and the report could provoke a
sharp clash between the government and the Tory-dominated committee.

<TEXT>
THE STAKES were raised in the parliamentary battle over the Maastricht bill
yesterday with the publication of the legal opinion obtained by Tory
Euro-sceptics about the amendment on the social chapter.
The opinion challenges the government's view that passing the amendment
would not affect the UK's ability to ratify the treaty. Almost 300 MPs have
put their names to the amendment, which would exclude from the bill the
protocol containing the social chapter and the UK's 'opt-out'.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the Commons, will consider over the
weekend which amendments to the legislation should be chosen for debate and
vote on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week when MPs resume their detailed
discussion of the bill. She will announce her decisions on Tuesday.

FT  01 MAY 93 / IMF announces global effort to boost growth: Early
completion of the Gatt Uruguay trade round is placed top of the agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE membership of the International Monetary Fund last night agreed to join
forces in a 'global co-operative effort' to boost world economic growth and
held out the prospect of lower interest rates in Europe, report Peter Norman
and Peter Marsh in Washington.
After a meeting of the Fund's policy making interim committee, member states
from the industrialised, developing and former communist countries issued a
unanimous declaration spelling out the efforts each group would make to
achieve sustained global expansion.
Most of the individual measures have already been announced by national
governments and their effectiveness will depend on their successful
implementation. But the statement will provide policy makers with a
checklist to ensure that their countries are living up to promises made to
boost growth.
The finance ministers and central bank governors comprising the interim
committee said they would monitor developments carefully to ensure the
hoped-for recovery will be consolidated. They said they supported
strengthening the IMF's surveillance of member policies so that problems in
the world economy such as crises on foreign exchange markets could be
identified and tackled in a timely manner.
Early completion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks was put
at the top of the list of measures to boost growth. The declaration said
that there was an 'immediate and urgent need' for a successful conclusion to
the round. 'Persistent failure to complete the round would not be a
standstill, but could reverse the trend of trade liberalisation which has
been an important contributor to growth'.
The statement allocated responsibilities to each group of countries.
Developing nations were urged to carry forward their economic reform
programmes. The statement said that the transformation of the former
communist countries to market based economies was a key element of the
co-operative growth effort. They were promised increased financial and
technical help while the finance ministers who drew up the statement urged
improved access for their goods to foreign markets.
The industrialised countries were allocated the 'central responsibility' for
strengthening growth prospects. The statement recalled the efforts already
being made by Japan to increase domestic demand and the US to reduce its
budget deficit. In Europe, it said conditions which should allow for a
further progressive reduction in interest rates are expected to continue to
improve in the period ahead.
The statement emphasised the importance of medium term strategies for
deficit reduction in nations such as the US with large structural budget
deficits. These would have a 'major favourable impact of interest rates,
private investment and job creation.'
Earlier, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, warned the US recovery
would be moderate. Other industrial countries would have to boost demand to
achieve a stronger world economy while the US cut its budget and trade
deficits.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has pledged extra efforts to unblock the stalled Uruguay Round of
trade liberalisation talks, raising hopes it can be completed this year.
At a reception for the finance ministers of the Group of Seven Countries,
President Bill Clinton said the US was ready to take 'exceptional actions'
to bring about an agreement.
The G7 finance ministers agreed on Thursday that a further opening of the
international trading system was indispensable for maximising world growth.
In their communique, they stressed that 'protectionism retards growth and
must be resisted'.
The G7 finance ministers will now put pressure on their respective
governments to strengthen progress on the Uruguay Round in the hope that
this year's G7 summit in Tokyo in July can give it decisive impetus.
Mr Don Mazankowski, the Canadian finance minister, said yesterday: 'There is
no single solitary thing we could do that would do more for the global
economy and global growth than the completion of the Uruguay Round.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Doctors: a life-threatening problem - Dominic Lawson urges
the government to break the medical profession's conspiracy of silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE UPON a time I was butchered by a dentist. He decided, after I had
walked in from the street complaining of a toothache, that a number of my
wisdom teeth needed to be extracted then and there. After titanic efforts,
he succeeded.
In the days following, my condition, as the bulletins say, went from bad to
worse. The dentist assured me that these were 'normal post-operative
conditions.'
Eventually my jaws locked and septicaemia set in, or so I was told by the
hospital surgeon before an emergency operation. As far as he was concerned,
the mess made of my teeth was consistent with the sort of injuries received
by people whose heads have come into violent contact with an unresisting
object.
When I emerged from hospital, I returned, with some vague thoughts of
violent revenge, to the practice where the dentist worked. I was told that
he had returned to New Zealand. At the time I harboured some suspicions that
the hospital had rung up the dental practice to let them know what had
occurred and that the man with the pliers had decided not to face the
consequences of his actions.
He need not have worried. I had no intention of sueing. As seems to be usual
in such incidents, and in ones far more serious than mine, the medical and
paramedical professions are never prepared to reveal to patients just what
they think of their colleagues, no matter how responsible the patient or how
irresponsible the colleague.
This is a principle defended as fiercely as the Hippocratic oath. The
reason, I think, is not mere loyalty to individual colleagues, or even a
sense of 'there but for the grace of God go I' It seems that the medical
profession wishes to create the impression that there are no such things as
bad doctors, that all practising surgeons have clear eyes and steady hands.
This guild mentality defies all reason and commonsense. There must be a wide
range of ability in any profession. Just as we must accept that there are
good, bad and awful journalists, there must also be good, bad and awful
doctors.
True, unlike journalists, who do not have to pass any exam, all practising
doctors must at some time have passed a stringent examination, invigilated
by their peers. But that does not mean that they do not fail to keep up with
developments, or become fuddled by alcohol in disappointed middle age.
Some months ago, on holiday, I met a doctor who, off duty, let slip the
unspoken truth, known to those inside his profession but hidden from those
outside. It was at the time of the government's publication of tables
monitoring, for the public's benefit, the length of operating waiting lists
in the various National Health Service hospitals.
'These tables,' said the doctor, 'are not the things you really need to know
as a patient. What you need is the tables showing the rates of deaths from
specific sorts of operations at all the big NHS hospitals. You would be
amazed to see the differentials in death rates following even routine
operations.'
'Where can I see these tables?' I asked.
'You can't,' he replied. 'But I can, and I can assure you that I'd study
them very carefully before deciding where I'd go for a big operation.'
On Tuesday, however, The Times blew the medical profession's cover by
publishing tables taken from statistics on hospital performance issued to
health authorities by the department of health. These showed that some
hospitals had death rates after general surgery six times higher than
others.
Naturally, the medical profession pooh-poohed the notion that this proved
that some hospitals were simply very bad at surgery compared with others.
The director of public health in Yorkshire, Dr Bob Haward, whose hospitals
featured among the very worst, said: 'What happens in a hospital depends on
what is going on outside it. I don't find death rates helpful.'
Nor, too, I imagine, do dead patients. The figures did not give the full
picture. For that we will need to see the sort of tables that my doctor
friend can see, showing death rates operation by operation.
Only when that happens will the government have truly honoured its pledge to
give NHS users the information they deserve as consumers. And only then will
we start to see a decline in medical complacency and incompetence.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The chancellor turns to Zorgs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DON'T mention green shoots of economic spring to me. Not when I am sitting
here in a rainforest of creepers, vines and carnivorous orchids so luxuriant
and swift-growing that I cannot see sunlight or moonlight or anything - a
tropical paradise of economic indicators so virile and upthrusting that
yesterday I rang my close and valued friend, Norman Lamont, Britain's
chancellor of the exchequer, to garner his reaction.
Norman has taken a shine to me ever since, a bold eight weeks ago, Hawks &amp;
Handsaws U-turned with great suavity and declared that - far from blaming
him for Britain's manifest ills and woes - we should honour him for taking
the blame for John Major's policies; that his strength and insouciance were
little short of miraculous, and that he reminded us of Churchill (also of
Hercules, stinting we were not).
Yesterday I asked Norman what it felt like, how did it really feel, to see
Britain's economy rocketing into orbit.
He said: 'Jolly good, actually.'
I said: 'Give me more. Sparkling personal stuff. Material like that I pounce
on. I can use whatever you've got.'
'Well,' said the chancellor, 'the stats are looking good. 0.2 per cent. 0.6
per cent. 0.6 per cent. 1.2 per cent. Minus 52,000, seasonally adjusted.
Structural, not cyclical. Yield curve sloping upwards. GDP ebullient. 1.5
per cent. 2.5 per cent. 3.7 per cent. Broad money holding. Inflation not a
problem. Trend-lines converging. 7.3 per cent. 9.7 per cent. Exports surging
manically. Stuff your German cars. Pounds 115bn. Dollars 517bn. FFr952bn.
Exchange rate trending higher. DM2.90. DM3.00. Perhaps we're looking at 4.
'All of Europe watching us. Stretched to breaking with envy. One in the eye
for Clinton. Teach him to dodge the draft. Eyes of the world on Britain. Our
leadership role regained. Naturally I'm delighted. I said it would be
alright. Trust me, I told the nation. The abuse I had to contend with.
Tabloids out to get me. Every black trick in the book. But water off a
duck's back. Now it's all come good. The green shoots of spring have turned
into barleyfields, hopfields, tundra and emerald swathe, a swampland of
orchids. Is this the stuff you want?'
'Magical,' I replied. 'But show me your innermost feelings. Take me inside
your head. Keep it reasonably personal. There's a market for personal
stuff.'
'Well,' said the chancellor, 'I'm singing in the bath again. Songs from all
the shows. If I were a rich man. Oh what a beautiful morning. Let's spend
the night together. Tomorrow belongs to me.'
'Fascinating. But how does it actually feel to be running a miracle
economy?'
'Well,' said the chancellor, 'it's the best feeling in the world. It's like
 -gosh, Michael, how can I put this? - it's like, you know, you're in the
royal box on Derby day and you've just eaten the best lunch ever and then
you've walked down to the paddock with the royals and stood around
knowledgeably and on the way back to the grandstand you've plunked down
Pounds 10,000 on a 20-1 no-hoper that scoots in by five lengths, still
accelerating, and the Queen turns to you and says with that beautiful smile
of hers: 'Extremely impressive, Norman. Did you know the dam?''
I said: 'Magnificent material, chancellor. I pounce on stuff like this. But
what will you do for an encore?'
'Well,' said the chancellor. 'Economic miracles have to be consolidated. By
the time I become prime minister, I want to see Britain launched upon a
hi-tech glidepath from which it cannot be diverted. We must re-establish our
scientific eminence. As a result, I am in the throes of launching an
ultra-secret programme of scientific catch-up designed to catapult us once
more to the forefront of nations.
'No stone am I leaving unturned. Sumerian gesh-time. Gnomonics. Transitional
logic. Animism. Exobiology. Metamathematics. The polyhedral cohesion of
virus crystals. Prelinguistic thought. The evidence for blueshifting.
Re-mapping the computer universe. Black-body radiation. Twin-theory
phenomena. Star-ponds. Nonobjective truth. The divine essence. Nutean
surfaces. Zorgs. Infinite binary fractions. Mohole totalities. N-bottomed
matter-crush. The novels of Don DeLillo. How am I doing for length, Michael?
This the material you want?'
I said: 'I have got 716 words, chancellor. Exactly the right amount.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Private View: The Temple of Health is crumbling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN it rains, the water pours down the wall of his consulting room. 'I have
my umbrella, to make patients laugh,' said Dr. Kosta Manis, laughing
himself. 'Welcome to our Temple of Hygieia. Don't mistake it for the public
convenience, which is right next to it.'
The public lavatory tastefully flanking the mother-and-baby clinic of the
Erith Health Centre, Kent, is a robust brick building. The health centre has
holes in the roof, stains on the ceilings and floors, and scaffolding to
prop up the back wall. 'Remember,' said the doctor, 'you are not in Bosnia
or Nigeria now. You are 12 miles from Southwark Bridge.'
The health centre is not just a place of work for Dr Manis but his private
metaphor for Britain's National Health Service. Both structures, he says,
have been collapsing for the last 20 years.
Dr Manis is a witty man who loves an ironic phrase, the more extravagant the
better. He laughs a great deal because he feels strongly. When really
agitated, he laughs until the tears come.
The fact he is Greek, from Mani in the southern Peloponnese, may account for
his passion. It also explains his individualism, and his contempt for those
who profess to know what's best for the rest - especially the politicians
and administrators of the NHS.
He thinks the collapse of the British health service is no particular
government's fault, but the inevitable result of a wrong assumption at its
founding: that there was a fixed 'pool' of illness to be treated. But better
treatment means longer lives and the old, naturally, consume a
disproportionate amount of health care. Add to this the fact of an ageing
population, the cost of the technology, and a dash of hypochondria, and it
is no wonder the NHS proves to be grossly underfunded.
'Rationing' is a dirty word. These days it goes under the more genteel
American label of 'prioritisation' following the state of Oregon's bold step
in declaring which treatments it was prepared to subsidise and which not.
'Rationing used to be where in the queue the patient stands,' Dr Manis said.
'And the doctor would decide. But now it is not where in the queue you stand
but whether you stand there at all. Because now there are certain conditions
that are too expensive to treat.
'Of course,' he continued. 'the patients have no say in that. And this is
what annoys me more than anything else. They are the ones who pay me, pay my
nurses, pay the managers. But they have absolutely no say in the whole
thing.
'This is the basic fault of the NHS. Why should you have a manager sitting
up in his ivory tower deciding, not how long you wait for a hip replacement
but whether you can have a hip replacement at all, or renal dialysis, or a
heart transplant? He decides what happens to you although it's you that pays
his salary.'
But the patients can't decide, I objected. They would all want everything
tomorrow.
'Correct. Why not?'
Because they can't have it.
'Why not?'
Because you can't supply it, I said, unsure who was interviewing whom.
'Precisely. But you lead very nicely to the point: the patients are not told
the facts. They are not told that within the next 10 years the demands on
the service will be so immense that the Treasury will not be able to cope
with them.' Dr Manis rattled off the familiar statistics. 'To me, or anyone,
even - as Mrs Bottomley would say - to the mentally challenged it's obvious
that private funds will come into the game. Now why do they not have the
guts to stand up and say so? The doctors know it, the patients know it.'
This time Dr Manis supplied his own answer.
'Because they are cowards. You see, I think the British people are like a
kind, benign giant, kept down by those Lilliputian politicians.'
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, figures a lot in Dr Manis'
conversation: to him she is a sort of crypto-socialist nanny, the token
woman in the cabinet, 'the verbal computer spewing statistics' who has told
fibs about London's health provision and has destroyed the point of her own
government's NHS reforms by failing to abolish the expensive regional tier
of bureaucrats.
'If some politician was honest enough to stand up and say: 'Look here folks,
there's no money in the kitty so you'd better make your own arrangements,'
the British, who are pretty reasonable, talented, industrious people, would
say: 'Right. Forget changing the car every three years, forget the Japanese
computer games and the Dutch lager. Let's look after our health and the
health of our children.' There's plenty of money around. It's all to do with
. . . I can never pronounce it.
Prioritisation?
'That's the one]' Dr Manis chortled.
I thought the doctor was about to suggest that Britain adopt the American
health system. Not at all. It was an insensitive, profit-driven system of
winners and losers, he said.
So which is the right model?
'For me Switzerland is the model. It's absolutely beautiful. It's based on
community and it's a totally ungovernable system with no rules and about
1,000 permutations, with real diversity of offer and choice. The state plays
a part, individuals contribute according to their means and if there is a
gap, charity within the community fills it. Each individual decides what he
wants to do.'
How well he wants to be?
'Yes] You see, what is health to you?'
I suppose it does vary, I admitted. Some people want to be perfect in every
department.
'Right] So health is a sense of well-being as perceived by each individual.
Right? Therefore we cannot have Bottomley telling us about the health of the
nation. It's the health of the individual.
'If a rich man wants a health check every morning, good luck to him if
someone is prepared to take his money and do it.'
That's a waste of resources, I said.
'If he pays for it it isn't'
It's a waste of the doctor's time.
'Who is to say he should or shouldn't? Unless, of course, people emotionally
feel the state is a substitute for parents; if they feel Mrs Bottomley is
their mother and John Major is their dad. Are we to have the mother of the
nation telling us how we should be? We might as well go to China, where if
you've got a bad habit like being a homosexual the state doctor treats you
with electric shocks whether you like it or not.'
Dr Manis enthuses about consumer choice in a mixed health economy, but has
not a single private patient himself. He cannot swallow the idea of taking
money over the counter. Private medicine in Britain was parasitic on the NHS
where it should be complementary. 'Without mincing words, if you're a
consultant physician and you see that your private practice is falling, you
make your NHS queue longer so some will be forced to go private.'
Dr Manis is, I suppose, a libertarian with anarchic tendencies - which is
not to say he is not a first-rate general practitioner who loves his 3,300
patients and is loved in return. After another tirade against the health
secretary I asked him if he was a reactionary. He seemed pleased. 'Now,
you're doing very well. You have to move back to my childhood. I'll tell you
why.'
And he described with some emotion how, as a seven-year-old during the Greek
civil war, he and his family nearly starved to death when the town was
besieged by the communists. 'People were dying around us. You could actually
see the bullets coming through the window.' He laughed unhappily. His
father, he said, was a bank manager and would have been the first to be
murdered had the army not arrived in time. The son has hated authorit-
arianism ever since.
'I come from a country where we don't really believe in authority. Each
Greek is an individual and that's it. I think people should know what's
happening to them. It's up to them to decide. I don't want a politician to
impose private schemes or a social system.'
Dr Manis came to England in his 20s, intending to move on to the US where
many of the family had emigrated. Instead, he became a research fellow,
lecturer and registrar in renal medicine at Charing Cross hospital in
London, worked at the Dreadnought seamen's hospital in Greenwich until it
was closed, and went into general practice. He is married to Jill Cooper,
once England's fourth-ranked woman tennis player, and they have four
children. They live very modestly in bourgeois Bexley.
The doctor took me to see another illustration of his thesis that
bureaucracy is bad for your health. Five years ago, Erith Cottage hospital,
a thriving concern attracting much local charitable support, was declared
too expensive to keep going. There was an outcry. The hospital was reopened
and redecorated - as a suite of offices for health administrators.
Dr Manis was predictably caustic about Sir Keith Joseph, who introduced the
three-tier NHS. 'Hospitals used to be run by three people. Then the great
free marketeer appeared and he totally ruined all that.
'You see, the priests have failed,' he added suddenly.
I asked him to explain.
'Instead of going round politicising, they should remember their vocation.
They should participate, attract their flock and raise money, like the Greek
Orthodox in his village. He knows who is rich and who is poor. 'Do you want
a nice little flat in heaven? If you do, cough up because so-and-so's wife
is going to have twins.' So the rich man takes the peasant woman to hospital
in his limousine.'
As our tour of the constituency ended, the doctor warned that even the
tolerant British could lose patience.
'The politicians keep looking for this vision thing. As if the British
people expect Major and Smith to go into some sort of trance and start
talking metaphysics] Uttering aphorisms from their tripods]
'For heaven's sake, what people want is realism. They want their politicians
to have a grasp of reality, hear what the people want, and do it. Because if
they don't do it, the little man with the moustache will appear and start
building autobahns . . .
As we approached the railway station, he announced: 'I've got it. The NHS is
a large-scale, unethical experiment where not only the guinea-pigs - which
is the patients - were not asked whether they wanted to participate or not,
but even the technicians - which is the doctors and nurses - have not been
consulted. That's it. I got it.'
The doctor laughed, this time with real pleasure.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Arts: Candide's candid charms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF EVER a writer were famous for ridiculing others' views and finding
himself stuck with them, it is Francois Marie Arouet de Voltaire
(1694-1778). His Candide (1759) pilloried the optimistic enlightenment idea:
'tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes', and it became his
catchphrase.
Leonard Bernstein's musical, Candide, was written and rewritten between 1956
and 1974 with contributions from Lillian Hellman, John Latouche, Dorothy
Parker and Stephen Sondheim; its history was proof of Voltaire's own saying
that the best is the enemy of the good. Now it has reached the Richmond
Theatre in south west London in a production by the Liverpool Everyman. It
makes a fine intellectual pantomime: colourful, energetic and entertaining.
This is a picaresque tale of Candide and his fiancee Cunegonde, their
adventures in Westfalia, Spain, Latin America and Constantinople; it amounts
to a chaotic progress through Jesuit, Catholic, New World and Old World
values. One can almost hear Michael Palin packing for a 'Candide's
footsteps' TV travelogue. Bernstein wraps up with advice from Voltaire: do
not seek Happiness or Knowledge, do not think, just dig the garden.
This production's strengths lie in its simplicity and ingenuity. The set is
a schoolroom with oversize alphabet boxes and a slide. Director John Doyle
keeps the action moving at the speed of thought; the design is flexible and
the costumes are a delight, all bold coloured Lycra with added ruffs and
flounces.
The small cast doubles as musicians. Once Bernstein's vertiginous overture
is negotiated, the music and theatre hold together well. The choruses are
peppy and upbeat, including the peerless 'What a day for an Auto-da-Fe' sung
by the Spanish Inquisitors. There is fine singing from Elena Ferrari
(Cunegonde) and Kim Harwood (as the sexy maid, Paquette) opposite Richard
Felix as a felicitous Candide. Helen Ireland and Millie Taylor at the
synthesizer are the rest of the orchestra.
After Candide, Bernstein wrote West Side Story (1957). The key song in
Candide here is an answer to the more famous 'America'; it is a lovely
rumba, 'Easily Assimilated' sung by a Russian baroness (Judith Bruce) in a
Colombian brothel, and is about being a world citizen, fitting in to an
America which now contained all the worlds visited by Candide. Maybe it was
America which turned out to be the best of all possible worlds.
The Richmond Theatre (081-940-0088) until May 1

FT  01 MAY 93 / Arts: Branagh's fine support - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B A YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENNETH BRANAGH'S Romeo and Juliet on Sunday, a shared production between
Radio 3 and the Renaissance Theatre Company, was studious rather than
theatrical. Branagh, who produced in association with Glyn Dearman, has used
an almost complete text - I didn't spot more than about a dozen lines
missing - and the 'two hour's traffic of our stage' ran three hours and a
quarter (with two short intervals, a sensible idea).
The most dramatic performances were given in supporting parts rather than in
the leads. John Gielgud's Friar Lawrence was even better than one might have
forecast, perfect verse-speaking blended with a three-dimensional
characterisation of this amenable priest. Richard Briers, too, played a
notably human Capulet, a proud, irritable father easy to agree with as his
moods followed one another. The Nurse is an infallible part, yet Judi Dench
made it personally inventive.
It is not that the leading parts were unemotional, but they lacked the
individual brio that radio acting must have. Branagh's Romeo was decently
spoken, in his beautiful voice; but I bet it was more lively at the Lyric,
Hammersmith. And Samantha Bond's Juliet missed the great opportunity the
microphone offers; she was a moving young woman, but she was never a tearful
13-year-old. You can argue that no actress has ever played her so (nor I
dare say any boy in Shakespeare's company), but it is there in the lines and
recording gives the chance. The other young Veronese were a roistering
bunch; Derek Jacobi gave charm to Mercutio's silly Queen Mab speech, that I
would have cut if I had been directing in 1597, and the faintly dirty chat
was amusingly done. There was film-type music by Patrick Doyle that filled
the breaks without distraction. The performance is published at Pounds 15.99
by Random Century Audiobooks.
Afternoon serials on Radio 4 are a great substitute for the Strand Magazines
of other days, and this Wednesday we embarked on a new one with a fresh
background, the affairs of a public school headmaster. Patrick Balfour
(Steve Hodson) writes books and talks on the media besides running his
school, indeed the first play (as it is headed) began with an encounter
between Balfour and Brian Redhead. Perhaps he should do less, for we soon
learn that his son has been caught cheating in a GCSE paper at another
school where he is a boarder, while at his own, there is drug-trouble. 'They
can buy it at a cafe,' says his deputy Michael, and the French teacher says
there's no harm in it.
As if this were not enough, Patrick's wife Judith is too busy on committees
and things to be much help and he goes to his invalid son Timothy for family
talk and to his publisher Lindsay Nicholson for sympathy. We do not yet have
the school-feeling that other school-plays give, and the serial is clearly
about the head rather than about his school - Jonathan Smith, the author, is
a senior master at a public school. There are enough plots and sub-plots
generously to fill four weeks.
Porter's Return on Radio 3 covers five short talks by Andrew Porter, one of
the founder-members of the FT arts page. He left to be music critic of the
New Yorker and stayed there for 20 years, covering New York music for us as
well. Much of his New Yorker criticism was collected in book form. Now he is
back in this country, on another paper, and his talks compare music in
London and New York. He is an observant critic and an outstandingly good
speaker.
The Thin Blue Line, Radio 4's survey of the United Nations, virtually stayed
in New York last week ('where political decisions are supposed to be
translated into action,' as presenter James Naughtie said). This week we
were in Cambodia to observe that translation on the ground. A really
interesting series.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Arts: Taylor bounces out of Arts Foundation - Simon Tait
meets the saviour of Palumbo's baby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JUST INSIDE the Arts Foundation's front door there is a Bouncer
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
not a suit with muscles to expel belligerent artists, but a mini-trampoline.
'It's great when you get really angry and frustrated,' says Russell Willis
Taylor, the Foundation's director. 'A few bounces and you're ready to go
again.'
Innovation can arouse great passion, especially when money is involved. 'The
value, especially in tough times, is in just doing things in a different
way, introducing variables,' she says, 'and sometimes it's hard to get that
across.'
In rescuing Lord Palumbo's Foundation from an embarrassing shambles, Taylor
has reshaped it and given it policy, aim and credibility in less than a
year, and produced a scheme which might change arts patronage fundamentally.
But most frustrating for her is that she will not be around to give out the
fruits she has laboured to produce. She leaves the job today and flies to
Singapore tomorrow on a posting with her husband, an advertising executive.
Her successor was appointed only on Monday. It will be up to Prudence Skeene
 -well known in the arts community for her management and fund raising work
with the English Shakespeare Company, Ballet Rambert and the National
Theatre, and as chairman of the Arts Council's dance panel  - to implement
the Taylor system, in which artists nominate the emerging talents for
patronage.
Two years ago the Arts Foundation, financed by an anonymous bequest of
Pounds 1.1m to the Arts Council, was launched by the Council's chairman,
Lord Palumbo, to support new art with lavish - and, some said, unseemly -
hubris at a party in London's Docklands.
The worthy purpose was obscured by the airy flashiness. No need to apply,
the Foundation would know where the money was most needed. Pundits unfairly
accused Palumbo of hijacking the bequest (made with conditions) and
dismissed the Foundation as confused, remote and a slight to the Arts
Council.
Stephen Bayley, the first director - who had founded the Design Museum for
Terence Conran - declared that the Foundation would raise Pounds 20m from
private patronage, would revive the salons des refusees with an exhibition
of work rejected by establishment institutions, create facilities such as a
recording studio and a gallery 'to break the cartel of the art trade', make
a television programme about patronage, even found a record label.
None of it happened, and very little money was raised by the Foundation,
which was run from Bayley's consultancy. Some grants went out, though, for
example for the resurrection of a prize for new books about the performing
arts. But after six months Bayley went and Palumbo and his trustees took
another six months to find Taylor.
She had been hugely successful raising money for English National Opera,
probably as much as Pounds 3m, and had won ABSA's Garrett Award for it. 'I
thought the same as everybody else did about the Foundation, but Peter
(Palumbo) changed my mind. He really believes in it, and I wouldn't have
dreamed of moving if I hadn't thought it was so damned important to have
this working,' says Taylor, American born and educated. 'The process of
giving money has become political despite the best efforts of everybody, and
it's right we should be outside that system.'
What she did from her appointment last June ought to be a case study for
every arts management course.
The money, she decided, was to be for practising artists, whose need was
greatest, not organisations or schemes, and at first anyone could ring up
and ask for a grant. There were 200 applications a week, varying from a
student who wanted a new violin to a man who wanted to build a concert hall.
She spent five months researching the needs, the possible and impossible,
and devising strategy.
She asked 65 foundations in America what they thought the likely response
would be to a series of small advertisements placed in local newspapers
inviting applications with a three month deadline: the estimates ranged from
4,000 to 20,000 applications a year, impossible to manage.
She decided to foster patronage within the arts community. Now, dotted
around the UK are 40-odd voluntary nominators, practising established
artists, who will suggest to emergent artists that they apply for a grant.
No one else can nominate. Applications are then screened by an advisory
committee and the eventual list is passed to the trustees for a final
decision. The first fellowships will be announced in November.
Last December Taylor took her portfolio to the trustees - Palumbo; Terence
Donovan, the photographer; Bill Brown, chairman of the Scottish Arts
Council; his Welsh opposite number Mathew Prichard; and Ed Victor, the
literary agent. 'It was a long session. They took it apart, put it back
together again, and eventually decided it was what they should have been
doing from the start.'
The Foundation has a modest Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 80,000 a year to spend,
depending on interest rates, and this year there will be six fellowships of
Pounds 12,500 each. The subjects include sculpture, ceramics, photography,
poetry, playwrighting and multi-disciplinary arts as being the most needy
areas; next year they will be different, with a new set of nominators.
No vigorous fund raising has taken place. 'That's not the most important
thing now. What is important is to get the Foundation set up and working
properly,' says Taylor. In due course she expects the Foundation to be worth
Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 5m, handing out fellowships up to Pounds 500,000 a
year.
'One of the best British gifts is this great tolerance of eccentricity, but
somehow you have lost the opportunity to take risks on people,' she says.
'Artists really are struggling to make ends meet and we are trying to buy
people time. They will be chosen on the basis of past commitment and future
promise. It's not a democratic process, it relies on judgment, taste and
risk-taking. I just hate it that someone else is going to do it.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Arts: Manipulated by a master of light - The natural visions
of James Turrell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONJUNCTION of James Turrell and Georgia O'Keefe at London's Hayward
Gallery is revealing. The two artists, so different in their methods of
work, prove to be alike not only in their shared grandeur of vision and
sublime self-confidence in its achievement, but also in having produced
individual works of striking similarity.
Look at O'Keefe's charcoal drawing 'Black Diagonal,' of 1919 and compare its
lines and circles with the forms Turrell plots over his photographs of Roden
Crater, an extinct volcano in the Arizona Desert. Look at her 'Wall with
Green Door' of 1952 and then at Turrell's 'Frontal Passage', 1992, which
uses holograms and movement, but is essentially about a green rectangle in
space. Go back to 'Green Door'. Note the importance of edge, of sky. Then
visit 'Air Mass.' Look at 'A Celebration', O'Keefe's painting of a section
of blue sky with clouds of 1924, then go back to 'Air Mass' and see 'A
Celebration', live.
O'Keefe expressed her experiences of desert landscapes in paintings and
drawings admirable in their simplicity and concentration of purpose.
Turrell, too, makes striking images of the desert landscape which is an
essential ingredient of his most ambitious work. His objective, however, is
different. He is not content, as O'Keefe was, to offer a record of sublime
visual experience and allow us to share it as and how we will. He seeks,
rather, to make manifest the vehicle of that experience - light itself.
It is 'the thingness of light' as he calls it which possesses him, and which
he has striven to communicate in works ranging from studio installations to
outdoor environmental projects, of which the grandest is the transformation
of the Roden Crater, on which he has been working since 1977.
During the 70s, when 'Wedgework IV,' now on view at the Hayward, was
created, Turrell was experimenting with dark spaces, reducing light to so
low a level that spectators must wait for their eyes to adjust to be able to
see the work. Both 'Wedgework IV' and 'Trace Elements', 1992, have the
unnerving ability to make light seem solid. The first, red hued space seems
filled with mist, although it is not, and the second dim chamber seems to
end in a wall painted with a rectangle of heliotrope, whose solidity, when
tested, proves illusory.
Effective though they are as demonstrations of colour created through light
and the capacity of the brain to create solids out of air, these two
installations do not quite succeed as objects of contemplation. The red of
'Wedgework' has a nightclub quality which undermines its more spiritual
effects, while the impact of the ghostly rectangle in 'Trace Elements' is
lessened by white light reflecting from the side walls.
'Air Mass' is different. In this piece, The Hayward roof has been
transformed into a high, white walled court with a ceiling open to the sky.
Benches run along the walls. Atop the benches, hidden lighting reflects
upwards. In photos of this piece as installed in sunnier locations, the
walls glow golden, the sky emanates an ever deepening blue. In London in
April the sky, grey with scudding clouds, seems reluctant to take part.
Indeed, the installation is sometimes closed because of rain and the plywood
entry tunnel and benches are stained with water marks. When open, the act of
contemplation is disturbed by traffic noise and one's fellow viewers,
embarrassed perhaps by the odd feeling of vulnerability which gazing fixedly
upwards induces. However, all these awkwardnesses add to the piece's quality
of delight, its unpredictability deepening its resonance, the power of the
weather and the vagaries of the spectators undermining the artist's attempt
to orchestrate our experience.
And this is to the good. For the trouble with Turrell, despite his charming
demeanour, is that, for his work to work, it requires him to assume total
control. The viewing experience has to be shaped, planned out, and the
spectator must act as the artist has ordained. To do so requires in effort
of will, an acquiescence in powerlessness.
Turrell's heart is really in his volcano. There, with the most benign of
intentions, he will have total control not just of those art pilgrims who
will flock to the site when it opens in the year 2000 but of nature itself.
The bowl of the crater, its fiery duty done, is being reshaped to make
visible the 'celestial vaulting' as he calls the curve of light where earth
and sky meet. Tunnels are being driven into its heart, and visitors will
follow designated pathways to the various forms of light experience created
within.
For, like others who have gone to the desert to find light made manifest,
Turrell requires obedience from those who choose to follow him. That
obedience, while a vital part of his work's undoubted power, is also the
source of its weakness. The helpless viewer, groping along a wall in search
of an exit, may finally feel manipulated rather than enlightened, controlled
rather than empowered.
At the Hayward Gallery until June 27.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Arts: Cracked up in California
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I BEGAN to chortle almost the moment this play began, and I guffawed right
through to its close. The same goes for the rest of the audience.
Now, since Cracks begins with an extended scene for one man alone in
silence, and since it subsequently involves the deaths of everyone onstage,
this is quite a feat on the part of playwright Martin Sherman and director
Tim Luscombe.
The key to the comedy, now showing at the King's Head Theatre in Islington,
north London, is that this mysterious series of murders occurs in a
Californian house-party in 1973; and the killings never stop the nine
characters from carrying on the pursuit of free love, dope-smoking,
coke-sniffing, and soul-baring.
Just watching each one of them entering is a hoot. There is Sammy, the
religious gay - 'Like all good Jewish boys, I became Buddhist' - who is soon
to join a Catholic monastery: 'I'm really into it - into God, and things.'
There is Jade, the girl who had studied ballet, but 'I stopped dancing
because it's easier to fuck.' Plus Roberta, the docker who changed sex. Plus
Nadine, the sweet young thing who is schizophrenically possessed by the
dybbuk of her lesbian psychoanalyst. And more.
Once you have seen one hippy singing 'The answer, my friend, is blowing in
the wind' to the corpse of the first dear departed, you have got the hang of
it. But each character, and the whole situation, just gets more marvellously
ludicrous. 'Where's Gideon?' 'Upstairs, getting a blow job.' 'But this is a
matter of life and death.' 'Honey, sometimes a blow-job is a matter of life
and death.'
One of the best jokes is left unsaid. You watch the corpses fall, and you
think 'But why are there only nine of them? This might be Ten Little Indians
on the West Coast.' Then you realise that Nadine is also Cynthia, and that
there are indeed ten - or were. Bang; and, there again, bang.
Cracks, first performed in 1975, today virtually qualifies as period comedy.
Martin Sherman is now famous as the author of Bent and When She Danced.
Though I object to the queasy mixture of farce and serious art history he
attempted in When She Danced (his Isadora play), any playwright who can
handle the trauma and crisis of Bent and the absurd froth of Cracks has
impressive range and ambition. (An interesting footnote is that, like
certain other American playwrights, he now both lives and writes in
Britain.)
This Cracks is directed by Tim Luscombe, has a comparable range. (His most
recent staging was the beautifully intense and realistic Snow Orchid at the
Gate.) He has his actors play their roles with a very nicely judged dash of
caricature. As Nadine/Cynthia, the play's funniest but most complex role,
Jane Gurnett lacks the impish assurance that marks the rest of the cast, but
nonetheless makes the virtuoso switches of voice and psyche hilarious.
As Maggie, who has given up acting to be a full-time star, Deborah Norton
gives a performance of delicious comic authority, reigning over the hippies
in stellar glory whenever she hasn't lost a contact lens - and, in a perfect
period echo, she looks like Carol Burnett. Briony Glassco, as Irene, has a
note of crazy laughter in her voice that wafts back the young Goldie Hawn
and the Rowan and Martin Laugh-In. The fact that she plays the least far-out
person onstage makes her near-hysteria only funnier. But all the cast
deserves high praise. Though the play is inch-deep, I haven't laughed so
much for many a week.
At the King's Head, Islington, London N1 until May 30.

WASTED YEARS by John Harvey Viking Pounds 14.99/Pounds 8.99, 274 pages
A COUNTRY OF OLD MEN by Joseph Hansen No Exit Press Pounds 4.99, 177 pages
THE DANGEROUS EDGE by Lesley Grant-Adamson Faber Pounds 14.95, 330 pages
A SHRED OF HONOUR by J K MayoHarvill Pounds 14.99, 256 pages
THE FIXED boundaries of detective fiction and espionage thrillers are secure
and reassuring - hence both their mass-market popularity and their critical
relegation. Even the better practitioners, from Hammett to Simenon to early
Le Carre, are often discussed with respectful irony and damned with faint
praise.
John Harvey's hard-boiled police procedural Wasted Years is genre-busting
crime fiction at its best. Harvey is either an important novelist who
happens to use this form or, more likely, a very good genre novelist whose
wider ambitions stretch this format. Harvey obeys the discrete rules of this
generic type - for example, puzzle-setting - but also transcends them. His
method is take a character - Charlie Resnick, a morose Nottingham detective
inspector - and go along with him into situations that take him to the end
of his tether.
The plot concerns nearly-forgotten violence which has left some nasty
unfinished police business, a spate of armed robberies, and Resnick's broken
marriage. In spite of the flashbacks, between 1969, 1981 and the recent
past, it is an excellent read, with brisk narrative breezes blowing
refreshingly through the twisted recesses of this heart-searching cop's
past. Resnick makes Inspector Morse seem jaunty, but then again he has a lot
to be despondent about: his personal life consists of watching Notts County
football team and listening to jazz records with only four cats for company;
his working life has seen an erosion of respect for the law.
Resnick cheers himself up by making outstanding sandwiches - not making but
building: 'thin slices of Gruyere cheese, slices of smoked ham, halved black
olives, onion, several pieces of sun-dried tomato and, finally, some
crumblings of blue Stilton on top of two thick slices of light rye bread.'
We readers do not need cheering up, however, as this is superb stuff - the
book,that is, not the sandwich.
Dave Brandstetter's LA patch is far from Harvey's nervy British provincial
city. Private dick Brandstetter is the ageing creation of Joseph Hansen, and
this is, in fact, the final Brandstetter mystery. But it is still a good
enough place to start for new readers, a spare and stylish whodunnit set in
sun-drenched, gentrified southern California. Brandstetter is a blond and
blue-eyed veteran; a furtive smoker; another gourmet, though not of
sandwiches - he even owns a good restaurant; he drinks malt scotch; and is,
unusually for a sleuth, homosexual.
Hansen's tone is cool and determinedly restrained, the better to evoke
Dave's low-key integrity, so much so that a sudden elegiac paragraph about
marshland lost to the city seems merely 'literary' guff from an accomplished
writer of popular fiction who wants to be taken seriously. This tiny,
preening aberration aside, Brandstetter's last case is a fine yarn of drug
dealers, failed rock musicians, child abuse and dishonest local politics -
especially at only a fiver.
The Dangerous Edge is a spy story told by a woman in a field where it is
generally gentlemen who prefer Bonds. Why was journalist John Blair shot?
Why was he in Spain? Is it anything to do with that old East German agent
now hanging round Prague? Search me, chum: ask Lesley Grant-Adamson. This is
is a suspenseful, complex book, part thriller, part crime novel, converging
on post-Velvet Revolution Prague.
More labyrinthine plotting in JK Mayo's A Shred Of Honour. Witty, elegant,
humane, Mayo is, like John Harvey, a 'real' writer dressed in genre clothing
and making the snobbish distinction redundant. A cache of British
chemical-biological-radiological weaponry has been stolen from the Gulf
theatre of war and sent into the Nubian desert by forces unknown. As the
caravan makes its way through Sudan, crumpled, likeably cynical military
intelligence agent Harry Seddall plays his hunches about who did it and why.
What is distinctive about Seddall's milieu is that the spies are vital,
amusing and brilliant people, completely unlike Le Carres weary bureaucrats.
The plot-twists are amazing yet not far-fetched. The book lodges in the
memory because of Mayo's objective treatment of ruthlessness. All this plus
more sandwiches, though sometimes of the knuckle variety.

REGGIE: THE LIFE OF REGINALD GOODALL by John Lucas Julia MacRae Books Pounds
18.99, 254 pages
REGINALD GOODALL, one of the leading British conductors of the century and
one of the elite among postwar Wagnerians, began his career with great (if
unevenly acknowledged) spurts of promise. He ended it, in advanced old age,
with a knighthood, magnificent recordings of The Ring (this month re-issued
on CD), Tristan and Parsifal to his credit, and the reverence of almost all
British Wagner-lovers.
In between, he endured a period of cruel neglect ' a staff conductor at the
Royal Opera House misunderstood, sidelined and eventually shelved, who for
ten years found his conducting dates there dwindled to non-existence
(between the 1961 Boris Godunov revival and the 1971 Parsifal).
Even during that time, of course, he was not reduced to total artistic
ineffectiveness. Otto Klemperer demanded his presence as assistant on those
late Klemperer recording sessions - the admiration between the two was
mutual, as it had been between Goodall and another leading conductor, Erich
Kleiber, and as it was to be between him and Kleiber's son Carlos. More to
the point, in his little eyrie at Covent Garden (nicknamed, naturally
enough, Valhalla) Goodall continued on the ewige Werk begun in the middle
1950s - the schooling of successive generations of British and Britain-based
Wagner singers to eloquence and international fame.
But then came the 1968 Sadler's Wells Opera Mastersingers - unforgettable in
the small theatre, repeated to even more splendid effect when the company
moved home to the Coliseum, where already the glorious adventure of the
English-language Ring was set to unfold.
Those performances, and the Welsh National Tristan and Valkyrie and ENO
Tristan and Parsifal of the late 1970s and '80s, amounted to a revelation of
long-lined, lovingly rehearsed, sagaciously sustained Wagner performance -
every instrumental line suffused with lyricism, every voice part unforced,
every word and note audible. These unforgettable evenings placed Goodall in
the grand line of Wagnerian conductors.
The Goodall 'galley years' at Covent Garden, as a chapter-title in John
Lucas's new biography aptly calls them, are therefore the more depressing to
contemplate when one holds them in the light of both the late triumphs and
the early career progress. In truth, little in his upbringing seemed likely
to promote that musical career; and the hand-to-mouth conditions, blinkered
British-is-best tastes and unwarranted self-satisfaction that obtained in
the musical life of this country for much of Goodall's early adulthood
seemed designed positively to frustrate it.
In spite of that, and of the combination of shyness, eccentricity, and
intransigence in search of high musical standards that marked his
personality, Goodall's achievements as choirmaster at St Alban's, Holborn,
and with the short-lived Wessex Philharmonic Orchestra forced him,
gradually, up the British musical ladder. The peak of thatearly period was
his conducting of the 1945 premiere of Peter Grimes: the Britten connection
led him in the postwar years to the newly formed opera company at Covent
Garden. But later that connection was broken (Britten took offence at some
small slight) and the gradual but inexorable decline in his fortunes as a
conductor set in.
This is a tale alternately saddening and exhilarating to read. Lucas -
husband of Anne Evans, Goodall devotee, a former Observer Arts Editor -
tells it excellently: even for those British opera-lovers who think they
know the ins and outs of it already, his Reggie will surely prove a
compelling and fascinating read.
The picture painted of Britten and his circle in the Grimes and early
Aldeburgh years is full of incident (some of it new to print), intrigue and
passions running high on all sides. Lucas does not shirk the snobbery,
prevarication and shady dealing that operated at Covent Garden in the
Webster-Drogheda era, nor the rough treatment Goodall underwent at the hands
of Solti on his arrival there in 1961 - had it not been for a handful of
obstinate Goodall champions, among them the critics Andrew Porter, David
Cairns and the late Peter Heyworth, and then the Sadler's Wells visionaries
Stephen Arlen and Edmund Tracey, Goodall's name would surely have been swept
off the Royal Opera masthead sooner or later.
But above all, this is the portrait of an extremely odd man, and it is
undertaken with commendable frankness. However much one regrets the many
chances missed, one comes to appreciate the number of obstacles placed by
Goodall himself in the way of his own steady progress. Foremost among these
must stand his pre-war fascist sympathies and his post-war reluctance to
accept the full extent of the horrors unleashed by his beloved Germany.
To his unbounded credit Lucas never shrinks from the issue. Neither does he
sensationalise it - and indeed, the admiration Goodall could feel for such
Jews as Klemperer does point to the self-contradiction and simple muddle
that Lucas discerns at the core of his political ideals. In sum, this is a
first-rate biography, painstakingly researched, judiciously balanced,
crisply and lucidly written - and, as always in such cases, it illuminates
much more than simply the remarkable main subject.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Collecting: New London fair sets antiques world buzzing -
Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCEPTICS WHO claim that there is no market for yet another antiques fair in
London will shortly be proved right - or wrong. Wednesday sees the opening
of the new British Antique Dealers' Association (BADA) Fair, staged in a
Salon de Mars-style pavilion in the forecourt of The Duke of York's
Headquarters on the King's Road in Chelsea. It is the first fair organised
by and open exclusively to BADA's 380 members (unlike next month's Grosvenor
House which is organised in association with BADA but invites non-members),
and has been 10 years in the making.
It was conceived to provide an affordable and distinctive London showcase
for those provincial dealers - plus those in the capital - who do not aspire
to the glitz and telephone-number price tags of Grosvenor House. The public
would be offered a comprehensive survey of the nation's art and antiques -
and the re-assurance of BADA vetting - by simply taking the Underground to
Sloane Square and walking 100 yards. From the trade's point of view, at
last, not only the big London boys would reap the benefit of the end-user's
price.
As it transpired, the provincial dealers proved cautious and more than half
of the inaugural fair's 90 or so exhibitors are London-based. A fifth are
big boys who are also exhibiting at Grosvenor House. The envisioned
clear-cut distinction between the two fairs is bound to be blurred, not
least given the directive from the organisers of Grosvenor House that
exhibitors broaden their spread of prices. None of the dealers I spoke to
who are exhibiting at both events has yet decided how best to divide his
stock.
BADA Fair Chairman Alistair Sampson can detect 'no whiff of competition'
between the two BADA events. (The casualty so far has been the cancelled
West of England Antiques Fair at Bath.) He believes that people will find
the new event less daunting than Grosvenor House and 'a very good quality
but feet-on-the-ground fair'. That means commercial stock and prices
reflecting the current buyer's market. Grosvenor House will no doubt remain
the premier event, but the battle lines seem drawn for the middle ground.
This can only be good news for those wielding chequebooks.
Sampson adds: 'Buyers too impatient in a reviving market to wait until June
for Olympia and Grosvenor House will come in droves'. If they do, there is
little doubt among the BADA membership that next year's pavilion at The Duke
of York's Headquarters will be vastly bigger.
The fair will open 11am-5.30pm on Wednesday May 5, 11am-8pm on subsequent
weekdays, and 11am-6pm at weekends, until May 11, when it closes at 6pm.
* * * Christie's has announced the sale of a choice group of modern pictures
 -by the likes of Picasso, Braque, Bacon, de Stael, Kokoschka and Klee -
amassed during the 1950s by a collector who claimed that she never spent
more than Pounds 1,000 on a painting. The discerning eye belonged to the
Budapest-born but London-based corsetiere Illa Kodicek. The 37 pictures are
to be sold on behalf of The National Association of Boys' Clubs at a charity
auction on June 23, and are expected to realise around Pounds 3m.
* * * Four days before, Sotheby's had unobtrusively lifted the veil on a
public collection that never was. Those lured by Monday's lecture on
'Bee-keeping in the Islamic World' in the firm's auction rooms at the launch
of Asian Week, may have been surprised to stumble across a room filled with
exceptional Victorian paintings - some, at least, appropriately Orientalist.
In pride of place, and over a metre high, hung Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema's
rose-strewn epic 'Caracalla and Geta: Bear Fight in the Coliseum 203 AD'
(estimate Pounds 800,000-Pounds 1.2m). To its left, a large Rossetti
'stunner' in coloured chalks, 'La Ghirlandata' (Pounds 400,000-Pounds
600,000), and the haunting, vulnerable beauty of Burne-Jones's Amy Gaskell
Pounds 250,000-Pounds 350,000). To its right, Lord Leighton's 'Old Damascus'
(Pounds 300,000-Pounds 400,000). The feast continued with Tissot, Poynter,
Albert Moore, David Roberts . . .
What their captions did not reveal is that these form a small part of the
Victorian art collection acquired by the American millionaire philanthropist
Fred Koch - for substantially more than Pounds 1,000 apiece. The collection
was to have been on public display in a Regency villa at the centre of
Regent's Park, part of a projected Victorian study centre that would also
have provided a library, scholarships and lecture programmes.
That London lost this resource is down to a handful of conservationists who
fought to protect every inch of cornice of the agreeable but undistinguished
St John's Lodge, and thus prevented its conversion.
The dispirited Koch retreated to Sutton Place; these pictures go under the
hammer on June 8. The irony is that St John's Lodge is still under
scaffolding seven years on, and the refurbishment of the house by its new
tenant looks as drastic as anything Koch could have proposed.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Books: SF's lost king still defends his throne - Fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN MULLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORWARD THE FOUNDATION by Isaac Asimov Doubleday Pounds 14.99, 414 pages
ELVISSEY by Jack Womack HarperCollins Pounds 15.99, 319 pages
MORTAL ENGINES by Stanislaw Lem Andre Deutsch Pounds 12.99, 239 pages
A WAR of succession has broken out. Isaac Asimov, king of speculative
fiction, is dead. Publishers have anointed two rivals to the crown: Jack
Womack and Stanislaw Lem.
As if to escalate the struggle, Forward The Foundation, Asimov's final
novel, completed only weeks before the 72-year-old grandmaster of SF died
last April, has just been published posthumously. The Foundation series is
Asimov's most sustained work of invention and his best loved. Inspired by
Gibbon, it is the epic future history of a decadent imperial system
incorporating 25m inhabited worlds.
As Foundation fans know, one man sees the collapse coming long before anyone
else. He is Hari Seldon, father of psycho-history, a nascent statistical
science of human behaviour which forecasts that, left to itself, the Galaxy
will endure 30,000 years of anarchy. Seldon reckons that this
mother-of-all-recessions may be contracted to 1,000 years if a small
enlightened community can be preserved. So he establishes his Foundation, a
benevolent secret society, and the seven books of Asimov's series follow its
fate.
Forward The Foundation is the biography of psycho-history's founder; a kind
of cosmic John Maynard Keynes and the self-confessed alter ego of Isaac
Asimov. This last book is the keystone in the archway of the series, and
Asimov deserves this monument. Be warned though that the pace of invention
and surprise is slower than in the early Foundation novels. The stylistic
cliche count is also higher. But the subtle, sustained parallel with the
last days of Roman imperial sway and the discreet pervasive influence of the
earliest Christian communities still ignites the imagination.
Jack Womack, the first challenger for Asimov's crown, has written a strange
novel about Elvis, the rock n' roll legend whose transformation into
cultural icon was strange enough in the first place. There has emerged in
America in the 16 years since Elvis's death a well-documented psychological
syndrome to describe the addicted collector of objects sanctified by the
touch of the King. His fans regard him as divine; his Graceland mansion is
their Mecca. That much is plain fact. Now for the fiction.
Elvissey pictures a future in which the C of E is triumphant. We are,
however, light years removed from tea and cucumber sandwiches with the
vicar. The C of E is the Church of Elvis, with its schismatic groups
including the Prearmyites, the Hosts of Memphis, and the Shaken, Rattled and
Rolled. These sects comprise a large proportion of the developed world's
population and they are dangerously unstable.
To control them, the globally-ambitious Dryco corporation sanctions an
audacious time travel kidnap. The plan is that the dislocated Elvis, plucked
from Memphis 1954, will keep his charismatic followers docile in New York
2033. Don't laugh. This is a grim and powerful novel.
Womack's world is discerned as if through a glass darkly, and demands
considerable initial attention from the reader. Has the cyberpunk generation
the required attention span? I hope so, for this odd and oddly rewarding
novel transcends cyberpunk - the streetwise, cynical SF fashion of the '80s
 -in important ways. Womack's book is different in tone and content from
anything you may have read.
Then there is Stanislaw Lem. Mortal Engines (translated by Michael Kandel)
is a collection of stories which demonstrates what the genre may boast at
its finest. The 'mortal engines' in the title are not the lethal cannons
described by Shakespeare's Othello but living automatons. Virtually every
character in these pages is a machine. Even the robot dogs have robot fleas.
A sure sign of Lem's literary stature is that his work demands classical
comparisons. Take the novella-length tale entitled The Mask. If Kafka and
Henry James were writing today in Polish and collaborating on SF, The Mask
is what you might expect. It is a fairy tale told from the dragon's
perspective. Love, death, free will are its themes.
Lem juggles elegantly with the deterministic world of fairy tales in which
physics is controlled by morality (good princes always prevail, wicked ones
always come to grief). The denouement will make your palms sweat.
The war of Asimov's succession can have only one just outcome. Womack is a
prince in waiting. Lem deserves the crown.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Motoring: The rally that suddenly stopped being fun -
Attitudes and events that have soured the London-Sydney race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 35,000 feet, on board a chartered Ilyushin 84 over the still snow-clad
wilderness which vaguely defines the borders of Uzbekistan, Iran and eastern
Turkey, the Australians were holding an impromptu auction of 16 bread rolls.
They went for an average of more than Dollars 150 each. But what had begun
as an auction became a general collection among the 102 surviving crews of
the Lombard London to Sydney car marathon who were, thanks to the diplomatic
row over the renewed Iranian fatwah on author Salman Rushdie, flying not
driving down the old Silk Road to Tashkent, our cars following in two
behemoth Antonov air freighters.
When the marathon reaches Eucla, the most remote of the Australian outback
towns on its route, the money will be handed over to its school.
'We'd heard there was a catering strike at the airport and that there would
be no food on board. So we just grabbed the rolls at the cafe,' said
competitor Graeme Furness, managing director of a Sydney car dealership. 'We
were going to raise money for Ginger's children. But when we found out they
were 22 and 26, we thought it might be more appropriate to raise funds for
the kids of Eucla instead'.
'Ginger' was Brian Ginger, the co-driver of a Holden Munaro from Victoria.
Brian, a company director who would have been 46 next month, died when the
rally car collided head on with a bus on Tuesday. The accident happened 7
kilometres from the end of a spectacular special stage that he and driver
Norman Framstad, an accountant from Victoria, had just completed in the Bolu
mountains of northern Turkey.
The precise cause of the crash remains unknown. But the death has cast a
shadow over the event as we prepare in Delhi for the next five-day leg
through the Himalayas and around India. It seems less important whether New
Zealander Graham Lorimer's Ford Escort can reclaim his lead from
Porsche-mounted Francis Tuthill; whether veteran British rally stars Andrew
Cowan and Roger Clark can climb back into the top 10 by Sydney - and
certainly whether Neville Marriner and me in our Unipart-backed 'Save the
Chidren Fund' Lotus Cortina can continue our steady climb through the field
from 96th to 58th.
Framstad has made it clear that at the time of the accident their car was
travelling at normal highway speed. Nevertheless, the accident has focused
attention on the fact that a sizeable minority of competitors have, some of
them frequently, exceeded the limits of what is acceptable in terms of
aggressive driving on the public highway.
It is the one misfortune so far of an event which otherwise has seen nearly
120 competitors' and officials' cars passing through 10 countries in 11
days. It has been a triumph of logistical organisation by Nick Brittan and
his 20-strong team of administrators.
We have crossed problematical borders, such as Romania's, sometimes through
crowds of refugees, in a matter of minutes. We have passed lines of trucks
nearly a mile long for whom the same process will take days. And even the
competitors were overawed as we watched an entire field of rally cars
disappear inside the Antonovs.
Paradoxically, while the organisers may soon read the riot act to the
rally's miscreants, the police forces and the inhabitants of some of the
countries we have passed through must share some of the blame for the
reckless driving.
It is difficult not to respond when crowds line their own streets making
clear signs for competitors to go faster, even though, under the rules,
these are non-competitive road sections where all normal highway rules must
be obeyed. It is even more difficult when - as we have found across all the
old eastern bloc countries - police at every junction are holding back other
traffic and goading the competitors on.
Brittan points out that the average speeds set for road sections lie well
within each country's relevant speed limits. The marathon's regulations also
provide progressively stiffer penalties - including expulsion - for
competitors who attract police complaints. But for the indulgent attitude of
some police forces, several drivers might be facing that penalty.
How, for example, do you excuse one car travelling so fast through a minor,
dusty Turkish town that it goes into a backwards spin to avoid a mother
crossing the road with her infant? And what did the Skoda driver think, when
his car, with his wife and small children aboard, was forced off the road by
another competitor in a small town in Slovakia?
The race resumes today. As we have prepared to set out for the Himalayas
there has been growing discussion about our behaviour on the road. What is
acceptable in countries where, generally, local standards of driving are
themselves normally appalling. Even the offenders have begun to realise that
Sydney remains 7,000 miles of driving away.
In all other respects, the marathon is living up to competitors' hopes. Even
though we are required to use cars of the same vintage as the original
London to Sydney marathon of 25 years ago, it is certainly no joy ride.
Cars and drivers are being tested to the limit. We are racing against the
clock over high mountain passes with appalling drops - euphemistically
described as 'fresh air corners' in the route notes - or on gravel tracks
snaking through the wilderness.
All these stages, 46 in all, take place on roads closed to public vehicles.
They are fast, exhilarating and undeniably dangerous. In Australia some will
be as long as 100 miles. And they lie at the heart of the competition for
the majority of the 106 crews which set out from London for this 11,500 mile
odyssey.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Motoring: Sisters under the trim - Stuart Marshall compares
the Rover 600 and the Honda Accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MY left, the new Rover 600. And on my right, the new British-made Honda
Accord. As everyone must know by now, under the sheet metal they are the
same cars. What sets them apart are really no more than cosmetic changes to
the front and rear ends and a different approach to interior styling and
trim.
But are they merely badge-engineered clones? I think it would be glib to
leave it at that.
There is nothing dishonourable in using the same engines, transmissions,
suspensions and some body parts in what are promoted and sold as different
makes of cars. Developing a completely new car costs so much it has become
impossible not to. For example: identical engines and transmissions go into
Audi 80s and Volkswagen Golfs; all Citroens and Peugeots; and many Fiats,
Alfa Romeos and Lancias. But as individual cars they all manage to feel
different.
Were I to get into a Rover 600 or Honda Accord in an unlit garage and drive
them off into the night, I would be hard put to tell which was which. Both
are as quiet, comfortable, lively and refined as one expects a modern
2-litre saloon to be. In daylight, though, it would be a different story.
Comparing the Rovers I had driven last month with the Hondas I sampled last
week, the Rovers seemed somehow more distinguished. I could even have
convinced myself they were more than just Hondas that had had a nose job and
a tail tuck.
Outwardly, the 600 is a handsome car; a proper Rover, in fact. The Accord
looks a typical Honda and there is, of course, nothing wrong with that. From
the front, the only car you would mistake a Rover 600 for would be a Rover
800. It looks as up-market as BMW's 3-Series that it is being pitched
against.
Inside, so long as lashings of traditional wood veneer turn you on, there is
no contest. The interior of the new Rover 600 Series makes the Honda's look
quite ordinary and more than matches that of the BMW.
Beauty is, of course, skin deep. The Honda Accord may look a bit bland
compared with the Rover but it comes very well equipped.
When the Accord goes on sale in Britain next week a 2.0i LS will have a
Pounds 15,145 list price. This includes electrically operated front and rear
windows, sunroof, heated door mirrors and aerial; remote central locking,
stereo radio-cassette and, should you want it, metallic paint.
Its Rover 600 counterpart, the 620SLi, costs Pounds 17,200 and metallic
paint is a Pounds 345 extra.
At Pounds 18,475 the poshest Accord 2.0iES is trimmed in soft hide. It even
has some wood veneer but is only Pounds 25 dearer than the equivalent Rover
620GSi. This, too, has leather seats - but not the Honda's standard air
conditioning and driver's side airbag.
So in the end, as the old saying has it, you pays your money and takes your
choice. A potential buyer of an Accord or Rover 600 would be wise to match
specification details carefully before deciding one way or the other.
The Swindon-built Accord is every bit as British as the Cowley-made Rover
600. Honda is confident company car fleet managers - and their financial
masters - have taken this point on board.
If value and performance, comfort and equipment are the only criteria, the
logical choice would be the Honda. But the Rover's fairer face and
traditionally British interior may seduce status-conscious buyers. Whichever
they choose, they can be sure of getting a thoroughly competent car.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Property: For Pounds 50,000, there's a world of choice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A THREE-bedroom, semi-detached house in the Midlands region of England will,
typically, cost Pounds 50,000, according to the country's largest building
society, the Halifax. But what will it buy in other parts of the world?
In the Irish republic, you could get a two-bedroom house or flat in a suburb
of Dublin or Cork. In Switzerland, though, you could probably find only a
re-sale studio at that price; even then, it would take some effort. One such
 -at just over Pounds 50,000 and offered by David de Lara &amp; Partners (tel:
081-749 2188) - is a second-floor studio with balcony in a chalet at Les
Crosets in Portes du Soliel, the Franco-Swiss ski area.
In France itself, Pounds 50,000 will buy you a manor house in Picardy with
three to five bedrooms and three acres; the sum includes the purchase fees.
Agent Barbers (071-381-0112) says it does need some repair work, but the
price has been cut from Pounds 85,000.
This agency produces a useful after-sale leaflet with advice on such things
as paying bills at a distance, letting, and getting restoration work done.
If, for instance, you use an unregistered builder, you will not get a VAT
receipt and will be unable to offset the work against capital gains tax.
In France's Charente Maritime area, Pounds 50,000 will acquire a
three-bedroom cottage with 24 acres of marshland running down to the Gironde
estuary - a place for the fishing and shooting enthusiast. The cottage does
need some interior updating but is only 35 miles from Bordeaux and its
international airport.
It is offered by the French Property Shop (0892-852-449) which, at the same
price, also suggests a house in a tourist village close to the river
Dordogne for anyone seeking a home with income. This has four suites of
bedrooms with shower rooms and is used for bed and breakfast. The English
owners put it on the market originally at Pounds 72,300.
Then there is leaseback. You can buy a property priced at, say, Pounds
80,000-plus in a Pierre &amp; Vacances resort in France, lease it back to the
company for 11 years - and pay only around Pounds 50,000. You can use it
yourself for six weeks a year and have no management or maintenance charges.
Pierre &amp; Vacances (071-924-6866) has several resorts where this sort of deal
is available, including two on the Atlantic coast.
Possibilities elsewhere include:
Andorra. Wedged between France and Spain in the Pyrenees, it can be tedious
to reach by road from either country, but the living costs are low and there
is good skiing. There, Pounds 50,000 will buy a two-bedroom flat in a town
although the price edges up in the valleys, says agent GAK Williamson &amp;
Associates (0962-734-999). Slightly larger than the Isle of Wight, the
principality has a population of about 55,000, around 4,000 British.
Spain. There are re-sale properties at whatever price you want. For Pounds
50,000 there is a three-bedroom furnished apartment near Fuengirola; a
two-bedroom apartment in the La Manga club near Cartegena; a three-bedroom
detached villa near Torrevieja; a two-bedroom town house near Rosas, with
boat mooring included; and many more (through Shield Kall Wright, tel.
0708-450-784). Fewer new properties are available at this price, although
studios are being marketed in the harbour section of Sotogrande on the Costa
del Sol (071-924-6866).
For Pounds 50,000, buyers should be able to find something new at the
Kennedy-Wilson auction of Wimpey properties in Spain and Gibraltar at
Marbella on May 9 (details: 071-497-9707). The 77 units being offered range
from one-bedroom apartments to three-bedroom town houses at Estepona, Spain,
with reserve prices from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 70,000 (including several
at Pounds 50,000).
Of the 19 apartments offered in Gibraltar, four have a Pounds 50,000
reserve. Bidders must register before auction day.
Portugal. Another way to spend around Pounds 50,000 on an overseas property
would be to buy a quarter share. These are available from Bovis Abroad at
its Sao Lourenco development on the Algarve. The company insists it is not
timeshare because you get freehold title.
A quarter share of a two-bedroom furnished flat can be bought for Pounds
49,000, and there is an annual maintenance charge of Pounds 1,000. Your
three months' use is divided into sections through the year, and the pattern
rotates over four years. Quarter-share apartments are mixed among those in
single ownership on the estate, which offers tennis and swimming. Owners get
a 25 per cent discount on the golf course. Information: 0800-252-235.
Italy. Many of the rural possibilities there would double in cost once
essential renovation was taken into account. But Brian A French &amp; Associates
(071-284-0114) suggests a six-room farmhouse at Montisi, Tuscany, with
cellars, stables and 20 acres. Priced originally at Pounds 75,000, the
owners (the family of the late actor Robert Morley) will take Pounds 50,000;
the reduction should help to offset any later bills.
Turkey. A London agent (071-352-2931) who himself has a property in the far
south-west Bodrum region says Pounds 50,000 would finance a very comfortable
villa there on a sizeable plot. One possibility is a freehold site close to
the water at Turbuku, 18 miles from Bodrum, and big enough for a detached
house with three or four bedrooms and two bathrooms.
The agent suggests that the work could be carried out by a local architect
and builder, and adds that other sites are available in nearby villages. The
nearest international airports for the area are at Izmir or Dalaman.
Greece. A British builder (0423-865-892) is constructing five villas with
three to four bedrooms, priced from Pounds 50,000. The development is in the
Mani area ('the real Greece, rather than the holiday hot-spots') of the
Peleponnese, the most southerly part of the mainland. It is about a mile
back from the coast but the houses have sea views. The nearest airport is
Kalamata.
Holland. In Rotterdam, you could buy a block of three (tenanted) flats for a
little under Pounds 50,000, purchase costs included. They will return an
income of just over Pounds 4,000 a year net of running costs and expenses,
according to London solicitor Osbornes (071-485-8811) which is offering
them.
Czechoslovakia. Arlette Adler, of Villas Abroad (081-891-5444), is partly
Czech and her agency has property available in Prague. For Pounds 50,000 you
could buy a one-bedroom flat in the city centre or a two-bedroom apartment
off-centre.
There is a shortage of hotel accommodation in Prague and charges are high.
Thus a business person who visits the Czech capital often might find it
worth having such a pied-a-terre available, particularly as Adler says it
could be let 'extremely profitab1y' when not required.
US. In south-west Florida, east of commercially-orientated Fort Myers, is
Lehigh Acres, a residential community with three golf courses. Agent Tom
Cowell in Bangor, Wales (0248-370-601), is offering three-bedroom,
two-bathroom homes with two-car garages on quarter-acre plots for just under
Pounds 50,000, including the land.
Some 37 miles south, on the fringe of leisure-orientated Naples, is the
3,000-acre Lely Resort where a third golf course will be completed next
year. A hotel, tennis ranch, country club and pools are being built, along
with houses and flats.
What would Pounds 50,000 buy there? If you are lucky, says UK agent Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley (071-824-8171), you might just get a quarter-acre plot
overlooking a fairway. The house would be what you cared to spend.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Travel: Dresden - bombed, battered and beautiful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY WESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH OF Dresden's historic core is still a reconstruction site, 48 years
after RAF bombers smashed it. But the old architectural gems are slowly
coming to light again in time for the city's 800th anniversary in 2006.
The spirit of reconstruction was brought home to me after climbing the
staircase of the Albertinum, when I spent some time on the first-floor
landing absorbing Canaletto's five magnificent Dresden panoramas. On one of
the churches he had painstakingly recorded scaffolding around the steeple.
Sometimes life seems to stand still. The same steeple was encased in
scaffolding during my visit as well.
Although it is one of Europe's greatest art galleries, the Albertinum is
mercifully neither overpowering nor crowded. It is all the more pleasurable,
therefore, to take in the few rooms of Old Masters, where household names
predominate. Even the Durers, Holbeins and Botticellis paled (at least for
me) beside Titian, Vermeer, Raphael's Sistine Madonna and my own favourite:
Rembrandt's joyous self-portrait with his wife.
The one view by Canaletto that looks virtually unchanged is the courtyard of
the Zwinger. Despite torrential rain, l found the Zwinger one of the most
enchanting Baroque buildings I have seen - light and airy, as befits a
palace built for pleasure and festivals.
Eighty per cent of visitors to Dresden are there on business, and the hotels
could fill their beds three times over throughout the year. Hotel prices
trebled after unification two years ago, and, at least until recently, they
are the most expensive in Germany. Even a double room in a two-star hotel
can cost around Pounds 90. For most tourists, the obvious solution is bed
and breakfast 10 miles from the centre at around Pounds 35.
Visiting the former DDR is not just about seeing a clutch of great
monuments. My suggestion is that, if you missed the fall of the Berlin wall,
then go now, because for a comparatively short time you can witness a rare
and exciting occurrence - the painful attempt by the east Germans to come to
terms with their new fate: half a nation in metamorphosis.
Everywhere you look, life in the old DDR (the letters still top many
buildings) mixes with the new. A smart new cafe stands a few yards from a
ladies' fashion shop, so staid it could have strayed from a 1930s film set.
How they all love to drive their unlovely Trabants.
We drove west down the silver road to Freiberg, so named because of the
silver mined in the area for 500 years until the early 1800s. Grey
apartments gave way to flattish countryside and impoverished villages with a
good sprinkling of half-timbering. It was like a version of West Germany of
40 years ago. Paint seems to have been largely unobtainable, but here and
there was a smartly manicured house and garden, perhaps the residence of a
privileged party official, now unemployed.
Freiberg's cathedral square had more charming buildings, but nowhere to sit
or drink a coffee. A cathedral guide insisted on locking us out because it
was the job of the next guide to let us in. Meanwhile, it rained. Old rules
die hard.
Inside, the roof had been repainted with superior Christmas-tree decorations
based on 15th-century originals. The astonishing tulip pulpit was
half-restored, while many of the Electors of Saxony reposed in stony
splendour behind a screen.
Freiberg is a half-day's excursion from Dresden. Meissen is a similar
distance, accessible from Dresden by road or by pleasure steamer along the
Elbe. Most go to see the porcelain, the first and the best of its kind in
Europe - made since the early 1700s. I saw a beautiful thimble for Pounds
75, with dinner services pro rata. Both factory and museum are worth a
detour, but buying is cheaper in Harrods.
Finally to Weimar, in neighbouring Thuringia - a cultural showpiece even in
communist days. Goethe's elegant but modest house - his home for 50 years -
is preserved in time-warp fashion, from his inkpot and desk to the armchair
he died in. Schiller, his poorer friend, lived only the last three years of
his life near by. In bronze they bestride a plinth outside the national
theatre where the Weimar Republic was born.
Weimar's streets and squares are a delight. I chewed a Thuringian sausage in
the market square while contemplating the house of Cranach the Elder. His
last great triptych is in the parish church.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Travel: Trunk calls only to north India - Michael J Woods
visits the elephant fair at Sonepur, Patna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEARING A red cap fringed with silver, a sweeping rich red cloak, large and
opulent earrings and delicately applied make-up, Moti (Pearl) looked every
inch the star he was. His owner claimed proudly that he was the best
elephant on sale at the fair, which explained his high price - the
equivalent of Pounds 8,140.
As his owner was Mr Solanki, the district president, who had three armed
guards, who was I to argue? 'Either I sell him for that price or I take him
home. I will not bargain', he said, as Moti rocked back and forth on his
shackled legs, the chains clinking slightly with his restlessness.
From time to time his mahout, who sat beside him on a bed of reeds, cut a
stem of sugar cane into convenient lengths, tied them with some blades of
grass and passed them to Moti's questing trunk. The animal hoisted them to
his mouth and munched them with relish.
The mela, or fair, at Sonepur, near Patna, in northern India, is reputed to
be the largest in Asia, an immense gathering of traders who come to buy and
sell cattle, horses, buffaloes, mules, oxen, goats, camels and, most
famously, elephants.
A little like an Indian version of the Royal Welsh or Bath and West
agricultural shows, manufacturers have stands at Sonepur to promote
fertilisers or tractors, and state departments such as forestry and railways
have their own exhibits.
There is a large fun fair with three big wheels and a variety of stalls
forming a vast bazaar. Here women sit beside the piles of dye of pure,
almost luminescent red, orange and yellow, while next to them may be
cauliflower or egg sellers or street barbers.
And there is food for sale everywhere. Curries bubble and steam, fresh
samosas gleam golden from leaf dishes while a skilled cook expertly twirls
his bag of flour paste over a pan of boiling butter to create distinctively
shaped sweetmeats called gilebi.
At times, it is difficult to linger because of the press of the crowds. The
pedestrians who fill the roadways have to draw aside to allow bellowing
buffaloes or Brahmin cattle to pass, or to give way to the strident bells of
the tricycle rickshaws, or the hooting of buses.
The mela originated as a religious event and begins on the day of the full
moon in November, Kartik Punima. At dawn, large numbers of Hindu pilgrims
gather for a ritual dip at the confluence of the Rivers Gandak and Ganges,
where a mythical battle took place between an elephant and a crocodile, the
reincarnated forms of two brothers. At its climax, when the elephant appears
doomed, Lord Krishna steps in and the crocodile is killed.
Pilgrims stream in from miles around, pouring over the old iron bridge into
Sonepur itself, arriving by train at what is India's second longest platform
or clotting the road with traffic until the resultant jam seems gridlocked.
Arriving at the back of such a queue, you need a top-class fixer, and we had
one in the form of Zubin Mody, our guide and major domo who travelled with
us throughout our trip.
Stepping lightly from the bus, Zubin quickly found the local chief of police
and, by means about which we did not inquire, enlisted his help to shuffle
lorries off the road and clear a space across the market square so that we
could rumble through to our camp site. Parts of that jam were eight hours
old.
Once the mela gets going, it does not stop for a month and is a
24-hour-a-day affair. As the light melts away and the day comes to an end,
the dust in the air appears to thicken and is joined by the smoke of dozens
of newly-lit charcoal and dung fires.
When night comes properly, the circus opens and the evening shows begin. We
entered through a thin board facade of a castle entrance, the sort of thing
you might see at the landward end of a failing pier at a second-rate seaside
resort. Inside, the great canvas hall was divided into four sections,
denoting four ticket prices, by barbed wire hung on bamboo staves to keep
the groups of men (these shows are for men only) apart.
Our show consisted of a series of modern Indian songs, with music so
amplified - to reach those at the back - that it was painfully distorted
near the front. While they remained fully clad in knee-length, long-sleeved,
high-throated dresses, the pelvic thrusts, hip wiggles and breast-shaking of
the singers left little to the imagination. It seems the fences are also
necessary to keep susceptible country boys at bay.
At first light the elephant lines stir. Fires are rekindled and new fodder
arrives. One by one, the chains are loosed, the mahouts climb astride the
elephant's neck by grasping both its ears and walking up the animal's trunk,
and they pad off to the river.
Gentle as lambs, they rolled amiably on to their sides in the Gandak to be
scrubbed with bricks or stones like pumice: faces, ears, sides, back, even
the soles of their feet. With one side done they stood up, turned round on
command and lay down for the washing to be completed.
The sun had almost risen when Moti came striding along, full of
self-importance. At the top of the bank he stopped but, try as he might,
Moti's mahout could not persuade the stubborn pachiderm to approach the
water. Good looking he might be, but such intractability banished thoughts
of raising Pounds 8,140. I was not going to buy an elephant which refused to
be washed.
Michael J Woods travelled with Twickers World, which offers a 15-day Indian
journey that includes two days at the Sonepur mela and also visits Delhi,
Jaipur (where elephants, bought at previous fairs, can be ridden to the
Amber Fort), Agra, Patna, Calcutta and Bombay. There is only one departure a
year to coincide with the mela: this year it will be on November 22, costing
from Pounds 2,165 plus government hotel tax.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Travel: A visit to the wild west of the far east - The way
we were / Nicholas Woodsworth returns to Cambodia full of curiosity about
his brother's life in Phnom Penh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAD NOT seen my brother, Gregory, for some years when, for the first time
since we lived there as children, I returned to Indochina.
Like many people who grew up abroad, we have continued to lead the same life
we began with. After tentative stabs at permanence, we both fell into a
gipsy kind of existence, I into journalism, he into international aid. Over
the years, we rarely found ourselves on the same continent. But, when our
paths crossed, Gregory always had enthusiastic news of promotions, postings,
moves up the career ladder.
It came as a surprise, then, to learn some time ago that Greg had fallen in
love, left his job at the UN in New York and, with no clear prospects in
mind, moved to Cambodia. I was curious to see what kind of life he had found
for himself in Phnom Penh. I might have been less so if he had taken up,
say, with someone from Milton Keynes and become an accountant. But here he
was, settled down with a French-Cambodian woman and helping her run a hotel
for the Foreign Legion. It sounded as improbable and as curious as events in
Cambodia itself.
I had no greater idea of what to expect in the Cambodian capital than of the
changes in my brother's life. When we left Indochina early in the 1960s,
Cambodia was a Buddhist kingdom still ruled by a demi-god: an old, cultured
country, hierarchical, mannered and ceremonial, authoritarian, admired
nostalgically by the French civil servants who had administered it so
recently.
However, the bloom of centuries was mangled rapidly by the ideologies that
colonialism engendered. Over the next three decades, one cataclysm followed
another: a Vietnamese war that over-flowed its borders; a secret US bombing
campaign to halt the spill; a right-wing political coup; invasion by US
forces and their South Vietnamese allies; four years of social chaos and at
least 1m lives lost to genocidal, Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge
revolutionaries; invasion again and the installation of a Soviet-supported,
Vietnamese-led regime; and 10 years of factional fighting which bled the
country dry and has left it without effective government to this day.
It is a familiar, endless litany of strategic super-power manoeuvring,
regional economic opportunism and national political chicanery, a list of
horrors that makes you wonder that there is anything left of Cambodia at
all.
I arrived in Phnom Penh at the beginning of Tet, the Chinese new year
celebrated in south-east Asia wherever Chinese traders, and the communities
that follow them, have settled. As I wheeled into town from the airport,
crowds of Cambodians in their holiday best strolled the promenade alongside
the wide and muddy Mekong river.
Brides in long white dresses posed in parks for family albums. Bands of
children set off firecrackers in places calculated to cause maximum
mischief. The city was festive, vibrant, humming, a far cry from the ravaged
image that two decades of Cambodian war reporting has left in our minds.
From the back of a motorcycle taxi, Phnom Penh is a place that would have
delighted Lewis Carroll. It appears to have decided that it lives in some
upside-down, back-to-front universe.
You do not simply drive in Phnom Penh. No matter what the situation, and at
whatever speed is half-sanely possible, you merge. In Phnom Penh,
intersections are challenges to be overcome, vigorously. Left and right are
nominal notions. The only rule is that big gives way to small. Downtown,
several hundred thousand motorcycles, cyclo-trishaws, bicycles, UN trucks,
cars and 4 x 4s all work to a rhythm that is innovative, energetic and
untrammeled by fixed procedure. It is a style that reflects the ethos of the
entire city; surprisingly, it more or less works.
Gregory lives not far from the river on a bumpy dirt road off the Monument
d'Independence. It is a residential area of whitewashed villas; small,
smoking, street-side piles of burning rubbish; palm and ornamental banana
trees, and orchestras of lonely dogs that delight in barber-shop harmony at
3am. Sometimes there is the sound of small-arms fire at night. Gregory lives
in the company of a small dog, a baby monkey named Lucy, a floating
population of servants, their dependents and hangers-on - and Paulette.
Paulette is dark, petite and pretty. She has a quick, white smile and a
voice that changes mysteriously, and as rapidly as needed, from the liquid
vowels of French to the short, chopped consonants of Khmer. She has the
inner poise of the Asian and the European's spontaneous energy. After 20
years of life in the west, she has decided to give the Cambodian part of
herself another chance.
Gregory is not the first young man to be lured by the attractions of
Cambodia. In the mid-1930s, a French military surgeon, having finished a
tour of duty in Saigon, decided that he liked colonial life in the east and
settled in Phnom Penh.
He taught at the city's faculty of medicine, opened a branch of the Pasteur
Institute and built a leprosarium. Among his patients was the young Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, even then part-deified royalist and part-populist
demagogue, the quirky leader upon whom the fate of Cambodia hangs so shakily
today.
In spite of his busy life, the good doctor eventually found time to marry a
Cambodian wife and start a family which grew to include six children.
Paulette was one of them. Educated in French schools in Phnom Penh, Gallic
in taste and temperament, the doctor's family found life ever more difficult
under the radical nationalisms that began tearing Cambodia apart in the
1960s.
By the early 1970s, their father having died, the children began drifting
away to studies, marriages and more stable lives in the west. By April 1975,
when Phnom Penh surrendered to advancing battalions of the Khmer Rouge, only
three of the children and the doctor's widow were left. She was lucky; she
escaped the rural exodus and death in the killing fields by finding refuge
in the French embassy.
Few of the friends Paulette left behind in Cambodia are alive today. Talk to
any number of Phnom-Penhois and you are unlikely to find one who is not a
survivor of a horrifying family tragedy. Paulette's decision to remake her
life in Cambodia has required not only a prospect of peace, however slim,
but courage to overcome the memories of the past.
Phnom Penh is a city of several faces. In the days that followed my arrival,
Paulette showed me Khmer Phnom Penh - royal palaces of tapering spires and
delicate gables curving skyward; temples and pagodas where, through the
drifting smoke of joss sticks, the electric halos of gaudy plaster Buddhas
blink on and off, and side streets teeming with noodle stalls, sidewalk
barbers and motorcycle repairmen performing miracles with bits of scrap
metal and wire.
Paulette also showed me colonial Phnom Penh, the city of her own past: the
arched porticoes of the Lycee Descartes where she studied; the art-deco
facades of the Circle Sportif where she swam and played tennis; the
mahogany-lined halls of the Hotel Royal, the most elegant Cambodian watering
hole of its day.
Now, much of colonial Phnom Penh is sad. The sienna walls of abandoned
villas are covered with mould and lichen. Their jalousies are weather-beaten
and open to the breeze, their gardens forsaken and gone to seed. For
Paulette, it all evokes a special sadness.
But the Khmer and colonial faces of the city are mere sideshows to Phnom
Penh these days. They have all but disappeared beneath the big top thrown up
by the biggest circus in town - the UN.
If the 22,000-man, 8,000-vehicle, Dollars 2bn peace-keeping effort of the UN
Transitional Authority in Cambodia, the largest operation of its type ever
mounted, has failed to assert itself over the most crucial parts of the
country - Khmer Rouge territory - it is indisputably present in Phnom Penh.
I have difficulty imagining just how bad the Pol Pot years were. Even under
the Vietnamese who replaced Pol Pot, Phnom Penh was a dismal and deprived
place. Today, all that has changed. A wild west of the far east, the city is
riding a booming, unregulated, dollar-propelled economic wave.
One afternoon, Paulette took me to one of the two small hotels she has
leased and manages in town. Pastis, Gauloises, card games of vingt-et-un,
tired men in jungle fatigues talking about their work in paddy-fields - with
eyes half closed, I might have been watching French Saigon in the 1950s.
Paulette, though, is only one of tens of thousands of Phnom-Penhois who have
found a living in the artificially-generated service economy. Visit some of
the scores of other hotels, shops selling luxury goods, foreign car
dealerships, bars, restaurants and dancing halls that have sprung up like
mushrooms, and you will find that the UN has brought the whole world to the
city.
In the Pacific Hotel I watched a mountainous, bristly Bulgarian soldier
wrestle a slip of a girl - one of the many Vietnamese who have flooded into
the country for its quick and easy living - out of her chair and on to the
dance floor for his own Balkan version of rock 'n' roll. In The Cathouse,
favoured for its shorts-clad Filipino girls, I watched New Zealanders thrash
Canadians at the pool table. In the No Problem Cafe, a villa of restored
colonial elegance, I sipped the ultimate in UN-inspired cocktails: a house
special of gin, blue curacao and lime known as la casque bleu (the blue
helmet).
Following two decades of hardship, Phnom Penh's quick prosperity seems
something of a dream. In spite of the smoke-and-mirrors magic of the
spending boom, there is little solid investment. No one knows what will
become of Cambodia and Phnom Penh after the UN goes home. Everything is
sold, nothing is made. Most new fixed investment is not Cambodian but ethnic
Chinese. Profit on assets is calculated not in years but in months or weeks.
Private and state corruption is endemic: government officials sell
everything from official cars to the buildings in which they work.
It makes Paulette sad. I asked her one evening why the country seems to have
so little faith in itself or its future. 'Cambodians are a nation of
survivors,' she told me. 'Under Pol Pot they learned to lie, to steal, to
cheat. Day-to-day survival has become everything; when we see an opportunity
today, we seize it before it goes. We live in impermanence and uncertainty.'
Paulette dreams, one day, of opening a fine hotel on Cambodia's lush
tropical coast. Greg imagines environmental protection on the Tonle Sap
Lake, Asia's last great unspoiled wetland. Neither, however, believes an end
to the country's problems lies just around the corner.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Sport: Two codes, one language - Rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO YOU know your rugby union and your rugby league? You know all about the
schism of 1895. You can distinguish between the six-tackle rule and the
turnover law, a play-the ball and a penalty. You would not mistake Martin
Offiah for Andrew Harriman or Shaun Edwards for Dewi Morris. Most of all,
you realise that this afternoon both codes will be on display in London.
At Twickenham, headquarters of rugby union, Harlequins play Leicester in the
Pilkington Cup final and hope to do better than they did last year when they
lost in the last minute of extra time to Bath. A few miles north, Wembley
will resound to cheers of support for Wigan and Widnes as they compete for
rugby league's Silk Cut Challenge cup final.
Union and league, amateur and professional, 15-a-side and 13-a-side; the
shape of the ball is the same but in other aspects rugby union and rugby
league are, to paraphrase Winston Churchill's remark about Britain and the
US, two codes divided by the same game.
Rugby union is amateur, a game played by men who have other jobs. Rugby
league is professional, a game for which men are paid to play. That is
correct, is it not? Up to a point, but consider the following apparent
contradictions.
Bath, Llanelli, Leicester and Northampton and Gloucester rugby union clubs
probably turn over more money in a season than most league clubs.
Rugby league has one current star who can describe himself as a millionaire:
Ellery Hanley. Rugby union has two. David Campese has claimed he became
rugby union's first millionare three years ago. It is said he has been
joined by Will Carling, captain of England.
It is fashionable for rugby union officials (known, for a reason that has
never been quite clear to me, as alickadoos) to belittle rugby league. This
attitude is misplaced because, if anything, union has copied far more from
league these past years than vice versa.
In union these days it is commonplace to hear talk of a big hit, meaning a
fierce tackle such as that by Mickey Skinner on Marc Cecillon in the
semi-final of the World Cup. These big hits have come from rugby league and
are a direct result of the extra emphasis now being placed on upper-body
strength.
Australian rugby league players started the trend more than 10 years years
ago when they began to work with weights to develop their upper-body
strength. Previously they had concentrated on building up the torso and
legs.
When the Kangaroos (the Australian rugby league team) reaped the benefits,
the Wallabies (the Australian rugby union team) sat up and noticed what
their countrymen were achieving and added serious weight training to their
schedules. Since the 1987 World Cup, weights have become as much a part of
union jargon as drop outs, the 22 and the line-outs.
The scrum has never played a significant part in league. These days, it is
being downgraded in rugby union, too, as are rucking and mauling. These days
scrum-halves in rugby union put the ball in to the second row of their
scrums as a matter of course - as they have done for years in league. A
strike against the head is a rarity these days, like a try by a prop
forward. I have seen more than 40 games this season and from all the
hundreds of scrums in those games only once have I seen a scrum-half
penalised for a crooked put in.
That is not all: at the World Cup sevens in Edinburgh there were often more
players offside than onside; men standing almost on top of their opposite
numbers. This is beginning to happen in 15-a-side, too, and is another trend
that has spread from rugby league. So has the elaborate sign language
referees now use to explain why they blew their whistle - not to mention the
trend of miking referees for television.
If you think the lines between the two codes are clearly drawn then try
answering these questions: which clubs routinely draw 6,000-8,000 spectators
to a home game? Wigan do and so do Leeds, both of which are league clubs.
But, significantly, so do Llanelli, who have been so startlingly good in
Wales this season. There were 10,000 at Stradey Park on Wednesday night to
watch Llanelli clinch the league title. Bath would attract more spectators
if their ground was bigger. As it is, the capacity of 8,000 is reached at
almost every home game.
Which code offers its star players cars, houses, jobs, petrol money? Again,
the obvious guess is league, but increasingly the answer is union. There has
been a sea-change in the attitude to money and the like in rugby union, and
a new job, a sponsored car, help with a mortgage and money are commonplace
in the supposedly amateur code.
I think the two codes are closer together than ever. If I could not go to
Twickenham then I would climb on the Tube and head for Wembley.
Twickenham offers a confrontation between two outstanding flankers, Neil
Back of Leicester and Peter Winterbottom. At Wembley there is the chance to
see Jonathan Davies, arguably the most complete footballer of his time,
dazzling Wigan's all-star team and perhaps sparking an upset victory for
Widnes.
Frankly, I wish I could watch both matches live.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Sport: Sorry lot of the A Team - Teresa McLean meets the
stoical skipper of the England seconds / Cricket
</HEADLINE>

THE ENGLAND 'A' Team losing all ends up to Essex on a damp day at Chelmsford
is not everyone's idea of fun. But it was interesting, and once it had
emerged from the drizzle it proved to be well worthwhile. Partly, I'm
afraid, this was because it reminded me how empty and dead English county
cricket is, and partly because it reminded me how much at ease Essex always
appear when playing at Chelmsford, however empty its tiers of seats and,
lest we forget, how much at ease Graham Gooch looks in the teeth of battle.
Admittedly, with a first innings lead of only 74 to defend, the A Team
bowling amounted to little more than a skirmish, but Gooch batted strongly,
especially to good balls. He is never graceful, sometimes tucked up, but
almost always hard-hitting. If he captains England this summer he is likely
to be level-headed against the Australians who are under the knowing hand of
that other Essex stalwart, Allan Border.
I hope the England selectors create an attack with some character against
Australia by choosing a couple of good spinners, preferably one leg, one
off, this summer. Far the most effective bowler at Chelmsford was the Essex
off-spinner Peter Such, playing for his county; he took 11 for 124, making
England's batting hopefuls look pretty silly in the process.
Such toured Australia with the A Team last winter and, as in Chelmsford, so
in Canberra 'Screaming Lord Such', as the locals call him, bowled well.
Against the Australian Cricket Academy his match figures were 11 for 144.
Such, like the nippy rather than fast Andy Caddick, had some good games on
tour and came back confident.
I went to see A Team captain Martyn Moxon at Chelmsford, when he was still
contemplating the misery of his team's batting.   He said he thought there
had been some 'writing down' of the A Tour in Australian reports, to devalue
it and stop improving players like Such and Caddick getting full benefit
from it.
One thing the A Team did learn on a tour their hosts never really took
seriously was resilience in the face of failures and defeats, uncomfortable
distances and disorders, empty grounds, some second-rate opposition and only
second-class status for games.
Moxon struck me as refreshingly uncomplaining, with traces of old-fashioned
enthusiasm yet reluctant to speak unless he had something to say. He is one
of a series of nice captains chosen for the England A Teams: Mark Nicholas
took the first to Kenya and Zimbabwe in early 1990; Hugh Morris took the
next to Pakistan and Sri Lanka and stood in for the injured Moxon in Bermuda
and the West Indies in the winter of 1991-92.
I asked Moxon whether the A Team players really saw themselves as future
England players or whether there was a danger of them becoming has-beens,
not-quites and also-rans, strengthened by the presence of Test players such
as Jack Russell and himself, but falling short of Ted Dexter's claim at the
start of the A Tour to Pakistan and Sri Lanka that 'it's about producing
future Test cricketers for England.'
Misfortune has taught Moxon to look on the bright side. There is no other
way to survive as captain of Yorkshire. He gave me a reassuring smile. 'It's
every English cricketer's dream to play for England. But if it doesn't
happen, it doesn't'
I decided perhaps I did not need one of Moxon's patent Tizer mixtures to
keep me going after all. Somebody near us in the pavilion bar had just
ordered one and Moxon described them, rather alarmingly, as something to
really get his benefit year going. He deserves to do well. The winter was a
hard one, dogged by the bad luck which seems to blight him whenever his
dream comes true and he finds himself picked for his country, whatever the
level.
He was picked for the 1984 Lord's Test against the West Indies but had to
withdraw because of injury and wait until 1986 to make his Test debut. He
has played in 10 Test matches, never with his place safe or settled. His
highest Test score is 99.
Nor have the A tours brought him much better luck. The 1991-92 tour to the
Caribbean was demanding and England lost, but Moxon broke his right index
finger in a casual game before he had a chance to take part in the fight. He
hurt that same finger again in Australia this winter, though it recovered in
time for him to score, inter alia, 123 not out in Canberra. It may even be
that he was better off with only a limited share in a tour which, like the
unfortunate one to Pakistan and Sri Lanka, victim of political unrest in
Pakistan, failed to get the top rating it sought.
Two A tours have worked and two have not. The A Team idea was built under
the sympathetic guidance of Keith Fletcher and has encouraged a host of Test
cricketers, such as Mike Atherton, who averaged 83 on the first, gentle trip
to Kenya and Zimbabwe.
It is the two most ambitious ones, to Pakistan and Australia, that have
stayed trapped as second-rate efforts. Perhaps next winter's tour of South
Africa will do better, combining tough cricket with good relations.
There have always been reserves and youth teams; Moxon himself has played
for England, England B and England A in his international career. I am
inclined to be sceptical about the notion of an A Team breeding-house for
future Test players and cannot help noticing how well the best countries
manage without one, but it is worth a try.
This last tour was difficult and even the many injured players - Moxon,
Graham Lloyd, James Boiling, Mark Ilott, Dominic Cork, Caddick - learnt a
lot.
Graham Thorpe has now been on all four A tours; he is a stylish left-handed
batsman and a fine fielder. Surely it will soon be time for the selectors to
give A Team veterans such as him a chance to play a Test.

<TEXT>
AFTER eight topsy-turvy months the struggle to be the first holder of the
hideous new Premier League trophy has been reduced to a simple equation.
Manchester United need to win one of their two remaining games to clinch
their first league title since 1967. Even if they cannot manage that they
will be champions if Aston Villa fail to win their last two games.
So far United have shown little sign of the collywobbles which undermined a
commanding lead in the league last year, but they face two opponents who
will expose any weakness of nerve.
The first, at Old Trafford on Monday, are Blackburn Rovers, the Premier
League's form team whose last game was a 3-0 win over Aston Villa. The
second are Wimbledon next Sunday. Wimbledon, according to accepted wisdom,
are the last team anyone would want to face needing a win to clinch the
title.
Wimbledon are reviled among the soccer 'purists' who refuse to accept that
part of the game's beauty is that it lends itself to so many styles of play.
Wimbledon are not pretty but they deserve respect.
For the purists this season has been a joy. The title has been a
three-cornered fight between teams that play the game 'properly'. But there
is also a huge difference between the styles of Villa and United. And what
has separated those two from their main challenger, Norwich City, is not
their attacking play but a characteristic they share with Wimbledon: steely
pragmatism.
Of the two contenders, Villa have been more enjoyable to watch. Ron
Atkinson, their manager, has bought a string of canny veterans, comfortable
with the ball at their feet, happy to work unrelentingly for the team. Their
midfield is short on flair but long on intelligence.
Villa can win matches with the breakaway pace of Dean Saunders and Dalian
Atkinson, but they can be patient, too: penning opponents in defence, moving
the ball fluently from wing to wing, picking away for holes. The movement
off the ball is continuous; players find space and in turn receive
uncomplicated ground passes, nearly every one delivered simply, securely,
with the instep. Dwight Yorke won BBC TV's last goal-of-the-month award with
a simple tap-in after a passing move involving nearly every Villa outfield
player.
At most Villa games this season the neutral fan has been able to settle back
in his seat and enjoy a flowing display of deceptively simple elegance.
United you watch from the edge of your seat. This is not because they live
dangerously. Their defence is even tougher than Villa's and has given them
an advantage in goal difference which may prove decisive.
United's attack is addicted to risk. Paul Ince, Ryan Giggs, Mark Hughes and,
most of all, Eric Cantona, disdain the simple technique of the coaching
manual. Every United attack is conjured from flicks, chips and back heels.
Even with players as gifted as these, such tricks fail more often than they
succeed. As a result, United can go for long periods without mounting a
coherent attack. But that is not the point.
United's most terrifying weapon is the pace of Giggs, Lee Sharpe and, when
he plays, Andrei Kanchelskis. Not for them the careful rhythm of Villa; they
try to engineer breaks from midfield, or at least to prevent opposing
defences settling into a comfortable formation.
United's march in recent weeks has been characterised by sudden goals from
rapid raids, starting with the three that destroyed Norwich's offside trap
and title hopes, and most recently those from Hughes and Ince that pierced
Crystal Palace 10 days ago.
Last year, Alex Ferguson, United's manager, picked increasingly defensive
teams in the final weeks; he blames injuries to strikers but that does not
explain why Kanchelskis started just four of the final eight games. This
year Ferguson has not blinked and he has kept picking four attackers.
The policy has been a success psychologically as much as tactically. 'We
went out dreading every game towards the end of last year,' says Hughes.
'Now it is a joy to play.'

WHEN ILLNESS STRIKES THE LEADER by Jerrold M Post and Robert S Robins Yale
Pounds 19.95, 243 pages
A LARGE number of political leaders, whether kings, presidents or prime
ministers, have been physically or mentally ill, sometimes both. The problem
is how to get rid of them before their illness impairs their judgment. There
is, as Jerrold Post and Robert Robins write in this new study, a 'lack of a
general theory relating health to political events and of the
interdisciplinary training necessary to address this domain'.
Happily, the two American academics do not attempt entirely to fill the gap,
for it would be impossible outside Utopia to have a panel of experts
deciding when someone should cease to lead on grounds of health. For a
start, who would rule on the health (or the motives) of the panel?
Instead their book should be read as a seriously anecdotal account of
madness in great ones. A disconcertingly large number of the case studies
turn out to be British. There were not only King George III and Castlereagh,
the foreign secretary who killed himself because it was rumoured he was a
homosexual. There was also Churchill who, when he returned as prime minister
in 1951 at the age of 76, was a 'virtual walking text-book of pathology. He
had significant illnesses affecting his heart, brain, lungs,
gastrointestinal tract, skin and eyes.' At one stage both Churchill and
Eden, his most obvious successor, were incapacitated at the same time and
the news was concealed from all but a small number of the cabinet.
The Americans have had their problems, too: Woodrow Wilson, F D Roosevelt
and John Kennedy, to name but a few, were all in some way impaired. Richard
Nixon was in a desperate state in the last period of his presidency and the
damage done to Ronald Reagan in the Hinckley assassination attempt was much
more serious than was admitted at the time. In France President Pompidou
managed generally to conceal his illness until almost the end, though
curiously his judgment seems to have been unaffected.
Dictators, such as Hitler and Stalin, we know about. No one was powerful
enough to advise them to step down, but the authors add interesting points.
They argue that if President Hindenburg had not been senile, Hitler might
never have become chancellor, and note that when Lenin became ill he tried
very hard to prevent Stalin taking over but was too physically weak to press
his case.
Two leaders who were obliged to give up power by a small group of advisers
were Ludwig II, the mad king of Bavaria, and President Bourguiba of Tunisia,
but the circumstances are too diverse to allow any conclusions to be drawn.
The country that has come closest to devising a constitutional approach is
the US, which introduced the 25th amendment after the assassination of
President Kennedy. Oddly enough, it has not been directly used in spite of
several disabilities since, the White House preferring to act on a more ad
hoc basis. Thus the best guidance the authors give to advisers, political or
medical, is 'When in doubt, shout]'

HOME FIRES by Donald Katz HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 618 pages
THE GENERATION of young Americans who settled down to start families just
after the second world war could hardly have dreamed of the problems lying
ahead. After years of Depression and global carnage, they believed that all
they had to do to put the eruptions of the previous two decades behind them
was work hard and live right. And they did just that, creating an era of
unrivalled prosperity. But it was an affluence which brought psychological
pressures to bear on the American family that Ma Joad or the mothers of GIs
never had to confront.
This muddying of the American middle class idyll in post-war America is the
subject of Donald Katz's exhaustive and compelling Home Fires. It chronicles
the Gordons of Long Island, a family so affected by their times that if a
novelist invented them he would be criticised for crudely obvious
characterisation. But the Gordons are a real family, their name unchanged
for purposes of the book, though it was changed in 1948, when Sam and Eve
Goldenberg, recently moved to the suburbs, decided to alter it to the more
homogeneous Gordon.
Like many couples married during the war, Sam and Eve were the children of
poor immigrants who simply wanted a better way of life. Fortunately, they
lived in an era in which hard work could achieve that. Sam, a master
electrician, was able to transport his wife and four children from the South
Bronx to suburban Nassau County, where large tracts of land were being
subdivided and 'developed' for young soldiers and their war brides.
At first, suburban life was everything Eve and Sam hoped, especially when
contrasted with the cramped poverty of their urban childhoods. The spacious
yard, the big car, the Saturday night dances at the club. So what if Sam had
to work ungodly hours, catching only the briefest glimpses of his kids each
night? So what if Eve, who had dreamed of being a torch singer, grew so
bored by the drudgery of suburban housewifery that she would throw plates
against the wall to remind herself she was alive? They were living in the
suburbs. They had made it.
The cracks began to show when the kids hit their teens. Susan, the eldest,
was a headstrong girl who, perhaps because of her father's absence during
the first few years of her life, just could not seem to abide the man.
Lorraine was equally rebellious, while Sheila developed a bad case of nerves
from the 'duck and cover' nuclear war drills at school And what to make of
the sensitive Ricky, so different from his macho father, already the butt of
neighbourhood bullies?
With the 1960s the family came comprehensively unglued. Susan went off to
Vassar and then London, fuelling her rebelliousness with a taste for drugs.
Lorraine got pregnant at the age of 17 and moved to New York, where she
began using heroin and singing with a radical feminist pop group. And
Ricky's penchant for show tunes and his mother's make-up was giving Sam
serious pause in his dreams of having his son one day inherit the family
business.
By the end of the decade the kids seemed to have been everywhere - swinging
London, Berkeley, Greenwich Village. Two even made it to Woodstock. And Sam
and Eve were sitting in their big suburban split-level, their heads reeling,
feeling like the parents Bob Dylan sang of when he proclaimed 'Your sons and
your daughters are beyond your command.'
With the 'Me' decade of the 1970s, this dissolution intensified. Though
Susan received an advance from Random House to write a feminist manifesto,
she soon sank into a bizarre re-enlightenment cult and ended the decade as a
junkie on the streets. Lorraine discovered yoga, transplanting herself and
her four kids - Magdelana, Ram, Shiva and Gupal - to an ashram in Yogaville,
Virginia. Sheila opened a health food store but then married a yuppie and
moved back to the 'burbs. And Ricky, to nobody's surprise but Sam's, came
out of the closet and moved to New York during the heady days of Gay
Liberation.
With the 1980s, as if to provide an ironic commentary on Ronald Reagan's
cynical and hypocritical focus on 'family values', the Gordons slowly came
back together. Susan seemed to be winning her fight with drugs, while
Lorraine extricated herself from the sway of her guru. Sheila replaced her
ageing mother as the focus for family gatherings, while Ricky and Sam came
to terms with the son's sexuality.
Home Fires is a compelling study of the American family at the historical
moment when it came under intense and often damning scrutiny. The affluence
and subsequent leisure of the post-war years saw a genie of self-absorption
released from the American bottle. Not surprisingly, it was the institution
of the family that came under the most pressure. Whereas, as Eve often
states, people of her generation had no time to be themselves, her children
had time for nothing else.
And though it is tempting to see all their nascent efforts at
self-definition - the cults and drugs and movements - as being wildly comic,
it is worth bearing in mind that Americans born between 1943 and 1956 were
inner pioneers just as much as their ancestors had explored terrestrial
wildernesses. We laugh at them from the vantage point of having learned from
their mistakes.
Indeed, if the book has one weak point, it is that the Gordons are so
typical of their era that they become archetypical. For every fad, there is
at least one of them who manages to indulge it to the hilt.
That said, this is a finely written book which makes for compelling reading.
Its heroes are undoubtedly Sam and Eve, who endure their children's vagaries
and accusations with patience, wisdom and humour, enabling them to survive
travails that would have buried most other parents. It is a strength which
allows for the reconciliations that close the book, just as Reagan and his
acolyte Bush, who talked about family values but never meant a word of it,
leave the stage for the first Baby Boomer president.

MORGAN: A BI0GRAPHY OF E M FORSTER by Nicola Beauman Hodder &amp; Stoughton
Pounds 20, 404 pages
LITERARY biographers seem to be increasingly tempted to focus on the detail
of their subject's life rather than the substance and achievement of his
books. Some of them compound the offence (no doubt profitably) by
highlighting who-did-what-to-whom. Here, thank goodness, is a splendid
exception - a biography whose aim is 'to study the life in order to
understand the novels . . . ' In other words, Nicola Beauman puts the books
first. To confirm her priority, she allows only 40 pages for the last 45
years of the life. She also - correctly - assumes that her readers will
already know the novels.
A new biography of E M Forster must have needed courage. P N Furbank's
two-volume 'authorised' version is extremely good and only 15 years old. But
it is fair to say that Furbank concentrated on the 'life'; on a re-reading,
he turns out to be curiously sketchy on the creation and analysis of the
novels, though he is fascinating about Forster's long, uneventful, rich,
suburban, decent and homosexual life.
Nevertheless, it is still easy to lose sight of the central mystery -
tragedy? - of Forster's career, which is that he wrote six great novels and
at 45 he was finished. There followed, of course, many years as the 'sage',
the voice of British liberal humanism, latterly resident at King's - Beauman
arguably under-covers this role - but the novels are what matter, and indeed
the films, which have brought them to a wider audience and must certainly
not be sneered at.
Forster was trapped, for most of his life, in an intense relationship with
his widowed mother; Beauman writes of the 'glueing' of mother and son. In
his childhood, they lived in the Hertfordshire house which was to be the
model for Howards End, and were forced to move out - a seminal event]
Thereafter they lived in Tunbridge Wells and Weybridge, where he wrote all
his novels.
His homosexuality was repressed until, at 37, he was posted to Alexandria in
the Great War; thereafter he was actively promiscuous, taking working class
lovers in the Bloomsbury style, before settling for one of the three great
loves of his life, Bob Buckingham, a married policeman through whom he found
a family of his own. It is impossible to deny that when Forster 'came out'
(privately, of course), the novels came to an end; he only finished A
Passage to India with difficulty in 1924, and seems never to have expected
to write another.
All this is known, but the story is explained and developed by Beauman with
constantly interesting reference to the novels. She has had access to some
sources unavailable to Furbank (though the diaries at King's are embargoed
after 1949): for example, she gives fuller details of the background to
Maurice (the homosexual novel which was suppressed by Forster in his
lifetime) and she goes into more detail about the changes Forster made
between early and later drafts of A Passage to India. In the first version
of the scene in the Marabar Caves, incredibly, there is an actual assault;
in the final version, Forster has arrived at a void which only Mrs Moore can
comprehend.
Beauman also allows herself to insert her own speculation and opinions - it
is a very personal book. (Sometimes she goes too far - did Mrs Forster
really take her son to Italy to avoid the Oscar Wilde trial? Is Where Angels
Fear To Tread sensibly described as 'the first modern novel'?).
But again and again she makes points which are helpful, even revelatory. She
is very good on the initial nine-month visit to Italy and its impact on the
young man's 'suburban soul'. Lucy, of A Room with a View, is trapped and
escapes to Italy as did Forster; she is not so much Forster en travesti, as
she symbolically loses her Baedeker, but 'what matters is that her situation
is his. He had become coerced, imprisoned in a way of life which is usually
the lot of women . . . ' Mr Emerson, in the same book, who so memorably
speaks for Forster's life-long rejection of 'muddle', is related to Edward
Carpenter, the sandal-wearing and homosexual socialist and free-thinker who
had an important influence on Forster at a critical moment even before they
actually met.
And throughout all this, Beauman clings to the main point, which may help
explain his lop-sided career - that by great good fortune he discovered his
'theme' very early: 'the English middle classes exposed to something other
(a foreign country, an expedition away from their normal territory), who are
mocked for their insularity and obtuseness, and who then discover something
so disconcerting that they are forced to realise, even if sub-consciously,
that they have confronted something vaster than themselves; in the end they
are either saved - or not.'
No wonder he is one of the great English novelists] Sometimes, as I say, the
enthusiast in Beauman goes overboard. To my mind, she is too keen on Howards
End, to the point where she describes the odious Mr Wilcox as the heir of
Margaret Thatcher, and she understates Forster's congenital inability to
understand marriage - his famous reference to 'the astonishing glass shade .
. . that interposes between married couples and the world' surely comes
close to disqualifying him from writing about one of the most fruitful areas
of the novelist's art. But this is a biography which is a pleasure to read,
and which will fascinate and delight and sometimes provoke all those who
continue to esteem Forster - his books, and now the films.

GETTING THERE by William Howells Compass Press Pounds 26/Pounds 14.50, 261 p
ages
IN SEARCH OF THE NEANDERTHALS by Christopher Stringer and Clive Gamble
Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 18.95, 247 pages
THE NEANDERTALS by Eric Trinkaus and Pat Shipman Jonathan Cape Pounds 20,
454 pages
APART from those who take the Book of Genesis literally, most people know
that humans descended from apes, and that our closest relatives among
animals are chimpanzees and gorillas. Until now the fascinating details of
enquiry into human evolution have been the province of specialists. But in
the last two decades debate has reached a crucial point: two main theories
have emerged about our origins, and the reason for the current spate of
books is that the experts are now submitting their arguments to the public.
The branch of science which investigates mankind's origins is
palaeoanthropology. It is based mainly on the study of fossilised skeletal
remains of early humans and their hominid ancestors, discovered by chance in
caves or ancient lake-beds. It is like trying to reconstruct a
thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle from a mere handful of remaining shapes. It is
an utterly fascinating branch of science. As each of these new books shows,
it is more like a gripping detective story than a scientific pursuit.
William Howells, until recently Professor at Harvard University, is the
doyen of contemporary palaeoanthropologists. His beautifully written survey
of the history of human origins is a worthy successor to Mankind in the
Making, the book that made him famous 30 years ago.
Lucidly succinct and magisterial, Howells' account takes us from the
beginnings of life on earth to the emergence of humans, setting the scene
for the more detailed discussion given by Christopher Stringer and Eric
Gamble in their superb study of the origins of modern man. They give a
brilliant introduction to the field: richly informative, marvellously
illustrated and always accessible to the layman. They not only investigate
the competing theories about our origins but explain how evidence for them
is gathered and assessed. This is excellent enjoyment and instruction in
one; anyone interested in the subject must own this book.
Eric Trinkaus and Pat Shipman, despite succumbing to the disagreeable
current fashion for chattily personalised writing which publishers believe
makes 'serious' subjects palatable to general readers, have produced a
valuable history of palaeoanthropology which dramatises the clash of
opinions now dividing it.
Like Stringer and Gamble, their interests lie chiefly with the more recent
end of the human evolutionary story, beginning 100,000 years ago with the
emergence in Europe and Western Asia of heavy-browed, massively-built
Neanderthal Man, named after the valley near Dusseldorf where, in 1856, the
first recognised skull was found. They recount the controversy that
immediately arose about whether Neanderthals are our ancestors or a mere
evolutionary side-branch. This question is at the heart of the current
controversy.
Most theorists agree that ape and man diverged about 5m years ago. The
earliest known hominids, the Australopithecines, date from 3.7m to 1.6m
years ago, represented in popular imagination by the diminutive hominid ape
called 'Lucy' The commonest and most enduring early man is Homo Erectus,
found across Africa, Europe, and Asia from 1.6m to 300,000 years ago. About
125,000 years ago our direct ancestors, archaic Homo Sapiens, appear at
African sites; then, mystifyingly a little later, Neanderthal Man appears,
only to vanish about 35,000 years ago. Was Neanderthal Man part of our own
direct lineage, or is he an aberration? All the authors under review attempt
to answer this question.
The first recognised Neanderthal remains were judged to belong to an idiot
with rickets. When accumulating evidence proved that Neanderthals were a new
kind of man, opinion divided; some took the ancestral, others the
aberrational view. Only one thing was clear: Neanderthals are distinctive,
differing from early modern humans in their powerful frames and heavy
skulls. They seem to have died out with the last ice age, rapidly succeeded
by a quite different type: taller, slimmer, smooth-browed Cro-Magnon Man.
And here one immediately sees the source of controversy. Ideas of race
sprang to the fore. Some earlier anthropologists refused to countenance the
possibility of human descent from Neanderthals, perceiving them as violent,
shambling brutes. Others interpreted early modern man in Aryan terms as
Neanderthals' conquerors. Either way, the savage appearance of Neanderthals
made them repugnant, even frightening. Studies at certain sites suggested
that Neanderthals might be cannibals. The brutish stereotype stuck, and
concepts of 'low' and 'high' human forms gave impetus to racism and eugenic
theories.
But evidence shows that Neanderthals buried their dead, perhaps on flowers
as the Shanidar fossils seem to testify, or with grave-gifts of meat,
perhaps for a journey into an afterlife. Some fossil individuals appear to
have lived into old age as cripples or invalids, impossible unless others
cared for them. This makes the brutish caricature implausible and has
encouraged some to think that Neanderthals genuinely belong to humanity's
lineage.
The needle-in-the-haystack nature of the enquiry has elicited both
brilliance and bizarrerie from researchers. Exquisite science has been
offset by folly or pettiness, the latter illustrated by those who, out of
jealousy, refused to let colleagues view their fossil finds. And there has
even been fraud, at its worst with Piltdown Man, the supposed apeman
'discovered' in Sussex in 1912.
The main conflict of theory is between the view that after the initial
spread of Homo Erectus from Africa about 1m years ago, different types of
humans evolved in the local areas where groups of Erectus settled. This is
known as the Regional Continuity hypothesis or, in Howells' apt phrase, the
'candelabrum' theory, because the evolutionary tree showing development from
Erectus to different modern human types looks like a many-branched
candelabrum.
The opposing theory is that true modern man developed from the Erectus stock
left in Africa. About 130,000 years ago, this theory has it, true Modern Man
began to spread out of Africa in a second exodus, everywhere replacing the
earlier descendants of Erectus in Europe and Asia. This is called the
Population Replacement hypothesis. It explains why Neanderthals and Modern
Man co-existed for a while, before the former vanished, seemingly displaced
by the latter; with the latter thereafter developing into all the types of
humans now found in the world.
Which hypothesis is right? The jury is out. These books help us to become
informed observers of its deliberations. Whichever way future evidence
pushes the decision, the debate will have given us an affection for our
ancestors and their relatives alike - including the Neanderthals - no matter
which branch of the family tree they sit upon.

THE BATTLE FOR STALINGRAD by Edwin P Hoyt Robson Books Pounds 18.95, 304
pages
IN LATE June 1941 Adolf Hitler launched 'Operation Barbarossa', a
three-fronted attack on the Soviet Union aimed at a near-complete conquest
before the dread Russian winter set in. It very nearly succeeded. Stalin had
decimated the Red Army's command during the purges of the '30s. With an
overwhelming superiority in quality and equipment, Hitler reckoned his
armies would make short work of the Russians.
He did not take into account that incalculable element which fate sneaks
into battles. In this case it was twofold: the extraordinary resilience of
the Russian people, their determination and fatalistic acceptance of
sacrifice; and General Georgi Zhukov, the Red Army's Chief of Staff.
Stalin and Hitler had a grudging admiration for each other. Both conducted
the war with total disregard for the lives of their own people. But whereas
there was no one in the German High Command to curb Hitler's strategic
lunacy, Zhukov found the knack of swaying Stalin to see military sense.
Stalingrad was built in the '20s. Straddling some 30 miles of the Volga, it
was in itself of no outstanding strategic importance. Its significance was
primarily psychological: with its parks, model houses and extensive
industrial complex, Stalingrad epitomised Soviet Communism's highest
achievement. Moreover, it carried Stalin's name.
The first German assault ran out of steam at the gates of Moscow and
Leningrad. Now the focus of the campaign shifted to the southern front in
the Caucasus. Thus in the summer of 1942 every effort was turned to the
capture of Stalingrad as first objective, with a pivotal swing northward on
to Moscow as second. Stalin, even more than Hitler, realised that the hour
of reckoning had come: in Stalingrad the fates of the Soviet Union and Nazi
Germany were to be determined.
Hitler's obsession with the capture of Stalingrad was matched by Stalin's
resolve not to retreat a single step. As both sides geared up for the
confrontation, the scene was set for the Mother of All Battles; the
Armageddon of the century. It proved to be just that. By the end of the
summer the German 6th Army under General von Paulus had gained control of
all but a few pockets of resistance in Stalingrad. Then winter came with
sudden ferocity. In November General Zhukov launched the counter attack
aimed at encircling the 6th Army and cutting it to bits. Previous fatalism -
enforced by NKVD (the Soviet equivalent of the Gestapo) units peremptorily
executing suspected deserters - gave way to growing confidence. At last the
Soviet war industry was out-performing the German. In February 1943 General
von Paulus, his army starved, frozen, sick with typhus, its supplies
exhausted, surrendered unconditionally to the Soviets.
Millions died in the battle. The suffering endured by both sides - but
particularly by soldiers of the besieged 6th Army, where 'Doberman pinscher
stew' was a delicacy while the dogs lasted - defies imagination. The
landscape was left littered with frozen corpses and half-eaten cadavers of
horses. All that remained of Stalingrad was a broken apocalyptic wasteland.
More than 90,000 German soldiers were taken prisoner. Barely 5,000 returned
to tell the tale. At Stalingrad the pendulum swung against Hitler. Here was
the first big turning point of the war.
Literature on Stalingrad is plentiful, including documents newly-released by
post-Soviet Russia. Hoyt has made intelligent use of much of it. The writing
is cinematically vivid. By including personal testimonies of soldiers from
both sides, he offers a poignant human dimension to counter-balance the
carnage and devastation of Stalingrad. I found this book almost impossible
to put down. Regretfully, the maps are awful.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Gardening: 'Plan in May and go away' is good advice -
Viburnums are the lime-loving alternative to rhododendrons, says Robin Lane
Fox, who has his favourites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY IN May, you do not want to be living on my sort of soil. It cannot
grow azaleas, camellias hate it, and a rhododendron will not survive for
more than a month. Elsewhere in Britain, plantations, woods and glens are
near their best for this convenient holiday weekend.
Sometimes, the best is too lurid; I have never reconciled myself to the
bright rhododendrons which have intruded on the great 18th century garden at
Stourhead. Elsewhere, the mauves and sugar pinks have been kept under
control and the light, damp and shading make an Oriental flora look at home
in Scotland. On lime, the rest of us have two options: to go visiting or to
find an alternative which will put up with the conditions.
This weekend, visiting is extremely tempting. The great gardens on acid soil
are slightly ahead of themselves and near their best already: they include
the Isabella plantation in London's Richmond Park, the Savill gardens in
Windsor, Exbury or Leonardslee in the south, or Bodnant in north Wales. If
you cannot grow it, view it: you do not have to live with all the dreary
foliage out of season. In gardens, too, 'plan in May and go away.'
Back home, gardeners on a lime soil need a mid-May alternative. In recent
years, I have been looking for shrubs which can be clipped and trained into
small pseudo-trees, or bushes on standard stems.
It strikes me that the state of the art is to invent a touch of style which
puts familiar plants in an original light. Shrubs on stems like standards
give class, quality and scope for adventure. They need not be expensive, and
I rather suspect that we have still scarcely scratched the surface of the
possibilities. Mercifully, the best of them flower in the mid-May gap and
will tolerate lime, compensating for absent azaleas.
In the retarded Cotswolds, we have yet to see the best of this year's lilacs
but, when they come, mine will be small trees, maintained at eye level by
light pruning. Lilacs work wonderfully as specimen standards, spaced down a
long border or used as upright sentinels instead of yet another columnar
cherry.
Admittedly, they are greedy shrubs which compete for good soil in a border;
but when lucky gardeners are enjoying their white haze of rhododendron
Loderi, these trained lilacs are no small compensation. My favourite is the
purple and white-striped lilac Sensation, which grows into a tree about 6 ft
high, but any of the heavy double purples and single sky-blues are almost as
good if you avoid varieties of maximum spread and vigour.
Take an ordinary bush of lilac; thin it down to one single stem; prevent it
from making top growth until the stem is about 4 ft high - and then allow it
to develop a cluster of shoots in a head which will be a substitute for any
good camellia on alkaline soil.
Honeysuckles respond admirably to the same styling if you tie one main stem
on to a 4 ft cane and allow only the top growth to develop through a
circular metal plant support fixed at the cane's summit. Early and late
Dutch honeysuckles are excellent candidates for this job, but my favourite
for mid-May is the heavily-scented Graham Thomas form, the pale, creamy
blooms of which are just bursting into their stickily-sweet flower. Limit it
to one stem; then, let it spread into a head which you trim without mercy
next month after flowering.
At a Gloucestershire nursery, I have been watching bushes of the
white-flowered Choisya, trained similarly into the shape of little evergreen
trees. They seem to work remarkably well and will hold their scented white
blooms at the level of your face, leaving you to decide if you really like
the smell. Here, too, if you can be patient for two or three years, you need
buy only an ordinary shrub. Train it on a single stem up a cane and prevent
any side shoots until it has developed the shape of a standard rose tree.
In warm towns, wisterias are bursting with flower already and will work
marvellously in the same tree format. But, lovely though they are, I think
the best of all candidates are this month's viburnums.
In May, viburnums are the lime-lovers' definitive answer to woods of
enviable rhododendrons. As bushes, the most refined forms are the named
varieties of viburnum Carlesii: Dawn Aurora, which have exceptional elegance
of bud, leaf and pinkish white flowers, the star performers in the family.
As standards or small trees, they are slow-growing and perhaps too refined.
At the other extreme, evergreen forms like the obliging Burkwoodii and Park
Farm Hybrid are too vigorous for tree training. The forms with horizontal
branches are completely unsuitable, lovely though they are in May. Juddii is
a much better bet, more robust than Carlesii and responsive to light
clipping. Personally, I have majored on viburnum Carlcephalum and, in its
fourth year, I am delighted with it.
Among the hybrids, it has exceptional vigour. It has the biggest heads of
flower plus the usual gust of scent, and its leaf is sufficiently grey not
to look too coarse. Nonetheless, a refined taste suspects it of being
vulgar. It is a typical breeders' variety, bigger and bolder than the
delicate parents.
Still, I am sufficiently vulgar to like it as my garden's main backbone,
growing into the shape of standards. Do not judge it when the heads of
flower are still in bud and have a drab buff tone to them. When they open,
the effect is all white, luminous across a lawn when dusk descends on a bank
holiday.
I have clipped eight bushes of this variety into tall, upright shapes by
trimming them after flowering. Like almost all forms of viburnum, it will
reach you with one little trap. Nursery growers have grafted it on to much
coarser stock. You need to watch carefully for stems with the wrong leaves
and a russet-brown colouring, and to cut them off immediately below ground
level. Otherwise, Carlcephalum gets on with the job. As a surrogate tree, I
recommend it from happy experience.
By a pleasant coincidence, every one of these shrubs for tree training
reaches its best in mid to late May and tolerates lime in the soil. With
ingenuity gardeners can, therefore, make up for the impossibility of
azaleas.
In nurseries, shrubs in standard shapes tend to sell for Pounds 20 or more,
as if they are virtuoso features. Actually, they are dead easy. And although
you will still want to visit our public glades of May-flowering shrubs from
the east, you will find on returning home that these contrived little trees
show old friends in a new light in any garden, however small.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Fishing: Bridges over peaceful water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FISHERMAN who is kept from fishing needs an occasional glimpse of water
if he is not to slide into the slough. The odd sighting of sunlight on a
gleaming surface, preferably accompanied by a weeping willow or two,
provides balm to the soul oppressed by the daily grind. This is why we
anglers treasure bridges.
A thousand times, passing back and forth along the M4 near Reading, I have
felt a spurt of irritation and frustration. It comes at the same spot, where
the motorway crosses the River Loddon, the Berkshire stream on which a few
miles lower down I learned my fishing as a lad.
The bridge is an ugly thing, but one would expect that. Its unforgiveable
offence, though, is that the grimy slabs forbid any view of the water
beneath. I know the river is there, but I am denied its healing influence.
That bridge is an ill-natured thing.
Towards London, the motorway soars over the Thames. From the aesthetic point
of view, this bridge is equally wretched - a flat, hideous intruder. But it
has one immense saving grace. It is edged by railings which allow a brief
but sustained sight of the broad waters of our greatest river. Heading to or
away from the horrible metropolis, I am cheered by it.
There is another Thames bridge which I love, although it is a good many
years since I stood on it, rod in hand. It is a long, elegant affair in
mellow red brick, which rises and falls over the river at Sonning (actually,
only half the river, but I need not go into that).
Just upstream of it, on the right bank, stands (or stood) a massive chestnut
tree, with branches trailing to the water. A great bed of underwater
cabbages extended from the foot of the bridge to those branches. In days
gone by, this was the haunt of pike.
We used to stand on the narrow pavement, leaning out over the water, and
swing a livebait towards the chestnut. When the pike were on the feed, it
was unusual for the float to travel more than a few feet before shooting
under. Often we would see the pike rush from the weeds and grab the bait.
Then it was a matter of dragging the beast across to the other side, where
it could be landed from the towpath.
They fought like fury, but rarely weighed more than 5lb although once I
hooked a big one which broke me somewhere in the shadows. This fish, though,
was nothing compared with the monster one of my brothers hooked off another
bridge at Sonning; a legendary creature, this, which devoured ducks, snapped
at swans, and broke his line as if it had been thread.
My favourite bridge view of all is on to my favourite trout river of all,
the Cumberland Eden. For 300 years or so, the road to the village of
Langwathby crossed the river by a beautiful, humped red sandstone bridge.
This, most sadly, was washed away by a mighty flood about 25 years ago, and
replaced by dismal steel and concrete. But it remains a marvellous vantage
point from which to survey the tremendous breadth of water, scanning it for
swooping swifts and rings of rising trout.
Fishing beneath bridges tends to be an awkward business. It is tricky to
propel the fly to the right spot, and more so to see what is going on in the
gloom. I remember expending much time and effort on a big fish which was
feeding noisily in the darkness under a very low brick bridge on a Kennet
sidestream. Eventually I shot the fly into the tunnel, struck when I heard a
gulp, and pulled out a hideous hook-jawed horror of 3 1/2 lb which gave
hardly a kick in protest.
In contrast, there was a bridge on a surging mountain stream in Slovakia
whose functional nastiness was mitigated by the snowy peaks of the High
Tatras beyond. Wading up from below, I came across two pockets of trout,
picking off olives with cheerful abandon in the shadows of the arches. I
emerged the other side with a brace and a half of fat half pounders, which
brought a huge grin to the mournful features of my friend Slavo, the local
vet.
I can see other bridges now: one in Romania which framed a setting sun and
the rises of a cluster of good grayling; half a dozen sturdy stone ones in
Ireland, irresistible invitations to stop and peer; a wooden footbridge at
Wargrave, below which the barbel lurked.
A bridge is a test. No true fisherman can pass one without lingering for
that cheering glimpse. I have in my mind the denouement of a detective
story. The detective hero, a piscatorial Morse, is with the chief suspect.
The villain's hitherto unbreakable alibi depends in some way - the details
are still sketchy - on him passing himself off as an angler. With our hero
beside him, the villain drives over a supremely seductive bridge, with a
glittering trout stream below. But he looks neither left nor right. Our man,
having spotted a two-pounder rising by the willow on the left, grabs the
murderer with the cry: 'Impostor'.
Well, I think it has possibilities.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Real home cooking - A house conversion with a
difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLEANING lady thought of it first. 'If all else fails, Mrs Graham,' she
said, early last year, 'you can always open a restaurant in your dining
room.' Amanda Graham needed no further urging. Nine months later,
Colquhoun's was born at Alton, Hampshire.
Necessity was the mother of this culinary creation. Like many others, the
Grahams were finding life tough in the recession. His architectural practice
was suffering and could no longer afford her secretarial skills. There were
three children, aged from 12 to 16, to feed and educate.
Their large, double-fronted Victorian house had a dining room that would,
they calculated, seat 20. And Amanda was not without experience: early in
the 1980s, during the previous recession, she had done a Tante Marie cooking
course. Small children and a recovery in her husband's business allowed her
to try her skills only on family and friends.
They must have been impressed because they were quick to voice encouragement
for the Grahams' new project. One snag arose when she sought planning
permission for change of use: she was opposed by local authorities worried
about parking, but managed eventually to allay their fears.
Making alterations to satisfy the fire regulations was the most expensive
element of the conversion. By the time it was finished, and including
working capital, Colquhoun's had cost Pounds 14,000 to set up. It was
financed by a loan from her brother (now repaid), personal savings and a
bank overdraft. Publicity was a family affair, too. Daughter Hannah and her
friends distributed 4,000 leaflets around Alton and the surrounding
villages.
The big bay window of Colquhoun's - Amanda's maiden name - provides plenty
of natural light and the room has been decorated in white and blue. The only
evidence of its former use is two sets of family photographs on either side
of the chimney breast above the fireplace.
From the start, Amanda realised that, because she was the only chef, the
opening hours must be tailored to her physical capabilities and culinary
strengths. So, despite having a rota of four waitresses and an unpaid,
supportive husband to help with the washing-up, the restaurant opens only
four nights a week: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Her working day
lasts from 9.30 am to 1.30 am and she changes her set menu every Friday for
the following week.
These menus are readings from culinary heroines: Elizabeth David, Jane
Grigson, Claudia Roden and Josceline Dimbleby. But they are cooked with such
care and thought that her mentors certainly would approve.
There is a choice at the first course: terrine of pigeons, salmon pate with
fennel or a cream of potato and onion soup, for example, followed by a set
main course. This usually is a casserole: chicken Provencale, beef braised
in red wine with black olives, or a Rhone ferryman's stew. Then salad,
English cheeses and a choice of three homely desserts (which has included a
bread and butter pudding described by one elderly diner as the best since
prep school).
For this, she charges Pounds 16.50 a person, which includes a complimentary
aperitif: Dunkerton's perry or Rock's elderflower wine. The restaurant is
unlicensed and makes no corkage charge but her greatest ally in Alton has
been Oddbins, the liquor merchant, which displays her new menu every Friday
and suggests wines to complement her main courses. There is another bonus
for customers: with a fixed-price menu and their own wines, they know almost
precisely what an evening at Colquhoun's is going to cost.
The quality of the cooking and the novelty of the restaurant brought full
houses until Christmas. Since then, there has been a slowdown, particularly
mid-week, but Amanda hopes for better business after Easter.
There have been unforeseen problems, of course. The restaurant's size means
it is too small to buy from wholesalers: thus, it must get its raw materials
from the supermarket, the local butcher, the cash and carry or the farm shop
nearby. And although she will cook happily for vegetarians, fish as a main
course is difficult because there is no local fishmonger.
Inconsistency of demand is the main drawback to Colquhoun's showing a profit
so far. But there does look to be the makings of a flourishing business and,
for Amanda Graham, a satisfying new career.

TWO LONDON restaurant renaissances. First, Beauchamp Place on the site of
the former Menage a Trois at 15 Beauchamp Place, SW3 (Tel: 071-589-4252).
Bright decor, Mediterranean influences on the menu and a mouth-watering wine
list at extremely keen prices.
Second, Walsh's, a seafood and oyster restaurant at 5 Charlotte Street, W1,
(071-637-0222) where Rue St Jacques used to be. Owned by the family which
founded the Wheeler's restaurants, its decor bears an eerie resemblance to
the original.
*****
Two useful addresses omitted from our round-up of restaurants in
theatreland. L'Escargot has now reopened at 48 Greek Street (071-437-2679).
It is just around the corner from the not to be missed Crazy for You at the
Prince Edward Theatre while, for opera goers, there is the long running Cafe
Pacifico, 5 Langley Street, London WC2H 9JA. (071-240 7075).
*****
My recent article on matching food and wines excited the senior management
at The Savoy. Now every Thursday the food and beverage manager, head chef
and sommelier meet to discuss and taste dishes and match them with suitable
wines from the Savoy cellars for the following week's dinner menu in the
River restaurant (071-836-4343).
The four-course menu with a glass of different wine at each course is Pounds
45 per person including VAT, service and, if you are on the right table, a
view across the river Thames.
*****
Finally, to Hortus, the gardening magazine, a sister, Convivium, a quarterly
journal devoted to good eating. It offers first-class writing, sympathetic
line drawings and is available at annual subscription of Pounds 25 from
Convivium, The Neuadd, Rhayader, Radnorshire LD6 5HH, Wales. Tel

FT  01 MAY 93 / Cookery: The scent of elder is in the air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW YOU see it, now you don't. The elderflower season comes and goes as fast
as a conjurer's rabbit. Scottish readers can relax for a bit, but those
living in sheltered corners of the south should be sharpening their
secateurs in readiness to cull this year's crop of the hedgerow muscat - a
mere whiff of which can send ex-patriates reeling with nostalgia for
Elgarian English landscapes on balmy summer days.
The first elderflower blossoms of the season deserve to be enjoyed as a
treat in their own right. Forget about calories: dip them into a fluffy
egg-white batter and deep-fry them for the best-ever fritters. Eat them
without cream; that would be over the top. Just dust them with sugar for
crunch and squeeze lemon juice over them.
The second great use of elderflower is in drinks. Home-made country wines
are not my scene but elderflower champagne was - until I discovered it is
usually, but not always, petillant and can go off with a bang. A few summers
ago, I took some bottles to the Royal Show. One of them exploded in the
middle of the night and caused something of a stir, with police dogs
sniffing out the area in readiness for a royal visit next day.
A safer bet is elderflower syrup, a heady concentrate of the fragrant
blossom. It makes an agreeable stand-in for elderflower champagne if diluted
to cordial strength at the point of serving with a slug of lemon and plenty
of fizzy mineral water. (Commercial elderflower cordials are less enticing;
usually, they are made with citric acid, not lemon, which gives them a
tinny, citrus quality).
The third - some would say the best - use of elderflower is in conjunction
with little green gooseberries (although this pairing often is difficult to
achieve since the gooseberry season, which supposedly coincides with that of
the elderflower, does not always make it on time).
Twirling a head or two of elderflower round and round a gooseberry jam pan,
and raking the florets into a pie dish or fool, produces magic results. But
when you have no fresh blossom, a slurp of elderflower syrup provides an
instant and sublime remedy. So, make elderflower syrup as soon as you can so
you will have it to hand when I come to write about cooking with
gooseberries in a month or so.
ELDERFLOWER SYRUP
You will need about 18 fine blossoms. Pick them away from both main roads
(where they will be heavy with pollution) and intensively-farmed,
chemically-sprayed fields (same reason). Choose blossoms that have just
unfurled to the full; that is when their scent is best. Do not wash them:
just shake them to get rid of any dust and wild life.
You will also need one organic or unsprayed lemon, preferably the aromatic
Amalfi variety. Grate the lemon zest into a saucepan. Add  1/2 lb granulated
sugar, pour on 1 pt water and bring to the boil. Add the blossoms, cutting
off the stalks close to the creamy heads as you drop the flowers into the
pan.
Push them well down into the liquid and bring back to the boil. Cover the
pan and set it aside until the contents are cold.
Then, squeeze the juice from the lemon, stir it into the syrup, strain
through a muslin-lined sieve and bottle. Store in a properly cold larder or
cellar - or, better still, in the refrigerator. It should keep for nearly a
year.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Life on the Rialto - Common Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WOULD be no prizes for guessing that the market in Venice is one of
the world's loveliest. It is just by the Rialto bridge on the opposite side
of the Grand Canal to St Mark's.
Its stalls shelter under a collection of medieval and renaissance arcades.
It can be maintained that the scene of the early morning market at the
Rialto has remained substantially unchanged since the early 17th century.
Near the bridge are fruit and vegetable traders with their heaps of
courgettes complete with delicate yellow flowers and those baby artichokes
(castraure) so beloved of the Venetians. Treviso red lettuces provide a
splash of contrasting colour to the bundles of green asparagus and the white
stalks of Swiss chard.
The meat market reveals a healthy interest in offal - and not just the
famous calves' liver but cows' udders and a dozen different sorts of tripe.
The butchers make up pretty skewers of meat called spiedini with chunks of
aubergine between the flesh and pile them next to bright yellow chickens and
guinea fowl.
Fish is the most dramatic display. Lobsters, scampi and razor-shells lie
alongside big-bodied spider crabs. There is tunny and sword fish, skate and
scorpion fish, tiny soles and mullet, cuttlefish and dried cod in the form
of stoccafisso and baccala, gurnard and sea bass still buckled in rigor
mortis, live eels and strange, pea-green fish a few inches long. These are
sold live with the gills still quivering in the morning sunlight.
From the cheese stalls Venetians buy the usual staples of Parmigiano
Reggiano and pecorino but also local cheeses such as the crumbly Asiago,
Baita from Friuli and a seasoned mountain cheese called Montagio.
The bakers' shops, with their olive breads and chunky cakes, are the last
relics of Venice's prosperous spice trade. An amber-coloured ring was filled
with dried figs and nuts. Dried fruit and nuts represent the tradition of
Austrian imports, which go back to the years when Venice was part of the
Habsburg Empire.
At carnival time Venetians eat as many Krapfen or doughnuts as the Viennese,
and there is also the Kranz and the Venetian strudel (heavier and richer
than the Austrian equivalent). In the smartest shops you may even find
sachtertorte.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Wine: A new-wave French vigneron / A look at why growers
must change to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY-ONE-year-old Jean-Philippe Fichet is typical of a new breed of
Burgundian. He was brought up in the village of Meursault, a name that
spells gold, glory and expense to white wine lovers. Like most of his
contemporaries, he comes from a family of vignerons.
His father has 5.5 hectares (14 acres) of vines in Meursault and the
neighbouring villages of Chassagne-Montrachet and Puligny-Montrachet. Like
most of the older generation, Fichet Pere has always sold his wine in bulk
to the negociants, the big wine merchants of Beaune.
Thus the name Fichet is not known to the wide wine-buying public, only to
the brokers or courtiers who have until recently trawled the region for wine
to pour into the negociant blends carrying the famous village and vineyard
names of Burgundy.
Until very recently Fichet was a name on sample bottles rather than wine
labels.
But Jean-Philippe realised, or perhaps sensed more intuitively, his roots
being so deep in the poor soils of Burgundy, that his father's way would not
be his way forward towards the next millennium of Burgundian history. He
wants, simply, to make great wine, and to see it enjoyed with his own name
on it.
He has seen what his cousin Jean-Francois Coche-Dury has achieved by
establishing his Domaine. By doing everything possible to maximise quality
at the expense of quantity, Coche-Dury can sell every bottle he makes three
times over. And yet he still sells the less successful wine he makes in bulk
to the negociants. Such dedication can hardly fail to inspire.
Young Fichet's motivation is far from financial. He is heavily in debt and
reckons it will be at least 10 years before Domaine Jean-Philippe Fichet
does anything more than cover its costs, but his ambition makes even more
sense now that the negociants' warehouses are full and their prices have
tumbled. (In 1989 they were paying FFr5,000 for a barrel of Bourgogne Blanc
and FFr15,000 for Meursault; today they may pay only FFr1,000 and FFr6,000
respectively.)
He has been making wine for 11 years now, since he was 20, but happily
admits that it has been only for the last four years, from the 1989 vintage,
that he has been making good wine (although even his 1987 and 1988 vintages
were praised in the influential American Robert Parker's book Burgundy).
Jean-Philippe, who exports 60 per cent of his small production, realises he
needs to expand his horizons outside the village of Meursault. Accordingly,
he made his first trip to England last month to show his wines at the annual
Burgundy tasting of his UK importers Morris &amp; Verdin.*
Jasper Morris delightedly told him about a blind tasting championship held
recently for Winecellars customers in London to assess the relative merits
of France, Italy and Australia at various price levels.
It was apparently entirely due to the overwhelming enthusiasm for
Jean-Philippe Fichet's Bourgogne Rouge 1990 (Pounds 7.50 a bottle) from
Morris &amp; Verdin that France 'won' overall, but the young Frenchman was
unimpressed.
'Wait till you see my 1992,' he said with a smile.
Fichet admits that he is a terrible taster, in the sense that, like any
passionate winemaker, no matter what the wine, he is always looking for its
faults.
He says he has learnt by hanging around those whose wines he admires, such
as cousin Coche, Francois Jobard and Dominique Lafon of Meursault's famous
Domaine Comte Lafon ('although someone like Dominique isn't going to tell me
all his secrets,' he says with due modesty).
Although his passionate dedication to quality is shared by an increasing
number of young vignerons all over Europe, people who, a generation ago,
might have left the countryside rather than inherited an agricultural way of
life, surely many of his contemporaries are just coasting along on the
endangered reputation of yesterday's Burgundy?
Isn't it difficult to maintain friendships when at such professional
variance? Strange that the French do not have a word for the shrug they
employ so usefully.
Dissatisfied with the temperature and humidity in his rented cave he set
about finding the sort of 'silent, secret place' he thinks great wine needs.
He is now renting a deeper, larger cellar from the Commune of Meursault
where he can boast of a fairly constant, natural 16'C and nice, damp
conditions to keep the oak barrels supple.
He is wary of new wood and uses it sparingly only for his very best wines.
But he understands the importance of establishing a rapport with his cooper,
Damy, in Meursault. 'You can't just ring up 10 days before harvest and
expect to get the best barrels,' he says.
In little plots around Meursault, Chassagne, Monthelie and Volnay, Fichet
now owns just 2 ha of red and white vines and is renting a further 5 as a
sharecropper, which means he cannot reduce yields as much as he would like.
When his father retires, his three siblings will leave him free to take over
the family vines and practice the ultra-strict pruning he believes necessary
to squeeze extra concentration into the resulting wines.
But what does his father think of his son's quite different working
philosophy? 'Ah,' smiles Jean-Philippe ruefully. 'It is the job of a father
not to say anything. But what I think he thinks is that what I am doing is
sensible for today's conditions.'
Fichet wines, of which the mealy Meursault 1990 is a Pounds 16 star, are
available from Morris &amp; Verdin, London SW1. (Tel: 071-630-8888). Coche-Dury
wines are (sometimes) available from Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester
(0206-764446) and Winecellars are based in Wandsworth, London SW18
(081-871-2668).

FT  01 MAY 93 / How To Spend It: The designer office in your living room -
Santa Raymond visits four professionals who have created a happier home by
making themselves a modern workspace in it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANTA RAYMOND

<TEXT>
TRADITIONALLY, working at home has been the preserve of writers and mothers
and small independent operators. This has changed. Today even executives
such as Richard Branson work in their living rooms and Steven Jobs invented
the Apple computer in a garage.
John Worthington, a founder of DEGW, an office design group, believes women
working at home have got it right. 'They have set up a model which will be
followed by many in the future.' The model may provide an environment which
lacks intellectual stimulus and social interaction but it often includes an
attractive environment.
Working from home can offer pleasant views and peaceful surroundings,
natural light and ventilation. It can save time and money and reduce
pollution caused by commuting. It can offer low overheads and tax
advantages. Home workers can spend time with their families when their
families want to spend time with them. They can work as many hours as they
like without being cut off from home life.
Not everyone can work from home - half the working population do jobs which
require their physical presence in a particular place, and for them the
traditional pattern of commuting to work will remain largely unchanged. But
the other half - some 11m people in Britain - could probably work as well,
or better, in their homes.
Pauline Hodson, a psychotherapist, consults in a converted garage at the
bottom of her garden in Headington, Oxford. It must be one of the nicest
offices around. It is clad in timber inside and out, furnished with antiques
and a great colourful rug is simply flung over the sofa. The view through
the full height window to the stream beneath is breathtaking - a good place
to work and to be.
Pauline's consulting room has its own separate entrance, just like the
office of her husband Noel. He works on the far side of the house in an
extension squeezed along the boundary wall. His view is also magical. A
great cherry tree screens the glass roof from the sun. Trees and plants
enclose the garden facade: one might be on the edge of a forest glade.
Noel Hodson is a prophet of home working. He chose it in order to spend time
with his young daughters. Fifteen years on he is a leading teleworking
consultant with an impressive client list, mainly built up during the past
three years. It contains nearly 100 large organisations, including BT, of
course, IBM, Marks &amp; Spencer, banks, building societies, insurance brokers
and local authorities.
Noel is writing a book on teleworking, networking with 16 co-authors all
over the UK and one in the US. He has an all singing and dancing computer
hired from BT and connected to an Integrated Services Digital Network line
for maximum clarity.
His office is a most civilised place. It is heated by a cast iron
wood-burning stove containing a flickering gas fire. This keeps house and
office heating separate, and can be left on at night at a low temperature to
stop the photocopier paper succumbing to the damp. The natural timber
windows, beams, columns, and furniture, the green carpeted floor, the
pictures hanging on soft white walls, all add up to an inviting environment.
There is enough room for a meeting of 10 people, or for Noel to have a good
stretch. The furniture is basic: work tops are supported by filing cabinets
and there is not even a special desk chair. Noel says he can work a 15-hour
day at the computer without suffering neck or back ache, but his eyesight is
deteriorating. The office took eight weeks to build and cost Pounds 30,000
(paid for by a business loan). Pauline's garage conversion cost just Pounds
12,000, but it lacks a lavatory.
As with many home offices the weakest design element is the lighting: too
much in the wrong place. Noel himself is not happy with it. The 19
spotlights ranging on tracks along the beams provide illumination that is
attractive, but insufficient at his main workstation. It uses a lot of
energy, generates a lot of heat and clashes with the elegance and precision
of the rest of the place.
The office also suffers from that perennial complaint - insufficient filing
space. As Noel says, with faxes and photocopiers we generate more paper now
not less. Even with six filing cabinets, a stationery cupboard and a lot of
shelving, he still does not have enough storage space.
In working at home, Alan Tye, a Royal Designer for Industry probably best
known for his Modric range of ironmongery for Allgood, is following the
atelier tradition of his Swedish wife, Anita. He considers himself a special
adviser rather like a QC. As a product designer with all the resources of
his manufacturing clients, he can operate large scale jobs with a small team
in a way which, he says, would not be possible for straight architectural
practices.
He created ample storage space by using Remploy's mobile Lundia system to
fill two whole bays in his office with four double-sided shelf units which
can be rolled across the floor on tracks like in a library. His office was
conceived as a model of what the modern workspace should be. It nestles in a
garden with tall trees and a raked gravel driveway. It appears to grow from
the contours of the 1970s house. The white walls spring from the modernist
movement but are totally sympathetic to the site on the edge of a small
Hertfordshire town.
The office is a light, bright space, with a translucent ceiling and large
windows looking on to courtyards furnished with alpine plants and a little
waterfall. The dark stained telegraph poles, (the cheapest and most
effective of beams) on their almost invisible polished concrete columns,
form a strong horizontal plane.
The building was designed from the inside out, with the spacing of the
telegraph poles springing from the modular desk system, Herman Miller's
Ethospace. It is not cheap, but it is one of the few which has adjustable
worktop heights, essential he says in any healthy office. The supporting
panels and cupboard fronts, covered in blue-grey flannel, provide
sound-absorbent surfaces.
The five work stations (three with VDUs), each with pale timber work tops,
include one for a secretary complete with a rusty steel reception shelf.
This material is used in various places including radiator fronts, and for
three curved steps leading up to a practice room, which doubles for Tai Chi,
the mainspring of Alan's work and beliefs.
Lighting is provided by low voltage spots and high frequency fluorescent
lamps fitted under high-level cupboards.
Flyproof mesh covered openings provided the ventilation and there are
extractor fans for the summer. Underfloor heating provides ideal
temperatures throughout the space. At a cost of Pounds 100,000, the 100
square metre single storey building is good value for money, though it did
take a long time to build.
Marina Haidopoulou Adams, a landscape architect, carries out large
international projects from her Kensington studio. She works with up to four
assistants on hospitals or schools in her native Greece, private gardens in
France and Germany, or conservation schemes in the UK. She has a word
processor but does not use computer-aided design.
Marina's is a great place to work and live and sleep. There are flowering
plants at the door, quince blossom inside the studio, great north-facing
lights looking up into the sky, edged by fine Victorian brickwork
Her bed in the gallery looks down on to the sitting area lying between the
workspace and the eating and cooking areas under the gallery. Grey sofas
focus on a stripped steel fire surround (containing an operational grate).
An antique dining table, laid with fine cutlery, glass, china and linen,
antique chairs, and wicker fronted kitchen cabinets, provide a very
different aesthetic to that of the office just across the room, even with
the warm, 19th century floorboards flowing right through.
For Marina, there is no physical divide between working and living. She
works when there is work to be done, which may be all day non-stop, evenings
and weekends; but she has no guilt about not working when there is no need.
She takes things as they come and slots the plumber's visit into her general
routine. She chose this very close mix between professional and private life
when newly divorced and needing to house herself and her teenage children.
Santa Raymond is an architect who specialises in the design of office
interiors.

FT  01 MAY 93 / How To Spend It: With pots of confidence - A set of pans
that made him feel like a real cook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A restaurateur, I used to watch every service in the kitchen with mixed
emotions. I felt anxiety because I was the proprietor. Would the food reach
the right tables, in the right sequence, to the right standard?
Nowadays, I feel relief and gratitude at nothaving to earn my livelihood on
my feet in front of hot stoves for eight hours a day. But just how do
professional chefs cook well and always manage to have the right equipment
on hand at the right time?
It is possible to equip yourself with most of the accoutrements of a
professional chef by visiting one of the shops in London's Soho which cater
for the professional chef - for example Leon Jaeggi - or by taking
advantage, as many restaurants do, of the mail order catalogue of A B E
Nisbet in Bristol.
Recently, though, my culinary skills were enhanced by a new range of cooking
pans which fulfilled two essential roles. The first was to instil
confidence: to give me, at least, the impression that I was cooking like a
professional; and, second, to stack conveniently so that they did not take
up valuable shelf space.
The pans are part of a gourmet cookset called The Compatibles from Amway -
there is also a matching set of cooking knives and cleavers - in two lots of
11 pieces. The basic set comprises four saucepans with capacities from 1
litre to 4 litres; an all-purpose skillet; and a double boiler. The
accessory set adds, usefully, a 6-litre pan called a Dutch Oven; a 6-litre
steamer; and an accessory rack for those still devoted to poached eggs. The
pans are not sold individually; the basic set costs Pounds 439.95 and the
accessory set Pounds 222.95. The complete set, of 22 pieces, is Pounds
595.95.
The full set would make an excellent investment for any keen cook. Made from
special, heavy-gauge steel (minimum 18 per cent chromium for hardness and 8
per cent nickel to resist corrosion), they look impressive and are easy to
clean, inside and out.
Most important, they transmit heat evenly and felt comfortable as soon as
they were put on the stove - either gas or electricity. The set scored well
on fine details, too. The lids fitted tightly and the handles never became
too hot.
The booklet that accompanies the set offers useful advice on how to put the
set to its fullest use. I would add only that you should follow carefully
the concise guidelines for cleaning the pans before using them - otherwise,
their coating can be distinctly malodorous.
These pans, and a whole range of other domestic appliances and personal care
products, are distributed by Amway, a direct sales organisation with a
worldwide turnover of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.90bn).

FT  01 MAY 93 / Fashion: A breeze from Africa clears the grunge - British
designers are rediscovering the colonial look
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNEXPECTED thing happened to the British design fraternity this spring.
While all around were losing their heads to the dubious delights of the
grungy 1970s revival, causing many observers to wonder how anyone selling
designer fashion was going to make a living this year, the British headed
unanimously for a different form of nostalgia - Africa.
Finally, British designers seem to have learnt that fashion must be not only
exciting but saleable. For here are elegant, interesting summer clothes that
will see you through from office to holiday. For designers such as Mulberry
and Margaret Howell, the British mood of colonial nostalgia is a hardy
perennial. Their time has come again with the return to pale silk and linen,
neutral suedes and long, swishy skirts.
Others, more susceptible to fashion's whims, have made a strong statement of
the same style. So too have the chain stores and, interestingly, commercial
European houses such as Georges Rech, Sportmax and Louis Feraud. The
original master of this look, Ralph Lauren, who even named a perfume Safari,
carries it off to perfection.
The colonial revival comes from a recognition that nostalgia is in the air,
but that women mature enough to afford designer clothes favour the elegant
1930s and 1940s. In the politically correct 1990s, the quiet colours,
natural fabrics and textures of safari dressing have an asceticism that
seems contemporary. It is also natural fashion territory for British women.
As Paul Costelloe points out: 'That soft, beautiful image of the
Englishwoman abroad, in a pale dress sheltered by her parasol or gently
sunkissed on a grand safari, has a natural resonance with my sort of
customer. Perhaps it is my age, but I don't look on the 1970s with
affection. I was working in America and I remember too many size 24 Southern
belles in hotpants and waistcoats. I don't think women want that again.'
Roland Klein, whose long safari dresses in heavy, textured linen have swingy
and full or svelte slim skirts, believes his customer is 'not on the hippy
trail. She is forward-looking and likes the modern practicality of the
safari look.'
But this modernity has retro overtones that make it distinctly different
from the last time around. As softness is the key to this summer's fashion,
so colonial safari style has adapted too. It is a long way from the crisp,
cotton khaki shorts and T-shirts associated with the real thing. Margaret
Howell, the designer, says it is her standard summer look, 'but I always
adapt to current fashion and this time it is softer, longer, more
antique-looking.'
Designer Arabella Pollen describes the mood as eloquently as do the chiffon
ties on her floppy safari suits: 'It's Africa as seen by 1930s Hollywood - a
glamorous woman arriving in the bush, beautifully but over-formally
dressed.' In fact, recent film titles are perfect scene setters: Out of
Africa, White Mischief, The Lover and Indochine have the same basic fashion
message, albeit from different periods and areas.
It is the unchanging tropical version of past elegance - simple, hot-weather
shapes plus an unstructured jacket for the cool of the evening or the hill
country. The difference is in the softness and in new ways of layering the
shapes. A safari jacket may have gently rounded details, a long skirt has
fluttery pleats or an A-line cut to give movement, trousers are wide,
pyjama-style in the softest silk, and the crisp shirt is replaced by a slip
of ruffled chiffon.
The mixes to try are a soft suede waistcoat over a long linen dress, a
sleeveless frock worn like a pinafore over a tiny sweater, the low-necked
feminine blouse under a tailored safari suit, and the softest silk scarves
and throws with everything. Going on fashion safari always makes sound
commercial sense but its latest reinvention follows a very fresh track.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Fashion: Screaming to be seen as individuals - Ralph Atkins
studies Westminster's moths and butterflies / Dressing for the Professions,
The Politician
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARLIAMENT, wrote psychologist and former Welsh Labour MP Leo Abse, is a
Mecca 'for all those who wish, even as they did in their nurseries but now
without fear of disapproval, to scream with anger, spit at their enemies,
attack opponents, boldly hit out at wrongs, real and imagined.
'Like moths around a flame, the aggressive flutter around Westminster.'
He should know. The violently-coloured shirts and bowler hats he wore on
Budget days in the 1960s stood out like a Red Admiral in a field of corn. He
wanted to convey a message about something more pugnacious than fiscal
stabilisers.
Politics is about individualism, a bid for attention. Dress is integral and
sends out signals. It has to resonate with a politician's convictions - and,
to be successful, that usually means distinctive. 'If you put Lady Thatcher
into Laura Ashley it would interrupt what she was saying,' says Barbara
Follett, past couturier to Labour's frontbench. 'Individuality is the most
important factor when choosing what to wear. It is a mistake to look like an
IBM executive clone.'
More than any other professional, the politician is constantly visible - to
local voters or colleagues they want to impress, to lobby journalists
practising their own peculiar school of political lepidopterology, and,
above all, to the television cameras. Bright media lights capture, as their
first image, a politician's attire.
Chosen in pre-dawn darkness, before dashing to breakfast television studios
or taking leisurely breakfasts before the 2.30pm Commons sitting, clothes
emit hints of mood, sincerity, competence, dedication, determination and
affability. The boundless range of political characters turns Westminster
into a laboratory of fashion experimentalism.
Margaret Thatcher is a pacesetter in her stateswoman-like but,
oh-just-slightly, slinky suits. Together with her practical Marks and
Spencer shoes, her outfit is a cocktail of chemicals - powerful, moral,
respectful, ruthless and, to some fanatical admirers, sexual. Hers is the
uniform most mimicked by women MPs. She was always impeccably turned out as
prime minister.
Perhaps the image was too contrived. Virginia Bottomley, health secretary,
wears pastel shades - the 'Mumsie look,' miaows another female on the Tory
benches - and has a softer image. Her outfit says: 'The National Health
Service is safe in my hands.' But there are constraints. Tenderness has to
be combined with toughness if we are to be sure that she can stand up to the
brutal, mean-suited boys at the Treasury where tailoring is usually black or
very dark from the chancellor, Norman Lamont, downwards.
Bottomley dresses to care. Thatcher looks as if hiding a bent to kill, her
armoured glamour suppressing the human being inside. If there is one.
Employment secretary Gillian Shephard wears similarly aggressive outfits to
those of the former prime minister - sometimes in flamboyant yellow, like a
fiery Brimstone butterfly. She is a fighter, battling, sometimes
semi-publicly, over coal policy with Michael Heseltine, the epitome of
gentrified political ambition - down to the last groomed hair riding over
his double forehead to the collar of his tailored suit. Heseltine's clothes
are precise and calculated, shirts stiffened and reeking of purposefulness -
telling us, maybe, that his hopes of winning the prime ministership are not
yet thwarted.
The variety of butterflies and moths fluttering at Westminster, searching
for a collar or trinket - or frequently more - that will make them stand
out, is plentiful.
Spats and hats have gone but there are still waistcoats around, distant
echoes of parliamentary fashion when Winston Churchill was polishing his
sound bites, gold chain dangling from his waistcoat. 'I regard Parliament as
a formal occasion,' says Greg Knight, government whip, who wears his
slate-grey three-piece suit even in the height of summer. 'It is not a
branch meeting of the boilermakers' union. MPs should dress accordingly.'
A single item of clothing is enough to make a statement. Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, and Tristan Garel-Jones, Europe minister, wear green
Austrian Loden coats favoured by the continental bourgeoisie. At once, the
Foreign Office's image of dusty Victorian sensibility is draped in European
culture and idealism. Together they are formidable. 'I see you are wearing
your single European coat,' said John Major as they approached him once.
Labour may have been mistaken at the last election in using standardised
clothing guidelines to reinforce a particular image. The party wanted
respect and credibility; it needed to build trust with the electorate. But
the forced image backfired, a warning, perhaps, that to dress against the
grain of your character can be as bad as not worrying about dress at all.
Lack of sincerity and passion loses votes. More flair was in order.
The grey jacket of Dennis Skinner, the Labour MP for Bolsover, has chips
woven into the shoulders - but, no matter how unappealing his stubbornly
left-wing rhetoric, he scores high in sincerity rankings. So does Jeremy
Corbyn, Labour MP for north Islington, who wears sport jackets - often
without a tie - and baggy trousers. He shows off his working class
conscience by carrying papers in a plastic bag.
At the opposite extreme, Richard Ryder, the government's chief whip, is the
most pianissimo of statesmen. His suits are anonymous. His mannerisms gentle
as he prowls Westminster's corridors. Former prime minister Harold Macmillan
would put on his Grenadier guards tie when the government was in trouble.
Likewise, Ryder vents his feelings via bright blue, green and red ties. He
wears them like warning signs. Red tie at night, Euro-sceptics delight.
The boundary between individualism and eccentricity is narrow. 'We are not
pop stars. We are serious managers of the country,' says Ann Widdecombe,
social security minister, who wears smart-but-practical skirts to visit
benefit offices under construction. She would not be so presumptuous as to
cite examples. But Nicholas Fairbairn, Tory MP for Perth and Kinross, is
famous for his tartan trews - and little else. Eric Forth, education
minister, mixes glowing colour ties and handkerchiefs with classic
waistcoats but is in danger of undermining his credibility as a minister.
People talk about Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby. They talk
about his garish ties.
At Conservative Central Office, the advice of the communications experts is
that politicians should not dress in a way that distracts from what they are
saying. But there is a paradox. Too much effort in creating an image can be
misspent. 'Sharp changes are not advisable. The important thing is the
comfort of the person,' says one senior official. 'The way you dress is an
expression of how you see yourself.'
He is right. Kenneth Clarke could not be a teddy bear-like rogue of a home
secretary if he tightened his belt or swopped his Hush Puppies for shiny
black Lobbs. William Waldegrave, public services minister, could not keep up
his impression of 'Academic Tortured by the Febrility of Westminster' if his
trousers were pressed and the waistband not turned inside out. They are
making statements; what they are is more important than the way they dress.
So too is Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader and former marine, who
 -in spite of his action-man image - dresses from head to toe in Marks and
Spencer menswear. His dress sense says he wants off-the-peg respectability
without too much effort.
For John Smith, Labour's leader, there is no expression of anger or
reformist zeal in the sonorous, dark suits he buys from Slaters, the Glasgow
tailor favoured by lawyers. But there is a tad of ardour from the floral
ties chosen by his fashion student daughter. On the Tory backbenches, among
the sea of suits, there are chrysalids of youthful ambition waiting to break
out and steal the show.
Alan Duncan, suave MP for Rutland and Melton, says MPs 'need to show
authority and a little bit of wit'. He recommends a tailored suit (four
buttons per sleeve); silk ties (small motif), cotton shirts (double cuff,
not white) and good shoes (tassels permitted).
It sounds wizard advice. But he has yet to get a government job. A better
guide would, perhaps, be more general. Politicians need to dress according
to their personality but without being fastidious. Dress is both important
and not important: there are limits - the need to look respectable, to
inspire confidence - but the politician's character needs to shine through,
to shout for attention.
Yet, as if to prove there will always be exceptions, there is John Major. He
lacks even a smidgen of wit in his dress, and he avoids individualism. In
his accountants' suits and pale shirts, the prime minister would be lost on
a commuter train.
What is his message? Respect but ordinariness, a man of the people, perhaps.
He has made it to the top yet is still - not quite - seen as a natural
leader. In his dress, there is no aggression or dash.
He is the Cabbage Grey that sucks the best nectar.

FT  01 MAY 93 / As They Say in Europe: Morality? Leave God out of it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE, judging by the newspapers, is plunged in a moral crisis. Sometimes
it is Bosnia, but mostly it is the swamp of crime and corruption that
promotes editorial hand-wringing. The British share the malaise but are
unique in their suggestions for solution.
John Patten, UK education secretary, and some Conservative MPs, such as Lady
Olga Maitland, believe religion has a role to play in securing a moral
revival. But nowhere in western Europe is this approach echoed. This is
largely because other nations realise that religion is about truth, not
morality. Nowhere else is there the same conviction that devotion inspires
good behaviour.
More of that in a moment. Religious education in the European Community
takes diverse forms - or no form at all, as in the state sector in France.
In Spain, the hour a week resembles the old lessons in Marxism-Leninism in
central Europe. In the north German Lander, it consists of philosophical
speculation. In Roman Catholic Bavaria, instruction takes a highly liberal
approach, with liberation theology and meditation to reach the inner self.
In Britain, it can be described generally as multi-cultural.
In Italy, there is a call for an 'ethical revolution,' to take the form of a
'secular' renewal founded on the 'basic rules for civilised co-existence.'
When I suggested to some Italians that the Church could play a role in
schools to help achieve a moral transformation, the idea was regarded as
ludicrous.
Britain, however, offers a cocktail of religions which can be taken
according to personal preference. And so there is a division between those
who believe in the inculcation of the faith indicated by parental persuasion
 -a sectarian approach, in fact - and those who, like Lady Olga, believe in
what seems to be generalised Christian instruction for cultural purposes.
But surely any dedicated approach to achieving renewal through religious
education should be about communicating the truth: that Christ is the Son of
God, or, as the Moslems and Jews would have it, that He most certainly is
not.
Whatever the option, there is still the problem of the relationship with
morality. What might be called official Christian statements reveal a strong
emphasis on the evils of such matters as fornication and adultery and other
sinful but lawful pursuits.
There are those who believe that a moral regeneration of Britain could be
founded on firm action on the fornication and adultery front, but they are
few in number. For the rest, Christianity has taken an off-the-shelf moral
guide from Judaism in the form of the Ten Commandments, and nine of these
could be part of an atheist canon.
Elsewhere, there is no political pressure for strengthening religious
education in schools for two reasons: the general decline in observance and
recognition of the trouble which could ensue. The British should be more
aware of this than most because of Northern Ireland and the bitterest row to
have split any group in this country in the past year: women priests in the
Church of England. The opponents of this innovation do not accept that the
question can be resolved by a vote. One can no more vote on such a matter,
they believe, than one can vote on two plus two equalling three.
If religious education should be strengthened in Anglican schools the
question of women priests would be pursued in the classroom. The Thirty Nine
Articles would have to enter the curriculum. Roman Catholic instruction
could legitimately include the observation that those who resort to condoms
risk eternal damnation. The state would, on grounds of equity, pay for young
Moslems to be brought up in the belief of the primacy of Sharia law.
But there is no reason to think that things are much easier in a more
homogenously religious country. Poland has followed the Patten-Maitland line
as part of the general post-communist 'rechristianisation' of the country
that has involved the banning of abortion.
Today, Poland's religious ombudsman is locked in continuous rows with the
Church and large sections of parliament; the constitutional court has to
define carefully the conditions on which children can be pulled out of
religious classes, and the academic status of religious examinations gives
rise to controversy. Priests infest the broadcast media, the prestige of the
Church has declined sharply, the press is split. And a tidal wave of crime
smashes against the shores of society.
In seeking a social order that operates harmoniously, where crime is not a
daily concern, one needs to look to the Far East and to the secular,
Confucian tradition. The Republic of Singapore, in particular, has
demonstrated that astonishing gains can be achieved by rearing a nation of
Pharisees.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Minding Your Own Business: The modern armourer - Clive
Fewins visits a derelict foundry in the Midlands where an old craft is being
revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARMOURER Richard Dunk traces his unusual occupation back to the six weeks he
spent in the Tower of London. It was not a continuous incarceration - he was
let out each night to go home.
But the 17th century Flemish armour he was working on was so valuable that
it had to be kept permanently under lock and key. 'Working in the Tower
armouries gave me a focus. It made me realise that armour was what I was
really interested in, rather than a career in the museum service, where I
had thought I would end up,' said 39-year-old Dunk.
That was nine years ago when he was reading for a history degree as a mature
student at Birmingham University. He gained an award for his project at the
Tower, and also a grant that enabled him to start his business. The rest, as
they say, is history, which has always been a passion with Dunk.
After gaining his degree with the support of his teacher-wife and friends in
various historical re-enactment societies, he did not need a lot of
persuasion to apply his 6ft 3in frame to metal bashing of a particular
nature.
He thinks nothing of working seven or more hours without a break in his
small workshop, a former wood store in the yard of a near-derelict foundry
complex at Darlaston, near Wolverhampton. It is a bleak background in which
to spend one's working hours.
Dunk enjoys the solitary work. 'It is an extremely noisy process, so for the
bulk of the work I need a workshop that is relatively isolated,' he said. He
uses the workshop in the garden at his home near Walsall when there is less
noisy work to do, or when he needs to be near a telephone. There he works on
straps and linings and padded wooden stands for the the armour.
'There is really no such thing as an off-the-peg suit of armour,' Dunk said.
'All armour needs to be made to measure. But because most of my American and
Canadian clients only wear it rarely, every suit needs a stand. These take
quite a long time to construct.'
Making a piece such as the 'Henry VIII' armour, based on a 1515 design and
used for a recent series of re-enactments, is a long and complicated
process. There are 34 different sections in the complete outfit, correctly
known as a garniture. Some of the pieces have splendid sounding names such
as cauldrons, chamfrons, combs, tassets and tumlets.
'People often do not realise that the medieval armour (people wrongly refer
to suits of armour) was built for a variety of different purposes, for
example war games, for use on horseback, for real battle, or for ceremonial
use,' Dunk said.
'So most of them came with what you might call bolt-on accessories, to suit
the use the armour was being put to on any particular day. I suppose there
is an analogy with the modern all-purpose warplane, that can be adapted for
a variety of uses.'
All the pieces in the Henry VIII armour were hand-wrought from sheet metal
and highly polished. Dunk has already made a reasonable profit from renting
it out for special events, but unless he manages to rent it to a permanent
exhibition he will sell it for around Pounds 12,000.
'There is probably a good home for it on the other side of the Atlantic.
But, frankly, I am too busy to try and find one at present and I am not so
hard up that I need to sell it,' he said.
Although Dunk has a healthy order book - 1992 was quite a good year and 1993
shows signs of being better - he has no plans for large-scale expansion.
'Employing another person is difficult,' he said. 'There is no time in which
to train anyone - it would cut down production time too much.
'But the work is extremely tiring, and not particularly rewarding
financially. I aim at a turnover of Pounds 25,000, and because of very low
overheads and the small amount of materials I use, I try to pay myself
Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 20,000 before tax.
'I am aware that with demand high, I should be expanding, but this would
probably take the form of sub-contracting, rather than employing someone
else to work for me. What I would really like to do is make less of the
standard everyday pikeman's armour - a set costs about Pounds 400 and takes
me three days to make - and concentrate on the high-quality orders from
abroad.
'These are more satisfying, as well as being more profitable. Everything has
got to work, and while the basic material - sheet steel  - is different from
the iron that the originals were made from, virtually every other detail is
the same. All my reproductions are authentic copies from original patterns,
many of which I take myself from original armour in museums and private
collections, and from pieces that come in for restoration. I have about 200
different patterns - quite a good collection.'
As well as armour, Dunk makes pikes and halberds that he sells to members of
the Sealed Knot and the English Civil War Society, who re-enact battles, and
also a range of period ironwork including candlesticks, candle prickets,
rush-light holders, lanterns and light holders. He has even made a cannon
that fires and two non-firing early 16th century replica cannon for Southsea
castle, based on guns found on Henry VIII's warship the Mary Rose.
Dunk organises re-enactments of battles and of Tudor life and makes armour
to order for permanent exhibitions. Most of this work comes from English
Heritage. He is currently working on a commission from them for exhibits at
a permanent display in Etal Castle, close to Flodden Field in
Northumberland, where the English defeated the Scots in 1513.
Dunk rents his workshop for Pounds 100 a month and his other overheads are
low. He rarely borrows. 'Really, I shall have to think about expanding to
cope with the overseas market as the business is there,' he said. 'Two years
ago, I approached the DTI for advice, but they did not seem interested.
Perhaps it is time I tried again. I do not really know . . .'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Escaping the mortgage trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MONTH ago, Sara and Howard Fagelman moved into a familiar house. It was
the same three-bedroom, semi-detached in Leeds which they had had to leave
two years ago when they fell into Pounds 10,000 arrears on their joint
mortgage after the liquidation of his business.
'The debt got to the point where we did not have any money to spend at all,'
said Fagelman this week. But they were lucky in their mortgage lender. The
Bradford &amp; Bingley is unusual in having a large mortgage-to-rent scheme,
allowing those in arrears to become tenants instead.
This week saw further evidence that the worst of the crisis in mortgage
repossessions, caused by the rise in interest rates and fall in house prices
at the turn of the decade, is easing. The government announced a 24 per cent
fall in the number of repossession actions starting in the first quarter.
The fall in base rates over the past six months has been the prime cause of
the easing. Yet, there also is evidence that government initiatives, which
have had teething difficulties since they were announced 18 months ago, have
started to become effective.
The mortgage-to-rent scheme which has helped the Fagelmans is a case in
point. It was at the heart of the initiative announced by the government at
the end of 1991, and suggested how lenders and housing associations might
work together so that borrowers could become tenants.
The idea was that associations would borrow from lenders to buy properties
on which there were arrears.
Those in arrears would then convert the debt into a loan on which there
would be an interest 'holiday'; at the same time, they would pay a lower
rent to the association to remain in their home.
This has happened to the Fagelmans. Their home has been bought by a mutual
housing association set up by Bradford &amp; Bingley and English Churches
Housing, one of the largest associations. ECH is paid management fees to
repair and manage properties.
The Fagelmans now pay Pounds 220 a month in rent compared with the Pounds
900 they were paying on their Pounds 57,000 mortgage. They also pay Pounds
10 a month on their arrears loan. 'It has been a humiliating experience, but
we have bounced back and it has made our relationship stronger,' says Mrs
Fagelman.
The terms of the scheme have been more attractive than some others
established by lenders because the fully mutual vehicle can claim mortgage
interest tax relief. Bradford &amp; Bingley has transferred the debt of 160
borrowers so far, and is planning to raise the number to about 500 a year
from now.
The society believes that others which had difficulty setting up acceptable
terms with housing associations for mortgage-to-rent schemes  - the reason
for early doubts about its viability - may not have adopted the right
structure. It says it has had two inquiries from other top 10 societies.
The scheme has also managed to establish workable new terms for tenants,
with most rents falling between Pounds 41 and Pounds 50 a week. Colin
Sherrift, ECH's housing director, says that thousands of households could
benefit if more of the 90 societies and 2,000 associations adopted similar
schemes.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Independent in spirit and practice -
Peter Martin finds enthusiasm and paradox at Bankers' Investment /
Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICHAEL Moule is an enthusiast. When he talks about investment trust
management, words race each other to be first out of his mouth. When a full
coffee cup gets in the way of his eager gestures, it is swept aside
unceremoniously; the resulting flood of lukewarm liquid does not interrupt
the verbal flow.
There is a paradox here: what Moule is describing with such intensity is an
investment strategy of caution, restraint, moderation. The Bankers'
Investment Trust, which he has managed with striking success since 1977, is
an old-fashioned international general investment trust, with an investment
attitude to match.
Although managed since the mid-1970s by Touche Remnant (since last year,
part of the Henderson fund management group), Bankers' has stayed
independent in spirit and in practice, refusing to add the TR initials to
the front of its name and avoiding cross-holdings in other TR funds. Indeed,
independence has been taken to surprising lengths: Bankers' chairman is
Andrew Barker, vice-chairman of a rival fund management house, Foreign &amp;
Colonial.
There are a number of other paradoxes. Moule is a value investor, aiming to
buy shares when they are cheap and sell them when the market recognises
their virtues once again. That approach traditionally produces good
long-term performance, although at the price of never doing remarkably well
in any individual year. Yet, Bankers' not only stands top of its performance
sector in the Finstat rankings for the past five and seven years, it has
also produced good short-term performance in the past few years.
Although Moule has a healthy regard for the virtues of dividends, he has
taken the trust away from the high end of the income range. His aim is to
buy shares with a yield around the middle of the market, with a portfolio
yield of around 3 1/2 to 4 per cent.
Value investors often concentrate on large, long-term investments in a
relatively small number of shares they know well. That way, they get the
maximum benefit from their painstaking judgments. By contrast, Bankers'
holds shares in a relatively large number of issues - 340 at the last
year-end, in October 1992 - and Moule rarely takes large stakes in them.
His typical 'unit' of investment is Pounds 1.5m, but often he will start by
buying much less. And although he holds some shares happily through long,
dull years, waiting for the upturn he is sure will come, he turns over 35
per cent of the portfolio each year. At the last year-end, 49 per cent of
Bankers' assets were in the UK, with 23 per cent in the US and 17 per cent
in continental Europe. Equities made up 85 per cent of the gross assets,
with 8 per cent in convertibles and bonds and the rest in cash. (Moule
usually avoids unquoted companies). Bankers' has Pounds 11.3m of debenture
debt: a 4 per cent perpetual debenture of Pounds 1.3m; and a Pounds 10m
debenture at 10.5 per cent.
In general, Moule prefers the highly developed Anglo-Saxon markets. He says:
'The value investor can only operate in very efficient capitalist markets
like the US and UK because, in these markets, if the incumbent management
won't do what's necessary to realise a company's value, someone else will.
You get bailed out of your mistakes if your judgment on asset quality is
correct.'
Some purchases of undervalued shares pay off spectacularly: when a share
yielding 9 per cent goes to 3 per cent, for example. But this happens
rarely; a more common success is a share that moves from yielding 60-70 per
cent above the market average to yielding 30-40 per cent above it. The
trick, says Moule, is to be satisfied with this, and to know the right
moment to sell. 'Everything has its price. For every share we own, I know
the price at which I'd get out of it.'
This approach led him into the mid-cap shares in the FT-SE Mid 250 index
late in 1991 and early in 1992. Now, when that index has outperformed
spectacularly, he is moving into worse-performing FT-SE 100 stocks,
including big drugs companies.
The narrowing of Bankers' discount to net asset values in recent years has
rewarded long-standing shareholders, and might lead to a new issue of shares
if the price goes to a steady 4-5 per cent premium for a while. It has,
however, led many traditional insurance company shareholders to sell out
(although institutions still dominate the share register).
Shareholders buying on such a narrow discount are vulnerable if it widens
later on: when investment trusts were most out of fashion, the discount
touched 32 per cent. Of course, to a value investor, that would have been a
buying signal . . .
KEY FACTS
At the end of October, 1992, the trust had gross assets of Pounds 229m and
net assets of Pounds 219.6m. On April 27, it had net assets per share of
151.2p and the shares were trading at 148 1/2 p, a discount of 1.8 per cent.
The yield was 2.9 per cent and the market capitalisation was Pounds 151.2m.
Bankers' pays quarterly dividends. Henderson has a management contract with
a two-year notice period, for which the annual fee is 0.44 per cent of
quoted assets and 1.25 per cent on unquoted assets.
BOARD
Bankers' has a five-person board chaired by Barker. The other directors are
Richard Brewster, chief executive of Jarvis Porter, the printing and
packaging group; John Crosland, formerly a director of the Fleming fund
management group; Patrick Hedley-Dent, a director of Travel &amp; General
Holdings; and Moule.
SAVINGS PLAN DETAILS
The minimum monthly investment into the savings scheme is Pounds 25, and
Pounds 250 for a lump sum purchase. There is a 1 per cent charge on sales
and purchases (which falls to 0.5 per cent for transactions of more than
Pounds 15,000.) The trust is not eligible for Peps.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Could you please advise me on the following points?
1. What is the position with reference to capital gains tax when a person
buys shares from a relative (for example a wife, father, aunt or uncle),
agreeing a price and paying the relevant stamp duty using a stock transfer
form?
2. What is the position with reference to CGT if the shares are bought in
the same way from a friend?
If you buy shares from your wife, you will be treated as though you had paid
her a price equal to her indexed cost for CGT purposes, broadly speaking.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT15 (Capital gains tax: a guide
for married couples).
If you buy shares from your father (or from your mother, a grandparent, a
sibling, a child or a grandchild), you will be treated as though you had
paid a price calculated on the quarter-up basis if they have a London
quotation.
Otherwise, broadly-speaking, you will be treated as having paid the market
price. Ask your local tax office for the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains
tax: an introduction).
If you buy shares from your aunt, your uncle or a friend, the price actually
paid will stand for capital gains tax purposes, provided that it was agreed
at arm's length.
If it was not an arms-length price, then you will be treated in the same way
as if you had bought the shares from your father (as explained in the
preceding paragraph).
The rules are similar for sales of shares. However, if a sale of shares to
your father (or to your mother, grandparent, sibling, child or grandchild)
produces a loss for capital gains tax purposes, then that loss can only be
set against gains on sales to him (or her, as the case may be), generally
speaking.
Finally, for good measure, perhaps we should say that the rules for your
father apply also to step-parents and step-grandparents, and to the spouses
of siblings, of children and of grandchildren.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Executor finds job too tough to handle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME THREE years ago, I agreed to be the prospective executor of an elderly
woman relative. From information gleaned, it did not appear that there
should be much difficulty in handling her estate (around Pounds
25,000-Pounds 30,000), a task I had previously carried out without undue
problems.
The woman recently died and, while I have obtained papers for a personal
probate application, a quick assessment of the papers would clearly indicate
that I was not provided with the full facts when I accepted the task.
There are indications that there will be much more complication than
anticipated due, in no small part, to the role played by those concerned in
assisting the woman in the management of her affairs in the last year or so.
Additionally, being a senior citizen of some 'vintage,' my own health has
given grounds for concern and I now feel unable to undertake such an
open-ended commitment. A bank account in my and the deceased names was
opened three years ago; from this, I have paid funeral expenses and will
continue to ensure that all such will be met. If necessary, I will fund any
shortfall from my own resources.
No application has yet been made for probate and I would like to divest
myself from this responsibility, but am unaware of the procedure. The
beneficiaries being family, I am advising them of my views and that I am in
contact with you for advice.
Does one have to go to a solicitor with the considerable expense involved? I
hold the original will (and copies) detailing me as executor.
A person who has been nominated as an executor in a will has a right to
probate or administration. He may renounce that right either before probate
has been granted or simultaneously with an application for grant. The
renunciation must be absolute and in writing.
It takes effect from the signature. The letter of renunciation must be
witnessed by a disinterested person. The renunciation, together with the
original will, are then filed in the district registry. A separate
renunciation of administration must be made if the executor is also entitled
to a grant of administration.
If an executor has intermeddled in a deceased's estate, his renunciation
will not be accepted. Any act in relation to the testator's property, which
indicates an intention to take on the executorship, constitutes acceptance
of the office of executor.
You state in your letter that you have paid the funeral and other debts of
the deceased.
This may not amount to intermeddling provided the payments were not large
and provided you have not otherwise dealt with the property of the deceased.
You may therefore, still be in a position to renounce the executorship. It
may be useful to approach the local registry and discuss the matter with
them. There is no need to brief a solicitor to do this on your behalf.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions - Buyers take
over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A RELATIVELY quiet week, there has been a change in bias from selling to
buying.
This may reflect the improvement in directors' confidence for the economic
outlook. Whether this will be sustained remains to be seen.
Shares in Lincat Group, which designs and manufactures commercial catering
equipment, have risen steadily since March 1992. That was when Martin
Craddock, the chairman and chief executive, bought 15,000 shares at 72p.
Last week, John Craddock, the president, sold 250,000 at 148p, reducing his
holding to about 1.44m
At the end of March, British Polythene Industries' completed successfully a
one-for-six rights issue. Rex Stone, the non-executive chairman, has now
sold 200,000 shares at 488p to leave him with 550,059 shares.
Persimmon, a residential building and development company, has seen its
share price rise 30 per cent relative to the FT-SE 100 index over the past
three months. Last week, chief executive John White sold 80,000 shares -
over half his holding - at prices between 271p and 277p.
The directors of Expamet International, the metal products company, have
been buying shares since August last year. Dr John Roberts, the chairman,
bought 450,000 last week at 53-55p, so increasing his holding to 504,843
shares.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Diary of a Private Investor: When shareholders are caught
bang to rights - Kevin Goldstein-Jackson casts a questioning eye over this
year's plethora of issues and their merits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THUD. Another rights issue document falls through my letter box. So far this
year, there seems to have been a plethora of them.
In January, my wife was invited to increase her very small shareholding in
Burton Group by taking up her one-for-four rights entitlement at 60p a
share. Reading the document, it seemed that the money raised would be put to
good use: refurbishing many of the group's stores and reducing borrowing
levels. The company was also cutting 933 staff employed in 'head office
functions.'
In our wanderings around shopping centres, my wife and I had commented
already on some of the dreary-looking Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins stores;
it must be hoped that the money to be spent on them will encourage more
customers.
But we also liked the group because of its flair for marketing: almost every
week, it seems to find some excuse for another heavily-promoted sale in its
Debenhams stores. My wife's shareholding in the group entitles her to a 12.5
per cent discount on all purchases at the group's shops, which also include
Principles and Champion Sport. This encourages shareholder loyalty.
My wife's decision to buy the rights issue shares has so far proved
profitable, as Burton's shares are now more than 80p.
Much less appealing was Lonrho's three-for-10 rights issue in February at
85p a share. It seemed to me that this was pitched at such a level as to
enable Dieter Bock, a substantial new shareholder in the company, to
increase his stake through underwriting part of the issue.
Although I have made some good profits over the years from buying and
selling Lonrho shares, the share price fluctuations in recent times have
been too much. My holding at the time of the rights issue was, therefore,
minimal.
But the imminent sale of The Observer newspaper (owned by Lonrho) to the
Guardian and the rise in the price of gold (Lonrho has a 45 per cent stake
in the huge Ashanti gold mine in Ghana), plus Bock's influence on the
group's German activities, have made me wonder if Lonrho is due for a
re-rating. The company has many other interests, and I shall be monitoring
it closely before deciding whether to increase my holding through the
market.
In April, I received details of rights offerings from three companies: Davis
Service Group, Sycamore Holdings and Television South West (TSW). I have not
taken up any of them; indeed, the details have persuaded me to dispose of my
holdings in two of those companies.
I bought shares in Davis for my personal pension scheme in February this
year, paying 205p apiece in anticipation of good results in March. And Davis
did announce good results: profits were up by more than Pounds 3m and the
shares rose to 230p.
On April 7, though, the company sent shareholders details of a vendor
placing and open offer of almost 17m new shares at 205p - plus news of its
proposed acquisition of HSS Higher Service Group from Mowlem.
The cost of this was Pounds 52m - which I thought rather high for a company
hiring out small plant, tools and equipment. HSS appears to have net assets
of less than Pounds 7m and had an operating profit (before interest charges
and tax) of only Pounds 4.765m for the December 31 1992 year-end.
So, I sold my Davis shares for 229p. I could well be proved wrong but, in
these days of continuing uncertainty in the markets, I prefer to err on the
side of caution.
Sycamore seems to be making a habit of rights issues. My pension scheme took
up its two-for-one offer in September 1990 at 10p, and I hoped the company's
new management team would improve performance.
In June 1991, Sycamore made an open offer to shareholders of 17 new ones for
every 20 held at a price of 19p. The company proposed using the proceeds to
fund a number of acquisitions including Warwill, a foundry and engineering
company.
By this time, I had reduced my holding substantially as I did not share
directors' hopes for Sycamore's immediate prospects. Some of its products -
particularly garden furniture - appeared increasingly unattractive compared
with rival products. And I was not keen on the foundry business.
Thus, by the time of this April's two-for-five rights issue at 5p, my
pension scheme had very few Sycamore shares left. What I read in the rights
document caused me to sell the rest.
As I had thought, its garden furniture business had run into difficulties;
these were explained away in the document as 'a combination of poor summer
weather and depressed consumer demand.' And, for the six months to December
31 1992, Warwill, had losses of Pounds 581,000.
Sycamore's other businesses were faring rather better, but the main reason
for the rights issue was to reduce the company's borrowings as it had
experienced 'considerable strain' on its financial resources. I decided the
risk of maintaining my holding was too great; there were better investment
opportunities elsewhere.
As for TSW, a small ITV company that lost its franchise last year, I was its
founder and, until January, 1985, the chief executive. At one time, I held
1.25m shares in it; now I have just 500, mainly for sentimental reasons.
The board of the company seems to have been well rewarded for losing the
franchise - and for committing the company to a lease until the year 2000 on
expensive office accommodation in Knightsbridge (west London) which, the
rights issue document points out, has now led to provisions of Pounds 2m.
The chairman saw his salary increase to Pounds 149,000 in 1992 and the
highest-paid director received Pounds 259,000 - up from Pounds 90,000 and
Pounds 149,000 respectively for the 17 months to December 31 1991.
TSW's one-for-six rights issue, at 47p, is for the company to transform
itself into UK Safety, a safety footwear business. I thought the offer was
unappealing. So, I have several questions:
For what are the proceeds going to be used?
Is there anything in the small print of the issue document that might cause
concern?
Will the existing directors of the company be taking up their entitlement?
Is the issue likely to be a success, or will many of the shares be left with
the underwriters - so that the price falls eventually to below the rights
price?
If the company was not having this issue, would I buy more shares in it at
the issue price? If not, then why back the company further when I do not
have 100 per cent confidence in it?
The answers to these questions will determine my reaction to the issue.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Record sales for unit trust Peps -
Investors flock in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL equity plans have become one of the most popular ways of investing
money, if the record sales achieved by unit trust Peps are anything to go
by. These plans, which account for the majority of Pep deals, achieved net
sales of Pounds 846m in the first quarter of the year. They accounted for
almost half the net amount - Pounds 1.8bn - taken in by unit trusts in the
first quarter of the year.
Peps allow investors to hold equities free of income and capital gains tax,
subject to investment limits. The maximum investment in a general Pep is
Pounds 6,000 in a single tax year. In addition, investors can also hold
another Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep.
Sales of Peps tend to increase in the first quarter of the year as people
top-up or new investors take out a plan before the end of the tax year. Unit
and investment trust Peps were given a significant boost in the 1992 tax
year when their annual investment limit was raised from Pounds 3,000 to that
of a general Pep.
The last quarter, therefore, has been the first before the end of a tax year
in which unit trust Peps have been on an equal footing with general Peps.
'Since the government allowed people to invest a full Pounds 6,000 Pep
allowance in unit trusts, close to Pounds 2bn has been invested,' says Gavin
Grant, of the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds.
At least of equal importance has been the background of falling interest
rates which has pitched equities, building societies and National Savings
into a battle for investors' money. Building society net receipts amounted
to Pounds 820m in the first quarter of the year - approaching three times
net receipts in the whole of 1992, which totalled a mere Pounds 295m.
Mark Boleat, of the Building Societies Association, said last month that
'faced with renewed competition from National Savings and unit trusts,
building societies have been adding to their range of savings products. This
has enabled them to maintain a steady inflow of funds over recent months.'
Mindful that many people are looking for income, unit trusts have been
marketing Peps aimed at meeting this income need. In February, M&amp;G launched
a Managed Income fund with a 5 per cent yield. Fidelity offered its High
Income fund, investing in high-yielding equities and fixed-interest stocks
to produce a 6 per cent yield.
The Cazenove Utility and Bond fund, also launched in February, invests in
utility stocks to produce a 7 per cent yield. But the most spectacular plan
was launched by Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial. Its Higher Income scheme offers a
yield of 10 per cent through use of the options market.
'People have been forced to look at Peps to boost their income, and they are
proving a very attractive option,' says Robin Bloor, of Chase de Vere,
publishers of Pep Guide. 'Money from maturing guaranteed income bonds and
the building society has been going into these products.'
The Association of Unit Trusts expects sales of unit trust Peps to remain
strong in the coming year despite Budget changes to advance corporation tax;
these have reduced income tax saving for basic rate Pepholders.
Meanwhile, at least 1,000 Foreign &amp; Colonial Pep investors will have part of
their Pep holdings sold as a result of an inadvertant breach of the Pep
rules by F&amp;C. Its High Income investment trust (not to be confused with Hypo
F&amp;C's unit trust plan) has been made ineligible for inclusion in a Pep as a
result of new rules announced by the government in December.
As a 'non-qualifying' trust - one that does not hold at least 50 per cent of
its assets in the UK or European Community - F&amp;C High Income was eligible
only for Pep investment of up to Pounds 1,500.
The new rules, which took effect on April 6, state that any non-qualifying
investment or unit trust which has less than 50 per cent of its assets
placed in ordinary shares cannot be included in a Pep. The move was designed
to prevent funds investing primarily in gilts or bonds rather than equities.
Only 30 per cent of F&amp;C's High Income fund is invested in equities - the
rest is in high-yielding convertible preference shares and fixed-interest
stock. But F&amp;C does not want to increase investment in equities because this
would result in a lower dividend to its shareholders.
The trust also has a dollar-denominated loan fixed at 9 3/8 per cent
interest until 1997, and cannot afford to switch to lower-yielding equities.
The Inland Revenue is giving F&amp;C a period of grace in which it is allowed to
sell the trust's shares and re-invest the proceeds. As long as this is done
by June 9, there will be no tax liability for those F&amp;C Pep-holders
concerned.
Once F&amp;C sells the shares, it will hold the proceeds on the money markets
until its Pep investors give it new instructions. Investors can switch to a
different F&amp;C investment trust or to another company without paying F&amp;C's
usual Pounds 50 transfer charge, which is being waived.
Jeremy Tigue, director of Foreign &amp; Colonial management and manager of the
F&amp;C High Income trust, said it was 'very disappointing' that the change in
the rules meant the trust could no longer be held in a Pep.

BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, will be
quizzed about the impact of the US cigarette price wars when reporting its
first-quarter results on Wednesday.
The decision by US tobacco group Philip Morris to slash prices in April had
no impact on BAT's figures to the end of March, which are expected to show
pre-tax profits up from Pounds 258m to about Pounds 350m. But the UK group's
share price has fallen by 17 per cent since the price cuts started and
analysts will be keen to get an update.
The results will include a currency gain of about Pounds 30m, but also
reflect stronger performance by BAT's insurance subsidiaries, Eagle Star in
the UK and Farmers in the US.
British Petroleum is expected to show on Thursday a slight decline in its
replacement cost profit for the first quarter when compared with the final
quarter last year. Nick Antill at Hoare Govett estimates the company will
make Pounds 190m compared with Pounds 200m. In the same period last year,
the company posted a profit of Pounds 89m. But BP will have done well to
keep the result fairly stable when oil prices and refining margins declined
leading to a downturn in pre-tax operating profits. This will partly be
offset by lower interest and tax charges and a boost from the
dollar-sterling exchange rate.
Refining margins in Asia improved and chemicals are expected to be no worse
than last year. Tate &amp; Lyle is expected to report on Wednesday an increase
in interim pre-tax profits of about 15 per cent to Pounds 103m, thanks
partly to sterling's devaluation.
Royal Bank of Scotland, also reporting interim the same day, is forecast to
produce about Pounds 65m pre-tax after bad debt provisions, against Pounds
48m a year earlier. Positive factors include flat costs, rising fee income
and widening mortgage spreads.
Bank of Scotland, on Thursday, is expected to report flat pre-tax profits
for the year ended February of about Pounds 140m. Operating profits will
have grown by about 12 per cent but bad debt provisions have risen.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Top annuity rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUITY RATES are at their lowest for many years, says Peter Quinton of the
Annuity Bureau (11-12 Hanover Square, London W1R 9BD, tel. 071-495 1495)
which produces the FT's table. The rates listed are based on a purchase
price of Pounds 100,000.
'Over the past few weeks, however, several leading insurers have
re-positioned themselves in the marketplace by improving their rates,'
Quinton adds. Royal Life raised its rates this week.
Billy Burrows, of Annuity Direct, says rates have flattened after a two-year
fall. He expects them to stay at present levels or even drop slightly in the
short term, with no significant changes either up or down.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Help for school fees - John Authers
explains how parents can benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SCHOOL fees went up by more than inflation again last year
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but parents showed signs that they had, finally, worked out how best to plan
for paying them.
Average fees increased by 8.3 per cent in 1992, according to the latest
census of schools by the Independent Schools Information Service (Isis). But
this figure includes wide variations. Term fees for boarding schools
increased to an average of Pounds 3,125, while day school fees rose to
Pounds 1,368.
There are also broad regional variations. Boarding school fees range from
Pounds 2,003 in Ireland (including both the republic and Ulster) to Pounds
3,532 in Greater London, while day fees vary between Pounds 686 (again in
Ireland) to Pounds 1,540 in Greater London and the south-east.
More than a quarter of independent pupils now receive financial aid for
their fees, most of which comes from schools' bursary and scholarship funds.
Indeed, many schools are in such difficult circumstances that, often, they
will be prepared to make a contribution just to keep their fee income
flowing.
The government's assisted places scheme is useful for those on total family
incomes of less than Pounds 25,000, and take-up is improving - 31,582 pupils
are now benefitting from it.
For those who have not saved in advance, Isis has a special reserve plan
which provides cheap lending facilities for parents. Draw-down loans come
from the Halifax, and you borrow money only when it is needed for another
term's fees.
This scheme has two big advantages. The first is the rate of interest, which
is linked to the Halifax's base rate of 7.99 per cent. If borrowing is
likely to be more than Pounds 60,000, the rate charged will be 7.54 per
cent; this drops to 7.39 per cent if you borrow more than Pounds 100,000.
The second is that there are no strings to how you repay the loan - you are
not forced to buy an endowment policy. Michael Kaye of Claremont Savile, the
independent adviser which administers the scheme, says: 'Endowment
mortgages, long held to be an answer, are no longer attractive and are
neither cost-effective nor tax-efficient.'
Instead, Claremont Savile steers parents towards the least risky and most
tax-efficient investments first. In more complex cases, you can also opt to
sell endowments to market-makers - which could give you a big pile of cash -
or make them paid-up, thus avoiding further outlay.
The Isis scheme has been on offer for a year and now pays out almost Pounds
1m a week to parents. Obviously, it is still better to save in advance; but
if your child is about to start school, and you cannot fund fees out of
income, there is no need to borrow any more, at any higher cost, than you
need. For further information, contact Isis on 071-630-8793 or Claremont
Savile 0344-28787.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: For investors with an eye to foreign
profits / A look at when and where to buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS an old stock market adage: 'Sell in May and go away. Come back on
St Leger day.' With interest rates in the UK relatively low, Britons
thinking of investing overseas in the hope of better returns could find some
wisdom in this saying.
St Leger day this year falls on September 11. The chart shows that, since
1964, the average capital return on the FT-All Share index between May 1 and
September 11 is just 0.56 per cent.
By investing on September 11 and selling on April 30, though, the average
return rises to 10.7 per cent.
The same principle seems to hold true in world markets. Since 1982, the
average return April-September is 1.54 per cent compared to 10.72 per cent
for the rest of the year, according to the Morgan Stanley Capital
International index.
Darting in and out of the market can be expensive and hazardous, though.
Most experienced private investors know the best returns come over the long
term, with five years a prudent minimum.
'Sell in May' can be used as a guide to timing - especially if tthe main
world markets show signs of being quiet over the next few months. New
investors may consider it better to wait, rather than monitor their
investments nervously throughout the dog days of summer.
The Weekend FT asked fund managers what they thought of the strategy, and
which markets offered the best opportunities.
Martin Wooller, director of fixed income at Fidelity Investments:
'Statistically, sell in May has often been a good policy, especially in the
UK.
'But equity investment is, and should be, long term. Do not try to be a
short-market timer. The professionals can't do it, so there is no reason why
others should be able to.
'We are cheerful about the UK because the market appears to be buying the
green shoots recovery story and there are, once again, good stocks to pick
out. We do not focus on the blue chips but more on the FT-SE 350. The market
is broadening, so this would be a good time to go in.
'The European markets are behaving sensibly in that they see German monetary
policy being relaxed, which is improving the valuation basis of the markets.
But earnings disappointments will come through in the summer so, again, that
could be a good time to buy.
'We are cautious about the US because of anxiety that the recovery is
faltering. A number of companies have reported disappointing earnings.
'If you want to sell in May, this would be the market to get out of; but we
would say, put at least part of the money back into south-east Asia for the
long term because the place keeps growing.
'Hong Kong, as an entry point into China, is not for the faint-hearted
because there are dangers that the Chinese economy is overheating. And there
is still the question of what will happen after 1997. But we regard it as a
long-term hold.'
David Rosier, chairman of Mercury Asset Management Private Investors:
'Market timing is the hardest part of the business. Short-term movements
have got very difficult to predict and are getting harder because the world
has become a smaller place.
'The Japanese market has risen strongly in response to foreign buying, but
it is expensive. Company profits will continue to fall.
'Our view is that the market is unlikely to rise sharply from present levels
and, when people focus on its evaluation, there is a risk that it could fall
sharply.
'We are neutral on the US. There is a modest economic recovery but the
market is fully valued.
'Continental Europe has reacted positively against a background of falling
interest rates, but the markets are having a hard time coming out of
recession - they are behind the UK in this. Some areas are more attractive
than others. For example, the new government in France is likely to focus on
domestic issues and rates will come down.
'We are positive about UK equities. There will be a gradual recovery in a
low interest-rate environment, and there could be good growth in the economy
in the next year and the year after.
'The next few months could be a good time to build up a portfolio when the
market is not rising quickly. But you must accept that the shares you buy
now may be slightly lower in value in a few months.'
Jeremy Tigue, director of Foreign and Colonial Management: 'Although sell in
May is a reasonable theory around the world, for many investors the time to
buy is in a period of weakness. We think the UK market will be higher by the
end of the year than now. But the British Telecom issue and Zeneca rights
issues in June/July will act as a restraint on the market. It will then be
the holiday season, so the market is likely to be quiet.
'The market in the United States has not done very much recently but there
are signs of recovery. We are now waiting for President Clinton's
announcement on health-care reform.
'The health-care sector has already suffered a lot in expectation of what
might happen so, unless the plans are radical, the market might be
discounting the bad news.
'There is bound to be a period of consolidation in Japan. After the steep
rise in the Nikkei index the chances are that the market will be quiet for
the next few months.'
Michael Lenhoff, portfolio strategist with Capel-Cure Myers, feels the major
markets are over-valued. 'On a price/earnings ratio the UK, at 17 times 1993
earnings, is higher than in 1987. In the US the multiple is 16 and that,
too, is high.
'In Europe, Germany is extremely expensive; it is about 40 per cent
overvalued on a p/e ratio. So, the conventional wisdom is appropriate for
these markets.
'We are, nonetheless, keen on the US market. Recovery is being translated
into strong corporate earnings' growth and monetary policy is good, too, but
the cloud is political.
'We are worried by the difficulty President Clinton has had with his
economic stimulus package. So, there is an added dimension of uncertainty,
which the market will treat adversely.
'We are equivocating on Japan. There is no evidence of a recovery in
corporate profits, and there are even questions about that in 1994.
'We had increased our weighting to Japan at the end of last year, but we
would not go any further at the moment.
'We are expecting 5-7 per cent growth in south-east Asia and have a double
weighting in this part of the world.
'Hong Kong looks expensive and is overvalued, but it is one of the few plays
on China. There will be short-term volatility, but we want to be in that
market for the long term.
'In the UK, we were saying that the FTSE-100 would reach 3,300 by the end of
the year, but that assumed further interest rate cuts. We might have to trim
back our year-end forecast to 3,150.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Men to face unisex threat on annuities
 -Lower payments could follow legal moves in EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a fact: women live longer than men. But a key opinion this week from
the advocate-general of the European Court of Justice says that, when it
comes to pensions, employers must forget all that. Those who have
contributed more to women's pensions because they will draw them longer
after retirement will, apparently, have to stop. The advice, if followed by
the ECJ in its final ruling in June, could mean that men will receive lower
monthly payments from an annuity bought upon retirement.
The advice to the court follows its consideration of a group of cases led by
the trustees to the pension scheme of Coloroll, the UK home furnishings
company now in liquidation. The trustees asked the ECJ to clarify how they
should carry out an earlier ruling in the case of Barber v Guardian Royal
Exchange. In that ruling - on May 17 1990 - the court ruled pensions were
deferred pay and that employers may not discriminate between sexes in pay
awards.
But pensions are a complicated subject, and employers needed guidance on the
nuts and bolts of equalising them. Across Europe, both occupational and
state pension schemes have, typically, allowed women to retire on full
pension at 60 while requiring men to wait until 65.
This difference in retirement ages meant, for instance, that male and female
twins who joined an employer on the same day, and left for a new employer on
the same day, had different transfer values. If they retired on the same
day, the woman received a pension roughly 25 per cent higher than that of
her brother; and if the employer bought an annuity out of a lump sum for
both of them, he would have to pay more to buy the woman the same monthly
income as her brother.
Now, it appears as if this will come to an end. 'The mere fact that, in
general, women live on average longer than men cannot, therefore, be a
sufficient reason to provide for different treatment in the matter of
contributions and benefits under occupational pension schemes,' the
advocate-general said in his opinion.
While they do live longer, there is no evidence that any one particular
woman will live longer than any one particular man; and if sex is to be a
guide to the size of pension, than the inclination to smoke or drink ought
to be as well, the advocate-general added.
The ruling has particular significance for those employers who finance
pension benefits through the purchase of an annuity for each employee upon
retirement, said John Cunliffe, a partner at solicitor McKenna and Co, which
represented the Coloroll trustees. It also has huge implications for
so-called money purchase schemes in which the employee receives a lump sum
upon retirement, although the court has not been asked specifically to give
an opinion on this matter.
The question is how insurers are going to respond to the ruling. The
advocate-general said there was no legal basis for requiring insurance
companies which sell annuities to calculate rates on a unisex basis. But
clues about what might happen can be gleaned from the US, where the Supreme
Court made a similar ruling nearly 10 years ago.
In broad terms, insurers there have cut men's annuity payments to the lower
levels of women. And data culled from annuity rates offered by Equitable
Life offer a picture of just how much difference there will be with unisex
rates. An annuity paying Pounds 100 a month will cost a 65-year-old man
Pounds 9,894, while a 65-year-old woman will pay Pounds 11,295. A monthly
annuity purchased with Pounds 10,000 will buy a 65-year old man a benefit of
Pounds 101.07 a month, but a woman of the same age will get only Pounds
88.53 for the same sum.
Significantly, the ruling does not affect those who receive a lump sum from
their employer and then go out into the market-place to buy it on their own
behalf. For those people, the response of the insurance industry to the
ruling will be what matters.
Consider, though, the position of employers trying to provide equal
pensions. According to Equitable Life's data, a pension scheme which is 75
per cent male and 25 per cent female will find the cost of a Pounds
100-a-month annuity for those at age 65 to be Pounds 10,244. As the balance
shifts to 75 per cent women, the cost rises to Pounds 10,945. But even that
is less than providing an annuity for a woman on her own.
Pension schemes offering an 'open market option,' in which members can
either go with the trustee's annuity policy or buy one on their own, may
find that sex will be the key determinant in deciding whether to exercise
that option. 'If I were a woman, I'd stick with the trustee. If I were a
man, I'd run to the nearest insurance company,' said Cunliffe.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Markets: The cash that has nowhere better to go - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN, the US stock markets are being propped up by huge inflows of
investors' cash.
Figures released by the Investment Company Institute this week showed that
mutual fund sales reached a record Dollars 11.3bn in March, and the early
indications are that April could come close to matching that figure. The
first quarter sales total of Dollars 60.1bn exceeded the old record by
almost a third.
The vast flows of money into stock funds, and eventually into stocks, are
helping to mask signs of weakness in some key equity market fundamentals.
Stocks remain expensive by historical standards, economic growth is
slackening, domestic interest rates have probably bottomed, and corporate
profitability, while it has improved in recent quarters, remains a hostage
to economic conditions - which means earnings could suffer if the recovery
slows down further.
Yet the fact that investors are hurrying to put their money into stock funds
is not necessarily a vote of confidence in equities. First, an increasing
amount of the new money is going into foreign stock funds as more investors
turn away from unexciting domestic markets and look for better returns
overseas. The weak dollar has only encouraged this greater interest in
foreign securities.
Second, March and April have been strong months for stock fund sales partly
because many investors rushed to put funds into their individual retirement
accounts (IRAs) before the April 15 tax-filing deadline.
President Clinton's first budget includes considerable tax increases and
individual investors, many of whom fall in the range of income-earners
facing higher government levies, were eager to make tax-deductable
contributions to their IRAs before the tax year ended.
Third, money has been flowing into mutual funds in record amounts, but fund
managers have not necessarily been putting all of it into stocks. Since
January, stock fund managers have been building up their cash holdings. At
the start of the year 8.9 per cent of fund assets were held in the form of
cash. By the end of March that figure had risen to 9.9 per cent, or Dollars
52.2bn.
While there is little doubt that some of that money will eventually find its
way into the markets, the recent rise in cash holdings reflects a wariness
among fund managers about the outlook for shares.
Moreover, this fondness for cash is remarkable given the miserable returns
available on cash investments. Investors are considered lucky if they can
get much more than 3 per cent on short-term assets like money-market funds
and Treasury bills. After inflation, they struggle to break even.
Yet fund managers are not alone in believing it prudent to hold more cash. A
recent survey by The Wall Street Journal found that the average cash level
recommended by strategists at a dozen big brokerage houses is now 14.25 per
cent of assets - the highest level seen in three years. At Dean Witter, for
example, chief investment strategist William Dodge has kept his asset
allocation at 60 per cent equities, 25 per cent bonds and 15 per cent cash.
In normal times, Dean Witter would have only 5 per cent of assets in cash.
What this all means for the markets is that stocks are being supported as
much by the realisation that equities are the only game in town as they are
by any deep-rooted confidence in the outlook for share prices. (It is true
that bonds had a superb first quarter, but the Treasury market rally looks
as if it has peaked.)
If inflation, and interest rates, pick up sharply over the summer, the flow
of investors' funds could be quickly diverted away from stocks. We have had
a little taste of that already, in the form of the recent rebound in gold
prices, which have benefited from a sudden revival of interest in gold as an
alternative investment to bonds and stocks.
This week's first quarter gross domestic product report did not help the
stock markets' cause. While investors had been bracing themselves for
economic growth to show a decline from the unsustainably high 4.7 per cent
rate achieved in the last quarter of 1992, the news that GDP rose by 1.8 per
cent in the first three months of this year still came as an unpleasant
surprise.
Some analysts tried to pin the disappointing growth on the severe winter
weather during the three months, but that did not wash. The most worrying
aspect of the data was that without a big jump in inventories, the economy
would actually have gone into reverse in the quarter.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Markets: An Pounds 8 ticket to fear and greed - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ORDER to resolve pressing cash flow problems, this column is throwing
itself open to the public.
For a modest entry fee, priced comparably with other attractions such as the
London Dungeon and the Black Hole of Calcutta, visitors will be given a
guided tour of the historic Prejudice Engine, the Cliche Machine and the
Irony Maiden. In the wake of the IRA's Bishopgate bomb, we anticipate eager
business from tourists anxious for the City experience, without actually
having to experience the City.
Meanwhile, work continues as normal. This week, our highly skilled
operatives have spent most of the time wondering whether the stock market's
slow-motion slide is a sign of its extraordinary accuracy as a discounting
mechanism, or its inability to hit a barn door.
The accuracy school of thought argues that the stock market picked up
remarkably early on the shape and speed of the recovery, after sterling's
exit from the ERM. By the end of 1992, the FT-SE 100 index had risen to
levels that discounted exactly the sort of pickup in economic activity and
corporate profits that is now under way.
Thus, in the week that this judgment was confirmed by the announcement of a
0.2 per cent rise in UK gross domestic product in the first quarter, it was
not surprising that the stock market was drifting back to levels achieved in
the closing days of the year, when the recovery first came into focus.
The alternative view - that the equity market's poor performance in recent
weeks indicates a form of collective myopia - stems from the belief that
what is happening is more than just a long-awaited lurch off the
recessionary floor.
German interest rates are now moving steadily downwards, even though each
individual step in the process is likely to be small and grudging. This
week, for example has brought two signs of German easing - a fall in
money-market rates on Wednesday, and a further cut in the Bundesbank's
three-day Treasury Bill rate to 7 per cent on Friday, seen by some analysts
as a strong indication of more cuts to come.
Lower rates from the Bundesbank will in time pull continental Europe out of
recession, and they will open the way for still lower UK interest rates in
the months ahead. Though UK companies continue to report poor results for
the recessionary financial year just ended - this week, for example, Tiphook
said profits were 20 per cent below expectations and Tarmac reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 350m in 1992 - there are also signs of how strong the
bounce-back in profits can be as demand picks up.
ICI, reporting for the last time as a single entity on Thursday, said
pre-tax profits for the first quarter rose 10 per cent to Pounds 233m,
thanks to weaker sterling and the effects of cost-cutting. Those two forces
affect much of UK manufacturing industry. When a solid recovery of demand
starts to make itself felt also, profits may rise more sharply than analysts
currently expect.
Of course, the advantage to UK companies from sterling's devaluation has
been partly offset by the appreciation of the pound from its lows. That
should not be overstated, however. This week, sterling closed at just over
DM 2.49, down a quarter of a pfennig on the week, and up 18 pfennigs since
February. On a trade-weighted basis sterling is now nearly 7 per cent higher
than it was in February. But it is still 11 per cent lower than in September
last year.
Worries about the impact of a rising pound on overseas earners are one of
the factors dragging down the stock market this week. A second factor
hurting the market - and supporting the case that it fairly values the
future stream of profits from UK companies - has been the weak performance
of gilts.
Ten-year gilts closed the week yielding 8.1 per cent, back above the 8 per
cent level for the first time since early February. A week ago, they were
yielding 7.9 per cent; a month ago, the figure was 7.7 per cent.
This move in long term interest rates not only affects the value of the
stock market directly - by making the dividend yield on equities less
attractive in relative terms - but also hints at economic worries to come.
It suggests that bond market investors, at least, are worried that the
economic recovery may be so brisk that it contains the seeds of its own
destruction, in the form of rising inflation. Short-term UK interest rates,
far from moving downwards in line with further German cuts, would at best
stay constant and might in time have to rise, to avoid the economy
overheating. That would put upwards pressure on sterling, reducing the
competitive advantages obtained by devaluation.
The gilt market is thus reinforcing the case for caution which is already
reflected in equities. One category of share is, however, very far from
displaying caution. The medium-sized, predominantly domestically oriented
companies in the FT-SE Mid 250 index continue to outperform their larger
brethren in the FT-SE 100.
This week they have achieved that outperformance largely by avoiding the
worst of the FT-SE 100's falls. Large investors move into and out of FT-SE
100 futures as a proxy for the market as a whole, a process which throws the
burden of sudden switches of mood disproportionately on to that index's
constituents.
Still, such technical factors apart, the Mid 250's move has been a striking
one. Its best performing stock - Barratt, the housebuilder - has risen 218
per cent since sterling left the ERM and the second-tier stocks took off.
Other construction groups have also risen sharply, as have companies such as
Burton (up 141 per cent) and Owners Abroad (up 116 per cent). Only 14
members of the FT-SE 100 have risen by more than 50 per cent since
mid-September; in the Mid 250, 90 companies have achieved that feat.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Markets: Having their cake and eating it - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
WHEN THE chairman of Britain's largest building society says he cannot sell
his customers the right products, it should be a clear signal to consumers -
if they did not know already - that something is seriously wrong with the
financial services industry.
Jim Birrell, the outgoing chairman of the Halifax, said this week that the
Halifax wanted to try to change the rules on 'polarisation' under which
financial products are retailed. His remarks add to the increasingly
circular debate on how consumer interests are best protected under the
system laid down by the Financial Services Act in 1988.
'Polarisation' is the name given to the system under which those who sell
financial products are divided into two separate groups. Financial
intermediaries can either sell the products of one company only - ie, become
its 'tied' agent - or set up as an independent financial adviser, where they
can sell anyone's products.
Originally, polarisation was designed to protect both IFAs and the consumer.
Tied agents must tell their clients that they are acting for one company
only. 'Multi-tying,' whereby agents would tie themselves to two or three
companies in order to offer a wider range of products, was thought to
confuse customers and was resisted by IFAs as threatening their interests.
It was also open to abuse because multi-tied agents could give the
impression that they were independent.
This has not worked out as it should. One unintended consequence of
polarisation has been that instead of protecting independent financial
advice, it has largely disappeared from banks and building societies
(although most retain separate IFA arms), mainly because life companies
offer higher commission to tied agents than to IFAs.
Moreover, polarisation has not stopped customers being confused. Even though
the bank or building society salesman has to declare the tie, customers do
not necessarily realise the implications. They cannot be blamed for assuming
that large institutions such as the Halifax, which act in a competitive
environment on mortgage and savings rates, also have a competitive range of
financial products.
But there was never any reason why one provider - the company to which the
institution is tied - should have a monopoly of the best financial products.
The provider with a good record for with-profits plans for pensions will not
necessarily have the highest performing unit trusts.
After toying briefly with independent financial advice in the wake of the
Financial Services Act, Halifax opted for a tie to Standard Life, one of
Britain's largest insurance companies. Halifax is now restless. Birrell said
this week that 'there are other sectors of the financial services market
where Standard Life is not the best provider.' The society wants to expand
through multi-tying.
His remarks highlight the speed with which high street banks and building
societies made their choice between the interests of their customers and
their own profitability after the implementation of the Financial Services
Act.
Asked why Halifax did not opt to retain independent financial advice if it
wanted to be able to sell products of more then one company, Birrell was
honest - 'the remuneration is better as a tied agent,' he said. The tie
earned Halifax Pounds 177m in commission in 1992, a hefty proportion of the
group's total profit of Pounds 680m. Birrell also said that Halifax found
that its customers did not know whether it was independent or tied.
Unfortunately there is little reason to believe that the consumer would
necessarily be in a better position with multi-ties. There is no getting
away from the nub of the problem, which is that better regulation is needed
in the industry and that financial salesmen and advisers should be made to
disclose the commission they receive for selling a product. Consumers should
be allowed to know the total they are paying for a financial product, in
simple arithmetic.
It is these deficiencies which have contributed to the fading influence of
the independent financial adviser, who is independent only to the degree
that he receives payment for his services from many life companies and
financial providers, instead of one.
Diligent IFAs who resist the temptation to oversell, risk losing their
reputation because of the misdeeds of their less scrupulous colleagues.
Members of Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for IFAs, were liable for large
payments to the Investors' Compensation Scheme, which threatened the loss of
IFAs to tied agent status. The insurance companies which use IFAs have been
prevailed upon to pick up a large part of the tab for the ICS.
The Office of Fair Trading made a good beginning towards reform by calling
in March for more disclosure. Unfortunately, it limited this recommendation
to IFAs and not to tied agents - with the danger that banks and building
societies will manage to kill off most of the IFA market, further reducing
consumer choice.
It is small wonder that Halifax wants to alter polarisation to preserve for
itself the benefits of tying, while widening its product range. It wants to
have the best of both worlds.
By the same token, consumers must look after their own interests by
continuing to press for disclosure and for higher standards of advice and
regulation in the industry.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Markets: BTP lights a fire under MTM - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS nothing like capping an industrial career by doubling your
company's net assets. Frank Buckley, the 64-year-old chairman of BTP,
presided over just such a deal this week when it bought MTM, a fellow
speciality chemical company, for Pounds 100m.
Whether this was in the interests of shareholders, or simply a last
impetuous fling, is another matter. When the company concerned has made
three calls on shareholders' cash within three years - this week's rights
issue at 185p was below the price of last year's call - the question is more
pertinent.
Happily for shareholders, BTP's latest acquisition looks well founded in
good, old-fashioned industrial logic. The Manchester-based company has
swooped to take advantage of the misfortunes at MTM's head office which have
led to a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the company's reported
profits.
BTP is buying under-utilised but modern plant which uses technology that
complements its own. And, in the profitable Hardwicke and the loss-making
Rock Hill plants in the US, it has gained a platform to manufacture
domestically for the recovering North American markets. Already selling 60
per cent of its product overseas, the underlying MTM businesses should
enhance significantly BTP's standing as a niche chemicals company.
BTP produces molecules for a multitude of industrial and consumer
applications. It provides a quarter of the world's preservatives for
cosmetics - the same chemical that is used in facsimile paper. It also makes
leather tanning chemicals, variants of which are used as additives in
concrete and in carpet stain resisters.
By juggling where it makes its product, BTP believes it can boost its sales
to the cosmetics business in the US, so gaining a price advantage by
avoiding the import tariff it now pays. And spare capacity at Teesport and
Kirkby might be used to meet the growing Far Eastern demand for tanning
chemicals.
The numbers would also seem to stack up. On Wednesday, BTP estimated pre-tax
profits of Pounds 20.4m for the year to end-March 1993 (up from Pounds
18.2m) but a fall in earnings from 14.8p to 14p. During the first year, the
company forecasts the MTM businesses will be of 'modest benefit' to
earnings, but that there will be 'significant benefits' thereafter. What is
more, the shares are still on a yield premium to the market: the company is
expecting to increase its final dividend to give a 9.3p total for the year,
up 5.1 per cent.
But can BTP's management handle the steep change in size, a question asked
when any company nearly doubles its size?
BTP says it thinks MTM's operating companies and their managements have been
held back only by the turmoil at head office. Extensive investigation into
the seven MTM companies showed that Richard Lines, MTM's former chairman,
invested heavily in modern, hi-tech plants. But management reporting systems
were woefully inadequate; in many cases, MTM simply did not know if the
product it was making was profitable. MTM's utilisation of capacity also was
very low: in Rock Hill's case, it was below 30 per cent when break-even
should have been above 65 per cent.
If BTP can improve this situation, MTM's three loss-makers would be
eliminated quickly. But Steve Hannam, who took over as chief executive last
year, emphasises that BTP will be dropping some of MTM's product lines. 'It
matters that what goes through BTP makes money,' he says, suggesting that
MTM's plants might become more sensitive to market demand.
The MTM businesses also should benefit immediately under a financially
strengthened parent. Inevitably, MTM's dire financial situation was
preventing some customers from placing orders and was restricting its access
to credit.
The change of ownership should light a fire under MTM's operational
management, which has worked under a cloud since the group's share price
collapsed last year. Certainly, Hannam finds it hard to hide his enthusiasm
for his new chemistry set. Introducing the deal, he said excitedly that BTP
had bought 'lots of sites, lots of assets, lots of kit.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Cited for treason: East Germany's 'spy with no face' - He
was the model for John le Carre's fictional spymaster. Next week, Markus
Wolf goes on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIDDEN INSIDE a parked car, the Swedish agent aimed his camera and its
telephoto lens at the distinguished-looking East German strolling with his
pretty companion in central Stockholm. The day was July 1 1978. The man was
Markus Wolf, legendary head of communist East Germany's Central Agency for
Intelligence (HVA) and the model for novelist John le Carre's Soviet
spymaster, Karla.
Until that day, the only photographs of Wolf available to the intelligence
services of the western world dated from 1959; Wolf was known as 'The Man
With No Face.' For him, it was the beginning of the end.
Next Wednesday, Wolf will go on trial in Dusseldorf charged with treason
against the Federal Republic of Germany. He is alleged to have bribed a
string of senior West German intelligence officials who became his 'moles.'
But the trial has aroused enormous controversy; some are calling it a
travesty of justice.
For one thing, Wolf was not a citizen of the Federal Republic. For another,
and perhaps more significantly, he has not been charged with offences for
which many of his one-time antagonists hold him to be partly responsible as
deputy head of the Ministry of State Security - the infamous Stasi secret
police.
Wolf's visit to Stockholm in mid-1978, under the alias of Dr Kurt Werner,
combined business with pleasure. The tall, dashing 56-year-old with a taste
for beautiful women, tailored suits and other luxuries - and regarded by his
peers in east and west as the cold war's most cunning and successful
intelligence operator - was there to meet one of his top West German agents,
an MP named Dr Friedrich Cremer.
Wolf was accompanied by Christa, the second of his three wives, on her first
visit to the west. They shopped for Swedish furniture, and Wolf broadened
his young wife's horizons by taking her to a porno club. But already he had
aroused the suspicions of a Swedish immigration official and
counter-intelligence was alerted.
As well as photographing Wolf, it took pictures of his meeting with Cremer;
these later helped to convict the politician of espionage, for which he was
given 2 1/2 years in prison. West German officials gnashed their teeth on
learning of Wolf's visit to Stockholm, but he had not violated Swedish laws
and was able to return to the east. However, the damage to his cover had
been done.
Wolf was a study in contradictions. Long an ardent Stalinist and calculating
exploiter of human weaknesses - including the notorious sex traps used by
eastern spymasters - his personal warmth and care for his nearly 4,000 staff
gained him their unstinting loyalty. Cremer was deeply impressed at their
meeting by the spy chief's openness, keen intelligence - he could talk about
literature or music with equal ease  - and his anxiety for the MP's
well-being.
Wolf's family background and the searing experiences of his youth help to
explain the contradictions of his character. His father, Friedrich, a
communist, was a noted playwright and physician during the Weimar era who
treated his poor patients for nothing. Although he abandoned his Jewish
faith as a German army doctor during the first world war he - and, later,
Markus - would suppress or revive their Jewish origin whenever it appeared
opportune.
Expelled from Hitler's Germany, the Wolfs were given refuge in the Soviet
Union. Markus was 11 when he shed his German past and became Mischa Wolf, a
zealous member of the Young Pioneers who adulated Stalin despite the purges
of the late 1930s which led to the imprisonment of many neighbours and
friends in Moscow. His own girlfriend, Margit, was one of the victims.
Like his father, and millions of other communists, Wolf learned to suppress
whatever doubts he had about Soviet socialism by telling himself that the
state had to be ruthless internally in its mortal struggle with Nazi
Germany. Much later, after the post-war Polish and Hungarian uprisings and
the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, he and many fellow communists
realised that the Stalinist system was the undoing of socialism. But, again,
they rationalised away their doubts by arguing that to question the faith
would be to play into the hands of the west.
At the age of 16, Wolf became a Soviet citizen. At 19, he joined the
communist party and was assigned to the spartan Comintern school where young
German exiles like himself were trained to occupy key posts in Germany after
the defeat of Hitler. It was there that Wolf met his first wife, Emmi
Stenzel, daughter of a communist deputy to the Reichstag who was murdered by
the Nazis. Although her mother was arrested by Stalin's secret police in
1937, she was convinced that the purges were not the work of the Soviet
leader but of his scheming aides.
Emmi was remembered by Comintern students for her habit of denouncing their
errant political views to the school administration, which forced them to
engage in self-criticism. She has mellowed since, but bridles at the charge
of having been an informer.
'It's untrue,' she says now in her high-rise flat overlooking east Berlin.
'We had group discussions about behaviour, studies, help. But we never had
interrogations, only discussions.' Even though Wolf divorced her in 1977 to
marry Christa, he continued to look after her interests and Emmi still says
only good things about him, although she notes: 'He never helped around the
house.'
Wolf and Emmi were flown to Berlin in May 1945; there, he became chief
commentator of Berlin Radio and remarked bitterly about the arrogant Germans
he met who refused to acknowledge the Nazi crimes committed in their name.
The party next assigned him to a senior posting at the new GDR embassy in
Moscow, requiring him again to become a German citizen.
Shortly afterwards, and much to his surprise, he was ordered to join the
newly-founded Institute of Economic Research - a cover name for East
Germany's fledgling espionage service, which he would head from 1953 until
he retired in 1987. His greatest coups were to obtain construction plans for
several US missile sites, and technical plans for the missiles, during the
1970s and 1980s, plus Nato's contingency plans for a Soviet-led attack.
He refused to use amateur spies or students (as the US Central Intelligence
Agency did at that time) because he thought the risk that they would be
caught and imprisoned was too high. If one of his own spies was caught, it
was known throughout the service that he would press vigorously to barter
their release. And he treated them like princes when they returned. Yet he
would use his agents to prey ruthlessly on lonely women - mainly secretaries
 -in key positions in Bonn and Brussels.
There were around 600 East German agents operating in the west. It was
Wolf's idea to latch some of them - nicknamed 'Romeo agents' - on to these
women employed by the Bonn government and Nato. When a woman was enmeshed,
perhaps by the promise of marriage, she would be drawn into Wolf's network.
In the case of Dagmar Kahlig-Scheffler, a secretary in former chancellor
Helmut Schmidt's East Germany's 'spy with no face' office, the HVA arranged
for her 'operative fictional marriage' to agent Herbert Schroter at which
HVA officers played the roles of best man and registrar.
Perhaps the most important of these was Dr Gabriele Gast, who fell in love
during her student days with a Romeo agent calling himself Karl-Heinz
Schmidt. Gast became a willing accomplice and worked her way up to become
deputy head of the Soviet section of the BND Federal Intelligence Service in
Munich. She spied for the GDR for more than 20 years, refusing payment for
her services because of her political conviction.
On meeting Wolf for the first time - at a house party he hosted on an island
in the Adriatic, off the Yugoslav coast - she was captivated by his charm
and intelligence. Later, she visited him several more times in East Berlin.
She was arrested only a few days before German unification and sentenced to
six years and nine months in prison. Schmidt was released after
interrogation.
Another of Wolf's spies was Gunter Guillaume who, with his wife, was
infiltrated into the refugee stream fleeing from east to west in 1956.
Seventeen years later, he had become an aide to West German chancellor Willy
Brandt.
He passed top Nato secrets to East Berlin and his arrest provoked Brandt's
resignation - an event Wolf later professed, not entirely convincingly, to
regret deeply.
Not all of Wolf's top spies in the west were as ideologically motivated as
Gast or Guillaume. Klaus Kuron was a frustrated senior official in West
Germany's BfV counter-espionage agency when, in 1981, he offered his
services to Wolf for cash.
Over 10 years, he was paid nearly DM700,000. After collecting his last
payment late in 1990, he surrendered to the authorities and was given a
12-year prison term for treason.
Wolf admitted later that much of the information gathered by his agents was
ignored by the ruling Politburo or, in the case of high-tech secrets, was of
little use to East Germany's creaking planned economy. He also claims he
became disillusioned politically with the communist system. So why did he
stay?
'We all had critical opinions - ministers, general directors and the
intelligentsia - but it came out only in our personal conversations,' he
told me in the luxurious flat in east Berlin which he shares with third wife
Andrea. He has been on bail awaiting trial since October 1991.
'Increasingly, I doubted the sense of my work. But what use would it have
been for me to protest? The dogmatists would only have become more
repressive.'
He was the first communist intelligence chief to step down voluntarily.
Realising that the orthodox East German regime could not survive much
longer, former Stasi Major General Markus Wolf altered course, backing
Mikhail Gorbachev enthusiastically and condemning Stalinism in a
best-selling book.
No one was more surprised than he to find himself mentioned as a possible
future reformist leader of the GDR. But any hopes in that direction were
dashed on November 4 1989 when he addressed a rally of more than 1m East
Germans.
Wolf's remarks, criticising the way that Stasi officers who acted in 'good
faith' had been made the 'whipping boys of the nation,' met with a storm of
whistles and cat-calls. The master strategist had miscalculated badly the
mood of his fellow east Germans.
Wolf denies flatly that he played any role in the Stasi's repressive
apparatus, the tentacles of which - helped by the organisation's 85,000
officers and 300,000 informers - stretched into every nook and corner, with
files on nearly 2m people.
'I bear no responsibility,' he told me. 'It was an advantage for me that
Mielke did his work and that my apparat had nothing directly to do with
his.' Wolf claims that the section he ran, dealing with foreign
intelligence, had nothing to do with the larger part of the Stasi engaged in
internal suppression and counter-espionage.
Wolf's trial will be concerned more with the Stasi's activities outside the
former GDR than with its activities as a hated secret police service, and
has generated few calls among east Germans for retribution. Indeed, most
easterners have long since forgotten how Erich Honecker, the former party
leader now in Chile, praised Wolf on his 60th birthday in 1983 for his
'decisive role in the development and strengthening of the ministry of state
security.'
Yet Wolf has been 'demonised' by the popular German press and several of his
aggrieved former opponents. Despite that, Herbert Hellenbroich, the head of
both West Germany's BfV counter-espionage agency and the BND intelligence
service in the 1970s, speaks for a considerable body of opinion when he
argues that convicting Wolf would be unconstitutional as he was ordered to
conduct espionage by an East German government recognised by Bonn.
Wolf's lawyers are expected to take precisely this line. They will insist,
also, that trying him violates the principle of equality under the federal
constitution: so long as West Germany's spymasters remain free, they will
argue, prosecuting Wolf is illegal.
This was exactly the position taken in 1991 by Berlin's high court at the
trial of Wolf's successor, Werner Grossmann; it called for a final ruling by
the Constitutional Court, which has not yet been delivered. But if it
upholds the Berlin court, then the federal attorney-general's case against
'Major General Markus Wolf ret' could, effectively, be destroyed.
As he awaits judgment, Wolf says he is convinced that his work as
intelligence chief helped to 'preserve peace' in Europe. His reasoning,
explained no doubt over many a candle-lit dinner table to his agents, is
that the more that each side knew about the other in the cold war, the less
they were likely to fight.
Who knows: perhaps he was right. 'I was a successful general,' he says, his
eyes narrowing. 'But what is the good of winning battles when the war is
lost?'

FT  01 MAY 93 / The Long View: Wheels within cycles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CHOOSE YOUR stock market cliche: buy the rumour, sell the fact; sell on a
strike (of oil, that is); to travel hopefully is better than to arrive. The
cyclical behaviour of asset markets is well documented and analysed, yet can
still seem perverse. The latest instance came this week in the UK equity
market when the FT-SE 100 index slipped below 2,800, even though the latest
GDP figures at last showed unequivocal evidence of economic recovery.
On the Continent, the Bundesbank continued to cut German interest rates,
only to trigger falls in stock and bond prices. Like TV news editors, are
investors no longer interested in good news?
Such reactions seem dramatically at variance with the mood of the markets
early in the year when indications of recovering output and falling interest
rates were seized on eagerly to justify rises in securities prices. To
explain this shift, we tend to be fed implausible rationalisations, one
being that falling German interest rates show just how dire the state of the
German economy must be.
In fact, securities markets are driven primarily by underlying flows of
money. When that is plentiful, the markets go up - something that,
typically, happens in recessions when most people are cautious, cut their
spending and reduce their borrowings. Financial assets are the beneficiaries
of this process. At some point in the recovery, however, confidence recovers
and the financial flows begin to reverse. People and companies raise their
spending on goods and services again. The tone of the markets changes.
In the classical pattern there is a clear sequence to this. The bond markets
peak first, fearing that interest rates will stop falling and will soon
begin to rise. Indeed, when bond prices fall, it is precisely the same thing
as saying that long-term interest rates are rising. The US long Treasury
bond yield has climbed back above 6.9 per cent, having twice been down to
6.7 per cent earlier in the year. In the UK, five-year gilt yields, in the
wake of this week's slightly disappointing auction of Pounds 3bn of Treasury
7 1/4 per cent 1998, have climbed by more than half a percentage point since
the middle of March.
The next stage - reached perhaps six months or a year later - is that the
stock market peaks out, too. It has been buoyed up in the meantime by
improving expectations for profits and dividends but, in the end, is
overtaken by rising interest rates.
Elsewhere, the property market is still at this point rising strongly, being
driven mainly by rents or incomes that depend directly on the economic
cycle, which is still in an upward phase. Property does not lead in the way
that securities markets do. You might think that real estate values would be
sensitive to interest rates, but property - both commercial and residential
 -is illiquid, and there can be long lags before buyers and sellers respond
to changing conditions. In bad times, sellers may refuse to deal rather than
accept low prices, so the market could stagnate for extended periods;
securities markets, however, are liquid and are run by market-makers who
adjust almost instantaneously in order to find a new level at which there is
two-way business.
Finally there are the alternative markets which perform late in the cycle,
perhaps because they are fuelled by the cash of entrepreneurs who have
realised their stock market gains. By this time, investors also are looking
for protection from inflation, a reason why gold could start to display a
late-cycle turn of speed, although it has performed dismally since 1979.
The particular feature of the present cycle appears to be that the markets
have become even more international and liquidity-driven. Some of the time
lags have, therefore, disappeared. In the UK, the All-Share index hit its
1993 high (so far) on March 8, the same day the long gilt market hit its
high (and the US long bond hit one of its twin peaks).
Because the steam has gone out of the main securities markets, investors are
casting around for alternatives which have been lagging in the meanwhile,
such as Japanese equities or gold. Although the speculators have been making
a lot of noise, in neither case do the fundamentals look very exciting.
True, different countries are at very different stages of the cycle: the US
is well into an upturn (although the first quarter GNP figures were
sluggish) and the UK clearly is recovering, too, but Germany and France are
still heading into recession. However, the global nature of investment flows
is tending to impose a common pattern on the markets (although the Tokyo
stock market, as always, ploughs its own furrow).
The particularly threatening feature of this economic cycle is the unusually
large element of structural fiscal deficit in countries such as the US, the
UK and Germany. Borrowing programmes that can be financed easily in a
recession may prove very difficult in a more buoyant phase for the economy.
Governments will have a responsibility to reduce their financial demands
quickly, by cutting spending or raising taxes, in response to economic
strength. Otherwise, there will be some kind of crunch, possibly a sudden
one.
The worry is that governments, in fact, respond very slowly. Already, Norman
Lamont's spend-now, tax-later Budget is looking very out of date, and the
complacent UK policy was roundly criticised by the IMF this week. In the US,
also, there is a lack of urgency. Meanwhile, Germany could be approaching a
very tricky phase as a weakening currency forces a reassessment by
foreigners who now hold vast amounts of D-Mark paper.
Essentially, long-term interest rates will have to edge up if all the
government bonds are to be sold. It must then be asked if the deficit-prone
governments are actually beginning to impede economic growth rather than
encourage it. So, we are seeing a subtle change of mood. As the market men
say, sell into strength.

FT  01 MAY 93 / City backs increased powers for police on terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE overwhelming majority of leading City companies and organisations want
greater police powers and formal co-ordination of security arrangements
after the Bishopsgate bombing, according to a poll conducted by MORI for the
Financial Times.
Two-fifths also favour excluding cars from certain City areas which may be
at high risk, at a time when pressure is growing on the government to find
new ways to tighten security to prevent future IRA attacks.
Nearly two-thirds said they would be 'very' or 'fairly likely' to contribute
to increased policing costs related to preventing terrorism, while 31 per
cent agreed businesses in high-risk areas should pay an extra premium for
terrorist cover.
The poll was based on interviews this week with representatives - many with
top executives - of 103 leading City banks, professional firms and
regulators.
Forty-seven per cent said they 'strongly agreed' or 'tended to agree' that
London would lose its position as Europe's premier financial centre if the
bombing campaign continued.
But none of the 12 non-UK banks questioned said it was likely to reduce
operations in London because of the risk of further bombs. Two said it was
'not very likely' and 10 'not at all likely'.
Mr Paul Downes, deputy chief executive of Georgeson, a public relations
company, said: 'I don't think anybody is going to be put off for ever. It is
not going suddenly to cause them to switch location. But it makes people
nervous.' Thirty-nine per cent of the organisations surveyed were damaged by
the blast, with 15 per cent describing the effect as 'substantial'.
More than a quarter said that some employees were not able to work on the
Monday after the Saturday bombing. Fifteen per cent said none of their
workforce was able to work even by Wednesday.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Brussels plan to speed E Europe ties with EC: Tariff
barriers to be eased sooner than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has endorsed a substantial package of measures to
accelerate the political and economic integration of six former communist
countries in eastern Europe into the EC.
The package includes faster-than-expected dismantling of tariff barriers in
footwear, steel, textiles, cars and other industrial goods, and a new plan
for the Commission to tap funds from the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development to finance road building, telecommunications and other
infrastructure in the east.
The Commission's support for trade liberalisation has already caused
misgivings in Brussels and could arouse strong opposition among some of the
EC's member states worried about increased imports in a deep recession.
The package covers Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria
and Romania. All have 'association agreements' with the EC which offer
preferential treatment but still fall well short of the benefits of EC
membership.
The chief elements of the package reflect a new alliance between Sir Leon
Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, and Mr Hans van
den Broek, EC commissioner for external political relations. A senior
Brussels official said the two men had ended their early rivalry and now
championed the cause of freer trade.
The package includes:
Removing all tariffs for industrial goods such as cars and chemicals by the
end of 1994. This cuts an earlier five-year transition period to three
years.
Reducing the period for phasing out tariffs in 'sensitive sectors' such as
textiles and steel from five to four years. This means a cut of 20 per cent
each year, with a 40 per cent reduction in the fourth year.
Increasing quotas and ceilings from 20 per cent to 25 per cent for sensitive
goods - so-called because of the east Europeans' competitive advantage.
Advancing plans to increase exports of meat, fruit, dairy goods and
vegetables from eastern European countries by 10 per cent annually for five
years. The plan has been brought forward by six months to begin this July.
Moving from a quota-based system which sets rigid targets for imports into
less restrictive 'ceilings'. This means east European exporters will not
automatically face higher tariffs if they exceed their import targets, a
senior EC official said.
The Commission paper fails to set a firm date for starting EC membership
negotiations, but it offers all six countries that have association
agreements with the EC a 'clear commitment to eventual membership'.
The third proposal is to allow the Commission's chief east European aid unit
 -Phare - to gain access to funds from the European Investment Bank and the
EBRD.
Officials hope for final agreement on the programme at the EC summit in
Copenhagen next month.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Matsushita ends electronics partnership with Philips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA Electrical Industrial is to spend Y185bn (Pounds 1.09bn) to buy
out Philips of the Netherlands from their loss-making joint venture in
semiconductors. The deal will end one of the most enduring partnerships in
electronics between a Japanese and European company.
For Philips, the divestment of its 35 per cent stake in the joint venture,
Matsushita Electronics Corporation, is a significant step forward in efforts
to cut its debts of Fl 15bn (Pounds 5.40bn).
Matsushita - the world's largest consumer electronics company which only two
and a half years ago paid Dollars 6.1bn (Pounds 3.96bn) for MCA, the
Hollywood film company - plans to pay for the transaction by the end of this
month by drawing on retained earnings.
Philips has repeatedly said it would not sell entire divisions or reduce its
80 per cent stake in PolyGram, the London-based music company, as a quick
way of easing its debt burden. The MEC sale will meet the key goal of debt
reduction without reneging on previous promises or weakening the company's
overall position in semiconductors and components.
The sale follows months of haggling over the price after Philips first
approached Matsushita last autumn. Matsushita said the partners had decided
to break up the joint venture because its operations had become too large
and complex and its decision-making too cumbersome.
Matsushita executives said MEC's expansion into semiconductor markets
outside Japan had brought the joint venture into increasing conflict with
Philips' own semiconductor business.
MEC employs 18,000 of its 22,000 total workforce in Japan. It manufactures
semiconductors in Japan, the US and Singapore and cathode ray tubes in the
US, Malaysia and China. Philips will not say how large a book profit the
transaction will yield. The company will hold a press conference on
Wednesday to announce first-quarter results.
MEC, which is valued at Y528.5bn by the sale, is the world's 10th largest
semiconductor manufacturer. It will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Matsushita, its main customer for semiconductors. According to Dataquest,
the research group, MEC had semiconductor sales worth Dollars 1.93bn last
year.
The joint venture was set up in 1952, with Matsushita keen to gain access to
Philips' innovative technology and Philips aspiring to break into the
Japanese market.
Like Philips, Matsushita's finances are under severe strain. It is being
hard hit by the slump in Japanese consumer spending and carries a heavy
depreciation charge for past acquisitions.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Record fine for insurer over sales of pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INTERLIFE Assurance has been fined a record Pounds 160,000 by Lautro, the UK
insurance industry's self-regulatory body, for persuading possibly hundreds
of nurses to leave their employer's pension scheme and buy less attractive
personal pensions.
Interlife, controlled by several continental European insurance companies,
was also selling long-term endowment policies and whole-of-life policies -
which do not pay off until the policy-holder dies - to young student nurses
on low incomes.
Lautro said Interlife's sales agents misled the nurses about the surrender
terms of the endowment policies, which heavily penalise those who cancel
them in the early years.
The number of policy-holders who can expect compensation has not yet been
determined, but 70 to 80 complaints were found in the company's own files
alone.
Lautro said the fine was the largest it had ever imposed. It might have been
higher if regulators had not been concerned that Interlife could have become
insolvent after victims had been compensated, according to Lautro.
Mr Sid Payne, Interlife's finance director, said a preliminary agreement to
sell the company had been reached and wassubject to approval from the
Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Boris Sackville, chief executive, had
recently resigned, he said. Between them, the two men own 3.8 per cent of
Interlife's shares.
Its corporate shareholders are Athens-based Europolitan Investment
Corporation (35 per cent), Sweden's Trygg-Hansa Life (20) Interamerican
Group Athens (14), Interamerican Bermuda (15.2), and Germany's Aachener Re
(12).
Interlife sold largely through a single 'tied agency' sales force based in
the Manchester area and targeted nurses and student nurses, visiting them in
their residence halls despite specific instructions from hospital
authorities not to do so. When complaints were made to the company about its
sales agents, it did not investigate them.
The tied agent employed up to 20 agents at a time, sending them into
hospitals and residences in teams of eight. Mr Payne said Interlife was no
longer using the tied agent and its business had fallen sharply.

had fallen sharply.
Lautro found breaches of 13 of its rules in a visit in June 1990 and found
15 more breaches in a follow-up visit less than two years later.
Complaints were made to Lautro after the nurses brought the matter to the
attention of the National Health Service Pension Scheme. The scheme, under
which employees contribute 6 per cent of their salaries, pays benefits based
on a percentage of final salary and guarantees annual increases in line with
inflation.

The stock exchange's clampdown on grey market dealing in Zeneca ahead of
demerger is a triumph of heavy-handed regulation. Given the analytical
effort expended by the City and the publication of a pathfinder prospectus,
Salomon Brothers' market was better informed than most official dealings.
Members of the rights issue syndicate could not freely participate. But
shutting out those with a vested interest in the issue might actually have
contributed to a fair price. One can only hope the exchange's promised
review of grey market practice results in some more liberal guidelines.

<TEXT>
One might have expected lower German interest rates to be a tonic for the
bond market. As rates have fallen elsewhere, money has moved out along the
yield curve in search of capital appreciation and higher yields. That German
bonds instead became unsettled this week is food for thought. The
Bundesbank, which regards long-term yields as an indicator of inflationary
expectations, is on difficult ground, especially when the weakening economy
has driven it to accelerate rate cuts although inflation is still over 4 per
cent.
Part of the bond market's behaviour is the old story of selling on the good
news. The Spanish peseta aside, calm has returned to the ERM. So there may
be greater opportunities in other European markets where rates are also
falling. The effect of such outflows on the D-Mark has so far been masked by
poor US economic data which have weakened the dollar.
Still, the anxiety of the Bundesbank's Mr Helmut Schlesinger is
understandable. One of the bank's tasks is to create an environment in which
the large budget deficits arising out of unification can be financed. It
will not help if the monetary squeeze intensifies the recession, making the
deficits even larger after the UK fashion. That is a powerful argument for
lower rates. But if the bank remains serious about inflation, it cannot
afford to see the exchange markets lose confidence in the D-Mark. The fall
in German rates may not be quite so smooth after all.

FT  01 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Philips/Matsushita
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the oddest thing about Matsushita's deal with Philips is the
reluctance of either company to talk about it. On the face of it,
Matsushita's offer of Y185bn for Philips' stake in their MEC joint venture
looks excessive. Conspiracy theorists will doubtless conclude that there is
hidden value for Matsushita. If so, it is hard to see what it is. Since
Matsushita is MEC's main customer, full control may allow it to rationalise
its component supplies. Matsushita is also more likely to avoid
protectionist pressure in European consumer electronics if indigenous
manufacturers such as Philips prosper. They, after all, have the ear of the
Commission in Brussels. All that, however, is pretty small beer.
What is clearer is the benefit to Philips. Borrowings will fall from Fl15bn
to Fl12bn and gearing will be cut to 110 per cent. The medical and
telecommunications businesses might also be usefully sold and the company
has plenty of surplus property now that it has slashed its headcount. That
would allow it greater flexibility to invest in its mainstream consumer
electronics side, though Philips has yet to prove that such manufacturing
has a long-term future in high-cost Europe. But the PolyGram stake is
unlikely to go. With the links between such intellectual property and
hardware growing, Philips would be mortgaging any hope of a high margin
future in home entertainment if it sold the only jewel in its tarnished
crown.

FT  01 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: RMC Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a lot of common sense behind RMC's decision to merge its Berlin
associate with its main German operation. It can now make full use of
accelerated depreciation allowances on east German investment, saving
perhaps Pounds 100m in tax over the next four years. The cash flow benefit
is significant: whether it justifies yesterday's 5 per cent jump in the
share price is another matter.
RMC's tax charge will come down just as Redland's is going up, but earnings
derived from temporary tax concessions are of poor quality. The
traditionally conservative RMC will probably smooth the effect on the bottom
line with deferred tax provisions. Still, it will need strong markets to
sustain earnings after the allowances end in 1995. A pointer will be whether
this month's UK price increases stick. The prospective multiple some 40 per
cent above the average assumes a strong recovery - well before it is set in
concrete.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rising gold price has not been good for equities. In theory, that should
not be the case since both are a hedge against inflation. But the equity
market has also to contend with the fear that rising prices would push
interest rates up again. High multiples which have been justified on the
basis that low inflationary growth produces high quality earnings would look
less acceptable if inflation returned. Such fears, though, would make sense
only if the higher gold price really was a signal of a return to the
inflationary psychology of the 1970s. By yesterday, a recovering London
market rightly appears to have decided otherwise.
If the FT-SE's reluctance to stick below 2,800 is encouraging, the market
still seems stuck in a narrow range. There is no immediate prospect of a
further cut in base rates. Institutional liquidity is tight, the Zeneca and
BT issues loom, and the government cannot yet feel confident about its
ability to fund the PSBR at current gilt yields. That could cause problems
for the equity market. There is probably enough evidence of recovery to
justify a forward multiple around 14. But the limited prospects for dividend
growth would leave a market yield of less than 4 per cent looking niggardly
if gilt prices fell sharply.
The market is below this year's starting level and the economic background
has improved but, until the funding position looks more comfortable, there
is nothing to drive it higher. It is not surprising, then, that dealers are
so susceptible to stories - about the gold price, for example, or
multi-billion pound bids for biscuit companies.

FT  01 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips lower after late
program selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER HOLDING firm in positive territory for most of the day, a late round
of program selling left blue chip stocks slightly lower at the close, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.43 at 3,427.55,
well below its peak of 3,446.19. Other indices fared better. The more
broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 1.30 higher at 440.19, the Amex
composite finished up 2.21 at 420.96, and the Nasdaq composite rose 2.97 to
661.42. Volume on the NYSE was 240m shares, and rises outpaced declines by
1,205 to 669.
Thursday's late rally, when prices recovered from early losses to end
broadly higher, set the tone for a confident start to trading. Within
minutes of the opening, the Dow was up almost 15 points as buying followed
through from the end of the previous session.
Dealers said that buying was a mixture of computer program trading, and some
end-of-month acquisitions by big institutions. Sentiment was also buoyed by
news that flows of investors' cash into stock mutual funds had reached
record levels in March and the first quarter, and by an early decline in
bond yields. Bond yields, however, later reversed direction, and combined
with a rush of late sell programs to leave Dow stocks with modest declines
at the end of trading. Economic news was mostly ignored because of the
conflicting nature of the reports. Personal income rose 0.6 per cent in
March, but personal spending fell 0.2 per cent and factory orders dropped
1.5 per cent, also last month.
Interest in cyclical stocks revived, in spite of recent poor economic news.
Allied Signal rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 65 1/4 , International Paper
added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 65 3/4 , and Caterpillar rose Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 69 1/4 .
Bethlehem Steel rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 19 5/8 in volume of almost 1m
shares after the company said it would raise prices on steel plate products
on July 4 by Dollars 10 to Dollars 20 a ton. Aetna jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to
Dollars 52 7/8 after the life and casualty insurer announced first quarter
net income of Dollars 166.3m, well up on the Dollars 118.7m earned in the
same period a year ago.
Eastman Kodak rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 48 3/4 on reports that the
company plans to sell a major asset to improve shareholder value. Genentech
climbed Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 37 1/2 on the news that the company's
blood-clot dissolving agent, Activase, had better results in preventing
heart attack deaths than a rival product. On the Nasdaq market Lin
Broadcasting rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 89 after a ratings upgrade from
Prudential Securities.
Canada
TORONTO STOCKS extended their winning steak to four sessions, closing higher
in moderately active trading. Based on preliminary data, the 300 composite
index was up 34.35 points, or 0.91 per cent, to 3,789.41, with advances
leading declines 460 to 270.
PWA Corp. reported increased losses in the first quarter but said it has
resumed making payments to its creditors as of today. PWA rose CDollars 0.03
to CDollars 0.53.

FT  01 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan cast adrift by political
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH a cut in German short end rates yesterday the expectation is for a
further easing in European interest rates next week, writes Our Markets
Staff. Amsterdam was closed for a public holiday.
MILAN went on a rollercoaster ride as the spectre of political instability
returned to haunt the market. Private domestic investors began the day with
a sell-off of blue chips which left the broad market about 5 per cent lower.
But around lunchtime institutional investors returned as buyers and prices
recovered some of the lost ground. The Comit index ended 12.83 or 2.4 per
cent lower at 526.30, down 1 per cent on the week. Trading was extended on
the screen-based telematic system to cope with the unusually high turnover.
An analyst at Intersim in Milan said: 'After the early sell-off,
institutions - both foreign and domestic - could not believe their luck that
they were able to buy at the lower levels.
'The situation in the later part of the day changed dramatically from the
emotions that were seen earlier as a more rational attitude appeared. If,
over the weekend, the political situation can be put in order, I think that
we could see the index resuming its upward trend on Monday.'
Mr John Stewart of Pastorino in Milan said: 'It was a remarkable turnaround
after the early panic. This is a volatile situation but I believe the
financial markets had already discounted the likelihood of political
problems along the way for Mr Ciampi.'
Among the blue chips, Fiat fell L292 or 4.2 per cent to fix at L6,557 but
picked up to L6,720 after-hours.
BCI which was marked 5.8 per cent down early in the day recovered to end L46
lower at L4,938 with 5 1/2 m shares traded. Generali, down 4.5 per cent at
an early L35,800, picked up to fix at L36,500 before L37,000 after hours.
Olivetti bucked the weak market on Thursday's news that Digital Equipment
was bringing forward its purchase of a 4 per cent stake and was underwriting
part of Olivetti's rights issue.
Montedison added L28 to fix at L1,178 before L1,188 after hours as the EC
approved the sale of its pharmaceutical division to Procordia.
PARIS suffered a temporary breakdown in its bourse computer as turnover
swelled to a record FFr5.2bn on expiration of futures and options contracts.
The CAC-40 index ended 18.48 higher at 1,939.03, a gain of 1.2 per cent on
the week. The market is now looking ahead to next Wednesday when Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur is due to reveal his budget proposals.
Michelin lost 6 per cent as the shares dipped FFr9.10 to FFr143.50 on
expectations of heavy losses in 1993.
Euro Disney, FFr2.10 ahead at FFr73.50, picked up some of the ground lost
earlier in the week on the appointment of a new chief financial officer.
Among financials switching was noted out of CCF, down FFr7.80 to FFr236.20,
and into SocGen, up FFr17 at FFr619.
FRANKFURT closed higher for the first time since April 19 on short covering
and light bargain hunting. The DAX index rose 3.25 to 1,627.19, down 1.8 per
cent on the week.
Bayerische Vereinsbank, which announced a 4.4 per cent rise in first quarter
operating profits, gained DM7 to DM444 while Lufthansa rose DM2.3 to DM106.8
on rumours of a tie-up with American Airlines.
STOCKHOLM firmed in thin trading due to the half-day holiday session. The
Affarsvarlden index gained 7 to 1,030.5 up 0.3 per cent on the week in
turnover of SKr572m. SE-Banken closed up SKr2.5 at SKr12. Mr David Longmuir
at James Capel said that some investors were switching from other bank
stocks which had advanced earlier in the week, but the issue could see
profit taking in the near future.
HELSINKI continued its rally on lower money market rates and reports of an
ore mine discovery in northern Finland. The HEX index rose 14 to 1,187.1,
adding 6.1 per cent from the previous week. OSLO was also strong on a spate
of earnings announcements. The All share index advanced 5.45 to a high for
the year of 477.29, up 5.6 per cent on the week.

FT  01 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Singapore equities burst into activity
 -Excess liquidity has been driving the market higher recently
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At last Singapore's brokers have something to get excited about. For much of
the past year the equity market has been in the doldrums, overshadowed by
the more spirited performances of markets elsewhere in the region,
particularly those of Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur.
But not any more. Singapore has burst into life, with the local Straits
Times Industrials Index rising about 40 per cent since last October.
Earlier this week the index hit an all time high of 1,797 - up from around
the 1,500 mark at the beginning of the year and 1,300 in the middle of 1992.
Since then the index has eased, closing yesterday at 1,783 for a gain of 0.6
per cent on the week.
The recent spurt was initially prompted by heady activity in nearby Kuala
Lumpur, with Malaysia related stocks accounting for the bulk of
transactions.
But in the last few days Singapore companies have been leading the charge.
Sembawang and Keppel, two of Singapore's biggest shipyards, have been riding
high. So have the local banks and companies in the property sector.
Good economic fundamentals are partly behind the new found market optimism.
Last year the economy grew by 5.8 per cent and official GDP growth
projections for this year are conservatively put at between 6 and 7 per
cent.
Singapore's all-important export sector is also performing exceptionally
well. Government figures released this week indicate that first quarter
non-oil exports were up 20 per cent on the equivalent period last year.
Market sentiment is tending to reflect broader regional trends. For
instance, the rally in Hong Kong, due to the resumption of talks with China,
has buoyed up the Singapore market.
But the main factor behind the rise is an excess of liquidity. Both
corporate and personal taxes were cut in a budget earlier this year. The
government is actively encouraging wider share ownership, allowing larger
portions of the Citizens Provident Fund, a mandatory savings scheme, to be
invested in stocks.
'It's the sheer weight of money available in Singapore that is driving the
market up,' says Mr Tom Inglis of Peregrine Securities.
'Bank deposit rates are only 1.5 per cent. People can go and buy a house,
but they are very expensive. Instead they are putting their money into the
market.'
Now about 15 per cent of Singaporeans own shares. The government wants to
bring that up to around 30 per cent - in part to counter criticisms that the
island republic's wealth is not being adequately spread among the
population.
A number of partial privatisations of big state controlled companies will
add much needed depth to the market. There have also been a number of new
listings, most of them massively oversubscribed. The floatation of Singapore
Telecom (ST), the state owned telecommunications and postal service, likely
in August or September, is being billed as the largest public listing yet in
the region.
Brokers say that the market will probably value ST at SDollars 10bn-SDollars
15bn (Dollars 6.2bn-Dollars 9.4bn). About 25 per cent of ST is likely to be
floated, with some 15 per cent available to foreigners. It's estimated that
the floatation will add about 15 per cent to total market capitalisation.
Brokers say that foreign fund managers are showing renewed interest in
Singapore in the run up to this flotation. The government has already said
that it plans further sell-offs of state enterprises, including stakes in
the Port of Singapore Authority and the electricity and gas divisions of the
public utilities board.
Some companies are rushing to the market in advance of the ST floatation.
Keppel Bank, part of the Keppel conglomerate, is likely to be listed next
month and listed companies are tapping the market for more funds.
Analysts say that even with the ST floatation and other company listings
there is no sign of market liquidity drying up.
'Plenty of money, particularly local, is still going into the market,' says
one broker. 'Some shares are overvalued but there's little sign that people
are backing off. Right now there might not be many bargains in Singapore but
long term it's still one of the best bets in the region.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo climbs 2.2 per
cent to a new high for the year

EQUITIES climbed 2.2 per cent to a new 1993 high amid foreign exchange rate
stability following the G7 accord in Washington, writes Wayne Aponte in
Tokyo.
The market was closed on Thursday for a national holiday.
The Nikkei average gained 464.61 to 20,919.18, up 6.7 per cent on the week,
after opening at a low of 20,502.06. The Topix Index of all first section
issues rose 28.03 at 1,620,79 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose
2.14 to 1,282.87.
Volume was estimated at 650m shares. Advancing issues outpaced declining
ones by 967 to 132, with 78 unchanged.
Brokers said that the Nikkei had been expected to decline yesterday on
profit-taking before next week's Golden Week holiday. The market will
re-open next Thursday. However, heavy buy orders from foreign investors
offset the day's selling pressure and generated a broader rally.
But one broker at a Japanese securities house said hopes that the Nikkei
average would trade higher after the holiday , based on historical chart
movements, fuelled most of the session's gains.
Nippon Oil, the day's most active issue, moved Y53 higher to Y854 in
reaction to the G7 news to limit the yen's advance against the dollar.
Telecommunications equipment manufacturers also gained ground, with Fujitsu
up Y39 at Y800 and Mitsubishi Electric rising Y26 to Y629.
Computer software companies advanced on reports that Sumitomo Bank intends
to upgrade its on-line system and speculation that other national banks may
follow. CSK, the largest software developing company, gained Y250 at Y3,320
and Ines, a major data service company, rose Y150 to Y1,520. In Osaka, the
OSE average ended 343.85 higher at 22,628.08, in volume of 39.3m shares.
Roundup
THERE were mixed performances yesterday.
MANILA closed at a record high, although investors took some of the profits
made during the week. The composite index rose 9.74 to 1,604.33, 5.7 per
cent higher on the week.
Analysts say that excess cash in the system has been driving the market,
boosting not only blue chips but also second liners.
TAIWAN finished off its highs as profit-taking emerged in late trading. The
weighted index, which gained more than 90 points at one stage, ended 36.05
higher at 4,563.52, little changed on the week, in turnover that rose to
TDollars 38.7bn.
Reports that Washington would place Taiwan on a 'priority watch' list of
unfair traders, instead of the more serious 'priority country' list helped
the market's mood.
BANGKOK edged up from the day's worst levels in the last few minutes of
trade but still closed at the year's low.
Sales of shares in finance and securities firms left the SET index almost 12
points lower at one stage. However, the index pulled up to finish a net 4.28
easier at 845.29 or 6.2 per cent lower on the week in turnover of Bt3.3bn.
It was the fifth day straight day of losses.
KUALA LUMPUR saw further strength on demand for issues linked to the Morgan
Stanley Capital International index. The composite index rose 14.61 to a new
high of 719.61, up 4 per cent from the previous week. Volume rose to 548.1m
shares.
AUSTRALIA edged up on cautious trading, but turnover surged on options
related trading. The All Ordinaries index advanced 1.2 to 1,681.5, but lost
1.2 per cent on the week. Turnover totaled ADollars 914.8m as investors
exercised options on Westpac Banking and Broken Hill Property shares. Gold
stocks regained strength, with Plutonic Resources, which announced a gold
discovery this week, rising 78 cents to ADollars 4.50.
HONG KONG eased on profit taking with the Hang Seng index closing down 53.54
at 6,830.51, 1.1 per cent higher on the week. Turnover was HKDollars 4.3bn.
Issues which had shown strong performance recently met heavy selling: Hang
Seng Bank lost HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 57.
SEOUL retreated as profit-taking overwhelmed late buying by institutional
investors. The composite index fell 3.19 to 721.57, losing 1.9 per cent from
the previous week.
NEW ZEALAND turned back after Thursday's peak in volume that fell to around
half that of the last few days. The NZSE-40 index fell 16.13 to 1,611.74,
little changed on the week.
Analysts suggested that some investors may have taken fright at news that
Chile's Copec, which is 30 per cent owned by Carter Holt Harvey, may report
a first quarter net profit fall of some 50 per cent. CHH ended 7 cents down
at NZDollars 3.07.
BOMBAY fell on the release of some disappointing company reports. The BSE
index lost 21.97 to 2,122.30.
JAKARTA was higher on domestic buying concentrated on companies which have
reported a sharp rise in net profit and have sound fundamentals. The
official index rose 0.88 to 314.10, barely changed on the week.
Jakarta International Hotel, which reported a 115 per cent rise in net
profit, moved up Rp550 to Rp8,050. In spite of a a 61.2 per cent decline in
net profit, Astra International gained Rp200 to Rp11,900.

Building specialists gave an immediate thumbs up to the merger of RMC's two
German operations, Readymix AG and Readymix Berlin, which they said would
give a substantial boost to the company's earnings, cash flow and costs in
that country. A series of broker upgrades are said to be in the pipeline.
RMC shares spearheaded a general surge in the building materials sector,
closing 34 stronger at 675p, the highest level since September 1991, albeit
on disappointing turnover of only 1.5m shares.
Redland, also heavily involved in the building materials market in Germany,
lifted 13 to 445p.

FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI bucks end of grey trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US BUYING gave a lift to ICI although liquidity was cut back after the Stock
Exchange stamped on the recently introduced 'grey' market in the shares of
the soon to be demerged company.
There were suggestions that complaints might have been lodged by other
leading securities houses. Salomon Brothers which had been making an
unofficial market in ICI 'new' shares and in Zeneca, the bioscience arm,
bowed to Exchange pressure yesterday and pulled out, at least until May 12
when the anticipated Pounds 1.3bn rights issue will be priced. The final
grey-market price for Zeneca was 690p and for ICI ex the demerger was 590p.
All trades done since Salomon opened the market on Tuesday will be honoured.
The underlying shares, which shot up on Thursday following higher than
expected first-quarter results, added a further 11 to close at 1289p, their
highest level since June last year. However, one cynical analysts argued:
'The chickens are going to come home to roost after the demerger.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WELCOME, if possibly technical, bounce in stock index futures yesterday
restored the June contract on the FT-SE Index to a premium against cash and
encouraged a recovery across the range of the underlying equity market,
reports Terry Byland. Local traders were active buyers of the contract but
there were some large investment buyers.
For most of the session, the Footsie contract traded at a premium of several
points to cash, although not to the Fair Value which is currently worth
around 7 points. At the official close, the contract was almost at Fair
Value. Trading volume was well down, however, at just over 7,000 contracts.
Strategists warned that yesterday's recovery was a technical response to the
absence of the feared US sellers. The contract could be tested if it
approaches the 2,828 area next week.
Sharply lower trade in the FT-SE contract reduced overall activity in traded
options to 26,640 from Thursday's 47,286. Lonrho headed the actives list
with 2,573 contracts.

FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index regains the 2,800 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEAR PRESSURES on the UK stock market relaxed yesterday and share prices
staged a spirited recovery, comfortably regaining the 2,800 mark ahead of
the extended weekend break. With both government bonds and stock index
futures in better heart, the FT-SE Index regained 26 points of the week's
loss, encouraged by renewed buying of the retail and consumer sectors still
seen as immediate beneficiaries from economic recovery.
Trading volume, sluggish at first, took in some small trading programmes and
was boosted in late dealing when Wall Street opened the new session with a
gain of 13 points on the Dow Industrial Average.
The London market closed at the best of the day with the FT-SE Index up 26.3
at 2,813.1. Yesterday's recovery reduced the week's fall on the Footsie to
29.9 points, or around 1 per cent.
The focus put on the blue chips this week by selling pressure from stock
index futures has been was reflected in a relatively better performance by
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which climbed by 21.7 to 3,132.1 yesterday.
The Mid 250 Index has lost only a few points this week and remains well
within 1 per cent of the all-time peak reached on March 19.
While the cut in bill rates by the Bundesbank was seen as no more than a
technical adjustment, this fresh evidence of the downward drift in rates in
continental Europe encouraged what was at first a slow recovery in UK
government bonds.
By the close of trading, long-dated UK gilts were ahead by around 11/32 .
Index-linked government issues, the bond market's inflation-hedged
securities, eased by about  1/4 of a point.
The day's Seaq total of 526.1m shares finally measured well against
Thursday's 542.1m, which was worth Pounds 1.14bn in retail business.
Non-Seaq business returned to more average daily volume, making up some 62
per cent of yesterday's business.
Market traders said that the market appeared to have returned to calmer
waters after the stormy sessions seen at the beginning of the week, and
hoped that this week's setback was nothing more than an expected shakeout
inside an established trading range.
However, investors still appeared to be avoiding the overseas earning stocks
yesterday as sterling remained firm, and there were doubts overhanging
prospects for Wall Street.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Money Markets: T-Bill rate cut again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK yesterday triggered speculation that it would ease its
official interest rates again in the next few weeks, by cutting its 3-day
Treasury Bill rate by 50 basis points to 7.00 per cent, writes James Blitz.
The provision of 3-day Treasury bills to the money market provides the
Bundesbank with a method of mopping up excess liquidity.
Some analysts see these bills as a relatively unimportant instrument for the
conduct of monetary policy compared to the Lombard and discount rates.
However, Mr Jonathan Hoffman of Credit Suisse First Boston, believes that
this latest cut, which brings the T-Bill rate 50 basis points below the
discount rate, is an important signal that the Bundesbank wants to ease
policy again.
In his view, commercial banks will be more willing to lend money to the
Bundesbank at the lower T-Bill rate because of the value of the Bundesbank
as an interbank counterparty. This, in turn, should soften German call
money, which is currently at 7.71 per cent, bringing pressure on the
discount rate floor, at 7.5 per cent.
Mr Hoffman also believes that the last cut in the T-Bill rate, in the last
week of March, was an important precursor to the cuts in the other official
rates which came last month.
The Bundesbank's move had less effect in German and French futures market
than in the foreign exchanges. The June Euromark contract had a 9 basis
point rise to close at 92.75, but dealers said this was a technical response
to the rather heavy sell off of recent days.
French franc futures were also stronger, helped by the Euromark rise and the
franc's strength on the currency markets in recent days. The June French
franc contract closed at 92.35, 6 basis points up on the day. The French
franc closed at FFr3.370, slightly weaker than its previous close of
FFr3.369.
Short dated interest rates in the sterling market were firmer after the Bank
of England forecast a large shortage of Pounds 1.85bn at the start of its
operations. The Bank of England did not operate in the market in the morning
and the overnight lending rate peaked at 7.25 per cent.
In these conditions, 3-month sterling cash rose  1/16 per cent on the day,
closing at 6 1/8 per cent.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar buoyed by T-Bill cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR was trapped in a tight range against the D-Mark yesterday, buoyed
by another indication that the Bundesbank is cutting rates but depressed by
more poor news on the US economy, writes James Blitz.
The dollar rose by around a pfennig in the European afternoon, peaking at
DM1.5905, after the Bundesbank cut its 3-day Treasury Bill rate by 50 basis
points to 7 per cent.
Changes in the Treasury bill rate, which the Bundesbank uses to mop up
excess money market liquidity, tend to be a lagging indicator of its
monetary policy.
However, yesterday's cut brought the T-Bill rate some 50 basis points below
the discount rate floor of 7.50 per cent, raising speculation that the
general structure of German rates could soon be lowered again.
Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Global Markets, pointed out
that this was the first time the rate had ever been below the discount rate
which sets the floor for all money market rates.
'Why should the Bundesbank take the T-Bills to a meaninglesly low rate
unless they intend to give the message that it won't be meaningless for long
?' she asked.
However, the dollar failed to make any further ground in an afternoon which
saw more indications that the US economy is growing only slowly.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, said
yesterday's figure for personal consumption, showing a decline of 0.2 per
cent in March against expectations of a 0.1 per cent drop, was a
particularly worrying sign for the US economy.
In his view, the first quarter GDP figure, which earlier this week showed
annualised growth of 1.8 per cent, will be revised down on May 29. This
week's figure for M2 money supply, showing a net drop of Dollars 9.4bn, also
underlines that bullish US growth forecasts may need to be revised. The
dollar closed in London yesterday at DM1.5880, up from a previous DM1.5815.
The US currency checked its decline against the yen in Friday's Tokyo
trading, following the conclusion of the G7 finance ministers meeting in
Washington.
The dollar had weakened to around Y111.25 in Tokyo as dealers took the view
that there was no commitment in the G7 communique to halt the yen's recent
rise. The dollar closed at Y111.2 in London.
Sterling closed  3/4 of a pfennig up on the day against the D-Mark, at
DM2.4925, following the change in German rates. However, with no important
UK indicators due next week, the currency is unlilkely to break through the
DM2.50 level in the next few days.

<TEXT>
SHARES in Genentech, the Swiss-controlled and California-based biotechnology
company, jumped by 16 per cent yesterday to Dollars 37 7/8 after an
independent medical study concluded that the company's Activase heart attack
drug was more effective than others.
Genentech had financed most of the Dollars 55m study, known as Gusto. It was
one of the largest clinical trials of heart attack patients ever undertaken
and involved 41,000 patients in the US and 15 other countries.
The company's sales of Activase had dropped considerably in 1992 following
an Oxford University study called Isis-3 that questioned the effectiveness
of Activase.
A RIVAL antidepressant to Prozac, the leading antidepressant drug, may soon
be available in the US following yesterday's decision by an advisory panel
to the Food and Drug Administration to recommend Effexor, writes Karen
Zagor.
The new drug, made by a unit of American Home Products, was described as
effective for patients who have never been treated for depression and for
those who do not respond well to their current medication. The most common
side effects are nausea, drowsiness and dizziness.
Although decisions by the advisory panel are not binding, the FDA generally
rules in favour of drugs which are recommended for marketing.
Prozac has been under steady pressure in recent years. The Church of
Scientology has waged a campaign against the drug claiming it makes people
suicidal.
More recently, Pfizer's Zoloft has proved tough competition, and SmithKline
Beecham's recently-launched Paxil has now entered the fray.

<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, the troubled leisure group which earlier this week announced
heavy interim losses and plans to raise new capital, has appointed Mr
Michael Montgomery, an executive with Walt Disney, its parent company, as
chief financial officer.
Mr Montgomery's appointment is the latest in a series of senior management
changes at Euro Disney in the year since the opening of its EuroDisneyland
theme park outside Paris.
He succeeds Mr John Forsgren, who becomes vice-chairman. Euro Disney said
the change was 'purely routine' and stressed that Mr Forsgren was being
promoted to his new role, where he will be responsible for the group's
relations with the financial and political communities.
However, Mr Montgomery, formerly treasurer of Walt Disney, which owns 49 per
cent of Euro Disney, will take responsibility for financial operations.
Both he and Mr Forsgren will report to Mr Philippe Bourguignon, who last
year took over as Euro Disney's chairman.

FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: GM rejects request for recall of
pick-up trucks

GENERAL MOTORS yesterday rejected the US government's recent request that
the vehicle manufacturer recall 4.7m pick-up trucks because of concerns
about possible design flaws.
As part of a vigorous defence of its safety record, GM argued that its
trucks performed within federal safety requirements when tested recently by
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Last month, the NHTSA asked the government to request the trucks' recall
because it believed the placing of the fuel tanks outside the vehicles'
frames made them more prone to fire risk in a collision.
GM, however, said that the NHTSA judged the GM trucks unsafe compared to
other manufacturers' trucks because it applied safety standards beyond those
normally set by the government.
The company also said the NHTSA ignored safety data compiled by state
authorities which showed that its trucks were as safe, or safer than, other
similar models.

FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: L170bn sale ends Pirelli
disposal programme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, has completed its wide-ranging
asset disposal programme with the L170bn (Dollars 115m) sale of its power
transmission unit to Mark IV Industries of the US.
Pirelli started selling the seven business units in its diversified products
division in early 1992, after its aborted takeover of Continental, its
bigger German rival, left it facing heavy losses. Pirelli said the disposals
would realise about L1,000bn - a target it claims has been exceeded.
The latest sale, which involves operations in Italy, the US and Spain, as
well as marketing offices in four other countries, will produce an
extraordinary gain of L10bn. The power transmission division produces rubber
belts for a variety of industrial uses. Sales last year amounted to L260bn
and the operation has 1,550 employees.
A final price for the deal will depend on audits under way. However, the
L170bn estimate includes L70bn in debt.
Pirelli expects to complete the transaction by the end of next month.
La Rinascente, the Italian retailing group controlled by Fiat, raised
consolidated sales by 13.5 per cent to L1,617bn in the year to April 29.
Adjusted for closures, the increase amounted to 14.8 per cent, it said.
The group denied negotiations on its sale were under way, in spite of
expressions of interest from other retailers after Mr Giovanni Agnelli,
Fiat's chairman, said Rinascente was no longer a 'strategic' asset.

<TEXT>
BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank yesterday reported that group partial operating
profits - which exclude own-account trading gains - rose 4.4 per cent in the
first three months of the current year to DM386m (Dollars 239.7m), an
increase of DM16m over the comparable period for last year.
Total group profit, including trading gains, increased at a higher rate, the
Bavaria-based bank said, without giving any figure.
Mr Albrecht Schmidt, chief executive, told the annual meeting that
performance in the first quarter was 'satisfactory'. He said that, as
expected, the pace of business growth had slowed during the course of the
current year.
The group balance sheet grew by 3.5 per cent to DM260.5bn. At the parent
company, the balance sheet grew by 2.3 per cent and partial operating
profits climbed by 6.6 per cent to DM255m.
The figures show a slowdown from the record rate of growth enjoyed last
year, when group partial operating profits rose by 24.1 per cent to
DM1.48bn, but suggest that the banking sector is continuing to enjoy a
degree of immunity from the downturn affecting the German economy.
The figures do not include provisions for bad or doubtful debts, which are
struck only after operating profits.

FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Cost control helps Aetna to
exceed expectations
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, one of the biggest US composite insurers, yesterday
reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, due to strong
cost-control efforts which reduced the impact of continuing weakness in its
property-casualty division.
Stripping out discontinued operations and the impact of accounting charges
in the 1992 quarter, Aetna's earnings slipped to Dollars 191.3m in the first
three months of 1993 from Dollars 201.3m last year.
Net income was Dollars 166.3m, or Dollars 1.51 a share, on revenues of
Dollars 4.29bn. A year earlier, the company had net earnings of Dollars
118.7m, or Dollars 1.07, on revenues of Dollars 4.52bn.
Earnings included catastrophe losses of Dollars 31m in the latest quarter,
against Dollars 4m a year ago. Net realised capital gains totalled Dollars
22m, against Dollars 75m a year earlier.
The company increased additions to reserves for troubled mortgage loans and
property losses to Dollars 70m, from Dollars 41m a year earlier. This was
offset by gains of Dollars 94m, largely from the sale of bonds, compared
with Dollars 117m in the 1992 quarter.
Mr Ronald Compton, chairman, said the company continued to be hurt by
adverse conditions in commercial real estate markets.
Operating expenses fell 10 per cent, and earnings benefited from gains in
the group health, individual life and annuities businesses.
Aetna's personal property-casualty business made a loss of Dollars 8m,
compared with earnings of Dollars 14m a year earlier. Although the company
has withdrawn or reduced its exposure to markets in which it could not earn
an acceptable profit, the benefits were partly offset by reduced net
investment income.
Earnings from commercial property-casualty insurance operations slipped to
Dollars 40m from Dollars 46m a year ago, reflecting lower charges for
additions to loss and loss expense reserves for prior accident years, as
well as lower operating expenses.
Financial services income rose to Dollars 31m from Dollars 20m due to
investment gains on futures contracts and strong annuity earnings, which
helped offset weak conditions in commercial real estate markets.
The life and health business made a profit of Dollars 76m compared with
Dollars 70m last year.

FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Santander to reduce its lending
rates on Monday
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Santander, the Spanish bank, yesterday broke with the tight monetary
policies imposed by the Bank of Spain and said it would lower significantly
lending rates on Monday.
The bank said it was cutting its rates on mortgages, consumer credits,
leasing and factoring by between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent, and set its
preferential lending rate at 12 per cent.
The Bank of Spain, which is intent on maintaining the parity value of the
peseta, has kept its benchmark intervention rate firm at 13 per cent,
ignoring interest cuts elsewhere in Europe, and has kept the interbank rate
at about 15 per cent.
'There is a difference between what the Bank of Spain does and what the
market wants,' said Mr Rodrigo Echenique, managing director of the Santander
group. 'The market is clamouring for lowered rates.'
Telefonica, Spain's state-controlled telecommunications company and one of
the most traded stocks on the Madrid stock market, raised its 1993
first-quarter net profits by 15.9 per cent to Pta14bn (Dollars 120.7m).
The depressed economic conditions restricted growth in installed new lines
during the quarter to 1.7 per cent. Operating profit rose by 8.5 per cent to
Pta298.9bn.

FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Citic undaunted by past
blemishes - The chairman of the Chinese investment body talks to Tony Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Wei Mingyi, the new chairman of China International Trust and Investment
Corporation (Citic), has secured one of his country's more sought-after
jobs, but also one of its most testing.
The 68-year-old Mr Wei, elevated last month to the Citic chairmanship,
inherits an increasingly complex international conglomerate with a heavy
debt burden and a far from unblemished record in investing abroad.
Mr Wei seems undaunted, however, and has little thought of slowing Citic's
rapid growth. Rather, he is intent on pushing ahead on several fronts.
'If a company constrains itself by consolidating at a certain level, then I
think that company wouldn't have a future,' he said at Citic's Beijing
headquarters. 'Business is always aggressive: maybe, sometimes you win,
sometimes you fail, but you must be aggressive.'
Mr Wei's philosophy is certainly consistent with the 'go-go' mood of China,
although his remarks are perhaps surprising, considering that he has spent
most of his working life serving communism, much of it in his country's
state-controlled electronics industries. Citic, itself state-owned, could
hardly present a greater contrast to China's lumbering state sector. Founded
in 1979 with capital of Yn30m (Dollars 5m) as a funnel for foreign
investment into China, its global assets total more than Yn50bn, spread
among 29 subsidiaries and affiliates.
Among its more active overseas subsidiaries are Citic Hong Kong (Holdings),
through its listed vehicle Citic Pacific, and Citic Australia. Both have
been on the acquisition and expansion trail recently.
In January, Citic Pacific acquired from its Hong Kong parent a 12 per cent
stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications. Other recent investments include a
controlling share of the Shanghai Children's Food Factory, and substantial
interests in two mainland power projects.
Citic Australia announced in March that it had purchased 10 per cent of
Yaohan International Company, the Japanese retailer. Its main investment is
a Dollars 70m stake in the Portland aluminium smelter in the southern
Australian state of Victoria. It is also planning a stake in the Australian
coal industry, and has linked with Hambros Australia to establish a joint
venture securities firm - the first such investment abroad by a Chinese
company in the financial services sector.
Citic, said Mr Wei, would like to expand further, but is cautious about the
international outlook.
The chairman was probably speaking from chastening experience. Investment in
a pulp and paper mill in Canada's British Columbia has gone sour, due to a
slump in prices; in the US, the 1988 purchase of a Delaware steel mill has
yielded little but heartache.
Mr Wei said 25 per cent of Citic's business interests were overseas, about
half in Asia. Ideally, Citic would like to lift its foreign investments to
50 per cent of the total, but this would require additional substantial
borrowing which the organisation could not afford at this stage.
The chairman estimated liabilities at about Yn40bn, against assets of
Yn50bn. He described the ratio as not satisfactory and indicated that Citic
favoured steps to reduce indebtedness, although prospects for achieving this
do not appear bright in the short-term. Foreign liabilities, including loans
and bonds, are put at Dollars 2.5bn. Last month alone, Citic raised almost
Dollars 200m in separate international bond issues in Japan and Singapore.
Depreciation of the Chinese currency by about 30 per cent against the US
dollar in the past year has not made Citic's task any easier. 'My daily
worry is servicing our loans,' said Mr Wei. 'But we cannot keep our money in
the bank: we have to keep it moving.'
Foreign bankers have occasionally questioned Citic's ability to continue
rapid expansion funded partly by international borrowing - especially as a
sizeable portion of its investments and energies are tied up in low-yielding
or loss-making mainland state enterprises, and in infrastructure projects.
Bankers assume, but do not take for granted, that the state would step in if
required.
Mr Wei said, somewhat ruefully, that in line with state priorities, Citic
was obliged to invest in low-return, long-term projects in energy,
transportation and heavy industry. To balance those investments, Citic was
also engaged in 'quick return' projects in real estate, retailing, tourism
and food processing.
He dated the organisation's drive abroad to the credit squeeze of 1988, when
China clamped down on most business activity. It was then that Citic made
its push into Hong Kong, leading to stakes in Hong Kong Telecom (12 per
cent), Cathay Pacific (12.5 per cent) and Dragonair (46.2 per cent).
One of Citic's features, according to Mr Wei, is the autonomy it gives its
subsidiaries. Larger investment decisions are referred to Beijing, but for
the most part subsidiaries are left alone. They are set targets, and if they
exceed them a percentage of profits is distributed as bonuses.
This approach certainly accords with Mr Wei's business philosophy - with
Chinese characteristics - which he expressed thus: 'A market economy is a
market economy whether socialist or capitalist. We call it socialism because
the capital comes from the the nation and not from private hands.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Gold
leads precious metals surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD MADE further progress towards restoring its tarnished image this week
and dragged other precious metals up with it.
The London bullion market added Dollars 12 to last week's Dollars 5.30 gain
in reaching a nine-month peak of Dollars 356.20 a troy ounce on Thursday.
That was trimmed back to Dollars 355.75 an ounce at yesterday's close but
traders were not dismayed; some attributed the selling to operators who had
come late into the rally, others to Australian producers attracted by the
relatively remunerative prices now available in terms of their national
currency.
The latest upsurge in the gold price has somewhat dubious origins, however,
being the result of a concerted effort by some high-profile international
financiers.
It was revealed last weekend that Mr George Soros, the speculator who netted
Dollars 1bn last September by betting against sterling and the Italian Lira,
had bought Dollars 400m-worth of shares in Newmont Mining, the biggest North
American gold producer. The shares were bought from Lord Rothschild, the UK
investor, and from aptly-named international wheeler-dealer Sir James
Goldsmith. The latter revealed at the same time, moreover, that he had used
the cash to purchase more than Dollars 300m of options to by gold bullion in
the London and New York markets.
The combined news 'had gold bugs coming out of the woodwork left, right and
centre', commented one trader after Monday's Dollars 7.35-an-ounce price
surge.
Successive bouts of profit-taking later in the week did not dent the
market's new-found bullish sentiment and many traders were still talking of
a near-term upside target of Dollars 360 an ounce.
Gold's buoyancy spilled over into other precious metals markets, with
platinum ending the week Dollars 15 to the good at Dollars 386.50 an ounce
and silver up 39 US cents at 435.5 cents an ounce, a 21-month high. The
silver market remained more nervous than gold, traders noted, with wide
price swings possible.
Palladium, platinum's sister metal, had been the star performer of the
precious metals market last week as its established upward price trend was
underpinned by the announcement of a planned cut in Russian output. But it
hung behind the others this time. Nevertheless yesterday's morning fixing of
Dollars 119.50 an ounce was the highest for nearly three years; the
afternoon fixing was 15 cents lower but still Dollars 1.60 up on the week.
At the London Metal Exchange the copper market began with an attempt to
consolidate following the heavy falls of the preceding three weeks. The line
was held initially, as talk of labour disruptions resulting from Chilean and
US labour contract negotiations helped to narrow forward premiums, but
options-related and Chinese selling had re-established the downward trend by
mid-week. However, a rally yesterday saw the three months price closing at
Pounds 1,209 a tonne, up Pounds 12.75 on the day and Pounds 1 overall.
By way of contrast, nickel market traders set out on Monday to build on last
week's rally. But the upward move quickly ran into overhead resistance. The
three months price peaked after adding Dollars 62.50 to last week's Dollars
235-a-tonne advance and closed yesterday at Dollars 6,005 a tonne, Dollars
167.50 down on the week. The announcement of LME warehouse stocks rises
totalling 2,460 tonnes did not help the metal's cause.
Lack of buying interest continued to weigh down the lead market and the LME
three months contract closed yesterday with a Pounds 7.25 loss on the week
at a fresh 6 1/2 -year low of Pounds 271.50 a tonne. But aluminium was
firmer, reflecting trade and commission house buying encouraged by rumours
of further output cuts. The three months quotation gained Dollars 21 on the
week at Dollars 1,115 a tonne in spite of running into overhead resistance
yesterday.
A chart-based rally in the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) robusta
coffee market was interrupted on Thursday when selling was prompted by
Brazil's announcement that it would sell 600,000 bags (60 kg each) from its
stockpile. Traders were sceptical about the announcement, however, as there
was no indication of when the sale would take place or at what price, and
the upward trend was reinstated yesterday.
The renewed strength, which saw the July futures price rise to Dollars 915
at one time, was sparked by a technically-inspired overnight surge in the
New York arabica market. But although the New York prices were holding their
gains in late trading yesterday the London market once more found it
difficult to move decisively above the psychologically-significant Dollars
900-a-tonne mark for the July contract, which closed at Dollars 903 a tonne,
up Dollars 27 on the week.
New York raw sugar futures edged further ahead, though there was no repeat
of last week's surge. In late trading yesterday the July contract was quoted
at 12.90 US cents a lb, up 0.09 from the end of last week.
There was little response to news that FO Licht, the German sugar statistics
agency, had cut its forecast of the 1992-93 world crop to 113.01m tonnes
from its January figure of 114.88m tonnes. Licht also reduced its 1991-92
crop estimate by 290,000 tonnes to 115.88m tonnes.
London ceased to be a raw sugar futures trading centre yesterday with the
expiry at 11:22 GMT of the May contract, the last remaining quoted month on
London Fox's No 6 contract. Fox announced on April 13 that it was suspending
trading in the No 6 contract because of declining interest.

FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Spanish food side leaves Ashley Grp Pounds
13.8m in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHLEY GROUP incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.8m for the 16 months to
December 31 after an exceptional Pounds 5.9m relating to the disposal of its
lossmaking Spanish food retailing business, Digsa.
The loss compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 13.7m in the 12 months to
August 31 1991.
Mr James White, chairman, said the group's exposure to the Spanish food
retailing business had not proved a happy one. Digsa reported operating
losses of Pounds 5m on sales of Pounds 516m.
Mr White said the group acquired the Spanish business when Mr Tony Butler,
who had experience of UK retailing, had been chief executive. The decision
to expand into Barcelona had proved 'an unmitigated disaster'. He added that
the downturn in Spain, which was reported in November, had accelerated.
Digsa is being acquired by Parafax, a Hong Kong-based company established to
acquire retail businesses.
Parafax is paying a deferred consideration of Pounds 20m, together with the
transfer of Digsa's net debt which has averaged Pounds 33m in the last three
months.
After six months from completion it will start to pay four instalments of
Pounds 5m.
In anticipation of the sale, which has to be approved by shareholders at an
extraordinary meeting on May 7, an extraordinary provision of Pounds 3.8m
has been made for the expected loss on disposal.
This is a transfer of Pounds 43.4m of goodwill previously written off
against reserves.
Interest charges were Pounds 7.27m, largely resulting from the levels of
borrowing in Spain at high interest rates. In the previous year interest
charged was Pounds 1.4m. If the Digsa sale goes ahead the group will be left
with gearing of 52 per cent, representing net debt of Pounds 12m.
Distribution of window blinds reported profits of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 6.7m)
on turnover of Pounds 47m (Pounds 30m) while the group's plywood and timber
activities contributed Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 286,000) on sales of Pounds
1.55m (Pounds 1.87m).
There is no final dividend. Two interim dividends of 0.375p each were paid
during the year. Losses per share were 11.6p (7.5p earnings).

FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Midlands Electricity splits top roles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLANDS Electricity has split the top position at the company and appointed
Mr Mike Hughes chief executive from today
Mr Bryan Townsend remains chairman but Mr Richard Young, who was formerly
managing director, has left the company. Mr Hughes was formerly executive
director with responsibility for engineering.
Mr Townsend said: 'Our primary focus remains on our core business and our
overall strategy of developing as an energy company must be continued.'
Mr Hughes could have a difference of emphasis, however. He has been known to
be critical of the company's expansion into retail outlets and may try to
shift the focus away from non-core activities.
Mr Young had been managing director since 1990 and is believed to have felt
slightly frustrated at the hands-on approach of the company's chairman which
limited his own influence.
Mr Matthew Siebert, electricity analyst at Hoare Govett, said: 'We could
start to see more movement amongst the management of the privatised
electricity companies . . . There are certain key decisions that need to be
taken ahead of the regulatory review, on pay bargaining and non-core
investment that could start to differentiate between managements.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ptarmigan takes a further step up the road
to engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PTARMIGAN HOLDINGS made further moves towards becoming an engineering
company by announcing an Pounds 8m acquisition funded by a rights issue, a
change of name and capital restructuring.
Ptarmigan, which is to be renamed Graystone, has agreed to buy a company
called Cableform, plus its US subsidiary, from FKI, the electrical
engineering group. The deal will be funded by a 14-for-3 rights issue of up
to 68.48m new shares at 8p each, which is being underwritten by Chemical
Investment Bank.
Shares in Ptarmigan were suspended on Wednesday at 10p, and dealing is
expected to resume on May 25.
Ptarmigan is in the process of disposing of its original businesses - making
sausage casings, artificial flowers and ribbons, publishing cookery and
crafts books and running three small country hotels.
Mr Dick Richardson, who became chairman and chief executive in June, said
the acquisition of Cableform marked a significant step forward in
implementing his strategy of identifying and acquiring specialist
engineering companies operating in niche markets.
In November Ptarmigan bought three engineering companies from Prospect
Industries. Ptarmigan said that as a result of these acquisitions, it viewed
the prospects for the group with increased optimism.
FKI Cableform, based in West Yorkshire, makes numbering machines, lighting
products and electrical controls. It employs 257 people in the UK, 21 in the
US and three in Germany. In the year to March 31 it made operating profits
of Pounds 1.3m on sales of Pounds 9.8m. FKI said the disposal was part of
its policy of focusing on core businesses.
FKI will receive Pounds 5m in cash, Pounds 2m nominal of loan stock and
12.5m new Graystone shares. The proceeds of the rights issue will pay the
cash element. Joint stockbrokers to the issue are Henry Cooke Lumsden and
Peel, Hunt &amp; Co.
Ptarmigan yesterday also reported that it has reduced pre-tax losses in the
six months to December 31 from Pounds 127,00 to Pounds 104,000 on sales of
Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.1m). Operating profit rose from Pounds 6,000 to Pounds
170,000, but this was offset by an increase in interest payment to Pounds
226,000 (Pounds 110,000).
Mr Richardson said: 'The group is now trading profitably and the trading
conditions for all our companies are showing signs of improvement. This,
together with recent reductions in interest rates, should result in improved
performance.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pearson interested in acquiring Star TV
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group, is interested in
buying a stake in Star TV, the Hong Kong-based satellite television company
which broadcasts to 38 Asian countries.
The interest in Star, which is a 50-50 joint venture between Hutchison
Whampoa and a company controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, comes as Pearson
finalises its Pounds 99m acquisition of Thames Television.
When Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, announc-ed the purchase of
Thames, the company added that it intended to expand in the international
television market.
Mr Julian Mounter, the newly appointed chief executive of Star, has recently
had talks with Pearson. However, it is by no means certain that the
satellite company wants to take on new equity investors. It has also been
talking to a wide range of television groups, including US networks, about
possible collaboration.
However, Mr Mounter used to work at Thames Television and has had a close
working relationship with Mr Richard Dunn, Thames' chief executive, for many
years.
At the moment Star broadcasts five channels, covering sport, music, Chinese
language, news and information and entertainment. The news channel is
provided by BBC World Service Television 24-hours a day.
A second satellite is expected to be launched next year and the company is
already talking about the possibility of using the latest digital
compression technology to squeeze out as many as 180 channels.
Apart from the possibility of a stake in Star, two other projects with a
Pearson involvement are being suggested.
One is to take UK Gold, the entertainment channel set up by Thames and the
BBC - or a version of it - to Asia. Another is that Longman, Pearson's
educational publishing group, could be involved in an educational channel
for broadcasting to Asia.
Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, declined to comment last
night.
Star TV is aimed at the most affluent 5 per cent of its potential market
from the Middle East to Japan.
Independent market research published in February found that 11.36m
households, or more than 45m viewers, could receive its broadcasts, which
are funded by advertising. According to the research, undertaken in 10
countries, the largest audience is in China, with 4.8m households, but India
has 3.3m and Taiwan 1.98m.

FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BPCC considers market flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BPCC, Britain's largest commercial printing company, is likely to go for a
Stock Exchange flotation either late this year or early next.
The company, formally owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell but sold when he
pulled out of printing, has started work on the 'beauty parade' to choose
financial advisers for the flotation.
'I'm not saying we are floating in October but we have started the process,'
Mr John Holloran, BPCC's chief executive, said yesterday.
The company, which prints nine of the top ten magazines in the UK from the
Radio Times to Woman's Own, left the Maxwell empire in January 1989 in a
Pounds 235m management buy-out.
The inspiration for the possible flotation has come from the company's new
chairman, Mr Brian Garraway, who retired recently as deputy chairman of BAT.
Timing would depend on market conditions as the printing industry starts to
pull out of recession.
Mr Holloran said that if the company decided to go ahead with a float 'the
earliest would be towards the end of this year and it could roll into next
year.'
Last year BPCC had a turnover of Pounds 289m with an operating profit of
Pounds 19.5m. After interest charges of Pounds 26m the company made a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 5m.
Since the buy-out the BPCC chief executive says Pounds 94m has been invested
in re-equipping printing plants and as a result a number of contracts lost
to continental European printers have been regained.

FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Spotlight on grey market rules - Stock
Exchange halts share deals in demerged parts of ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK Exchange has asked Salomon Brothers International, the investment
bank, to stop making a 'grey market' in the shares of the demerged parts of
Imperial Chemical Industries.
The exchange said it was reviewing its guidelines on grey market dealing -
dealing in securities on a 'when-issued' basis before official dealings
start.
This could lead to a framework of rules for a Stock Exchange sanctioned grey
market.
At present Stock Exchange rules forbid grey market trading although the
exchange does give permission for such trading to take place on a
case-by-case basis. Grey market dealings were allowed, for instance, in
Racal and SmithKline Beecham.
The division of Salomon which was making the market is not a Stock Exchange
member firm, so was not subject to the rules, but agreed to the request.
The Stock Exchange considered that since not all market participants were
able to trade in the grey market and there was not full information about
the issue which has yet to be priced, trading was not to the benefit of all
investors.
The grey market trading could have affected ICI's ability to price the
Pounds 1.3bn Zeneca rights issue which will coincide with the demerger.
Salomon ceased trading shares in Zeneca and the ex-demerger ICI yesterday at
1 pm, but will re-open trading after the price of Zeneca's rights issue is
announced on May 12.
The final grey market price for Zeneca was 690p and for ICI ex the demerger
590p. All trades done since Salomon opened the market on Tuesday this week
will be honoured.
Shares in Zeneca and the remaining ICI are due to start official trading on
June 1.
Many stock exchanges have an established grey market in shares, and in
London some Eurobonds and gilt-edged stocks are dealt in before issue. The
exchange will talk to people in the market to judge whether a set of
guidelines and a code of practice can be established.
Salomon said it welcomed the Stock Exchange's review 'given the increased
level of investor interest in such trading'.
The High Court ruled yesterday that the Zeneca shares to be issued to ICI
shareholders in the demerger will count as capital in the hands of trustees,
not as income. Had the shares been classed as income it would have caused
problems for trusts where income is regarded as the property of the 'life
tenant' and capital belongs to the 'remaindermen' who benefit after the life
tenant's interest ceases.

FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Clark chairman rebuts dissidents' circular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of C&amp;J Clark, the privately-owned shoe group facing a proposed
Pounds 184m bid from Berisford International, has written to shareholders
with a point-by-point rebuttal of a circular from a group of shareholders
opposed to the sale.
Mr Walter Dickson, chairman, and six other directors of Clark have
recommended the offer to shareholders. The entire board of 11 has said the
terms are fair and reasonable, but three directors have advised shareholders
not to accept.
The dissident group, known by the acronym Shoes, wrote to shareholders on
Wednesday saying the offer failed to reflect Clark's future potential, and
attacking the board over its role in the bid being made.
Shoes' letter put forward an alternative board structure - which it said
would end the disputes between family shareholders which have plagued Clark
for years - and supported a flotation of Clark within five years.
Mr Dickson said 'there is no certainty in Shoes' proposals'. He said a
two-tier board, suggested by Shoes, was 'virtually unknown in this country'
and Clark had been advised not to adopt it. The proposals 'cannot disguise
the deep rooted differences of opinion which have disrupted your company
over the years'.
He said the suggestion of a flotation was 'uncertain as to value, as to
deliverability and as to timing'.
Mr Dickson also said that the price negotiated with Berisford 'takes into
account Clark's recovery plans'. Shoes argued that the price was low because
Clark is expecting a profit recovery.
Directors of Clark and Berisford have addressed meetings of Clark
shareholders in London and Somerset in recent days. The issue of selling to
Berisford will be put to an extraordinary meeting next Friday, May 7.

FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Tax saving move gives boost to RMC shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of RMC jumped by 5 per cent yesterday after the company
announced that it was reorganising its German operations giving it
substantial tax advantages.
Readymix Berlin, its 63.6 per cent controlled eastern German operations
which previously has been classed as an associate, is to be merged with
Readymix AG, its larger western German subsidiary.
The move, which will involve no cash cost to RMC, will allow the group to
take much better advantage of accelerated tax depreciation incentives
introduced to encourage capital investment in the former East German
republic.
It will, however, increase group debt by Pounds 150m, raising gearing from
31 per cent to 45 per cent.
RMC said that Readymix Berlin would have generated insufficient profits for
the group to take full benefit of the tax relief. This could now be set
against earnings of the merged company, including profits from western
German operations.
RMC's share price rose 34p to 675p following the announcement. Mr Derek
Jenkins, finance director, said the group would achieve an immediate cash
benefit of DM40m (Pounds 16.2m) which would not have to be paid against this
year's tax bill.
Depreciation and accumulated tax losses amounting to DM100m would be
available for relief against corporation tax on 1993 profits. This meant
that big payments on account which would have been made this year will not
now be necessary, said Mr Jenkins.
He said that the group in the next two to three years proposed to invest
DM500m in its eastern German operations.
This investment would be eligible for tax relief provided it was spent
before December 31, 1995. Mr Jenkins said earnings per share would improve
as a result.

FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone trims loss to Pounds 6.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCCARTHY &amp; Stone, Britain's biggest builder of sheltered housing for
elderly, yesterday announced a reduced loss of Pounds 6.1m for the six
months to the end of February, against Pounds 6.9m.
The interim dividend is being passed as was last year's final after an
interim payment of 0.5p. Losses per share fell from 11.1p to 9.9p.
Mr John McCarthy, chairman, said it was a creditable performance given the
recent difficulties in the housing market.
Turnover fell from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 25.7m despite a 16 per cent
increase in the number of homes sold in the UK. Mr McCarthy said that the
underlying increase was a little more than 3 per cent if a 'one-off' bulk
sale of 41 units was excluded.
The average price of a retirement flat had fallen from Pounds 68,500 to
Pounds 61,100. As a result the UK made an operating loss of Pounds 500,000
compared to break even a year ago.
Losses in France increased from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 400,000. Mr
McCarthy said the group was 'looking to liquidate its overseas net operating
assets of Pounds 14.4m as quickly as possible for re-investment in the UK'.
The group, which has renegotiated its financing arrangements with its
bankers until November next year, had net borrowings of Pounds 69.1m only
marginally less than the Pounds 69.2m of a year earlier and compared with
shareholders funds of Pounds 72.1m.
The group said borrowings would have been less but for the adverse effect of
exchange rates on Pounds 3.4m of overseas debt and fees of Pounds 2.9m
payable on the renewal of bank facilities and lease finance.
COMMENT
McCarthy &amp; Stone's share price, which slipped a further 1 1/2 p to 31p
yesterday, has languished while other builders have bounced on prospects of
a UK housing market recovery. The shares have underperformed the FT
Actuaries construction index by more than 50 per cent since the end of April
last year. The arguments against the shares are that recovery in sheltered
housing is likely to lag the traditional housing market. In addition gearing
is very high and could constrain the group when sales do pick up. Losses
this year are likely to be more than Pounds 7m, with the possibility of
another small loss next year. It may be a buy at some stage, but not yet
given the the size of borrowings and the risks in the sector.

There was only limited trading, mainly concerning residential housing.
Turnover was Pounds 5.08m (Pounds 8.52m). Interest costs were Pounds 7.21m
(Pounds 13.2m).
Losses per share worked through at 21.93p (35.26p).
The company said that in line with the general improvement in the
residential market it had seen an upturn in sales in the first quarter.
Fairbriar is concentrating on the residential side of its business.

6.89p, compared with 4.26p.
The company is awaiting the outcome of an appeal against a planning decision
before making a recommendation on the final dividend for the previous year
when a second interim of 0.5p was paid. A nominal interim of 0.5p is being
paid for the period under review.

<TEXT>
KINGSTON Oil &amp; Gas is making a number of changes which will result it
controlling a third of the waste fuel oil recycling market in the UK, DCC, a
private Dublin-based company, becoming its largest single shareholder. It is
also changing its name to Greenway Holdings.
It is selling Kingston Oil Corporation, its US oil and gas interests for
Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m) cash to its management and buying BCS from Emo Oil,
a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of DCC, for Pounds 2.8m, satisfied by the
issue of 5.6m shares representing 29.9 per cent of the enlarged capital.
The company also announced 1992 pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.1m, compared with
profits of Pounds 1.19m, after an exceptional charge this time of Pounds
4.49m relating to the write-down of the US interests less exchange gains on
US intra-group indebtedness.
Turnover was Pounds 6.09m (Pounds 6.63m). Losses per share were 32.44p
(earnings 9.01p). A final dividend is not being paid, leaving the total for
the year at 1p (2.5p).
BCS, a waste oil reprocessor, will be merged with Orcol Fuels, Kingston's
offshoot in the same business.
The US write-off will result in a deficit on reserves and the company is
seeking court approval to reduce the group's share capital.

FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Dixon Motor will reverse into Plateau
Mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIXON MOTOR Holdings, a Yorkshire-based, multi-franchised motor dealership
group with 12 outlets, is coming to the Unlisted Securities Market by
reversing into Plateau Mining, the former natural resources group which has
been fighting a hostile bid.
Guinness Mahon, Plateau's adviser, said the enlarged company, which will
change its name to Dixon Motors, will be valued at between Pounds 12m and
Pounds 15m when dealings begin on May 25.
It calculated that the proposals are worth more than 6p a share to existing
Plateau holders compared with last August's suspension price of 3p and the
revised all-share offer from Kingstream Resources, a small Australian
exploration company, of 5.18p.
Plateau was originally formed from most of the Robertson Group's mining
interests and started trading in January 1990 at 90p.
Mr David Hickey of Guinness Mahon said Dixon made pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 400,000 on a turnover of Pounds 45m in 1992. He said Dixon would have
to wait a year for a full quote because, although it had existed for 20
years and had increased profits during the recession, technically it had
only a two-year profits record since the acquisition of some assets from the
receiver of Corton Beach, the mini-conglomerate.
Plateau will acquire Dixon for about Pounds 8.6m, to be satisfied by the
issue of 8.2m new ordinary shares at 105p each. Another Pounds 3.5m of
shares will be placed with institutional investors and Pounds 1.5m of the
cash raised will go to 3i, which has been backing Dixon. The rest of the
money will provide additional working capital. Dixon's other shareholders
have agreed to retain their new shares for 12 months.
Plateau has already announced the sale of its remaining mineral interests to
Delta Gold and the Delta shares acquired will be returned to existing
Plateau shareholders.
Mr Hickey said shareholders representing about 70 per cent of Plateau were
in favour of the Dixon deal but Kingstream's adviser, Ionian Corporate
Finance, which has now posted details of the hostile offer to Plateau
shareholders, said: 'Our position remains the same. We have no intention of
giving up.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Lessons in the art of survival: UK boarding schools are
changing as pupil numbers fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the recession was officially pronounced dead by the government this
week, it is biting its deepest into one area of British life usually
regarded as immune. Boarding schools across the country have seen their
steepest fall in numbers - 6 per cent - since records began in 1982,
according to the Independent Schools Information Service.
Attendance at independent day schools has been resilient over the past
decade, and girls' day school attendances rose slightly this year. But the
latest fall in the number of boarders, coming on top of a 10 per cent
decline over the previous three years, has forced many boarding schools to
adopt new strategies.
They are under pressure from two economic forces: the seemingly inexorable
rise in their costs, and hence fees, and the effect the recession has had on
parents' ability to pay.
Independent school fees (including day schools) have risen on average at
double the rate of inflation for more than a decade. Last year, average fees
rose by 8.3 per cent, triple the inflation rate, taking the average cost of
a term at boarding school to Pounds 3,125. Headmasters' Conference schools,
the independent sector's elite, charge Pounds 3,425 on average; prep schools
charge Pounds 2,492.
Boarding schools are aware of the danger of pricing themselves out of the
market, but their scope to keep fee increases down is limited. Education is
highly labour-intensive, with staff salaries accounting for up to 80 per
cent of costs, according to Mr Michael Oakley, chairman of the Independent
Schools Bursars Association, which represents school treasurers.
Independent schools need quality staff, and cannot ignore teachers' pay
agreements in the state sector. Isis believes that keeping independent
school fee increases below the public sector teachers' pay rise of 9.5 per
cent is, therefore, something of a victory.
Fee increases have also been fuelled by competition between schools on
eye-catching capital projects, such as sports halls and drama centres. As
the recession deepened, parents began to decide that these were luxuries
they could no longer afford.
Ms Joan Jefferson, president of the Girls' Schools Association and
headmistress of St Swithun's, a boarding school in Winchester, admits:
'Boarding is expensive and it's inevitable that in a time of severe
recession it will be affected more because it costs more.'
Boarding numbers have been hit far harder than day pupil numbers, which
dropped by only 0.2 per cent last year after a decade of consistent growth.
School fees are usually one of the last items of expenditure to be cut when
a family suffers financial difficulties.
By contrast, the downward trend in boarding numbers has continued for more
than a decade, even during the buoyant years of the mid-1980s, suggesting
that social, as well as economic factors, are squeezing boarding schools.
There were 126,616 boarders in the UK in 1986, according to the Department
for Education, and only 109,216 in 1992.
In contrast with previous generations, the value of keeping children within
a family environment, rather than sending them for a 'character-building'
experience at boarding school, is more widely accepted.
However, the oldest and most famous boarding schools have managed to escape
the general trend. At Winchester College, for example, numbers have risen
because the school offered more places than usual last year, assuming that
some parents would be forced by the recession to withdraw their sons. This
did not happen.
Mr John Sabben-Clare, the headmaster, points out that the school is
insulated against the recession because it attracts pupils internationally,
not just from the UK or its local area.
But minor boarding schools which are not household names, in outlying areas
of the country which offer sparse catchment areas should they want to
attract day pupils, face real difficulty in justifying fee increases to
parents.
They need to adapt to survive. That means an end to the ambitious building
and capital projects of the past decade, increased assistance for pupils,
whether from endowment funds or from the government's assisted places
scheme, and a more flexible approach to boarding. Many boys' schools are
becoming co-educational to expand their target market.
One example is Blundell's School in Tiverton, Devon, established in 1604,
and the scene for much of the action in Lorna Doone, which will become fully
co-educational from September this year. Mr John Leigh, the headmaster who
took over at the beginning of the year, says: 'There's a genuine desire to
increase equal opportunity. But it's fair to say that the economic climate
was a catalyst.'
Like other schools in the south-west, Blundell's has seen the number of
boarders drop, though they still make up roughly three-quarters of the
school's population. Blundell's has a policy of giving financial aid to
local children - Mr Leigh points out that this corresponds to the founder's
intention - and a quarter of pupils receive bursaries or scholarships from
the school.
This puts it in line with the Isis figures which showed that 26.6 per cent
of independent school pupils received help with fees, most of it - 16.9 per
cent - coming from the schools themselves.
When Blundell's makes appeals to its alumni in future, it will be asking for
funds to endow bursaries, not to build sports halls. According to Mr Leigh:
'I think of the 1980s as the decade of building and of the 1990s as the
decade of learning how to use those buildings to the best advantage.'
Again this echoes the Isis trend, which shows that capital spending per
pupil declined for the first time since 1982 last year - by 10 per cent to
Pounds 513.
Another Devon boarding school, Shebbear College, has taken more drastic
action. Shebbear is a 150-year-old Methodist school in the north of the
county. Its number of boarders has steadily declined, and at the end of last
year the Methodist Board of Management announced that it was to vacate its
present site and merge with a girls' school in Bideford, 12 miles away.
Shebbear's governors and teachers succeeded in overturning the decision.
However, they have done so only by accepting staff redundancies, and a cut
in teachers' allowances. A total of Pounds 250,000 has been cut from the
school's budget of Pounds 1.6m for next year, while fees for juniors have
been trimmed by almost a third, from Pounds 1,250 to Pounds 850 per term.
From September, the school, like Blundell's, will be fully co-educational.
These changes demonstrate the economic pressures on small boarding schools.
Mr Russell Buley, Shebbear's headmaster, said: 'We're simply recognising
where the markets are for our product. The way forward is to face up to the
problems of being an isolated boarding school and turn that to our
advantage.'
The proportion of boarders at Shebbear has dropped steadily and now
comprises just over half the school's population. Many parents in north
Cornwall and Dartmoor prefer a daily two-hour round-trip to the expense of
boarding.
'Flexi-boarding' is the less traumatic policy which has been adopted by the
Royal Naval School in Haslemere, Surrey. The school, which once had a heavy
boarding emphasis because it was founded to educate the daughters of naval
officers, now allows weekly boarding, and occasional overnight stays. Girls
living locally are also allowed to spend time boarding while parents are
away on business.
Mrs Jill Clough, the headmistress, explains that this unusual system evolved
because of parental demand. It lessened the costs for many, while also
allowing day girls to share in the 'boarding experience' to some extent.
Like Blundell's, Royal Naval is now digging deeper into bursary funds and is
also receiving help from charities. Mrs Clough describes this as taking a
long-term view - if the funds are not used now, when parents are finding
times tough, family links with independent education could be broken.
Strategies such as these mean that it is still too soon to declare the final
demise of the British boarding education. But survival for the less
prestigious boarding schools now requires innovation to attract new pupils
and a greater effort to hold down costs than has been apparent in the past.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Letter: Financial strength of with-profit companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFF WESTALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You recently quoted my remarks on with-profits business in the life
insurance industry ('Mutual sacrifice puts new thinking into boardrooms',
April 21). I would like to set these remarks in the wider context of the
benefits of with-profit life assurance, namely the smoothing of investment
returns.
It is inherent in with-profits business that the policy holder enjoys a
smoothed investment return. During a period of rising investment returns,
smoothing will entail distribution of less than the assets that have been
earned and hence a strengthening of the free reserve position.
Conversely, in a period of falling investment returns, the time lag of the
smoothing process will lead to companies distributing more in assets than
they have been earning on investments. While this excess will be paid for
out of free reserves, our research indicates that the average cost of paying
this excess in 1991 amounted to around only one half of one per cent of the
total funds. We do not believe this has had a significant effect on the
financial strength of with-profit companies.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Battle against a moral imbalance: The arms embargo imposed
on the Bosnian Moslems is unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another flurry of negotiations has started over Bosnia. They seem unlikely
to succeed. The west hopes to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to implement the
Vance-Owen plan, while refusing to do anything effective to change their
minds. In particular, the British government remains deeply attached to an
arms embargo that guarantees the Serbs and, to an extent, the Croats
military superiority in Bosnia.
Why is the government's support for the arms embargo so implacable? The
foreign secretary has already answered this question by condemning the
arming of the Moslems as merely providing a 'level killing field'. By its
actions and its words, the British government evidently prefers an unlevel
killing field.
Mr Hurd's position is, it should be noted, advanced as a moral one. He
argues against arming Bosnia's Moslems on the grounds that it would both
prolong and increase the killing. The obvious reply to this objection is
'yes, it might'. But what is desired by these means is not war for its own
sake, any more than that was the aim of the US in supporting the UK during
the second world war. The aim of fighting would be a better outcome than
surrender. Mr Hurd should be able to see this. He insists that what is
needed is a negotiated political settlement. But what can be the
precondition for such a settlement, other than a balance of forces on the
ground or the satiation of one side?
Participation by foreign ground forces would be more effective in bringing
balance to the battlefield than arming the Bosnian government. But, for
understandable reasons, the UK - along with France and the US  - does not
wish to undertake a large and open-ended commitment. With foreign ground
troops ruled out, it seems extraordinary that a recognised state should be
denied any effective means to defend its existence.
It is only because states provide a police force and an army that they are
entitled to insist that their citizens remain unarmed. Similarly, only a
commitment by the west to defend Bosnia's Moslems could justify depriving
them of their right to self-defence.
So what about the argument that providing these people with means of
self-defence may increase casualties? First, the west is not pacifist.
Countries such as the UK accept that the risks of resistance will often be
preferable to surrender. Second, the victims are being denied the right even
to choose whether to defend themselves. The west is imposing the preferences
of those not at risk on those who are.
To deprive both sides of means of defence is tantamount to willing the
victory of the side that started off better armed. The present stance is
pro-Serb. In feeding the victims, the British government has adopted a
conscience-salving gesture. But by choosing neither to defend these people
nor to help them defend themselves, it is an accomplice in 'ethnic
cleansing'.
Yet by its support for sanctions against Serbia, the government has
implicitly recognised that this is not solely, or even largely, an
inter-ethnic war within Bosnia. It has also recognised that one side is more
culpable than the other. Serbian action in Bosnia is made possible by the
support from Serbia. The aim of that support appears to be the creation of a
geographically contiguous, ethnically pure, greater Serbia.
The western reaction has been economic sanctions, which are unlikely to
work. What has happened since the Gulf war demonstrates the ineffectiveness
of the sanctions policy that many favoured before it started. As for the
Vance-Owen plan, it looks clever-silly. The fundamental objection is that it
conflicts with the aims of both Serbs and Croats, yet there is no force to
impose it.
Can sense be made of the British stance? Yes it can. The policy could be
expounded as follows, even if members of the government would not be willing
to admit this even to themselves: 'Serbia will win this war. It will win
because the costs of doing anything effective to stop it would be too high.
It would be best for everyone if that victory were as quick and complete as
possible. Giving military help to the Bosnian government would increase the
number of people killed, while just postponing the inevitable.
'We cannot admit this is our policy, since it contradicts everything we
supposedly believe in. We can also not ignore the disquiet of our
television-watching population. The commitment of a modest contingent of
soldiers for humanitarian purposes has at least stilled those calls and
saved lives, while doing little to postpone Serbian victory. Naturally, we
will not acknowledge this was our objective, for which reason the appearance
of sanctions will be maintained indefinitely.'
This policy is not indefensible, but it is hardly acceptable either. It
suffers from four disadvantages.
First, it is bound to appear to fail. The ostensible policy is to stop
Serbia, while the real policy is for Serbia to succeed. The contrast is
bound to make the west look ridiculous.
Second, the policy may even fail to minimise the killing. Effective
opposition is at least as likely to stop the Serbs as anything else. If that
opposition is not to come from western countries, then it must come from
those they are attacking.
Third, Bosnia is not the last word in this saga. Others will learn from the
success of this brutal attempt to unscramble ethnic omelettes by force.
Serbia itself will learn from the success of this attempt.
Finally, the western world is defined by moral values. To connive at
atrocities for reasons of realpolitik concealed under the cloak of
pseudo-pacifism is to bring it into disrepute.
It may now be too late to provide the Bosnian government with effective
means of self-defence. Given western reluctance to intervene effectively,
however, this policy would have offered a better chance of peace than
negotiating while giving Serbs and Croats carte blanche to change facts on
the ground.

FT  01 MAY 93 / A lovable bully's fall from grace: Christopher Lorenz
reflects on the leadership of soccer's Brian Clough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So. Farewell
Then, Brian.
Doyen of the City Ground.
Your old magic has ceased to
Inspire.
You've been elbowed out.
The enterprise you've led for 18
Glorious years is collapsing.
Keith's mum says you were a loudmouthed
Bully.
But I always thought you were the master.
You'll be sorely missed by fans and rivals.
Life will never be the same.
(With apologies to EJ Thribb (17 1/2 ) of Private Eye magazine)
For any readers in New York, Nuremberg, Nantes or - God forbid - Nottingham
who haven't the faintest idea what on earth this dreadful adolescent
doggerel is all about, the explanation is this. A few days ago Britain's
best-known soccer manager and TV sports 'personality', the larger-than-life
Brian Clough, announced under boardroom pressure that he would retire from
his job at Nottingham Forest Football Club from the end of the season. He
has occupied the post since 1975, making him, at 58, the
second-longest-serving postwar soccer manager since the legendary Matt Busby
of Manchester United.
Clough's passing, and next week's probable relegation of the club which he
transformed from mediocre journeymen to European champions, holds lessons
aplenty for other leaders and their followers - not just in sport, but also
in politics and especially business. For Clough's irascible character and
domineering leadership style bear a striking resemblance, albeit in
exaggerated form, to those of many politicians and top executives past and
present. Remember Margaret Thatcher, who departed in equally ignominious
circumstances? Or Lord King, late of far-from-Virgin British Airways, who
went in similar fashion? Or Robert Horton, ousted from the chairmanship of
British Petroleum last summer after only two years at the top?
Admittedly, managing a football club is in a somewhat lesser league than the
tasks which such big-time players perform. But this does not invalidate the
parallels between their styles of leadership, as Clough's career shows.
Together with many charismatic business leaders who have a sustained stay at
the helm, Clough had his most successful years as part of a duo. In
business, the partner usually stays quietly out of the limelight. But
Clough's, the late Peter Taylor, was equally outspoken. Once they split up,
Clough never hit quite the same heights again.
His leadership style epitomised old-fashioned industrial management - the
arrogant, charismatic autocrat who rules with a rod of iron, and demands
unquestioning obedience. Nigel Nicholson, professor of organisational
behaviour at the London Business School, calls this 'benign despotism - or
not always so benign'.
In Clough's case, the fear this induced was laced with a streak of
paternalism and - something many business leaders lack - genuine humour.
Whatever the wider world thought of him, this earned him intense respect,
sometimes bordering on love, from almost all his staff. Lord King and Lady
Thatcher were rather different. Combined with their manifest competence, the
fear they induced earned them bags of respect, but little love.
Clough's insistence on blind loyalty from his staff extended to forcing even
mature star players to run through beds of nettles. Nicholson calls such
acts 'rites of degradation which fully absorb people into the clan.' Clough
also had a habit of humiliating players in front of one another - though
much less often in public. As one of them wrote: 'It was the law of the
playground.'
Another tendency was to reward players when they expected to be punished,
and visa versa. 'Such unpredictability creates extreme dependence,'
Nicholson says. It also prompted several mature men to walk out of the club.
But Clough made a virtue of it even in public. In the business world, such
mercurial behaviour is unusual, and top managers who practise it tend not to
last long - unless, like Robert Maxwell, they own the company.
Clough's sense of his own power was so acute that he wore it on his sleeve.
As with Bob Horton at BP, he could never cease letting you know that he was
the boss. Overtly manipulative behaviour of this kind can be deeply annoying
to one's staff, even when done with a dash of humour. Horton's conversations
and internal speeches were peppered with jokes about his supposed
infallibility, or his 'running for Pope', while Clough belittled most males
by calling them 'young man'. He parodied this in a recent TV advert by
telling Gary Lineker and other England soccer stars to eat up their Shredded
Wheat cereal.
Psychologists argue that such brash behaviour usually stems from insecurity.
Even at the top of BP, Horton certainly saw himself as an outsider, with a
different educational background from most of his Oxbridge colleagues. In
Clough's case it rankled badly that he had failed to be appointed manager of
the English national team.
Another similarity with Horton was the contradiction between Clough's own
autocratic style and his professional belief in democracy. A lifetime member
of the Labour party, he talked for years of becoming an MP. At BP, Horton
eventually espoused the 'empowerment' of managers and employees, but failed
to suppress his innate nature, even with colleagues. It was part of his
undoing.
When the time for instant judgments is over, and heavyweight historians move
in, Clough's key strengths will be seen as his professional skill and
perception, plus his remarkable ability to motivate the members of a team to
raise their performance to impossible heights. The list of his faults will
include arrogance and the congenital inability of most leaders to recognise
when they have lost their touch (or passed their sell-by date, as EJ Thribb
would say).
As recently as March, Clough was still joking about his ability to 'walk on
water'. Leaders who feel that way should watch their step.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Letter: City police unrivalled in fight against urban terror
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN COXALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your article headed 'Police plead not guilty to terror
charges' (April 29).
The article states that the City of London police force 'sometimes hasn't
got cover at weekends'. This statement is entirely wrong. At all times the
force area is covered by a significant number of operational police
officers, both on foot patrol and in response cars, capable of dealing with
any incident. Indeed, on the morning that the Bishopsgate bomb was
discovered by police, the force immediately deployed officers to evacuate a
very large area, thus reducing the number of casualties.
In common with many other forces, the City of London Police has started
setting target response times for attendance at incidents (which are graded
in priority bands). This force sets very high targets (four minutes for the
most urgent of incidents) and during the early months of this year a
performance of almost 94 per cent was recorded across the full range of
incidents.
Over the past three years, the force has dealt with five bombing incidents
in the City of London, and gained unrivalled experience in fighting urban
terrorism. It takes a leading role in training on this subject at the police
staff college at Bramshill. Because of the heightened risk of terrorism to
the City of London, officers have been redeployed from the fraud squad and
other specialist departments to undertake anti-terrorist duties. Our
officers work closely in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police
anti-terrorist branch, and at any given time we have up to 30 officers
working with them.
We feel that it is important that the citizens of the City of London are
confident that their police provide a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week service,
capable of meeting their needs.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Letter: Teaching the history of business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ARNOLD KRANSDORFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In reviewing Mr Michael Heseltine's new industrial strategy
('Heseltine's plan 'to help Britain win' ', April 26), your reporter is
right to point out that not all critical ingredients are in the industry
minister's sphere of influence. If Mr Heseltine wants to encourage the
cultural revolution he feels is so necessary to lift Britain's business
prospects, he should go to the heart of the problem and make an appointment
with the education minister.
At this meeting, he might ask Mr John Patten why, while subjects such as
political, military, social and economic history are an integral part of the
general educative process, business history as a curricular subject is not
part of any form of universal education at UK schools?
He might point out that its neglect is evident at higher levels too, even at
business schools. Just 6 per cent of business students are exposed to the
subject in any way, equal to fewer than  1/2 per cent of the country's
university population, a statistic which is put into further perspective by
the number of professors of business history in the UK - just three against
Japan's 300.
Our research into business history's application in the workplace shows that
 -unlike many of their overseas competitors - British managers and workers
at all levels acquire little historical awareness of business in general and
companies in particular from the wider educational system. This is
compounded by the minimal efforts by companies to pass on their own history
to employees.
While low historical awareness helps to explain the absence of a wider
business culture, it also means that industry is unable to take advantage of
its own practised example.
It can also be argued that the concentration on wider-based economic history
at the expense of more specific business history makes aspiring British
entrepreneurs less practical businessmen.
The industrial revolution is more than 220 years old. By being its first
participant, Britain should have an inbuilt advantage of experience,
knowledge and tradition - if it were passed on.
If the education system and industry did not ignore business history, Mr
Heseltine wouldn't have to depend so much on initiatives such as advice
shops to help individuals do what should - by now - come naturally.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Letter: Yen's peak against the US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E C PANK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your newspaper has recently referred to the yen/dollar exchange
('Rising yen may not cut Japan's surplus', April 21) stating that the yen
had reached a postwar peak of Y110.25 to the dollar. This was not a record
high.
Prior to the second world war the rate was lower than Y4 to the dollar;
after the war the US occupation authorities imposed a 15-to-one conversion
rate which was raised considerably as inflation soared. The 360-to-one
exchange rate imposed in 1949 lasted for more than two decades.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Growth, gold and the G7
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE best part of a decade, economic co-operation in the Group of Seven
industrialised countries has been a euphemism for protracted haggling over
the structure of exchange rates, with the US occupying the role of
arm-twister-in-chief. In this respect Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary
in the Clinton administration, has shown himself to be a worthy successor to
the great architect of dollar decline in the 1980s, Mr James Baker. Japan
bashing has been his forte. But since this week's meeting of G7 finance
ministers and central bank governors, all is harmony on the currency front.
In a sudden access of diplomacy, Mr Bentsen has condemned attempts to
manipulate exchange rates. The G7 communique, meanwhile, stresses the role
of structural reforms in promoting domestic adjustment and reducing the
exchange rate changes that are required to restore external balance. The
question is how long this outbreak of peace will last.
While there may have been good reasons for talking up the yen, the need to
curb Japan's trade surplus, which now stands at 3.3 per cent of GNP, was not
one of the better ones. Since a high proportion of Japanese imports are
dollar-denominated commodities, the initial impact is to make the deficit
widen. To make matters worse, Japanese exports are notoriously insensitive
to price changes. Recent history suggests that the response of the Japanese
tradeable goods sector to a currency-driven squeeze is anyway to restructure
and become yet more competitive.
Deceleration
Nor is the latest bout of yen appreciation persuading the over-indebted
Japanese consumer to come out of the shell. After the excesses of the bubble
years, households are choc-a-bloc with consumer durables; and wage
settlements are at their lowest level since the last yen surge induced the
recession of 1987. The only good news on the US-Japan trade imbalance is
that the US economy is growing more slowly than in any normal recovery - and
that is bad news in most other respects.
The deceleration in US growth to an annual rate of 1.8 per cent in the first
quarter of the year was partly due to a sharp contraction in exports, from
an annualised rate of growth of 8.9 per cent in the fourth quarter to
shrinkage of 7.1 per cent. So much for the impact of currency manipulation
on the US trade performance, though too much should not be read into a
single quarter. But nor does the decline in yesterday's figures for US
factory orders in March suggest any immediate change in the picture.
As the G7 communique rightly puts it, the restoration of sustained
non-inflationary growth is critical to our efforts to deal with domestic and
international challenges. But precious little growth is in evidence at the
moment. Outside the US, the Japanese are dependent on government spending to
promote recovery, which takes time. The German economy is contracting, and
gradual cuts in interest rates by the Bundesbank point to a very slow move
out of recession for the rest of continental Europe. Even in Britain, where
the substantial relaxation of monetary policy since last September finally
appears to be working some magic on domestic confidence, it is too soon to
predict the strength of recovery.
Unsynchronised
It is paradoxical, then, that commodity prices have turned up this year and
that some high-profile investors have been telling impressionable
journalists about their enthusiasm for that great anti-inflationary hedge,
gold. The striking feature of the commodity upturn is the low base from
which it starts.
Nor is a modest upturn necessarily a bad signal. In those economies which
are over-burdened with debt, it is desirable that investment should play a
greater part in recovery than consumption; and an investment-led cycle,
marked by large infrastructure spending, especially in Asia, would naturally
tend to be more commodity intensive than one in which growth is related to
consumption and the service industries.
In the present economic cycle growth is wholly unsynchronised across the
world, so there is little risk of a commodity-based global inflation of the
kind that marked the mid-1970s. If there is an inflationary risk, it is in
the latter part of the decade and it relates to the difficulty G7
governments have in restraining structural budget deficits. If, for example,
the Clinton administration's plans for healthcare impose excessive burdens
on an already weak budgetary position, there could be trouble.
The pressure of an ageing population in Japan and in continental Europe
could similarly undermine fiscal policy, in the absence of pre-emptive
effort to improve the financing of pensions and healthcare. But the bond
markets are highly sensitive, after the losses incurred by investors the
1970s, to such threats. If governments do look like losing their grip on
fiscal policy bond prices will collapse and interest rates will rise well in
advance. It may still be possible for governments to inflate their way out
of their debts, but the electoral consequences will be swifter this time
round.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Lean years after the harvest: The Names' response to Lloyd's
business plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ronnie Todd-Young was too busy yesterday afternoon to watch the
countryside as he travelled by train to Chablis in northern France. As a
member of Lloyd's, who underwrites just over Pounds 1m a year, he was
meticulously reading the first business plan from the London insurance
market.
Like thousands of others, Mr Todd-Young was looking for signs of hope to
counter the prospect of ever-increasing losses and demands for money which
are forcing many Names - the individuals whose personal assets back the
market - into financial hardship.
Mr Todd-Young, 58 and semi-retired, combines his professional interest in
wine with membership of Lloyd's. He is also an organiser for the Tunbridge
Wells area of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the body which represents
several thousand of the 19,642 active Names.
After making steady profits during the early 1980s, he has now had three bad
years as the market plunged into loss. 'I saw it as a way of making my
capital work harder, and it paid for my children's education,' he says. 'Now
I'm having to pay it all back.'
During 1988 and 1989 when Lloyd's lost more than Pounds 2.5bn in total, Mr
Todd-Young paid out about Pounds 100,000. This year, the market is bracing
itself for a further record loss of more than Pounds 2.5bn for 1990 (Lloyd's
reports its results three years in arrears). Mr Todd-Young is expecting
another loss of more than Pounds 100,000.
He managed to pay his 1988 and 1989 losses from cash. Now he has started
selling shares. 'The old treasure box will be empty at the end of the year,'
he says.
After skimming the business plan, he said: 'The main shock was to see what
the top management thought the global loss would be. For 1991 there will be
another loss of over Pounds 1bn. It's rather bloody worrying. My concern is
that it all seems to get worse. You lose confidence in what we're being
told.'
Faith in the competence of the market's professionals and managers is one of
the main issues addressed in the 70-page business plan launched on Thursday
by Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, and Mr David Rowland, its
chairman. It contains a glimmer of hope for the most hard-hit Names.
In his introduction to the report, Mr Rowland says Lloyd's is prepared to
make 'a modest contribution' to a settlement of the legal disputes dogging
the market if this is 'demonstrably to the net benefit of the Society as a
whole'. Talks to achieve a deal will continue.
There is rather better news for Names less badly affected. The plan will
make it easier for those continuing to trade to pay any future losses. A
scheme to isolate many billions of pounds in old liabilities from US
asbestos and pollution claims should eventually allow the market to contain
these problems.
As a result, Names who are members of syndicates with 'open years' - where
the uncertainty of future claims means syndicate managers are unable to
close accounts - would be able to leave. For those who remain, radical
reorganisation and cost-cutting offer the prospect of potentially attractive
profits.
But the reaction of Names has so far been muted. Lloyd's sense of realism is
generally welcomed but views range from despair to subdued optimism.
In West Sussex, news of the plan on Thursday's BBC Radio 4's Today programme
did little to lighten the gloom surrounding Mr Richard Godden. In common
with a sizeable group of other Names nearby, he was recruited to Lloyd's in
the mid-1980s through the Gooda and Partners agency, whose owner, Mr Tony
Gooda, lives in nearby Coneyhurst.
The experience has been a grim one. Gooda &amp; Partners has gone out of
business, and the Gooda Walker syndicates into which it placed many of its
Names have lost nearly Pounds 1bn. Mr Godden faces losses of nearly Pounds
600,000, which he says he is unable to pay.
What he finds most worrying is Lloyd's decision in the business plan to lift
a moratorium on legal action against Names who are refusing to pay. 'I'm
just waiting to be served with a writ in a week's time,' he says. 'The plan
is all very well for people who are staying in. It is no good at all for
those people who have been ruined. I think Lloyd's is certainly doing more,
but it has an awful long way to go.'
Mr Godden, a retired local magistrate, is taking legal action against his
agents. 'The way we have been treated by some of these people was much worse
than the people who come up before me,' he says.
The business plan reassures Names that it will not issue 'blanket writs'
against those who have not been able, or have refused, to meet demands for
cash. But its moratorium on issuing individual writs - which Mr Middleton
temporarily introduced two months after his appointment in September - will
be lifted at the end of this month.
That makes little difference to Mr Godden. He is a member of the
2,000-strong Gooda Walker Action Group, through which Names are suing their
agents for negligence in the biggest legal action at the market. Writs have
been served and the case will come to court in 1994.
Mr Godden is also supporting a smaller case, backed by the Writs Response
Group, another alliance of loss-making Names. 'Frankly, I'm fighting and
resisting all I can,' he says. 'It is making life a perfect misery for
people like me. The worst thing is that we've been tricked and deceived.'
Ms Fernanda Herford, another Gooda Name, is similarly dismissive of the
business plan - although she says she was braced for worse news. 'It is a
damp squib, but I thought they'd ditch us more blatantly,' she says,
referring to the failure to provide any rescue plan for hard-hit Names. 'I
thought they would be more ruthless with us.'
Ms Herford joined Lloyd's in 1978 and expects to lose nearly Pounds 800,000,
nearly eight times the amount she needed to deposit with Lloyd's to
underwrite. 'It is endless. I'm blown out of the water. I've ceased to care,
I'm so over the top,' she says. Even her efforts to raise cash to meet
claims have backfired. By selling shares to pay early losses of Pounds
200,000, she has been left with a big bill for capital gains tax.
She has been earning an income by letting out rooms in her Chelsea home as
bed and breakfast accommodation for tourists. At the same time, she has
begun to campaign on behalf of other badly hit Names concentrated on the
so-called 'spiral' syndicates - those which provided reinsurance against
large-scale losses for other Lloyd's syndicates. 'If I knew then what I know
now I wouldn't touch (Lloyd's) with a bargepole,' she says.
That view is shared by Alexander and Jessie Munn, who joined Lloyd's in the
mid-1980s. The couple is waiting to hear the details of the plan, although
they heard the outline on the radio news. 'It sounds as though we have been
set adrift,' says Mr Munn.
'(Lloyd's) permeates your every day,' he says. 'It's difficult to get
anything else done. You're told to pay up and shut up. But many people have
paid everything they can pay. When I joined in 1986 I thought I was going
into an honourable institution. I have discovered that I have become
involved in a cesspit of dishonesty.'
Mr Clive Francis is angrier still. He made his money in property development
and lost it all on syndicates at Lloyd's - including those managed by the
Gooda Walker and Pulbrook agencies. He has little time for the new business
plan. 'After all the gestation of an elephant, it produced a mouse. This is
Peter Middleton's mouse,' he says.
'The report is tantamount to admitting fraud, failure to regulate and
incompetence in the past. But reformation without restitution will fail. I
have been hearing calls for an extraordinary general meeting. People are
saying we will just not accept being tossed overboard.'
The reaction is not surprising from Names who feel embittered about their
huge losses. But even Names less badly hit are cautious in their welcome for
change. Mr Todd-Young, for example, is a member of a number of syndicates
which have 'open years'. Although he approves of the business plan's
proposal to set up a scheme to isolate many of these old liabilities, he is
worried about the cost.
Some Names could be asked to pay more money if Lloyd's finds their
syndicates provided insufficient in reserves in the past. 'If we are asked
to pay even more money, I'm not sure where it is going to come from,' says
Mr Todd-Young.
He is also worried about the impact of legal action on Names who are not
involved at first-hand in litigation. 'The worst-hit Names are saying you
have got to help us. I'm saying I haven't got any money to pay my own
losses. I don't want to be accused of wanting to push the mortally wounded
off the boat, but litigation is a big worry.'
Rear-Admiral Nicholas Goodhart, who has retired to Craddock in Devon, says
Lloyd's is doing the best that can reasonably be expected. He applauds the
criticism of past mistakes and praises the market's intentions to reduce
costs. 'Some of the agents have done a valuable job. But, by Jove, they have
paid themselves for it,' he says.
A Name since 1978, underwriting Pounds 750,000 a year, Rear-Admiral Goodhart
has been hit by losses in 1988 and 1989, which have been aggravated because
of his membership of the Feltrim syndicates - which, like Gooda Walker,
specialised in 'spiral' reinsurance.
'Provided all the insiders don't take all the profits and leave all the
losses to the Names there is no reason why they shouldn't be profitable,' he
says. Even so he admits, 'I'd be better not to have joined. The losses have
caused a certain amount of worry. Our horns have been drawn in.'
Even the optimistic Names temper their reponse to the business plan with
concern about the market's recent rgulatory and management failures. Sir
Hugh Bidwell, the former Lord Mayor of London, and a Name at Lloyd's since
1986, is enthusiastic about the business plan, but says: 'So much of it is
sheer common-sense. It unbelievable that Lloyd's has been allowed to operate
without a central plan.'
Sir Hugh, who has reduced his commitment to the market to Pounds 450,000
after suffering big losses in 1989 and 1990, says that he 'can't wait' to
increase his participation again. Even so he warns: 'One shouldn't
underestimate the problems. It is only the first rung on the ladder and it
is a slippery ladder to climb.'
MAIN AIMS OF THE LLOYD'S BUSINESS PLAN
Names to get a 40 per cent pre-tax return
20 per cent pre-tax return for incorporated Names
Cut cost base by at least Pounds 190m
'Ring-fence' to be created to protect new capital from old-year liabilities
Continue negotiations to settle legal disputes
More independent regulation
Reduce managing agency fees
Establish central unit to carry out member agents' administrative functions
by 1994
Introduce Mapas (member agents pooling arrangements) to underwrite with 25
per cent deposit;
Admit incorporated capital for 1994
Introduce 'high-liquidity Names' with liquid assets of Pounds 500,000 or
more and 20 per cent deposit
End restriction on Pounds 3m upper premium income limit
Include US dollar securities as acceptable Names' deposit

FT  01 MAY 93 / Man in the News: Direct hit by boss of bosses - Peter Morgan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain, like many of its company boardrooms, is full of 'first-class people
putting in a second-class performance', claims Mr Peter Morgan,
director-general of the Institute of Directors and boss of bosses.
This week, he won applause from 2,000 company directors attending the
institute's annual convention at London's Royal Albert Hall by imploring
Britain to end its 'dreary pattern of postwar economic decline'.
His critique of past economic mistakes and his assertion that the economy
was recovering 'more or less over the dead bodies of Bank of England and
Treasury officials' was portrayed as untimely and unhelpful for a governing
party posing as the champion of business.
But the man who heads an organisation of 48,000 wealth-creators, all paying
homage to the entrepreneurial arts, insists his intervention was not a
betrayal.
A Welshman with a reputedly fiery temperament, he says his criticism was
directed less at present ministers and more at the Whitehall establishment
which has gripped successive governments by the throat.
Known as someone who likes making waves, Mr Morgan says he was also trying
to press upon industry its binding obligation to help drag Britain up from
the bottom of the international league of economic performance, where it
hovers above Greece, Portugal and Turkey.
'Britain has the talent, the leadership and the inventiveness, all the
ingredients for enterprise. Yet they don't come together,' he says.
The son of a West Glamorgan bank clerk who spent 30 years at IBM before
taking over at the IoD in 1989, Mr Morgan says Britain's lowly position
stems primarily from companies' lack of productivity, competitiveness and
employment and wealth-creating ability.
'If I were a politician I would be utterly frustrated because I would think
I was being let down,' he says. Having said that, government - 'I use it in
the generic sense' - is not free of sin. As a Trinity College, Cambridge,
historian, he mounts his favourite hobby horse to survey the
'anti-enterprise culture' which spread during the postwar decades of trade
union power and nationalisation.
The Thatcher years, however, were 'pretty successful', ushering in a
renaissance in attitudes and practices which offered 'an immediate,
measurable response' - such as productivity improvements and a halt to
Britain's declining share of world trade.
Then it all went wrong. Although he says there is no point in 'going over
and over' the messy end to the 1980s, he largely attributes the final,
calamitous errors under Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, to the
pernicious influence of senior civil servants. 'I am quite sure that no two
people have a greater commitment to controlling inflation than the present
prime minister and chancellor. But so did Lawson. When chancellors like that
end up as he did, you have to ask about the way the system works,' he says.
So a fundamental element in the 'radical new approach' to economic
management he outlined at the Albert Hall would be a strong, independent
Bank of England, removing excessive political discretion from macroeconomic
management and restoring sound money and financial instability. The
implication is that, without it, the government might again let inflation
rip.
The IoD, he is at pains to point out, does not expect the government to run
the economy, merely to provide the correct framework. It is in the
performance of the company sector that Britain's salvation lies, although
government can certainly help make its task easier.
Which leads to the remainder of his agenda. For the most part, it covers
pretty familiar territory.
Britain must have an education system which gives it indispensable skills
for the 21st century. Companies, Mr Morgan says, must exploit the full
potential of their employees by 'getting the ideas out of the heads of
management and into the hands of the workforce'. Business must exploit its
earning power through higher added value, by importing less and exporting
more.
Though there has been some progress, government must also dismantle the
burden of capital taxation; otherwise, its commitment to helping small
businesses in particular will be called into question: 'The perspective that
demands capital must be taxed and not allowed to fructify is bad.'
For an economy of its size, Mr Morgan suggests, Britain has more than its
fair share of world-class companies, but it is failing to flourish further
down the corporate scale. 'We do not have the all-important layer in the
middle.'
His 'radical agenda' begins to sound a bit like a pre-Budget shopping list.
But he does not apologise for seeking advantage for companies, upon which
everyone's future prosperity ultimately depends.
One of the 'brightest things on the horizon' is the revolution in attitudes
under way at the Department of Trade and Industry. In seeking to ensure
government does not move without considering the impact on business and in
drawing both together to win business, Mr Michael Heseltine 'is fulfilling
our agenda to the letter'.
Beyond the structural, however, there is the cultural. Donning his history
hat again, he says: 'If you go back in time, your name was what you did -
weaver, thatcher, butcher, baker, archer. But somehow we have lost a sense
of common economic purpose.'
There is also a cultural undercurrent which has difficulty dealing with
success. The public loves to attack directors for high earnings, though he
says people are beginning to understand that top management should be well
rewarded if they perform well.
Mr Morgan - whose IoD contract obliges him to maintain a couple of
directorships of his own - is not going to apologise for rewarding success.
But the 56-year-old Lloyd's underwriter adds: 'I will not defend
compensation which is not transparent in terms of performance.'
So how about revealing what the IoD pays him? The institute is not obliged
by statute to do so, but has recently been thinking about it. It intends to
disclose the sum soon. So why not now? Very well. Mr Morgan says he is paid
Pounds 146,000 a year.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Surveyors chart the damage to offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRUNT of the disruption from the Bishopsgate bomb was borne by overseas
financial institutions, which occupied half the damaged office space, an
assessment by chartered surveyors shows.
The bomb damaged 1.6m sq ft of offices, three quarters of which were
occupied by banks and financial advisers, the Herring Baker Harris report
says.
Professional services and insurance companies were also badly affected,
accounting for 14 per cent and 8 per cent of damaged offices respectively.
The explosion will reduce the vacancy rate in the City from 18.8 per cent to
17 per cent - it had reached unprecedented levels after surges in
construction.
The glut of empty City offices will be cut by up to 1m sq ft as a result of
demand from displaced tenants and the withdrawal from the market of vacant
space that was damaged. A third of the damaged offices were vacant. Another
third is expected to be habitable within a month.
More than a quarter of the buildings damaged by last year's IRA bomb were
caught up in the latest blast, especially those around Camomile Street.
Much of the affected area was re-developed in the late 1980s. A quarter of
the damaged buildings are less than 12 years old.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Labour urges freedom for post offices to diversify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday called for post offices to be free to diversify into new
lines of business such as ticket sales and financial services as part of a
blueprint for Post Office reform.
Under its proposals - which envisage a unified national postal service
remaining in the public sector - the party would set up an independent
regulator to set and monitor new service and performance targets.
It would examine ways of giving the Post Office access to the financial
markets to raise private capital for development projects.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, said when launching the proposals
yesterday that the party would review the body's corporate governance,
possibly setting up a supervisory board whose members would be 'more widely
drawn' than present Post Office directors.
Yesterday's announcement came two weeks after it emerged that the government
had decided to delay the possible privatisation of the Post Office until the
1994-95 parliamentary session at the earliest.
Ministers are expected to make a parliamentary statement on the outcome of
the government's Post Office review before the end of the present session in
July or August.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has still to decide
whether to sell the organisation as one unit or split it into two or three
parts based on its constituent sections - the Royal Mail, Post Office
Counters and Parcelforce.
Labour's statement suggests there is some common ground between the two main
parties as ministers are also keen for Post Office Counters to branch out
into new businesses.
This is seen as a way of improving the financial performance of the
thousands of post offices which do not cover their costs and must be
subsidised from the Post Office's other activities.
Ministerial discussions on the issue have been given fresh impetus by
Department of Social Security moves to encourage pensioners and recipients
of other benefits to receive payments through automated credit transfers
instead of via the Post Office.

FT  01 MAY 93 / City critical of government after bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORGANISATIONS IN the City of London strongly criticised the government
following the IRA bomb at Bishopsgate last Saturday, according to an FT/MORI
survey.
Only one third said they were either 'fairly satisfied' or 'very satisfied'
with the performance of the government in dealing with the problems caused
by the IRA, while 34 per cent were 'fairly' or 'very dissatisfied'.
When asked about reasons for their dissatisfaction most highlighted a
perceived failure by the government to change the political situation in
Northern Ireland. 'The same stance as 30 years ago has not achieved a
result,' said one.
One commented: 'There seem to be no new initiatives - they always react to
everything after it's happened.' Another said: 'The problem has to be
tackled before bombs get into trucks.'
Several called on the government to increase its commitment to finding a
solution, suggesting measures such as better intelligence, improved security
and tighter co-ordination. Less than a third had positive comments on the
performance of the government following the bombing, while 17 per cent said
they rated it 'poor' or 'very poor'. Fifty-nine per cent were positive about
the role of the press.
But the Corporation of London received high praise, with nearly three
quarters rating it 'very' or 'fairly good'. The police received positive
comments from 60 per cent of organisations, and the fire service from nearly
half.
Most said the police or the City corporation should co-ordinate greater
security between companies in future.
Eighty-four cent of organisations supported a greater police presence on the
streets of the City to prevent terrorism, 79 per cent wanted the police to
have powers to set up road blocks when they felt it necessary and 74 per
cent wanted formal co-ordination of security arrangements by organisations
in the City.
Just less than three-quarters said they already had a formal contingency
plan with which to respond to crises such as a terrorist bomb, of which 26
per cent put the plans into operation after the explosion.
The proportion of organisations with plans fell to two-thirds for
organisations with less than 1,000 employees. The highest proportion without
plans were investment houses, regulators and accountants.
Most of those with contingency plans had only developed them very recently,
with 45 per cent formalised since the bomb at the Baltic Exchange in April
last year.
More than a quarter of organisations said that some of their City workforce
was unable to work on the Monday after the bombing, with the worst affected
being investment houses. Even by Wednesday, 15 per cent of companies said
none of their workforce was working.
Operations were also affected in other ways. Several companies mentioned
that they helped others with accommodation and other assistance.
Some had work disrupted because of damage to clients' or customers' offices.
At least two mentioned difficulties in getting access to their buildings
after the bombing.
Half of companies already had external security cameras and 48 per cent had
toughened glass. Nearly four-fifths had introduced greater controls on entry
to their buildings.
Nearly a quarter of companies said that they would consider installing
cameras following the bombing, 15 per cent a redesign of office
accommodation and 19 per cent moving key functions permanently to less
vulnerable locations.

Mayfair, following its demerger from ICI. It expects to move about 100 staff
out of ICI's Millbank headquarters by the end of the year.

Colleagues in the water industry said that he had been depressed following
diagnosis of the illness, which many had suspected for months.
Sir Roy, 67, has not contacted his family or Thames Water since his driver
left him at his Battersea flat at 2pm on Tuesday.
Police divers were reported to have searched the River Thames near his flat

THE BRITISH and Irish governments 'are at one' on Northern Ireland, Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said yesterday.
After talks in Dublin with Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, Mr
Hurd said: 'We need a fair and widely acceptable political agreement . . .
which has to cover all three strands of talks that are taking place.'
Mr Hurd reinforced recent statements by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern
Ireland secretary, that there could be no 'internal settlement' in the
province and any solution had to take into account the relations between the
two governments, their relationships with Northern Ireland, and
relationships between the Northern Ireland parties - hence the three
'strands'.
The last such talks on Northern Ireland's future administration ended last
November without any significant agreement. The Unionist parties - and the
Democratic Unionist party in particular - have since laid down a
precondition that the Irish government must drop its territorial claim to
the province, written in its constitution, before any new talks can begin.
Both Mr Hurd and Mr Spring reaffirmed, however, their determination to see
the talks resumed. When asked about the controversial move last month by Mr
John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic Labour party, to hold talks with
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, at the latter's request, Mr Spring said:
'Our position is that which it has always been, that the government will not
enter into talks with the men of violence. If they move away from violence
then that opens possibilities for them to enter talks . . . Mr Hume is an
experienced politician and I like to think he knows what he is doing.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Security cameras catch the eye: The early success of a
surveillance system in Northampton town centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHAMPTON has long been proud of its historic battles, its shoe-making and
its cricket. Recently a different kind of reputation has drawn the attention
of politicians, senior police officers and business leaders to this Midlands
town.
In the wake of last weekend's devastating bomb in the City of London, local
officials are finding themselves inundated with inquiries about the town
centre's closed-circuit television surveillance system.
Other towns have them but none on such a concentrated and integrated scale
as in Northampton, where 96 cameras linked to a central system cover the
main shopping areas and car parks.
Mr Norman Howells, the council's head of finance and operations, said: 'The
push for this came from the public and the traders. The crime threat was not
as great as people imagined, but the public wanted us to install a system
that made them feel safer. It was a question of confidence.'
All the cameras in the town are linked to a control room housed in an office
above the town's main multi-storey car park. There two operators working
eight-hour shifts sit in front of rows of monitors - some split into four,
others providing full-screen images.
They can spot and record anything that is going on at any time in all the
town's central pedestrian and vehicle routes.
The controllers, employed by Firm Security Group, a private security
company, sit at panels controlling camera angles and freezing pictures.
They have a telephone link to the police, and at night the system becomes
the responsibility of the local police force, which has another set of
monitors in the nearby station.
The visual accuracy and speed of the system in identifying vehicles and
individuals is impressive. At about midday on Thursday I watched one monitor
capture a truck on screen which had temporarily parked with flashing lights
outside the town's main hotel. After zooming in from a wide-angle
perspective of the street, the camera provided a clear close-up shot of the
driver.
The truck - similar in size to the one that exploded in the City at the
weekend - turned out to be known locally. But had action been needed the
operator would have contacted the police, who would have checked the vehicle
on their monitors before taking between one minute and five to arrive on the
spot.
Chief Inspector John Cordner of Northampton Police said that the system was
primarily a deterrent and a provider of supporting evidence. It could not
provide a guarantee that security would not be breached.
Its main success in the month it has been fully operational has been in
providing evidence leading to 17 arrests. Both council leaders and police
insist that the system can provide better security than simple foot or
vehicle policing and is cost-effective.
The system has been introduced during the past 2 1/2 years and 85 per cent
of all crimes in the areas monitored have been solved by the police. The
public seem to like it.
The management of the car park believe that the 12 per cent increase in
customers over the past year, in spite of the recession, is a mark of public
confidence.
The council spent Pounds 280,000 installing the full system, with Pounds
20,000 provided by the private sector, but it cannot afford to use the
cameras' full potential.
To monitor every vehicle would require about 32 individuals sitting without
interruption for 24 hours - about five times the present staffing.
Mr Leon Barwell, director of sales and marketing with Firm Security Group,
said the aim was to make the most cost-effective use of the system.
Chief Insp Cordner, reluctant to endorse it as a complete solution, said:
'Its only an aid. It's as good as the people who are monitoring it. You
still need people to make a judgment.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Pictures of lorry bombers released
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of London Police have released video pictures of two men walking
away from the parked lorry containing the bomb which devastated Bishopsgate
in the City.
The enhanced pictures from a commercial video tape taken by a camera mounted
in Bishopsgate show two men walking south and apart down the street just
before 9am. Both are wearing hooded jackets to hide their faces.
Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, said:
'We are convinced these are the two men who left the lorry and it is
reasonable to assume they are the bombers.' Witnesses, he said, had
confirmed seeing them getting out of the lorry parked 200 to 300 yards away
from where the film was shot.
The first man, seen getting out of the driver's side, was between 5ft 8in
and 5ft 9in and stockily built. He wore a slate grey three-quarter length
anorak and dark trousers. Immediately he got out of the lorry, he pulled his
hood up.
His passenger was slimmer and about 5ft 9in tall, wearing pale blue jeans
and a blue and white mottled jean jacket with a hooded jogging top
underneath. He also pulled the hood up to hide his face.
Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, appealed to all premises
to check for any tapes which police had not seen.
Mr Kelly said the pictures showed the value of security cameras. 'I urge
those who don't already have them to acquire them. Those who do should check
they are operating properly. One common fault is the tapes wear and don't
give very good images and so should be changed regularly.'
Police repeated an appeal for help in tracing the movements of the lorry,
which was stolen on March 20 in Staffordshire and was later painted blue.

MISS Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the Commons, will consider over the
weekend which amendments to the Maastricht legislation should be chosen for
debate and vote on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week when MPs resume their
detailed discussion of the bill. She will announce her decisions on Tuesday.
The most contentious question is whether she will allow MPs to vote on an
amendment, which has attracted wide support from opposition parties and Tory
Euro-sceptics, to exclude from the bill the social protocol, which contains
both the social chapter and the UK's 'opt-out' from it.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Strike to hit BA flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASSENGERS flying British Airways from London Gatwick were warned yesterday
to expect disruption over the holiday weekend after airline cabin crew voted
to stage a 24-hour strike from midnight tonight.
The strike has been called by the TGWU general union following a vote in
favour of action by cabin staff protesting at plans to transfer some BA
routes to a subsidiary company set up after the flag carrier took over Dan
Air in October last year.
As part of BA's plan to cut costs on the loss-making routes the subsidiary
carrier will pay lower wages to newly-recruited staff. BA said existing
staff who transferred to the subsidiary would not have their pay cut.
The flights that could be delayed or cancelled are to Geneva, Faro, Naples,
Genoa, Bordeaux, Malaga, Frankfurt, Copenhagen, Bergamo and Madrid. BA
advised passengers to telephone the airline for news and said it hoped to
get people away on other services.
Although cabin staff voted by 175 to 35 to take industrial action, domestic
flights, long-haul journeys and flights from Heathrow would not be affected,
according to BA.
Union officials said yesterday that the BA management had 'miscalculated
badly by assuming that our cabin crew would quietly accept their work being
done on worse pay and conditions'. It called on the company to 'call off its
provocative plan to impose this measure on a loyal group of dedicated
professionals'.
BA said yesterday: 'We are very disappointed that the action disrupts the
travel plans of the very people whose business will save jobs at Gatwick.
Only by encouraging more passengers on to our short-haul services can we get
our Gatwick operations into profit and protect employment.'
The TGWU is also balloting 18,000 British Airways ground staff, clerical
workers and cabin crew on industrial action over contracting-out of services
and the setting up of subsidiary companies operating under allegedly worse
conditions. The ballot result is expected at the end of the month.
The British Airways board yesterday gave its public backing to Sir Colin
Marshall, the airline's chairman, and Mr Robert Ayling, its managing
director, following demands by Virgin Atlantic Airways that they should
resign.
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, challenged the two to resign earlier
this week after renewed allegations in a television documentary that they
had been aware of their airline's 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin.
The number of passengers passing through Birmingham International Airport
rose 10.8 per cent to a record 3.885m in the year to March, largely because
of an increase in charter services. Traffic in 1991-92 was affected by
recession and the Gulf War.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Fall in unsold empty homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of unsold empty homes, inhibiting a revival of thehousing market,
has fallen by a third since the beginning of last year, stockbrokers UBS
said.
A report published yesterday by Mr John Wriglesworth, the broker's housing
market analyst, estimated that the number of empty properties had fallen
from 225,000 to 150,000.
He forecast that house sales would rise 20 per cent this year, reducing the
number of empty properties to 120,000 by the end of the year - a normal
stock level in a reasonable market.
Mr Wriglesworth said the rise in sales would not, however, be accompanied by
a significant rise in prices this year, due to the overhang of unsold
properties on the market and continuing concern over rising unemployment and
the state of the eco-nomy.
He forecast that prices would rise 7 per cent next year as buyers became
encouraged by more stable house prices, low mortgage rates and slower
increases in unemployment.
UBS estimated that there were 1.9m UK householders owning homes with values
of less than the money borrowed to buy them. More than 1.5m of those
suffering from negative equity lived in southern England, the broker said.
Mr Wriglesworth said: 'The supply of properties for sale in the south,
especially those suitable for first-time buyers, is likely to be more
limited, resulting in more pressure for house prices to rise as demand
grows.
'In Greater London we expect house prices to rise by 10 per cent next year,
over double the national inflation rate for retail prices.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Palace tours 'priced too low'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS at Buckingham Palace have made a marketing blunder by pricing its
entrance charge at Pounds 8 when the market would sustain almost twice that,
says the English Tourist Board.
Mr Mike Richardson, the board's marketing director, said: 'It's drastically
under-priced. They should be charging Pounds 15 for adults. This is going to
be a bonanza and also a field day for ticket touts, because at Pounds 8
there will be room for margins.'
Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday that it would open to the public for
the first time. It will be open for eight weeks from the second half of
August each year until the end of 1997. Tourist industry executives said
they expected the scheme would prove so successful that it would continue
indefinitely.
Mr Richardson added: 'There are millions of people out there who want a
slice of the royal family and this is the only way they can get it. They
must have been scared about accusations of ripping the public off. But they
needn't be worried about that because the public will want to pay a premium
for the best.'
The tourist industry estimated yesterday that the palace's maximum capacity
per day would be 10,000 visitors, giving a possible total of 600,000 this
year.
A number of important technical aspects - such as whether there will be
advance tickets or if people will be expected to queue - were still unclear
yesterday, though the palace had set up an information line for inquiries.
Yesterday the palace declined to comment on any aspect of its marketing
policy concerning London's latest attraction.
It said Thursday's announcement 'was the beginning and now everything will
be gone through in detail to be ready for opening in the second week of
August'. Buckingham Palace announced yesterday that Saturday August 7 will
be the first day the general public will be allowed to visit.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Contractors warned on bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACTORS bidding for work in the public sector have been advised by their
trade association to ask for an extensive list of information about the
existing work-force.
The Cleaning and Support Services Association said the information was
needed so contractors could assess their potential liabilities if the
contract was covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) regulations 1981.
Where Tupe regulations apply, a contractor must take over the existing
workforce at existing pay and conditions.
Mr John Hall, CSSA director-general, said that while the regulations did not
always apply, there was a risk that they would 'in almost every case',
depending on 'fine legal interpretations and on how the contractor decides
to perform the work'. As a matter of good commercial practice, bidders
needed full details of the potential liabilities they were taking on, he
said.
The information needed includes a list of all staff employed on the work,
their terms and conditions, reckonable service, accrued pension rights and
current health.

FT  01 MAY 93 / More teachers vote to boycott testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the government to suspend school testing mounted yesterday with
the announcement that members of a second teachers' union have voted
overwhelmingly to boycott the tests.
The normally moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers announced that
its members in schools voted by an 82.7 per cent majority to boycott testing
in connection with the national curriculum. The turnout was 57 per cent.
The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers is already
boycotting the tests, after members voted 88 per cent in favour of action.
The largest union, the National Union of Teachers, is also consulting
members on a boycott in a ballot which ends on May 10.
Mr Peter Smith, the ATL's general secretary, urged the government not to
ignore the result. He said: 'The ATL is not known as a trigger-happy union
when it comes to industrial action. The concern shown by our members is
probably a litmus paper test for the feelings on this issue among teachers.'
The ATL vote led to renewed calls on the government to suspend the testing
for this year, until the completion of the review of the national curriculum
tests under Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the new School Curriculum and
Assessment Authority.
Mr David Hart of the National Association of Head Teachers said the ATL vote
'virtually guarantees' that every school in the country would be affected by
boycotts.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, refused to comment on the ballot
result. An Education Department spokesman said the vote was not in the
interests of pupils, parents or teachers. Sir Ron Dearing yesterday set out
his programme for reviewing the national curriculum and testing procedures
in schools, including a survey of 1,400 schools and 200 bodies representing
teachers, parents, governors and employers.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Law Society loses first round in legal aid battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LAW Society yesterday lost the first round of its battle with the Lord
Chancellor over legal aid.
The solicitors' governing body failed to persuade the High Court to block
Lord Mackay's proposals to change the way in which solicitors are paid for
criminal legal aid work in magistrates' courts.
The society had accused Lord Mackay of acting outside his powers under the
1988 Legal Aid Act by replacing hourly-based fees with a standard fees
system.
The Lord Chancellor's desire for economy had overridden the need to act both
lawfully and rationally, it said.
But Lord Justice Leggatt, sitting with Mr Justice McCullough, said once the
court was satisfied the Lord Chancellor had not acted illegally and that his
decision was not so absurd that it could be said he had taken leave of his
senses, it was 'no part of its function to adjudicate on the merits of an
administrative scheme'.
The judge said it was evident that Lord Mackay had exercised the broad
discretion given him by parliament under the 1988 act to introduce the new
system and Lord Mackay had taken account of all the factors he was required
to.
He suggested that the Law Society might wish to take stock of the wisdom of
continuing its challenge. 'It might do better to see how the amended scheme
works and then press for improvements,' he said.
After the hearing Mr John Appleby, chairman of the society's courts and
legal services committee, said they would take advice before deciding
whether to appeal. 'It is now clear the powers the Lord Chancellor was
granted under the Legal Aid Act are wider than anyone had previously thought
and that he can restrict access to justice simply by cutting or restricting
lawyers' fees,' he said.
The society believes the new scheme will overpay some lawyers and underpay
others.
Mr Appleby stressed that the society's separate legal challenge to the
government's legal aid eligibility cuts was unaffected by yesterday's
decision. That case will be heard at the end of May.
Red Hot Television, the satellite pornography channel, is 'more likely to
fail than succeed' when it challenges a UK broadcasting ban in the European
Court, the Court of Appeal said yesterday.
Giving its reasons for refusing to grant the channel an injunction against
the government's decision to impose a ban, the court rejected Red Hot's
argument that the High Court judges who originally refused an injunction
failed to consider the prospects of success in Europe - one of the factors
which affect the granting of such injunctions.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Court rules personal-contract 'sweeteners' illegal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFERING of financial incentives to staff by employers to assist the
de-recognition of trade unions is a breach of employment law, the Court of
Appeal ruled yesterday.
In a judgment with widespread implications for the introduction of personal
contracts throughout industry, three judges decided that employers' use of
incentives amounted to unlawful discrimination against an employee's right
to belong to a union. The judges upheld two appeals by members of the
transport union RMT and the National Union of Journalists whose employers,
Associated British Ports and Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily
Mail, had offered pay increases to staff prepared to sign personal contracts
but denied them to those who wanted to remain union members.
Lord Justice Dillon said this amounted to a breach of section 23 of the
Employment Protection Act 1978, which protects employees' rights to belong
to a union. He rejected the employers' argument that if individuals were
given a choice, such as accepting a personal contract or remaining in a
union, they were not being penalised.
Lord Dillon said the judgment did not affect the right of employers to
de-recognise unions or to require changes in employees' terms and
conditions.
But employers enter a potential danger area offering a 'douceur' (sweetener)
to employees who support their policy but not to those opposed to it, he
said.
The court's ruling was welcomed by the two unions which had brought the
appeals.
Mr John Foster, general secretary of the NUJ, said it amounted to a
substantial reassertion of union rights which would have widespread
implications for attempts by employers to introduce personal contracts. The
NUJ is dealing with a series of similar cases from the newspaper industry.
Mr Paul Statham, a lawyer for RMT, said more union members would be able to
seek redress from industrial tribunals if they believed they had been
penalised because of their union membership.
Although ABP ruled out a further appeal, Associated Newspapers said it would
appeal to the House of Lords.
'The Court of Appeal's decision has thrown the law into confusion,'
Associated said.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Engineers urged to establish single body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S 42 professional engineering institutions could be merged into a
single body in the second half of the 1990s under controversial proposals
unveiled yesterday by Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering
Council.
The main recommendation is for a new relationship between the council and
the professional institutions to be drawn up at the end of this year.
Institutions would be grouped into colleges, and the steering group formed
by Sir John recommends that the council and institutions should produce a
proposal by the end of 1995 to move gradually from the new relationship to a
single institution.
'We do believe that a single institution would be a logical step to ensure
our overall objectives are met,' Sir John said. Presidents of the four
biggest institutions, while 'warmly welcoming' the proposals, said the case
for a single engineering institution had yet to be made.
However, Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers'
Federation, said: 'It identifies the main concerns of companies employing
engineers, including improving the influence and status of the engineering
profession.'
Sir John said the profession lacked recognition because it found it hard to
speak with a single voice.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Actions of BBC governors attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW WAY forward for the BBC, putting emphasis on a clearer definition of
its role and increased accountability, was proposed by the Labour party
yesterday as its contribution to the debate on the corporation's future.
The board of governors would be replaced by a board of trustees who would be
more independent and representative, and have much less scope to become
involved in the day-to-day management of the organisation.
Other suggestions include replacing the corporation's charter with
legislation that could be amended by parliament, and adopting a 'covenant'
setting out the BBC's obligations to licence-fee payers.
The discussion paper, called Putting the Citizen at the Centre of British
Broadcasting, is critical of the governors, saying that recently they have
been playing 'an increasingly active and possibly improper role' in the
BBC's management, undermining public confidence in its independence and
integrity.
It envisages that the proposed board of trustees would act as regulators,
and make an annual report to parliament. A cross-party committee of MPs
could examine potential trustees to see if they were suitable.
The paper emphasises that the central issue is the BBC's independence must
be strengthened, and that politicians must not be allowed to control it.
Labour also proposes a new viewers' and listeners' council to provide a more
direct voice for licence-fee payers. This would take on the roles of the
Broadcasting Standards Council and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.
Ms Ann Clwyd, the shadow national heritage secretary, said: 'The BBC must
become more open and accountable to the views and interests of its viewers
and listeners on whose behalf it operates.'

FT  01 MAY 93 / Brown redirects Labour's economic strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday started the task of
producing a credible opposition economic strategy with the completion of a
lengthy policy document underlining Labour's break with public ownership,
spending and tax levels.
The document, sent to the party's new policy-making forum for discussion
before this year's party conference, eschews traditional ideology in favour
of improving the economy's productive potential.
Its ambition is to present Labour's economic strategy as the ally of the
individual by arguing that government-backed investment in training and
industry is a prerequisite for individual advancement.
Mr Brown, launching the new policies in Corby, Northamptonshire, said the
proposals were 'grounded in a philosophy in which a strong and prosperous
community advances individual opportunity and ensures investment in our
future'.
The document adds: 'Instead of the old battle between public and private
sectors, it is our objective to mobilise the energies of both.'
But the shadow chancellor adheres to the central principle that 'responsible
government intervention' is essential to sustained growth and high
employment levels.
Entitled Labour's New Approach, the document says its starting point is a
recognition 'that Britain's problems cannot be solved by the application of
crude free-market economics'.
It adds that the emphasis of the Conservatives on inflation control as the
sole objective of macro-economic policy must be replaced by a strategy
embracing sustainable growth, a manageable balance of payments and high
employment levels, as well as low inflation.
Mr Brown identifies individual skills as the most important ingredient of
industrial competitiveness in the 1990s. The government's role is to ensure
that individuals receive enough training to reach their potential and to
improve the economy's productive capacity.
He advocates public/private sector partnerships in rebuilding the nation's
infrastructure and in developing regional and industrial strategies. He
suggests the establishment of a network of regional development agencies and
banks, tax and social security incentives for skills training and penalties
for 'entrenched interests' that limit opportunity and choice.
This group is said to include banks offering poor service, the 'Tory
financial establishment', privatised monopolies which overcharge and
irresponsible employers who neglect training.
The document carefully omits specific spending pledges but hints how a
future Labour government would finance its proposed investment in education
and training, infrastructure and industrial investment by suggesting a
restructuring of the national accounts.
Government investment would be separated in the accounts from spending and
borrowing needed to pay for current expenditure and the servicing of past
debts.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Bank's role examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROSS-PARTY group of MPs is to look again at whether the Bank of England
should be independent, as part of an extensive inquiry into the Bank's role.
The Treasury select committee's investigation will cover the Bank's
relationship with the government and with parliament - both in its own right
and in the light of the Maastricht treaty - and also its supervisory
activity. Ministers have repeatedly made it clear that they do not support
the idea of giving the Bank independence, and the report could provoke a
sharp clash between the government and the Tory-dominated committee.
The committee is due to start hearing evidence in about mid-May and the
inquiry is expected to last through until the summer recess, probably at the
end of July.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Deficits stifling initiatives: Bundesbank's Issing warns of
threat to economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's public sector finances are in no state to support collaborative
efforts to promote economic growth, Mr Otmar Issing, a senior Bundesbank
director, said yesterday.
The rhetoric might appeal to the media, but strategies such as the European
Community's growth initiative, agreed at the Edinburgh summit last December,
led all too easily to 'loose money policies' - mainly with borrowed funds,
he told a private meeting in Frankfurt.
A new 'programmes era' appeared to have dawned, with worldwide calls for
joint initiatives.
The European project, for example, proposed the application of 'all
available' budget policy measures, a European investment fund and new loan
facilities for the European Investment Bank.
But if expansive fiscal policies were capable of promoting sustained growth,
the question had to be asked why this way was still not being resolutely
pursued, Mr Issing said.
'The sobering answer is to be found in the lamentable state of public
finances.'
Budget imbalances had worsened last year, partly because opportunities for
consolidation during better times had not been taken, he claimed.
Average EC deficits and debt ratios increased to 5.5 per cent and 63 per
cent respectively of gross domestic product in 1992. New peaks would be
reached this year when, apart from Luxembourg, all member states would be
further than ever from meeting the convergence criteria laid down for
economic and monetary union (Emu).
To avoid possible misunderstandings, Mr Issing said he was not against
policies directed at common interests. However, he wanted to warn against
'high expectations and illusions'.
In a renewed defence of the Bundesbank's much-criticised strategy, he also
warned against using interest rates and monetary policy as political
instruments to rouse flagging economies.
Referring indirectly to frequent reminders offered to the Bundesbank that it
had an overall economic responsibility and that interest rate cuts were
needed to promote growth, he said that the more lending rates were used as
political instruments, the more stability suffered.
'More liquidity instead of more capital would enter circulation.' In the
end, monetary policy would have fulfilled its intended role but finance and
pay policy would probably have not, Mr Issing claimed.
In a thinly-veiled warning to his German audience, he said those who set
most store by stable money would suffer most. Monetary policy would lose its
credibility and a core economic asset would have been gambled away.
After three recent reductions, Bundesbank policy-makers are rapidly using up
their current room for manoeuvre on official interest rates, and are tending
increasingly in speeches and policy statements to turn up the pressure on
government and pay negotiators.
The central bank's annual report was sharply critical of recent budget
shuffles which instead of cutting public spending added the equivalent of 2
per cent of gross national product to German tax and welfare contributions.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Sell gold, IMF urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, yesterday suggested that the
International Monetary Fund should sell some of its gold to help finance IMF
assistance for the poorest developing nations.
In his speech to the IMF's policy-making interim committee, Mr Lamont said
he 'would not rule out some modest sales of IMF gold to fund at least part'
of a successor to the IMF's extended structural adjustment facility (ESAF)
which provides funds at token interest rates to poor developing nations
carrying out economic reforms.
The ESAF totals SDRs6bn (about Pounds 5.5bn) and is due to expire next
November. The industrialised countries that provide the fund have so far
been unable to agree on how to finance a successor, largely because of the
budgetary constraints on most of them.
British officials said preliminary discussions had been held in the IMF
board of directors about whether to sell some of the Fund's gold. Although
Mr Lamont put forward the idea in his speech yesterday, he is not committed
to it, they said. 'He wants to see the issue explored,' one added.
One suggestion put forward by the British Treasury was that the IMF should
sell between 10m and 15m ounces of gold over 10 years to provide about half
the funds needed for new ESAF funds. Because ESAF costs only build up
gradually, the gold sales would not need to begin until 1996.
Britain is keen for the international community to agree on a successor to
ESAF because it believes it is a good policy instrument for spreading sound
economic policies in developing countries.
The UK also has close ties with many of the countries that use ESAF funds,
particularly in Africa.
The IMF sold gold in 1976 to set up a trust fund that was a precursor of
ESAF and also provided finance for developing countries.
However, the present IMF management has been hostile to further gold sales.
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, has described the IMF's gold
as the 'jewel of the family'.
The IMF's gold holdings amount to 103.44m ounces and are valued
conservatively at 35 special drawing rights an ounce in the IMF's accounts.
A substantial obstacle to IMF sales of gold is the condition that they must
be approved by 85 per cent of the total voting power of the Fund's members.

FT  01 MAY 93 / IFC to seek Russian joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Finance Corporation will move aggressively to find
investment opportunities in Russia in partnership with foreign companies,
Sir William Ryrie, the IFC's executive vice president, said yesterday.
Although Russia's present economic crisis and high inflation was a big
deterrent to foreign investment, Sir William said, the medium to long-term
potential for foreign investment was very large.
Russia joined the IFC two weeks ago, opening up the possibility of direct
investment in the country by the corporation. The IFC, which is the member
of the World Bank group charged with promoting private investment in
developing and former communist countries, is likely to focus its attention
first on the oil and gas industries, the hotel business and
telecommunications.
The IFC has been active in promoting privatisation in Russia since late
1991. It pioneered the privatisation of small-scale enterprises and
transport services in the Nizhny Novgorod region and is now helping Russia
to sell off medium-sized and big enterprises.
According to officials, the interest of Russians in acquiring privatised
companies is growing in spite of the economic crisis in the country. So far
42,000 of 275,000 small enterprises in Russia have been privatised, the IFC
said.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Golf indicator shows Japan's economy is in a fair way:
Robert Thomson charts the club membership index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a hint of recovery in money supply growth, and stock prices have
risen in recent weeks, but the most positive indication that Japan is
finally out of the bunker of recession is a sudden upswing in the Nikkei
Golf Membership Index.
Golf club memberships had promised the perfect balance for Japanese
investors, who were able to watch their membership certificates appreciate
rapidly in the late 1980s, the 'bubble era', and be assured of a round of
golf on the country's overcrowded courses.
The bubble collapsed, and membership prices dropped 64 per cent in three
years, a particularly nasty fall for about half the certificate holders who
never bothered to play golf and saw the investment as a valuable means of
diversifying their government bond and stock portfolios.
However, in the past two weeks, the Nikkei golf index has risen just over 4
per cent, and the membership brokers who run the active secondary market in
certificates are confident that punters will be rushing back to the course
in the hope of making a quick profit.
More important, the golf index, an aggregate of memberships at 500 leading
clubs, is regarded as a leading indicator of the property market. Mr Paul
Heaton, financials specialist at Smith New Court, said trading in the
certificates was a 'very useful guide' to the real economy.
'The Japanese property market is extremely illiquid, whereas these
certificates are very liquid instruments. The recovery of prices is a good
reflection of the remarkable change in economic confidence over the past few
weeks,' Mr Heaton said.
But the reputation of golf certificates has been tainted by scandal. Owners
of the Ibaraki Country Club, near Tokyo, sold 60,000 memberships instead of
the promised 1,830, undermining the market, while several brokers have gone
bust, and police have found that some greenkeepers are gangsters in
disguise.
In the hope of encouraging stock market prices, the Finance Ministry has
restricted new listings, but about 350 golf courses are under construction
and these 'new listings', equal to about 20 per cent of the current total,
could overwhelm investor demand. One hope for the 190 brokers is that
interest rates have fallen far enough to prompt investors to look for better
returns on their money.
Mr Hideo Hayashi, general manager of Shinwa Golf Services, a leading broker,
said the market had definitely hit bottom, and investors had started buying.
But he fears Japanese banks have lost their fondness for the certificates,
which have added to their bad loan burdens. 'In the late 1980s, banks would
provide around 90 per cent of the value of the certificates, but now they
will only lend to 60 or 70 per cent,' he says .
Japanese banks consistently argue that they provided funds to no more than
70 per cent of a certificate's value, but it is clear that institutions were
lending at far higher levels in the late 1980s. Given that prices at some
clubs have fallen by as much as 80 per cent, these banks are hoping that
younger Japanese or, perhaps, their own staff quickly develop a passion for
the game.
A membership certificate, now selling for an average Y20m (Pounds 117,600),
had a certain sacredness in Japan because it entitled the holder to claim a
share of the club, in theory, a small patch of green on the fairway or,
sometimes, an unwanted place in the financial rough.
Clubs encouraged members to feel rich, an important attraction for Japanese
who do not feel they are wealthy in spite of the country's impressive GNP
figures. But clubs which promised the most prestige have brought some of the
greatest disappointment.
The Gentry Hills Golf Club collapsed, leaving members to fight court battles
over ownership. Membership prices at the Classic Golf Club have fallen by 78
per cent, and the Gatsby Golf Club issued 15 times more memberships than
promised.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Keating backs Miyazawa on trade protest
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA yesterday expressed strong support for Japan's rejection of
President Bill Clinton's call for a 'managed trade' regime to help reduce
the US trade deficit with Japan.
During talks in Canberra, Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister,
told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese premier, that Australia was
'concerned' by the US proposal, which was rejected by Mr Miyazawa this
month.
Mr Keating told Mr Miyazawa that he admired his 'forthright and strong'
opposition to the US proposals, which Mr Clinton believes would reduce the
trade deficit by setting targets for certain sectors.
Australian officials said the two prime ministers agreed to oppose managed
trade, which Mr Keating fears would damage trade between Japan and third
countries.
Japanese officials said the talks made clear that Australia and Japan shared
a common view on managed trade. However, Mr Miyazawa said later that there
was no need for the two countries to 'get together to oppose the US'.
'I don't think the US will exercise managed trade. I told President Clinton
it would not be practical or good. All the countries in the Pacific are
against managed trade.'
The talks, which follow Mr Keating's visit to Japan in September, confirmed
earlier indications that Canberra is emerging as a close ally of Tokyo,
especially on trade issues.
Mr Miyazawa said the talks marked 'a new era' in relations with Australia,
which he described as 'an invaluable friend'. Australia is one of the few
countries to run a significant trade surplus with Japan.
The only difficult moment in the talks appears to have come when Mr Keating
raised the sensitive issue of Japan's closed rice market, which Australian
farmers want to see opened to imports.
Mr Miyazawa gave no ground on allowing foreign rice imports, but Australian
officials said he indicated that Japan was considering other market access
initiatives in an attempt to stimulate agreement in the Uruguay Round talks
on Gatt.
'Japan is determined to strike a positive stance on the problem of access to
the market,' he said after the talks.
Mr Miyazawa also said he supported suggestions by Mr Keating that the
15-country Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Process (Apec) could be
strengthened to encourage liberal trading in the region.
Mr Keating has called for solid progress at Apec's next ministerial meeting
in Seattle in November and urged a framework for harmonising trade and
investment rules and resolving trade disputes between members.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Governments' powers to defend currencies are dwindling

INTERNATIONAL investors are being given increased powers by the
liberalisation of financial markets to force policy changes on governments,
an International Monetary Fund study has concluded.
The report amounts to an admission by the governments of leading industrial
nations that they have limited powers to keep their currencies within agreed
limits when faced with severe market strains. The study is one of a series
of official inquests into the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism
between last September and early this year.
It concludes that, when faced with heavy selling of their currencies by
investors, governments' ability to influence markets by currency
intervention or interest rate changes is severely constrained.
The report says: 'The discipline exerted by capital markets over government
policies is neither infallible nor is it always applied smoothly and
consistently. Nevertheless, the markets eventually decide on what are
unsustainable situations, and when they do, their size alone increasingly
allows them to force adjustments.'
The study reflects the tone of another report on the currency turbulence by
Mr Lamberto Dini, deputy governor of the Bank of Italy, delivered to finance
ministers from leading industrial nations in Washington yesterday. Although
the Dini study contains no specific policy recommendations, it warns against
the re-introduction of exchange controls.
The best way for a country to avoid pressure on its currency, Mr Dini
concluded, is rigorous medium-term policies.
The Dini report underlined that international monetary stability requires
close consultation among countries to identify inconsistent policies and
encourage policy changes where these are needed.
Ministers welcomed the report yesterday, but some regretted that Mr Dini had
not been more positive about the powers of governments to influence the
exchange markets by selling and buying currencies.
'The report could perhaps have made more of the effectiveness of
intervention when the conditions are right. It is not always the size of the
intervention, it is choosing the right moment,' said Mr Edmond Alphandery,
the French economics minister.
Mr Alphandery said the report showed the need for new prudential regulations
for the foreign exchange market, because so much currency trading is carried
off banks' balance sheets, but he warned that more needed to be done to
strengthen supervision of non-bank participants in the exchange markets.
The IMF study says that as a result of worldwide financial liberalisation,
Dollars 1m trillion (Pounds 649.3bn) a day is swopped among investors on
currency markets. This development can lead to up to Dollars 200bn being of
investment being switched out of a specific currency within one week.
Faced with such large flows of money, the ability of central banks to use
their foreign currency reserves to alter market sentiment is limited.

BRITAIN'S rising government deficit poses the biggest threat to the UK
recovery, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, warned yesterday.
Speaking in Washington where he is attending meetings of the International
Monetary Fund, Mr Lamont refused to rule out the possibility of further tax
rises later this autumn in the first of the UK's new unified budgets. 'We
will have to address it (the deficit),' he said.
The chancellor was reacting to concern in financial markets that a
continuation in the recent sharp rise in the gap between government spending
and revenues could sap international investor confidence, possibly leading
to a slide in the pound which might require higher interest rates.
Under plans announced in Mr Lamont's March budget, UK taxes are to rise by a
combined Pounds 16bn over the next three years. The Treasury expects the
deficit to reach Pounds 50bn in the 1993-94 financial year. Mr Lamont said
the UK was poised for sustained growth after the 2 1/2 -year recession. He
said there were 'a number of encouraging features' about Britain's
performance during the recession, including rising manufacturing
productivity and business investment , which testified to the 'underlying
strength' of the economy.
He said prospects for a gradual reduction in UK unemployment were not as
poor as some people thought, while with wage inflation at the lowest level
for 25 years the climate for business was 'excellent'.
'I am determined that there should be no return to the boom conditions of
the late 1980s, when a surge in corporate and residential investment
coincided with an unsustainable growth in consumer demand,' Mr Lamont said.

<TEXT>
THE Australian government yesterday awarded the right to subscription
television licences to two new and relatively unknown media interests. The
powerful consortium most widely expected to win, led by media magnate Kerry
Packer and US-based Rupert Murdoch, was beaten on price.
The winning bidders were YCOM Pty, which offered ADollars 177m (Pounds
82.3m), and Hi Vision, which tendered ADollars 212m. About 50 tenders were
received for the two four-channel licences.
The winning bid will now require the approval of the competition regulator,
the Trade Practices Commission.
Australia's subscription television policy allows for three
satellite-delivered services. The third licence, with two channels, has been
reserved for the national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC).
The bidding process was criticised for supposedly allowing highly
speculative bids from groups that did not have strong financial backing or
enough experience in operating television networks.
The communications department had decided the richest bids would
automatically win the rights.
The companies will have 30 days to pay and obtain the licences. Failure to
raise the equity will allow the government to grant the rights to the next
highest bidders.
Mr David Hill, managing director of the ABC, said the department had very
strange bidding rules. He said he did not expect the two winning companies
to operate viable subscription television services.

<TEXT>
THE Japanese labour market is as weak as it was during the mid-1980s
recession, according to official employment figures published yesterday.
They suggest that any recovery in Japanese consumer spending this year will
be modest.
The average monthly wage in the year to the end of March rose by 1.4 per
cent, the lowest growth since 1970, according to the Labour Ministry. Real
wages did not grow at all, the ministry said. Fixed wages rose by 3.4 per
cent a month, to Y266,915 (Pounds 1,570) while non-fixed payments such as
overtime fell by 10.8 per cent to Y23,336.
Employment rose by less than 0.1 per cent in March compared with a year
before, after a 0.4 per cent decline in February. The job offers to job
applicants ratio fell to 0.88. That means there are just 88 job offers for
every 100 people officially seeking work.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities said: 'This is the
weakest level of labour demand since the strong yen crisis of 1985 to 1986.'
Female employment fell by 0.7 per cent in March, while male employment rose
by 0.5 per cent. Many women workers who leave work do not register for
official unemployment benefits.
Partly as a result the Japanese unemployment rate was unchanged last month
at 2.3 per cent.
The weakening of the labour market, combined with the recent strengthening
of the yen against the dollar, is likely to further depress Japanese
inflation.
Inflation in Tokyo, which is a leading indicator of national trends, rose by
only 0.1 percentage points last month, an annual rate of 1.3 per cent.
Import prices fell for 19 of 40 products surveyed by the Economic Planning
Agency in April, up from 10 in March.

OUTSIDE the Palestinian Embassy in Amman, Abdul Jawad Saleh waited with
tears in his eyes. After 20 years of exile, he, along with 14 other
Palestinian deportees, blinked in the morning sun as their luggage was
packed on a convoy of buses bound for the occupied territories.
Cheered on by their families who sang Palestinian folk songs and waved the
national flag, Mr Saleh, once the mayor of Al Bireh in the West Bank, said
he could not believe that he was finally allowed to go home. 'This is a
re-birth, a resurrection for me. Every day since 1973 I have dreamed of
this,' he said.
The group is the first instalment of 30 Palestinians who the Israelis have
agreed to allow back into the occupied territories.
Nassir Hana, president of Bir Zeit University in the West Bank, who was
expelled to southern Lebanon in 1974, described their return as 'a victory
for world opinion. This gives legitimacy for the full return of all
Palestinians,' he said.
On the other side of Allenby bridge connecting Jordan to the West Bank,
thousands of Palestinians gathered on the streets to greet the returnees.
The Israeli army looked on from a distance.
After many hours the deportees cleared customs. People clambered onto buses
waving posters of Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, and songs and festivities filled the air.
The move is Israel's first concession to the Palestinians since the Middle
East peace process began 18 months ago.
Most of the returnees were community leaders deported after the 1967 war for
'political activities'. Firebrands and radicals in their time, many are now
retired professionals in their late fifties and older.
In the Palestinian political spectrum of the 1990s they are all mainstream
PLO supporters and firmly in favour of the peace talks.
A number of Palestinians were careful to play down the importance of the
Israeli gesture but Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman, said yesterday
that peace talks with Israel were finally producing results and might be
entering a 'qualitatively different phase.'
More than 1,400 Palestinians have been deported from the occupied
territories since 1967.
Agreement on the return of 30 represents a minor victory for the PLO which
is desperate to regain credibility after two years of fruitless
negotiations.

FT  01 MAY 93 / 'Last chance' talks for Bosnia Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S Serbs will come under intense pressure at the weekend to accept an
internationally-brokered peace plan for Bosnia when they meet leaders of the
other warring factions and the presidents of Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia
at a two-day summit in Athens.
The 'last chance' summit has been called by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen,
the United Nations and European Community mediators, amid urgent
consultations by the US, its European allies and Russia on the kind of
military measures than can be taken to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to endorse
the Vance-Owen plan.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, is due in London tomorrow
or Monday for talks with Mr John Major, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, which are expected to review all the possible options for further
action in Bosnia.
With both Britain and France strongly opposed to the selective lifting of
the arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia to help the Moslems, it is
probable that the talks will concentrate on the feasibility of air strikes
against Bosnian Serb supply routes.
Following his talks in London, Mr Christopher is scheduled to fly to Moscow
on Tuesday, where he will meet President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the foreign minister, in a bid to enlist their support for military
measures which Moscow has always been reluctant to approve.
Mr Christopher's task will be made easier by Mr Yeltsin's recent victory in
the Russian referendum, which has weakened the influence of pro-Serbian
hardliners in the Russian parliament. 'We are very satisfied with our
co-operation with the US,' Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign
minister, said yesterday.
Military action and the continued implementation of tougher sanctions, which
formally came into effect earlier this week, can be pre-empted by an
agreement between the warring factions in Athens.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen firmly believe that President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia holds the key to a solution of the one-year-long conflict in Bosnia.
'We know that the Bosnian Serb fighting forces are fuelled by Yugoslavia,'
Lord Owen said in a radio interview yesterday.
Yet the mediators nevertheless appear confident that Mr Milosevic, who tried
hard to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen plan last week,
will continue to exert the same kind of pressure on them in Athens.
'President Milosevic has decided this is the best settlement he can get. And
he has told them (the Bosnian Serbs) straight he is not going to have the
whole of Yugoslavia's economy, livelihood, and even safety, put at risk any
longer for the Bosnian Serbs,' Lord Owen said.
'Milosevic has a very heavy responsibility to bear for what has happened
over the last two years. But he is not an ideologue. He is a pragmatist. I
think he has made a pragmatic choice. He is not going to confront the
international community.'
Lord Owen's optimism appeared to be backed up by US President Bill Clinton
who said yesterday that talk of possible use of allied military force may
have made the Bosnian Serbs take a second look at a UN-backed peace plan.
Meanwhile Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told reporters in
his stronghold of Pale, near Sarajevo, that he believed enough progress
could be made in Athens to enable his 'parliament' to accept the peace plan
at its meeting on May 5. But he stressed that he did not expect to sign the
plan during the weekend summit.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Study criticises US operation in Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATION Restore Hope, the US-led intervention in Somalia last year, has
done more harm than good, claims a 60-page report published today.
The document by the London-based African Rights is timed to coincide with
the handover today of Washington's leadership of the international force to
the United Nations.
The authors say fighting and banditry have become worse in some areas, and
claim aid workers are unanimous in describing the security situation as
having deteriorated since western intervention.
The report maintains that the overall food supply problem had been overcome
as early as October 1992, before the US troops landed.
Over-supply of food has damaged the agricultural sector, says the report.
Efforts at disarmament of rival factions have been 'sporadic and
half-hearted', and both the UN and the US have failed in the peace process
by giving warlords an 'unwarranted legitimacy' and not consulting a
cross-section of civil society.
The highly critical analysis is by Ms Rakiya Omaar and Mr Alex de Waal,
co-founders of African Rights. The small, UK-charity funded organisation was
formed last December after they resigned from Africa Watch, part of a
US-based international network of human rights monitors.
The experience of the authors in Somalia and elsewhere in Africa will give
weight to their analysis. Their judgment is also likely to be backed by
several of the charities working in Somalia.
The report calls for a UN commission of inquiry into the operation,
disarmament of warlords, and greater attention to long-term economic
rehabilitation and the peace process.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S beleaguered ruling coalition won a vital victory yesterday when the
country's parliament passed a mass privatisation bill, securing the
government's future and giving the go ahead to its policy of market reforms.
The legislation provides for the transfer to the private sector of about 600
companies at once and the distribution of shares to the public.
The privatisation scheme, expected to be approved by the Senate and
President Lech Walesa, failed to get a majority last month and the fate of
Ms Hanna Suchocka's coalition government hung on the result of yesterday's
vote.
The plan, first mooted in 1991, foresees the establishment of 20 or more
foreign managed investment funds. Shares in these will be distributed at a
nominal charge to all adult Poles who apply.
The funds are to remain for 10 years, after which the shareholders will
decide whether to wind them up. SG Warburg has been advising the
privatisation ministry on the scheme.
The World Bank has made access to successive tranches of a Dollars 450m
(Pounds 292.2m) loan conditional on implementation of the scheme and
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) funds are available
to finance the plan.
Privatisation is one of many paths the government is following to reduce the
state sector which at the end of last year still had 7,342 enterprises.
Hundreds of state companies have been leased to management and workers and
scores sold to foreign and domestic investors. Some 40 per cent of
industrial output is already produced by the private sector.
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister, who threatened to resign
if the scheme failed to go through, said after the vote it would 'permit
hundreds of companies to be restructured, give them access to western
markets, to new technologies and cheap credits'.
'This is good news, it means that a lot of things can start moving again,' a
western banker said yesterday The 215 to 178 vote victory only became
possible after the government had made concessions to the SLD, the 58 strong
group of former communists in parliament. Yesterday 38 of the SLD group
either voted for or abstained, opening the way to further tactical alliances
with Ms Suchocka's cabinet.
The government now enjoys the support of a mere 187 votes in the 460 seat
Sejm after the small PL farmers' group left the coalition in a difference
over agriculture this week.
The concessions to the SLD included opt-out rights to state sector
enterprises chosen for inclusion, handing shares in 10 the funds to 3.6m
pensioners and public servants as compensation for wage cuts made in 1991
and later declared illegal by the courts and lastly strict definition of the
rights and duties of foreign managers.
The plan had nevertheless been criticised by the right-wing opposition
parties as well as the PSL farmers party for giving too great a say to
foreign investment banks and consultants over a big part of the country's
industry.

<TEXT>
MR Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's prime minister, said yesterday he wants to
introduce a state of emergency to override opposition to his economic
reforms and step up the fight against inflation.
He said he would this month ask parliament to extend the special powers
under which he has been running the economy for six months. 'What we need is
to introduce a state of emergency. This could be used to push ahead rapidly
with demonopolisation in various sectors,' he said.
In particular, he said:
Parliament, which has been stalling the government's reforms, should no
longer have a veto over economic measures;
The National Bank, which in March prompted a 50 per cent drop in value of
the Ukrainian currency by issuing a massive tranche of subsidised credits to
state industry and agriculture, should be brought under direct government
control;
The government should take charge of the State Property Fund, the
privatisation body which has recently been criticised for its slow progress.
It is not clear whether Mr Kuchma will secure the extra powers he is
demanding. There have been recent signs that the other two Ukrainian
leaders, President Leonid Kravchuk and parliament chairman Ivan Pliushch,
are willing to back the prime minister. An increasingly fractious
parliament, however, may refuse to renew any special powers at all when they
expire at the end of May - in which event, Mr Kuchma said, he would resign.
The prime minister said decisive action was needed in the face of a
worsening payments crisis and intensifying inflationary pressures. Increases
in the cost of Ukraine's fuel imports from Russia would force another sharp
increase in prices and wages this month, he added. Ukrainian officials say
the rise could be as much as 20-fold.
Tighter control over credit and the budget deficit are also essential if
Ukraine is to qualify for a Dollars 250m (Pounds 162m) loan which Mr Kuchma
said Ukraine hoped to obtain from the International Monetary Fund by the end
of June. An IMF mission is expected in Kiev in mid-May for negotiations on
this so-called transitional facility, which could pave the way for further
assistance from the World Bank later in the year.
Although looser-than-normal conditions would be attached, Ukraine will not
qualify unless the government can demonstrate the will and the means to curb
spending. In April the country moved close to hyperinflation, with prices
rising at nearly 50 per cent a month, said western economists.
Ukraine may face an additional problem in obtaining western assistance:
rising American and Russian anger over its tardiness in ratifying nuclear
disarmament treaties. In yesterday's interview, Mr Kuchma, recently
appointed chief negotiator with Russia on the issue, said mounting western
pressure was helping to turn this into a problem by fuelling pro-nuclear
sentiment in the Ukrainian parliament. 'Even the kindest, gentlest man, if
pressed and pressed and pressed, will want to bite back,' he said.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Howard attacks EC environmental policy
</HEADLINE>

   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Howard, UK environment secretary, yesterday attacked EC
environmental policy for its lack of an 'even-handed approach' in enforcing
'green' directives.
Speaking in Lucerne to the Environment for Europe Conference, he said the
European Commission needed to do more 'to ensure proper enforcement.' He
said the Commission should move away from its 'complaints-driven procedure'
towards a 'more analytical approach to enforcing compliance'.
At the moment the Commission's action against countries for breach of
directives is prompted by complaints, often by pressure groups. Countries
such as Britain with a high level of public environmental awareness and
active pressure groups have complained that they are being
disproportionately criticised.
Mr Chris Smith, UK shadow environment secretary, said the speech was a
'petulant response to the Commission's welcome decision to proceed with
action against the British Government over Oxleas Wood'. The UK government
wants to build a highway through the ancient wood in southeast London.

MR Boris Fyodorov, Russia's radical finance minister, said yesterday the
west should put pressure on President Boris Yeltsin to pursue rapid market
reform following his referendum victory.
He said: 'Please urge our president to avail himself of the situation and
take faster steps to a market economy ..it is not clear to me that the
president is using the advantage afforded by the referendum.'
Mr Fyodorov was speaking after Mr Yeltsin appointed an old-style industrial
manager, Mr Oleg Soskovets, as first deputy prime minister, instead of
boosting the reformist camp in a divided government.
He said supporters of radical reform like himself and the privatisation
minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, were urging the Russian leader 'to take
decisive steps now because there won't be a second chance.'
Mr Fyodorov, who has been instrumental in attracting pledges of large-scale
western assistance to underpin his economic reform programme, also said it
was essential to replace the chairman of the central bank, Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko, whom he accuses of hindering reforms.
He suggested the return to the government of radicals like Mr Yegor Gaidar,
the former prime minister, whose unpopular policies had been 'endorsed by
the people' in Sunday's referendum.
Some supporters of radical reform claim that Mr Yeltsin will still take
steps to boost reformers in the government, but others saw the appointment
of Mr Soskovets, following that of conservative Mr Oleg Lobov as another
first deputy prime minister, as a bad omen.
In the mould of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister who used to
manage the Soviet gas industry, Mr Soskovets was described by a Russian
management consultant as belonging to the 'old generation of managers who
try to combine old-style management with new ideas'.
Meanwhile the Russian parliament continued its witch-hunt of Yeltsin
supporters in the media and tried to make a deal with the president on a new
constitution.
The parliament asked Mr Yeltsin to reconsider his plan to bypass parliament
and get a new constitution adopted by a constituent assembly.
Parliament's leadership offered Mr Yeltsin a deal whereby he would dilute
his draft constitution to give less power to the president, and deputies
would approve a compromise version in November. Mr Yeltsin has instead
proposed that a constituent assembly be set up next month to approve a new
constitution giving the president sweeping powers.

THE Irish central bank yesterday ordered all building societies operating in
the republic to produce audited reports detailing directors' interests and
transactions made by them.
The order follows the dismissal of the chief of one building society earlier
this week and local press reports alleging large insurance commission fees
being paid to the director of another.
The central bank issued a statement yesterday, saying that, on receipt of
the reports 'the bank will decide whether further action is warranted'. It
said it was also considering whether the regulation of building societies
could be improved but stressed 'that it has no concerns about the financial
stability or soundness of any of the societies'.
Mr Edmund Farrell, the former chairman of the Irish Permanent Building
Society, was dismissed by his board last week for what his successor, Mr
John Bourke, said was 'abuse of office and betrayal of trust'. The board
claims Mr Farrell made profits of IPounds 700,000 on property transactions
between himself and the company. Mr Farrell has claimed that the
transactions were approved by the board.

FT  01 MAY 93 / GM nears plant deal for Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors of the US, the world's biggest vehicle maker, expects to
reach a final agreement by mid-May to begin low volume car assembly in
Poland.
Separately the group is planning to cut around 2,500 jobs at its plants in
Germany, Belgium and the UK in response to the steep fall in west European
new car sales.
Mr Jack Smith, GM president, said that agreement had been reached 'on all
aspects' of the group's plan to assemble its Opel Astra in Warsaw in a joint
venture with FSO, the Polish state-owned carmaker.
'These understandings need to be incorporated into the draft final
agreement, which can be done quickly,' he said following a meeting with
Polish Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka.
In the first stage of the project GM is planning to assemble up to 10,000
Opel Astras a year in Poland. GM will send car bodies from its assembly
plant at Antwerp, Belgium for final trim and assembly in Warsaw.
GM plans to invest around DM30m (Pounds 12m) for the first stage of the
project. It will have management control of the joint venture in which FSO
is expected to have a holding of 20-25 per cent.
In a second stage GM could move later to full assembly of car kits in Warsaw
including body welding, when capacity would be increased to 33,000 a year.
GM Europe said yesterday that pilot production could start in Warsaw by the
end of the year with volume production beginning by the spring of 1994.
Separately GM and FSO are negotiating a technical assistance agreement for
the US carmaker to support FSO in the updating of its existing production of
the ageing Polonez range, and GM is also planning to assist in the
development of components suppliers in Poland.
Mr Waclaw Niewiarowski, Polish minister of industry, said that the
government had agreed to compensate GM for the high unit costs of the
initial low volume car assembly, possibly through a reduction of the vehicle
excise tax rate.
In west Europe, Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said it was planning to cut
1,700 jobs by the end of the year at its plants at Bochum, Kaiserslautern
and Russelsheim in response to the sharp fall in west European new car
sales. At the end of March the company had 52,400 employees.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Italians vow to end Craxi immunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN magistrates yesterday pledged to fight parliament's decision not to
lift the immunity of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, amid
protests and demonstrations in Milan and Rome.
Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Milan's chief public prosecutor, who has led
the investigations into political corruption, said his team was prepared to
appeal against the decision by MPs to approve only two of the six requests
to lift Mr Craxi's immunity.
An appeal to the constitutional court to overturn the decision would be
unprecedented and mark a further escalation in a conflict of interests
emerging between parliament and the judiciary.
Mr Borrelli said he thought it would be possible to indict Mr Craxi 'within
a few months' on the allegations so far sent to parliament.
In a broad discussion on the state of the corruption investigations in
Milan, he estimated magistrates had so far uncovered 'between 30 per cent
and 40 per cent' of abuses.
Mr Borrelli stressed that, although the initiative for paying kickbacks on
contracts - had often come from politicians, businessmen had frequently been
willing parties in what was seen as a 'reciprocally' beneficial
relationship.
However, he distinguished between small businessmen, often compelled to pay
bribes to survive, and larger companies with a much greater 'capacity for
resistance'.
Mr Borrelli strongly denied claims that magistrates had granted managers of
Fiat, Italy's biggest private company, special treatment. Lawyers for Mr
Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of the Eni energy and chemicals
group, and Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, a prominent Rome businessman, have
accused the judges of having reached a secret understanding with Fiat.
According to the lawyers, Fiat executives under investigation had been
allowed to return to their homes while their clients remained in jail.
This week, four senior Fiat executives, against whom cautionary warrants had
been issued, returned to Italy from 'business' trips abroad. All but one
including Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat's chief operating officer, were granted
house arrest without being jailed.
Mr Borrelli welcomed the more co-operative attitude shown this month by Mr
Cesare Romiti, Fiat's managing director. In the past fortnight, Mr Romiti
has appeared twice before the magistrates voluntarily, delivering a lengthy
document on Fiat's involvement in political corruption.
Explaining Fiat's change of heart, Mr Borrelli said: 'They probably hoped
this investigation would have met the fate of other inquiries of its kind in
the past'. Had the company changed tack earlier, 'they might have saved some
people a few days in jail'.
Last year, Mr Enzo Papi, then a senior executive at Fiat's Cogefar-Impresit
construction subsidiary, spent a lengthy period in Milan's San Vittore
prison before collaborating with investigations. His incarceration was
followed by other Fiat bosses, notably its chief financial officer, Mr
Francesco Paolo Mattioli.
'The treatment given to the top management of the company is just the same
as in other cases,' Mr Borrelli claimed. Rather than 'negotiating,' he said
magistrates had been approached unexpectedly by Fiat's lawyers, who informed
them Mr Romiti was prepared to come forward.

FT  01 MAY 93 / US acts against Japan on trade: Clinton takes tougher stance
to force opening of foreign markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday launched a salvo of tough trade actions against Japan,
Brazil, India, Thailand and several other trading partners.
The move provoked an immediate hostile response from Japan and heralded a
new era of trade friction with several other countries.
The measures are likely to add to foreign governments' perplexity over the
direction of US trade policy. Just the night before, Mr Clinton told finance
ministers of the Group of Seven industrialised countries, meeting in
Washington, that the US was ready to take 'exceptional actions' to bring
about agreement in the stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Mr Clinton's remarks were echoed yesterday by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
treasury secretary, who told the IMF the US wanted the Tokyo summit in July
to seek a G7 agreement on market access issues holding up a Uruguay Round
agreement. The round should be concluded by mid-December, he said.
Yesterday's tough US measures target the Japanese government's procurement
practices in construction and supercomputers, while taking aim at abuses of
intellectual property rights in the other countries.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, invoking US laws against foreign
government discrimination on procurement, said President Clinton's
administration was 'taking a different tack' from the Bush administration in
seeking more rigorous enforcement of US trade laws and bilateral trade
agreements.
Mr Kantor argued that these enforcement actions were intended not just to
open foreign markets for US goods and services, but to restore credibility
to the idea of open trading.
He said tough action could help to develop public support for free trade in
the US, where protectionist sentiments are mounting against the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The strongest action announced yesterday was against Japanese practices in
awarding construction contracts. Citing 'persistent and significant
discrimination against US firms', Mr Kantor threatened sanctions within 60
days if the issue was not resolved.
Angry Japanese officials warned that they might retaliate against US
contractors and insisted that negotiations would not begin with the US under
the threat of time limits or sanctions.
Japanese officials interpreted the move by the US trade representative's
office as a sign of the Clinton administration's tougher stance on the
bilateral deficit. Japan also sees the US action as an opportunity to show
it will resist bilateral trade agreements.
The US earlier this month used the same law to invoke sanctions against the
European Community in the telecommunications and heavy electrical equipment
sectors. Sanctions are due to be imposed in the telecommunications area.
Procurement practices were also listed as concerns in Australia and China.
Mr Kantor complained of Japanese discrimination against US supercomputer
suppliers and ordered a review of Japanese actions under a 1990
supercomputer agreement.
A senior Japanese foreign ministry official said the timing of the US action
could damage multilateral negotiations under Gatt. 'We are ready to discuss
the construction market but we will never do so under threat of sanctions,'
he said.
At the same time, the US listed Brazil, India and Thailand as 'priority
foreign countries' because of their denial of adequate intellectual property
protection. Other countries also targeted for action on the intellectual
property issue were Hungary, Taiwan, Korea, Argentina, Egypt, Poland,
Turkey, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the EC.
The US move came as G7 finance ministers agreed this week that a further
opening of the international trading system was indispensable for maximising
world growth.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Banks may have to increase cash cover for market risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS around the world which trade actively in the foreign exchange,
securities and derivatives markets will have to set aside more capital to
back their risks if proposals put forward yesterday are adopted.
This amounts to the first significant extension of the so-called Basle
Accord of 1988, which set common minimum capital levels for bank credit
risk.
The latest proposals, from the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, would
for the first time require banks to set aside capital to cover the market
risks they run in their trading operations. They would also cover the
fast-growing markets for derivative financial instruments such as futures,
options and swaps.
The impact of these changes would be lessened by a second Basle Committee
proposal yesterday.
This would reduce the amount of capital needed by banks, mainly in the swaps
market. In a change planned to take effect early next year, the accord would
be changed to recognise bilateral 'netting' agreements, under which two
banks agree to set off their claims against each other and recognise only a
net amount.
Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the New York Fed and of the Basle Committee,
said the overall effect would 'work in the direction of a very modest
overall increase' in the minimum 8 per cent capital requirement laid down in
1988. For most banks the rise would be 'not more than a percentage point'.
Even this, though, would add greatly to some banks' capital costs. Mr David
Haigh, managing director of finance at NatWest Markets, an arm of Britain's
National Westminster, said a 1 per cent rise would require Pounds 700m extra
at the bank.
Mr Corrigan said the committee had not set out to restrict activity in
particular financial markets, though he hoped the rules would force banks to
adopt more cautious trading strategies, particularly in the foreign exchange
market.
The Basle Committee decided to publish its own proposals after talks on a
common set of rules with international securities regulators collapsed
earlier this year.
Mr Corrigan said the Basle group would continue to seek agreement with
securities regulators and the European Commission. The Basle rules are
stricter than an EC directive on foreign exchange risk and position risk of
banks in the equities markets.
After consultation lasting to the end of this year, the proposals on market
risk would not be produced until the middle of 1995.

FT  01 MAY 93 / ICI wins tariff cut in water charges appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH West Water has agreed to cut its tariffs at Imperial Chemical
Industries' complex at Runcorn by 25 per cent after appeals to Ofwat, the
water regulator, that some big users are being overcharged.
The rate cut for the site in north-west England takes effect next month. It
could prompt other large users in England and Wales to seek reductions.
Although this would be welcomed by industry as a benefit of privatisation,
water companies would make up any shortfall by raising prices elsewhere,
including charges to domestic users.
Ofwat said ICI approached the regulator about a year ago to discuss tariffs
at the site and was followed by several other big users. Gatwick airport
negotiated a 25 per cent tariff reduction from East Surrey Water, which came
into effect at the start of April.
Tariff reductions are not automatic and big users need to show that the
costs of supplying them are lower. ICI argued that it was supplied at
Runcorn directly from North West Water's trunk mains rather than the more
expensive household distribution network. ICI is the UK's largest industrial
user of water with annual water bills of more than Pounds 20m.
The North West Water agreement will save a 'substantial six-figure sum' each
year, the company said. 'If these circumstances apply elsewhere, we will
expect similar treatment,' said an official.
ICI has been a leading critic of rising utility prices since privatisation.
The company is still in discussions with the government about lower
electricity prices for its Runcorn site, where its main product is chlorine.
The discounts were welcomed by Ofwat as 'correcting imbalances' between
water users. In the past, industrial users and owners of large properties
have subsidised small domestic users. But the cuts will be attacked by water
companies, under pressure to keep prices down yet improve water and sewage
quality.
Mr David Highet, director of communications at North West Water, warned that
the lower charges for big users could mean higher bills for consumers. 'The
money has to come from somewhere,' he said.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Italy seeks political consensus to avoid poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE two day-old Ciampi government was last night desperately trying to patch
together a new consensus among Italy's political parties to avoid the
damaging consequences of elections before electoral reform has been enacted.
This followed a dramatic blow to the new government from the withdrawal late
on Thursday night of three ministers of the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) and the one Green cabinet member.
They withdrew in protest after parliament voted to preserve the immunity of
Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, from facing serious charges
of corruption.
Uncertainties about the duration of the much-weakened government yesterday
affected the lira, which was trading at L941 against the D-Mark. This
compared with L928 when Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of
Italy, was chosen on Monday to head Italy's 52nd post-war government.
Efforts to head off the storm of protest provoked by the Craxi vote centred
on proposals to end parliamentary immunity in cases of corruption. However,
a simpler proposal, which would not involve a change of the constitution,
was for secrecy to be removed in voting.
Such secrecy is regarded as the reason behind the majority vote in favour of
Mr Craxi. Some members of opposition parties, such as the populist Lombard
League, the neo-fascist MSI and the hardline communist Reconstructed
Communism, are understood to have voted with Mr Craxi's allies in order to
discredit the government and force early elections.
Italy's press yesterday emphasised the gravity of the situation, saying the
stability of the country was at serious risk.
Newspapers doubted whether Mr Ciampi would be able to survive long enough to
introduce new electoral laws. Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum
movement, warned that 'without electoral reform, the chamber of deputies
could return up to 20 parties in a new election'.
Demonstrations were staged in many large cities denouncing parliament and
attacking Mr Craxi for hiding behind its immunity.
Last night, the PDS was firm in its decision to withdraw its three ministers
who had spent less than 10 hours with the science, finance and parliamentary
affairs portfolios. The same applied to the Greens who pulled out of the
environment ministry.

Industries' complex at Runcorn by 25 per cent after appeals to Ofwat, the
water regulator, that some big users are being overcharged.
The rate cut for the site in north-west England takes effect next month. It
could prompt other large users in England and Wales to seek discounts.
Although this would be welcomed by industry as a benefit of privatisation,
water companies would make up any shortfall by raising prices elsewhere,
including charges to domestic users.
Ofwat said ICI approached the regulator about a year ago to discuss tariffs
at the site and was followed by several other big users. Gatwick airport had
since negotiated a 25 per cent tariff reduction from East Surrey Water,
which came into effect at the start of April.
Tariff reductions are not automatic and big users need to show that the
costs of supplying them are lower. ICI argued that it was supplied at
Runcorn directly from North West Water's trunk mains rather than the more
expensive household distribution network.
ICI is the UK's largest industrial user of water with annual water bills of
over Pounds 20m. The North West Water agreement will save a 'substantial six
figure sum' each year, the company said. 'If these circumstances apply
elsewhere, we will expect similar treatment,' said an official.
ICI has been a leading critic of rising utility prices since privatisation.
The company is still in discussions with the government about lower
electricity prices for its Runcorn site, where its main product is chlorine.
North West Water said ICI had made a 'particular' case for a reduction
because it was supplied directly. The company had not yet laid down general
rules to decide whether other customers deserved lower tariffs.
The discounts were welcomed by Ofwat as 'correcting imbalances' between
water users. In the past, industrial users and owners of large properties
have subsidised small domestic users. These imbalances were being addressed
by the water companies already and agreements with large users like ICI will
accelerate the process.
But the discounts will be attacked by water companies, which already face
pressure to keep prices down yet improve water and sewage quality.
Mr David Highet, director of communications at North West Water, warned that
the lower charges for big users could mean higher bills for consumers. 'The
money has to come from somewhere. We will recoup it from the customer base
in future years.'

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Paper profits encourage flotation - The
development of Inveresk since its management buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVERESK, the Scottish speciality paper company, the subject of a management
buy-out in 1990, is coming to the market via a placing and intermediaries
offer to raise Pounds 30m. The issue would value the company at over Pounds
75m.
The pathfinder prospectus will be issued next Thursday and Inveresk will
join the diminished band of quoted British-owned paper companies in an
industry dominated by large foreign-owned groups. Yet it believes it can not
only survive but also expand, partly through acquisition, in the European
speciality paper sector.
Inveresk is a famous name in British paper-making, formed after the first
world war as a grouping of private mills. In 1981 it was bought by
Georgia-Pacific of the US. When problems at home hit GP it co-operated in
allowing Mr Stefan Kay, Inveresk's managing director, to put together a
management buy-out backed by Morgan Grenfell Development Capital.
The MBO brought a powerful dose of managerial energy and also allowed
Inveresk to make investments, running at between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m a
year in each of the last two years, in improved capacity, which had not been
possible in the later stages of GP's ownership.
After little more than a year Inveresk was able to pay back about Pounds 20m
of senior debt and mezzanine financing out of improved cash flow
Mr Kay is keen to dispel the notion that the paper industry consists solely
of very large companies with capital investments running to Pounds 250m per
machine, exposing them to violent cyclical swings in what are, in effect,
commodity markets.
'We are a major force in speciality paper making worldwide,' he said. James
Capel, the company's broker added in a circular that Inveresk should not be
seen as 'a small fish in a big sea' but rather as having a significant
presence 'in a number of rockpools'.
Each of Inveresk's four mills, three of which are within 40 minutes drive of
the head office in Dunfermline, Fife, with the fourth, near Wells in
Somerset, have strong positions in specific areas, such as business
stationery, label papers and coated graphic boards.
Although Inveresk now exports 44 per cent of its output it has been hit by
the recession in the UK, with turnover falling from Pounds 98m in the year
to December 1 1990 to Pounds 88m last year.
However, operating margins increased from 7.6 per cent in 1990 to 9.8 per
cent last year when pre-tax profits increased marginally from Pounds 5.5m to
Pounds 5.8m. Mr Kay said that while the results did not at first sight look
a spectacular basis for a flotation, they actually represented a very sound
performance.
'We've fought our way through a very difficult climate and invested heavily.
We've got great capacity for organic growth, none of our mills is running at
capacity. We can expand without taking on more people.'
Though there are no directly comparable quoted paper companies, analysts
regard the performance as impressive.
Mr Kay said the MBO was designed with a relatively early exit in mind. The
institutions which backed it - Morgan Grenfell, County NatWest Ventures and
3i - would be keeping about 65 per cent of their holdings, while management
would retain between 80 and 85 per cent of their stakes. GP, which had the
right to 5 per cent of the proceeds of a flotation, is taking a 3.3 per cent
stake.
After the flotation the existing institutional shareholders should end up
with about 40 per cent of the company with management having between 25 and
30 per cent and new shareholders holding the rest. About Pounds 5m of the
money raised will be new cash.
'This is a tactical manoeuvre to get out of the (rather restrictive) MBO
mode into quoted company mode,' said Mr Paul Dollman, finance director, who
joined the company last month from Maddox Group.
'It is not about building up a war chest. We've still got a Pounds 20m loan
facility which we've never used. We will be debt free from day one,' he
said.
Mr Kay said there were acquisitions to be made among speciality papermakers
in the UK and northern continental Europe both in family-owned companies and
the 'orphan children' of bigger groups, which Inveresk was itself before the
MBO.
James Capel, however, pointed out that, once floated, Inveresk would be
attractive as an acquisition for other paper companies, naming Portals, a
quoted British speciality paper maker, as a potential predator.
'We have no ambition to be taken over,' said Mr Kay.
He added that performance in the first four months of this year had been
very encouraging, ahead of last year in both sales and volume in the
'extremely modest' UK recovery.
The full prospectus will be issued on May 20 and dealing in the shares
begins on June 2.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Uni recapitalisation approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurer, is to be released from the grip of
state-appointed public administrators after the acceptance by authorities of
a recapitalisation plan to raise NKr4.3bn (Dollars 649m) for the troubled
group.
Uni collapsed last August under the weight of NKr3.8bn in short-term debt
accrued to build a NKr4.7bn, 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia Forsakrings of
Sweden.
The terms of the deal are similar to those revealed on April 19 but were
approved by authorities on the condition that a further NKr300m be raised
through a share issue at a later date to help underpin Uni's financial base.
The deal, to be concluded in the next few months, is also conditional on the
recapitalisation ensuring that Uni meets capital adequacy rules. Uni's
creditors are guaranteed full reimbursement of loans outstanding. Norway's
Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission (BISC) approved the plan, which
calls for NKr2.8bn to be raised through the issue of NKr1.8bn worth of
ordinary shares and NKr1bn worth of redeemable preferential shares.
In addition, NKr1.5bn will be raised through a bond issue. All three of the
issues have been guaranteed by two consortiums of domestic and foreign
companies.
Sundal Collier &amp; Company and Fondsfinans, two domestic brokerage firms, have
been given the mandate to undertake the issues and to ensure further capital
is raised at a later date.
Because authorities sought to push the deal through as quickly as possible,
a decision is pending on whether to spin off the Skandia holding into a
wholly-owned daughter company which would purchase the shares from Uni. An
estimated NKr1.4bn would be raised by the new company for the Skandia
acquisition through a bond issue and subordinated loan, which would qualify
as core capital. If this is decided, Uni will be given an option to buy back
the Skandia shareholding.
Uni's shares are to be written down to a nominal value of NKr10 a share from
NKr20.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits warning from Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in UK transport rental group Tiphook fell 22 per cent yesterday after
the company issued a profits warning and said its trailer division was
losing money.
Tiphook said profits in the year to April 31, due to be announced in July,
would be about 20 per cent below expectations. UBS, the company's broker,
cut its forecast from Pounds 75m to Pounds 55m (Dollars 84.7m). Tiphook's
often volatile shares fell from 293p to 170p at one stage, before recovering
to 230p.
Analysts were surprised at the scale of the downgrade, especially since Mr
Robert Montague, chairman, was optimistic about the trading outlook when
announcing interim profits in December.
'They misjudged their markets,' one analyst said.
Most of the downgrade stemmed from the trailers division, which was hit by
downturn in Germany and slower than expected recovery in the UK. Utilisation
rates fell from 62 per cent to 56 per cent and analysts expect the division
to make a Pounds 10m loss instead of a Pounds 5m profit.
The company is cutting its fleet from nearly 34,000 trailers to 24,000 by
selling 9,532 trailers back to manufacturers.
In return, Tiphook will spend Pounds 387m buying 11,000 new trailers over
the next five years.
The fleet reduction had been planned for some months and will improve the
division's utilisation rates from below 60 per cent to 75 per cent. It will
also delay the benefit to Tiphook of any economic recovery in Europe.
The cuts follow the bid for the company's main competitor, TIP Europe, from
General Electric Capital Corp of the US. GECC plans to increase and upgrade
TIP Europe's trailer fleet if its offer succeeds.
A Pounds 16m profit from the trailer disposals will be balanced by certain
charges totalling Pounds 13m.

FT  30 APR 93 / Ciampi to seek vote of confidence after government loses
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE newly-formed Italian government said last night it would seek a vote of
confidence after the leader of Italy's former communists, the Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS), said he would withdraw support for Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi's coalition.
The decision by Mr Achille Occhetto of the PDS followed a surprise decision
by the Chamber of Deputies to reject most of the requests by Milan
magistrates to waive immunity for Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist
leader, to face charges related to alleged corruption.
The vote was immediately seen as an effort by the Christian Democrats and
Socialists to protect a political class discredited by the corruption
scandals.
According to Italian news agency Ansa, the three PDS ministers chosen by Mr
Ciampi to join the coalition were set to resign in protest. Mr Francesco
Rutelli, a Green chosen as environment minister, also said he would resign.
Mr Occhetto said he would urgently seek a meeting with President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro saying that under the understanding on which PDS members had
entered the government, members of the outgoing four-party coalition would
back magistrates' requests for immunity to be waived in cases of corruption.
Milan magistrates indicated they would take the matter up with the
constitutional court, foreshadowing a confrontation between parliament and
the judiciary.
The sudden turn of events came only 10 hours after Italy's 52nd post-war
government was sworn in under Mr Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy,
and which included for the first time since 1947 three members of the former
communist PDS. The inclusion of the PDS in the 24-strong government would
have formed a broad-based group of politicians and technicians to carry out
electoral reform and manage the economy.
Observers said that if the three PDS ministers withdrew from the government,
and their resignations were accepted, it could make early elections
inevitable - even before new electoral reform had been introduced.

FT  30 APR 93 / Talks 'have built a bridge' between China and Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA and Taiwan, bitter enemies for more than 40 years, yesterday signed
agreements in Singapore which could mark the first tentative steps towards
the resolution of one of the world's more intractable conflicts.
The agreements themselves were limited in nature. The talks were described
as unofficial and were not supposed to involve any discussion of political
matters.
But, as the two delegations posed for the world's media, clinked champagne
glasses and repeatedly shook hands, it was hard to escape the feeling that
something important had been set in train.
The delegates seemed to agree. Mr Koo Chen Fu, a multi-millionaire
businessman and leader of Taiwan's delegation, said the meeting had been
historic. Mr Wang Daohan, a former mayor of Shanghai and leader of the China
side, said the discussions had been momentous.
'We have built a bridge between us,' said Mr Koo. 'No one can say we have
not achieved results . . . both sides have won.'
The agreements cover mostly technical matters. These include joint efforts
to combat crime, the resolution of fishing disputes, judicial co-operation
and cultural and scientific exchanges.
Most importantly a formal structure for future exchanges between the two
sides was also established. With the opening up of China's economy and
growing business and social ties between Taiwan and the mainland such lines
of communication are urgently needed.
Both sides also talked of the deep differences between them.
Taiwan businesses have an estimated Dollars 9bn investments in China. Taiwan
had come to the Singapore meeting wanting assurances from China that it
would develop a legal framework for the protection of these investments. The
Chinese side refused, saying existing laws were adequate. Disagreements on
this issue, still unresolved, forced the meeting into a third unscheduled
day.
Taiwan also became angry when China raised the question of direct shipping
and air links. All contact between China and Taiwan, politically separated
since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, is indirect.
Taiwan said any discussion of direct links was political and as such,
outside the scope of the meeting.
The word reunification was hardly mentioned.

PAKISTAN'S caretaker prime minister, Mr Balkh Sher Mazari, yesterday
expanded his cabinet to a record 50 members, bringing in new groups and a
controversial minister from the previous sacked government, Reuter reports
from Islamabad.
A total of 17 new ministers, 10 ministers of state and three advisers were
sworn in, to add to the existing 17 ministers, two special advisers and one
special assistant inducted shortly after Mr Mazari took office 11 days ago.
Most of the ministers belong either to a faction of Mr Nawaz Sharif's
Pakistan Moslem League that rebelled against him before he was sacked as
prime minister, or to the former opposition led by the Pakistan People's
party of ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Among the new ministers was Mr Sardar Aseff Ahmad Ali, who escaped orders
for his arrest earlier this month after he resigned as minister of state for
economic affairs, accusing Mr Sharif of failing to tackle terrorism.

Angola's Unita rebels yesterday said they had shot down a government
helicopter and killed seven soldiers in the northern oil-producing enclave
of Cabinda, Reuter reports from Sao Tome and Johannesburg.
Earlier, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said it had suspended
all relief flights in Angola after one of its planes was shot down this
week. 'We hope to resume the flights as soon as guarantees for the safety of
our flights can be provided by all parties concerned,' a WFP spokeswoman
said in Harare.

SOUTH AFRICAN President F W de Klerk, in twin gestures of conciliation,
yesterday apologised for his National party's imposition of apartheid and
said African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela had presidential
qualities, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
Mr De Klerk said in an opening statement at a news conference unveiling the
party's new colours he 'deeply regretted' that apartheid had deprived blacks
of their dignity and potential to develop. Pressed to say whether this
amounted to an apology, which he had so far refused to give, he said: 'Yes,
we say we are sorry.'
Mr de Klerk unveiled a new blue, white and green flag showing a yellow sun
in place of the powderhorn that has been the party's symbol since it came to
power in 1948.
Earlier, Mr de Klerk said in an interview with CNN television that Mr
Mandela, his main political rival, had presidential qualities. 'I think Mr
Mandela has the typical qualifications, personal qualifications and
qualities, expected of people who fill high office. I respect him,' he said.
He said, however, that the ANC lacked the experience necessary to rule South
Africa. 'To me they are unacceptable because of their adherence to
communism. I think they need direction,' Mr de Klerk said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE'S central bank yesterday urged the government to keep up its fight
against inflation, despite political pressures to relax austerity ahead of
next spring's election.
Mr Efthymios Christodoulou, central bank governor, said before presenting
the bank's annual report that year-on-year inflation, still almost four
times the European Community average, would 'show a swift decline' later
this year.
He said a drop in inflation, together with a fall in interest rates and
increased public investment, would set the stage for economic recovery, 'but
anti-inflationary policies must be strictly upheld even in an election
year'.
Inflation rose from 14.4 per cent at the end of last year to 16.4 per cent
in March. The central bank said price rises for utilities and fuel, together
with a jump in food prices as a result of bad weather, caused the increase.
The economy ministry hopes to bring inflation down to single digits by the
end of the year. However, the government's election campaign organisers are
already demanding an additional wage increase for civil servants, limited by
the budget to 4 per cent in 1993, and the lifting of restrictions on public
sector hiring.
The central bank's exchange rate policy also aims at trimming inflation, by
slowing down the drachma's decline against the Ecu. In the first quarter of
this year, the Greek currency fell by 1.4 per cent against the Ecu, compared
to an overall 8.3 per cent drop during 1992.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (19): Designers exercised - New
Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFF DANIELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The minds of executive car designers are being exercised in new ways as they
look towards the future. It is no longer sufficient merely to extrapolate
the fashionable trend of appearance, to improve performance, specification
and cabin space. Contrary forces are beginning to appear in three important
areas.
It could be argued that the current Mercedes S-class spelled an end to the
conventional approach when it appeared at Geneva in 1991. The world admired
it as a technical achievement, but wondered if it should - given concerns
about the relationship between conspicuous consumption and the environment -
be quite so large and heavy.
Mercedes mounted a stout defence based on the car's unparalleled safety and
on its scrupulous attention to environmental detail, but company executives
privately admitted that if the S-class design had been 'frozen' later, the
car would indeed have been smaller.
If not reversed, the trend had been interrupted. It could no longer be taken
for granted that any new executive car would be bigger and heavier than the
model it replaced.
A similar anxiety has arisen in the matter of appearance. Customers have
begun to mutter that many of the latest models look confusingly the same,
mainly because of the influence of aerodynamics on design. Some
manufacturers, notably Rover with its highly successful 800-series
'facelift', have abandoned the ultimate saving of drag coefficient in favour
of a more distinctive front-end appearance. Individuality has become
important.
The third backlash has been in the area of specification. The 1980s was the
decade of making anything that moved power-operated, and of exploiting the
driver's susceptibility to 'technology' by granting him control of systems
whose operation had previously been taken for granted: the shift pattern
mode of the automatic transmission, the settings of the suspension damping,
the information shown on the trip computer display.
Executive car instrument panels and centre consoles began to resemble
airliner cockpits - at a time when, as it happened, airliner cockpits were
beginning to look much simpler in the interests of reduced crew workload.
Now the word is filtering back to the car manufacturers that customers may
actually resent the fitting of features which are never used once the first
flush of experimentation has passed. The new emphasis is on improving
specification in a way which is 'transparent' - the new buzzword - to the
driver. Comfort, active safety and driving pleasure must be improved, but
the car must perform all the necessary actions without the driver being
aware of them.
Such changes of attitude seem likely to be accommodated by a combination of
new materials, new technologies and fundamentally new design approaches.
To reverse the escalating trend of size and weight, engineers are looking to
lighter materials, principally aluminium, and to subtle changes in the shape
of the car itself. New shapes will also bring new opportunities for
re-establishing individual marque identities.
The need for technical 'transparency' will be met by new electronic concepts
such as 'fuzzy logic' which will enable systems to adapt themselves to users
and their needs without the user ever being aware of anything happening.
Audi is likely to be the first to introduce a new model making substantial
use of aluminium, later this year. Others will follow by the end of 1995.
The need to reduce size as well as weight is more difficult to achieve.
People continue to grow larger and therefore to need more cabin space. Car
designers increasingly look to provide the maximum cabin space in the
minimum road area. This is most easily done by making the car taller and
sitting the occupants more upright. Such an approach brings incidental
advantages such as better driver visibility and easier entry and exit, but
is difficult to square with the consistent fashion trend of recent decades
towards longer, lower cars.
Most designers hope the evident need for a new approach will encourage
customers to look at cars in a less conservative way but a debate is bound
to rage around the relative merits of retaining a conventional but taller
shape, or moving closer to the multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) concept pioneered
by designs such as the Renault Espace and Mitsubishi Space Wagon.
Whichever approach is most widely adopted, designers will certainly try to
avoid that uniformity of overall design which resulted from over-emphasis on
low aerodynamic drag during the 1980s.
The influence of electronics on the design and operation of in-car systems
will continue to increase, but with the emphasis shifting from the control
of engine and transmission to the management of all aspects of comfort.
Engineers now expect electronic systems to play an important part in
achieving a smooth, quiet and vibration-free ride.
Developments in this area include noise-cancelling technology of the kind
demonstrated by Lotus Engineering, and much more sophisticated control of
suspension movement - and possibly also of seat spring characteristics.
Many of these developments will make use of the technology which its
Japanese pioneers sadly misnamed 'fuzzy logic'. There is no real element of
chance in this approach, which actually implies the ability to learn from
experience and thus to adapt.
A fuzzy-logic automatic transmission, for example, may decide after a couple
of apparently pointless down-shifts that it will henceforth remain in the
higher gear in that particular situation. The technique has already been
applied in other comfort-related areas of the car, most notably in the
control of air conditioning.
In summary, the executive car of 2003 is likely to be roomier and more
comfortable, yet lighter, more economical, and more compact at least in
terms of road space occupied. It will also, crucially in the eyes of some
marketing men, be much easier to tell one make of executive car from
another; the magic of marque is about to be rediscovered.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (18): Lure of the feel-good factor
 -How They Go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE simple answer to the question 'How do the latest cars go?' is: at least
as well as cars of twice their price 15 years ago.
Giant strides have been made in improving the refinement and ride comfort,
safety and sheer easy driveability of the medium-sized and medium-priced
car. So much so that the executive car costing less than Pounds 20,000 is
now so good that company car users demanding better must be more concerned
with status than with the practicalities of business motoring.
It is no exaggeration to say that today's superminis such as the Nissan
Micra and Vauxhall Corsa are the equal of yesterday's small-medium cars in
everything but bulk. Much the same comment applies to the small-medium cars
 -such as the Rover 200-400, Ford Escort-Orion, Citroen ZX-Peugeot 306 and
Vauxhall Astra - and the modestly-priced larger models from the high-volume
producers, such as the Citroen Xantia, Ford Mondeo, Nissan Primera, Peugeot
405, Rover 600, Toyota Carina E and Vauxhall Cavalier.
In fact, the latest crop of new models is so good one almost has to nit-pick
to find fault. It is true that the Mondeo's ride deteriorates slightly as
one moves up range and the tyres become wider and squatter - but the upside
is handling and cornering of a standard confined to high-performing sports
cars not long ago.
The performance, refinement and comfort of cars in the size and price
classes of the Mondeo must inevitably encourage some user-choosers to trade
down and reduce the tax man's take. For example, the latest Vauxhall
Cavalier automatic with a 2.5-litre, V6 engine, or a two-pedal Rover 623GSi,
both way below a Pounds 20,000 list price, would probably please any Senator
or 820i user untroubled by loss of perceived status.
The slow but inexorable move towards diesels in company fleets - and
pressure on executives to follow suit - need bring no loss of motoring
enjoyment. The latest turbocharged and intercooled diesel cars such as the
Audi 80 and 100, Rover 825, Citroen XM and Peugeot 605 - not to mention the
BMWs due here in the very near future - are light years away from the
sluggish diesels of the 1970s and early 1980s.
Although they are still more noisy at start-up than petrol cars, they cruise
on motorways in near silence, have lively acceleration and need tanking up
at much greater intervals.
Although the forthcoming abandonment of the over-1,999cc tax barrier on
company cars removes some of their raison d'etre, the just-under-2-litre
petrol engine with a turbocharger can provide the executive car user with
the best of both worlds.
Driven gently with an eye on the boost gauge, they offer 2-litre economy.
Potential 3-litre performance (and, of course, fuel consumption) is there
when required. Sensitive drivers, though, exploit the turbocharged engine's
massive low-speed torque by staying in a high gear for overtaking and hill
climbing instead of changing down, which benefits economy. Good examples of
these 'split personality' cars are the Citroen XM, Lancia Thema and Saab
9000.
But however good the under-Pounds 20,000 cars are, there are always
user-choosers whose companies are prepared to pay more and who are
themselves willing to find the extra income tax. Only in the highest reaches
of the premium quality and luxury car market does the tax burden become
oppressive.
It can, in fact, be argued that lower rates of depreciation affect the total
motoring costs so much that, a Mercedes 190E, for example, is a better
financial bet, long term, than an apparently cheaper car. Its successor, the
keenly awaited C-class, seems likely to be as much a benchmark car as the
190 has been for over 10 years.
For some people, a BMW, Jaguar or Mercedes-Benz has a 'feel good' factor
which is more easily recognised than described. My personal pick of this
top-quality crop would be a BMW 5-Series or 7-Series with a 3-litre or
4-litre V8 engine and 5-speed automatic; a Jaguar XJ6 3.2-litre or 4-litre;
or a Mercedes-Benz 320E. The only other saloon of comparable price that
equals - and in some respects exceeds - their standards of performance and
refinement is that bogeyman of the European luxury car maker, the
superlative Toyota Lexus LS400.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (16): New examples on the way -
Alternatives / Multi-Purpose Vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DERRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government ministers may have been banned from using the expression 'green
shoots of recovery' and Mr Ian McAIIister, Ford's chairman, would only hint
recently about 'a stirring of the soil' but motor industry executives are
confident that at least one area of the business is heading for substantial
growth in the UK and continental Europe: the MPV or multi-purpose vehicle.
This is partly because people are looking for alternatives now that high
performance and sporty cars have been driven out of reach by soaring
insurance rates; partly because once the space, flexibility and comfort of
an MPV has been enjoyed, it becomes difficult to revert to a normal vehicle.
But mostly it is because of the number of new examples about to reach
British showrooms.
The current market leader, by a comfortable margin, is the Renault Espace,
introduced in 1984 and which in 1992 took 41 per cent of the UK market. The
'one box' format, which allows seven seats and lots of space in a vehicle
the length of a medium saloon was so innovative that it is surprising it has
taken the rest of the industry so long to catch up.
Already Nissan, Mitsubishi and Toyota have launched competitors with the
Serena, Space Cruiser and Previa respectively, but next year will see a
joint-venture MPV from Volkswagen and Ford and a second joint venture from
Fiat Group and PSA which will certainly see the launch of a Fiat, Lancia and
Peugeot MPV and possibly a Citroen version too.
Last year the Renault Espace accounted for 3,221 of the 7,851 MPVs sold in
Britain. This year, Renault expects to sell 4,800 examples in a total market
it believes will expand to between 9,000 and 10,000 units.
'Our strategy is to achieve a 50 per cent market share now before the market
finally starts to take off as competitor cars reach the showrooms and to
retain that leading market share by confirming the Espace as the benchmark
or generic model in the sector', says Mr Phil Horton, director of
communications.
Two variants - a turbo-diesel and an automatic V6 - are available to
encourage even more potential Espace buyers, and the company is advertising
the model on television for the first time in the UK to reinforce the
message.
'The Turbo-diesel is already accounting for 35 per cent of customer orders
and the automatic V6 provides the right product for buyers in the Pounds
25,000-plus executive sector', says Mr Horton, who also promises special
editions for the summer to boost sales.
Nissan's manager of marketing and planning, Mr David Archibold, is even more
bullish than Renault about the prospects for the MPV sector.
'We expect it to be a fairly stable market in 1993 with perhaps a modest
increase, but next year sales should reach 20,000 units, up 50 per cent,
because of all the new products coming onto the market', he says.
'We also expect the market to increase by a further 50 per cent in 1995 in
Europe. On the continent, the market is forecast to increase even further
than in the UK, but that increase won't happen overnight here because this
is a more conservative market. But there is no doubt of the increase in
interest in the sector'.
Nissan introduced its new Serena last year. Most buyers were previously
estate car drivers, according to Mr Archibold. Those same estate car buyers
seeking yet more interior space have been identified by Volkswagen as the
people most likely to move into the MPV sector.
At last year's motor show, VW displayed its Caravelle model on the cars
stand for the first time. While the van-based Caravelle is rather larger
than most MPVs and very much at the top end of the segment, Volkswagen, like
Nissan, found that most of those showing an interest were already estate car
drivers, many with larger families unhappy at carrying children without
proper seat belts.
'The Caravelle, with its seven or eight seats, all with belts, fulfils a
need,' said Volkswagen, although it acknowledged that the Caravelle model
was very much a niche product. The company's model in the central MPV sector
comes next year, jointly developed with Ford.
The other imminent joint venture, between Fiat and PSA, is interesting
because of the decision to have an upmarket Lancia version as well as the
standard Fiat derivative. This indicates that Fiat executives reckon there
is room for an executive version which will offer all the comforts and
luxuries of a top-line saloon with the space and flexibility of an MPV.
Mercedes-Benz planners have the same thought and showed a concept of an MPV
at Frankfurt. However there is no word on whether the project has been given
the go-ahead.
Unlikely to reach production is Giugiaro's stunning concept for a mobile
office, shown at Geneva. The Columbus, with its seven seats, four-wheel
drive and outlandish styling, may never be built, although the idea of being
able to work on the move interests several manufacturers and specialists.
Ford has its Granada Office Car, equipped with fax and telephone, and also
offers an Executive Transit van - essentially a luxury mini-coach for groups
of businessmen.
Others have also prepared similar concepts including Chrysler, based upon
the Voyager MPV. But to date executives have been unwilling to pay for the
privilege of being able to work and be in constant touch both inside and
outside the office.
For the time being, the growth area is the straightforward MPV - part car,
part people carrier, and part lifestyle accessory.
Renault's inspired initial design looks set to lead one of the motor
industry's few bright sectors over the next few years, and the company is
not concerned at the way others are cashing in on its idea.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (15): Tax changes could help -
Alternatives / Sports Cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's small but enthusiastic specialist car industry, and larger sports
car makers such as Porsche, could be beneficiaries of changes to company car
taxation in the UK.
This could happen in two ways:
Firstly, as a result of the 8 per cent increase this year in the tax scale
charges of the current system. This has led some analysts of the company car
sector to conclude that many more employees will want to hand back their
company cars in exchange for a cash alternative.
If they do, the chances are that - freed from the shackles of their
companies' lists of 'approved' cars - they will choose a greater variety of
cars.
Some with no interest in cars and modest private mileage are likely to buy
second-hand vehicles and use any cash saved for other purposes. Others, even
if only a small minority, are likely to indulge perhaps a long-nurtured
desire for a more off-beat car which no company finance director would ever
have contemplated purchasing.
Secondly, the new system of company car taxation scheduled for introduction
next year, and based on a simple percentage of new cars' retail list prices,
will make more attractive those sports cars - such as those of
Blackpool-based TVR and lower-priced Porsches - which have tended to fall
foul of either of the current system's two price thresholds of Pounds 19,250
and Pounds 29,000 above which the personal tax assessed rises sharply.
For TVR and other carmakers whose prices do not stray above about Pounds
40,000, the new system is unalloyed benefit. The problem is that the tax
liability continues to rise in proportion to list price, with no ceiling set
by the Inland Revenue.
On that basis, the tax bill on the more expensive Porsches, such as a Pounds
60,000-plus 911 or 928, for someone covering fewer than 2,500 business
miles, becomes burdensome, as tax is levied on 35 per cent of the list
price.
Even if the extra boost to demand is modest, it can have a big impact on UK
specialist sports car manufacturers, which typically measure their output in
hundreds rather than thousands of cars annually.
In the case of Malvern-based Morgan Motor Company, any rise in demand would
be reflected in a lengthened waiting list - still several years' long -
rather than a rise in output.
Morgan, which makes about 450, Thirties-style two seaters a year, is still
quietly congratulating itself for having ignored 1989's on-camera advice of
Sir John Harvey-Jones, former ICI chairman and TV 'company doctor', to
expand production.
Sir John wanted Morgan to make another 300 cars a year, halve the then
10-year waiting list and raise prices.
Three years and a collapsed UK car market later, profits are up and the cars
seemingly remain as desirable as ever.
It is TVR, however, which has had the most dramatic change of fortunes,
sending sales and production sharply upwards during a period when UK new car
sales overall have slumped by about one quarter.
The company will celebrate its 40th birthday - although it has had several
owners - next year as a manufacturer of high-performance sports cars which
have won respect from a much wider audience than long-term TVR afficionados.
The change of fortune is all down to the Griffith, named after a 1960s TVR
two-seater, which caused a sensation when first unveiled at the Birmingham
motor show two years ago and which entered production last year.
Compared favourably in styling terms with manufacturers such as Ferrari, it
has recently been joined by an equally well-acclaimed model, the Chimaera.
Last year, TVR's 200 employees produced a record 824 cars, up from 719 in
1991 and 300-400 annually through much of the 1980s.
Mr Peter Wheeler, who bought the company about 11 years ago, thinks annual
output of 1,500 might eventually be feasible by a slow expansion of the
workforce. But he makes clear that he intends TVR to proceed cautiously as
it will not willingly contemplate any risk of later contraction and
redundancies.
Rivals continue bemused by TVR's relatively cheap prices. The 160mph
Griffith at launch was Pounds 26,000 and the new Chimaera also lists at less
than Pounds 30,000. 'We're not paying any money for marketing machinery',
says Mr Wheeler. 'With others, you're paying for the Le Mans reputation, not
the car itself.'
In the next few months, TVR is expected to bemuse rivals even more. The
Griffith is to be re-launched using the first engine to be designed and
manufactured by TVR 'in-house', a V8 unit with a claimed 300-plus
horsepower.
According to motor industry convention, it has become wildly uneconomic for
any carmaker to design, develop and manufacture its own engines unless it
can spread the cost of several hundred units a year. Mr Wheeler merely
shrugs, points to TVR's expected Pounds 1m profit and suggests that the
industry should wait and see.
There is new life, too, in one of the industry's proudest names, Aston
Martin Lagonda, the maker of luxury sports cars taken over by Ford in 1987.
It caused a big stir at this year's Geneva motor show when it unveiled an
all - new model, the DB7, intended to quadruple production to 800 cars a
year in 1995.
At an expected UK price of 'less than Pounds 80,000', it will still attract
a hefty tax bill as a company car - but a lot less than the Pounds
135,000-Pounds 175,000 Virage and other models on which the existing Aston
Martin range is based.
The DB7 is to be built not at the headquarters in Newport Pagnell,
Buckinghamshire, but a factory at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, where the last of
Jaguar's super-fast, Pounds 415,000 Jaguar (also owned by Ford) XJ220 coupes
are being assembled.
The main design and development work on the DB7 has been contracted out to
TWR (Design), part of the TWR group run by Mr Tom Walkinshaw based in
Oxford. It develops and manufactures Jaguar's high-performance sports and
racing cars.
A new company, Aston Martin Oxford, has been formed to operate the Bloxham
facility in which TWR has taken a 25 per cent stake. The car's bodies are to
be supplied by Motor Panels, the Coventry-based components group. It is
Motor Panels, now part of Mayflower Corporation, which holds the key to
potentially one of the most significant developments in the UK sports car
industry for more than a decade.
Mayflower is planning to invest up to Pounds 24.2m in a collaborative
venture with Rover to develop and produce a new range of MG sports cars.
Neither Rover, the motor vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, nor
Mayflower will officially confirm the project's existence. However,
Mayflower acknowledges that it is in an advanced stage of negotiation for a
contract to design, develop and supply the bodyshell for 'a new specialist
vehicle for European markets'.
Rover, while denying that any final decision has been made on a new MG,
admits it has been exploring 'possible relationships which might be
relevant'.
It is understood that a final decision will be taken shortly on the project,
code-named PR3, with bodyshell production likely to start in early 1995 and
output of the new MG reaching 15,000 to 20,000 a year.
The car is expected to be mid-engined and powered at the top end of the
range by Rover's K-Series engine in a new 1.6-litre version which is
presently under development.
Meanwhile, interest in the MG marque is being rekindled by the launch this
month of the MG RV8, a Pounds 26,000 roadster based on the MGB, which ceased
production when the Abingdon MG factory closed in 1980.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (17): Love affair continues -
Alternatives / Four-Wheel Drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE three years of recession, the British motorist's love affair with
four-wheel drive continues.
Last year, 39,230 on-off road 4x4s were registered, which was 2.46 per cent
of the market and a volume increase of 37 per cent on 1991, when 28,674 were
sold.
Children are taken to school, secretaries go to their offices and
businessmen travel to meetings in rugged, high-slung Range Rovers and Land
Rover Discoveries, Mitsubishi Shoguns and Isuzu Troopers.
Some, but not many, are even driven off the tarmac now and again, fulfilling
the function for which they were designed.
What is so attractive about on-off road vehicles in which the engine's power
is put on the road permanently or occasionally through four wheels, not two?
The question defies logical answer.
Family cars never spin their drive wheels on dry roads. But they may do on
wet ones. In a wintry spell, sheer lack of grip can bring any car to a stop.
Four-wheel drive halves the amount of power each drive wheel tyre has to
transmit - which in turn halves the probability of the tyre losing grip and
spinning. So a car with four driven wheels is four times more likely to keep
moving and behave itself on slippery surfaces than one with only front- or
rear-wheel drive.
In cars with a lot of surplus power, four-wheel drive has a wonderfully
calming effect. There is a strong case to be made for it on safety grounds
alone.
But, curiously, sales of purely road-going four-wheel-drive cars have not
lived up to the high hopes expressed when the original Audi Quattro
turbo-coupe startled the motoring world with its sheer driveability in 1980.
It is the on-off road 4x4 vehicle, descended in concept from the Jeep of the
Second World War, that the public clamours to drive.
All have two-range manual transmissions giving 10 forward ratios, or eight
when automatic.
The paradox is that many - some would say most - owners or users have no
idea how to drive them off-road or have any need of all their heavy and
costly mechanical complication.
The makers know there is a strong streak of fantasising and wish fulfilment
in on-off road 4x4 purchase.
Executives sitting up high in 10-geared Discoveries or Shoguns may justify
their choice on safety grounds - 'It feels so strong' - or convenience: 'I
must be able to get to the station when it snows'.
More practically, they may find the vehicles handy at the weekend for
pulling horse-boxes, dragging boats up slipways or filling with children and
dogs. Young men and women, forced into giving up hot hatchbacks by punitive
insurance rates, turn to 4x4s as macho substitutes with an agreeable hint of
a Barbour jacket, breeches and Purdeys lifestyle.
The rough, tough four-wheel drive you cleaned inside and out - if you ever
cleaned it at all - with a high-pressure hosepipe is a threatened species.
Survivors are the Land Rover Defender, consisting essentially of Discovery
mechanicals and an austerely equipped body, and the cart-sprung Daihatsu
Fourtrak and Jeep Wrangler.
Britain's best-selling 4x4 by far is the highly successful Land Rover
Discovery which is really a Range Rover wearing trendier clothes. The petrol
V8 is very thirsty; the great majority sold are diesels, powered by an
unrefined but frugal 2.5-litre direct injection engine that rewards
light-footed drivers with more than 32mpg (8.83 l/100km).
The 22-year-old Range Rover, which is beginning to look dated, has been
eclipsed by Discovery. It does everything the poshest Range Rover Vogue can
do at not much more than half the price. Main foreign competitors of the
Range Rover and Discovery are the Mitsubishi Shogun, Isuzu Trooper and
Toyota Land Cruiser.
Other full-size on-off road 4x4s used as substitutes for conventional
executive-class saloons or estate cars include the Mercedes-Benz
Gelandewagen and Nissan Patrol and, since the beginning of this year,
Chrysler Jeep Cherokee.
Although the dollar has hardened considerably against sterling since
Cherokee import prices were announced last autumn, it has few rivals as a
value-for-money package. About Pounds 20,000 buys a 4-litre,
leather-trimmed, air-conditioned Cherokee automatic with cruise control,
power windows, alloy wheels and ABS brakes.
It can be used on the road in two-wheel or four-wheel drive. Being very high
geared - 30mph at 1,000rpm - it is quiet and economical - about 20mpg on a
motorway - and handles more like a high-slung Volvo estate than an on-off
road vehicle.
Two interesting newcomers about to go on sale in Britain are the
Spanish-built Nissan Terrano II and its Ford-badged clone, the Maverick.
Nissan knows exactly what kind of market the Terrano II will sell in. It
describes it as a competent performer on the rough stuff but says it is
mainly intended to offer the same level of comfort and refinement as a
modern passenger car. There are three-door and five-door estate versions
with 2.7-litre turbo-diesel or 2.4-litre petrol engines.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (14): Higher premiums curb 'hot
hatch' sales - Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH POULTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago, insurance companies dropped a bombshell which wreaked havoc in
the performance car market. A GTi was the car to be seen in during the
prosperous late 1980s, but cheap power in the wrong hands led to an
unprecedented spate of accident claims. The situation for insurers was
exacerbated by car theft raging out of control.
By 1992, insurance companies had had enough and used the introduction of the
Association of British Insurers' new 20-group insurance system to raise
premiums for performance cars and introduce draconian restrictions in
providing quotes for high-risk drivers and people living in high-risk areas.
This, combined with recession, pushed sales of some performance cars into a
nose-dive.
Particularly hard hit were the cheaper 'hot hatch' cars. New car sales in
this market almost halved in 1992, compared with 1991, mostly owing to
prohibitive insurance costs. But sales of expensive performance cars have
not suffered as badly.
People buying such cars as Ferraris, top-range Jaguars and Mazda RX-7s are
older and prepared to pay the higher insurance premium.
Mr Robin Foster-Taylor, insurance broker of F Rauch, says the insurance
companies are to blame for making performance car insurance too cheap and
easily obtainable during the late 1980s. He says: 'For several years,
premiums were unrealistically low as insurance companies fought for market
share. By charging low premiums, insurers encouraged people to buy
performance cars and claims were intolerably high. Premiums charged now
reflect the true cost of performance car insurance.'
It costs between Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 3,000 with a full no-claims
discount to comprehensively insure the Ford Sierra Cosworth, a favourite
target for car thieves. But sales continue at a lower level as people find
cheaper ways to get their performance kicks. Typically, on a Cosworth
private buyers will fit an immobiliser and alarm and opt for third party
insurance at Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,000. The biggest buyers are company car
drivers whose insurance company will turn a blind eye to the occasional
performance car slipped into a fleet policy of more than 30 cars.
What has happened, says Mr Foster-Taylor, is that the buyer profile has
changed. 'There are fewer inquiries from 21- to 24-year-olds and the buying
age for performance cars has increased to 30- and 40-year-olds.'
He adds that the worst is not over, as the cost of insurance has gone up
enormously in the past 12 months, with three to four premium increases a
year. 'You're looking at premium increases of at least 15 per cent and in
some cases some 30 to 40 per cent for GTis. Premiums will continue to affect
the market for some time to come.'
Yet the impact on sales is selective, with a clear distinction between
affordable boy-racer-type cars and up-market performance cars. This is
highlighted by the contrast between Mazda and Ford. Ford says its XR3i
represented between 10 and 12 per cent of Escort sales. This has now been
reduced to 5 per cent.
Mazda claims its RX-7, an out-and-out sports car, has not been affected at
all by insurance costs: 'This car is sold in limited numbers and is bought
as a conscious decision by buyers who are prepared to pay the extra
premiums.'
Peugeot's 205 GTi is another example of the cheaper hot hatch victim. The
company says that GTis have fallen from 15 per cent of 205 sales to 8 per
cent. 'Increased premiums had a considerable impact on 205 GTi sales, but we
expect the market will stabilise as manufactures take over some insurance,'
says Peugeot.
Porsche in Britain has seen profits fall hard, with sales of 944s dropping
from 1,612 in 1991 to 945 in 1992, but the company says this is mostly as a
result of the recession. 'Premiums for our cars were high anyway, but we
knew we were going to be hit badly with the 20-group system and prepared for
it. As a result of premiums going up, we relaunched our own Porsche
insurance which offers favourable rates to Porsche owners, with premiums set
for three years. Many customers have taken this up,' said a Porsche
representative.
Volkswagen says its buyer profile has changed, particularly with its
introduction of a V6 engine, to older people who want bigger car refinement
but in a smaller car than a Mercedes-Benz or BMW. 'GTi sales have fallen
slightly, as people wait for the new 16-valve model, but there's been no
noticeable reduction in sales of other performance cars such as the Corrado,
Passat and Vento with 16-valve and V6 engines.'
Audi also seems to have come through the insurance shake-up relatively
unscathed. A representative says: 'With our 80 range, we are selling as many
16-valves as diesels. The typical profile of an 80 buyer is professional,
male, married, 35 to 39, household income of over Pounds 30,000 and more
comfortable in terms of insurance.
'The Audi 100 buyer is more mature still, with most having built up
no-claims discount. Being in a lower risk group means insurance is not such
an issue.' The company sold more than 100 of its 150mph S4 models last year
and is launching an S2 performance version of the 80 estate.
Many performance car manufactures are hitting back with 'in-house' insurance
schemes which guarantee a quote and deliver insurance as part of a complete
sales package. The fitting of car alarms and immobilisers is widespread.
The makers are also considering refining their performance cars and making
them less obviously sporty, in an attempt to regain lost sales. As a Ford
representative points out, the market is far from dead: 'The performance
market has been reduced but it is still alive. It's just the way things are
done that has to be a little different now.'

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (13): Manufacturers under scrutiny
 -EC Pricing Debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE investigation of carmakers' pricing policies across Europe is set to
intensify over the next two years.
In mid-1995, the present 10-year 'block exemption', which controversially
allows car makers to use a selective dealer distribution system in
contravention of European Community competition rules, is due to expire.
The industry has been given due warning by the EC competition directorate,
that a renewal of the block exemption will depend importantly on car
manufacturers' performance in conforming with EC limits on car price
differentials across Europe.
The block exemption granted in 1985 was conditional in part on car prices
between member states not differing by more than 12 per cent in the
long-term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year.
A landmark will be reached later this month, when carmakers publish for the
first time comparative EC price lists for selected new cars under a plan
agreed with the European Commission.
Publication of the price lists is aimed at helping car buyers to shop for
bargains across EC borders. The price lists, agreed while Sir Leon Brittan
was still the EC competition commissioner, are aimed at increasing the
pressure on manufacturers to bring car prices more into line throughout the
EC and to make it more difficult for car dealers to discriminate against
foreign buyers.
The price lists, to be published twice a year, will contain the recommended
retail prices, both including and excluding taxes, of one standard-equipment
volume model in each segment of the car market.
The information will contain prices for all EC member states except for
Denmark and Greece which have been excluded because of their excessively
high tax levels.
The lists will include details on the most significant options such as
air-conditioning, automatic gearbox, power steering and anti-lock braking
systems, as well as for right-hand drive, and warranty conditions, delivery
costs and roadside assistance.
The Commission's plan for the biannual publication of price lists is not
legally binding but EC officials have indicated that if carmakers do not
co-operate they will risk losing their jealously-guarded right to operate
the selective distribution system.
Prices, published in May and November every year, will be shown both before
and after tax, in Ecu and in local currency. The Commission dropped its
original demand that manufacturers should supply information about all
possible models and options on the grounds that it would be too
time-consuming for manufacturers and confusing for consumers.
During 1992, the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European
Commission both published reports on car prices in Europe. The reports
failed to remove widespread confusion over price differences, but the EC
report in particular drew attention to many specific cases where price
differentials had exceeded the block exemption guidelines.
According to a survey published late last year by Beuc, the European
consumers' organisation, the prices of certain new models can differ by more
than 40 per cent between countries. Manufacturers point out that prices are
mostly within the 12 per cent band recommended by the Commission.
The pricing debate has been widened beyond Europe by a report from Ludvigsen
Associates, the UK-based automotive analysts, which claims that whatever the
price differences within Europe, European car buyers in general are paying
as much as 30 per cent more for new cars than consumers in the US and in
Japan.
Ludvigsen Associates, which carried out the basic research for the MMC
inquiry in the UK, claims that 'the European car buyer is spending more than
he should for personal transportation' both in absolute terms and in
relation to household income.
The report was the first co-ordinated attempt to compare car prices between
Europe and the other leading world markets, the US and Japan.
According to the study, the largest differences are with car prices in
Japan. It claims that European car prices (net of tax) are 33 to 43 per cent
higher than equivalent prices in Japan, while European prices are 15 to 45
per cent higher than in the US.
On average, it takes 27 weeks of gross family income for a European to buy a
car, compared with 21 weeks in America and 15 weeks in Japan. The UK is at
the European average, while the Germans, French and Belgians need four weeks
less.
Much of the unrest over car prices has been generated in the UK, but some of
the heat has been taken out of the debate by the uncomfortable combination
of recession and last September's devaluation of the pound, which have
contrived to bring UK prices much more into line with the rest of the EC.
A report published in March by Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors
of the US, claims that new car prices in the UK are now lower than in
several other European markets.
The study, prepared by management consultants A. T. Kearney, renewed the
motor industry's attack on earlier research undertaken by European consumer
groups into pan-European car prices for failing to take into account many of
the factors that influence car price variations across the European
Community.
GM maintains that the price variations that do exist, can be attributed
mainly to:
Exchange rate variations of 15 per cent or more over a 12-month period;
Discount variations of up to 10 per cent of list prices between countries;
Equipment specification variations of up to 17 per cent between countries;
Tax rate variations ranging from rates of 15 per cent up to 213 per cent;
and
Differences in finance benefits that can create list price variations of up
to 11 per cent between countries.
Publication by Vauxhall of the new A. T. Kearney study was aimed at trying
to head off action by the UK government to force car manufacturers to change
some of the more controversial terms of their franchise agreements with
dealers.
Carmakers in the UK have rebuffed the request made to them last year by the
Office of Fair Trading to change some of the more restrictive terms of their
franchise agreements. The changes had been recommended in a report published
early last year by the MMC following its investigation into UK car prices.
The requested changes would, for example, allow a dealer to acquire
competing dealerships within his existing territory. They would also remove
limits on a dealer's freedom to advertise outside his territory, or to
acquire dealerships from other carmakers outside his territory.
Carmakers operating in the UK have been reluctant to grant the changes
sought by the OFT, however, in case such a move should undermine their
position when the block exemption is renegotiated with the European
Commission. Franchise agreements in some other EC countries are more
restrictive than in the UK.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (12): Volvo and Saab struggle on -
Upheavals in Scandinavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future direction of Swedish carmakers Volvo and Saab Automobile is
inextricably tied up with their respective volume car partners, Renault of
France and General Motors of the US. Both Volvo and Saab are battling to
staunch continuing heavy losses.
This summer, Saab Automobile will finally unveil a successor for its
venerable 15-year-old 900 series, a car whose origins even date back a
decade earlier to 1968.
The car will be the first fruit of the new model programme that has been
under development since General Motors of the US took over control of the
ailing Saab car business at the end of 1989.
Volvo has also accepted that it is unlikely ever to develop a new car range
again alone. In one of the most far-reaching steps to date in the ambitious
alliance with Renault, the two companies have decided to develop jointly a
new range of top-of-the-line executive cars to be sold in Europe from the
end of the decade.
The two groups decided in the final months of last year to develop a common
platform for the new range, which would allow the use of many common
mechanical components, most importantly common engines and gearboxes.
While having a high degree of commonality 'under the skin' the cars will
have different body styles and will maintain independent Volvo and Renault
brand identities for sale through the two carmakers' separate distribution
networks. The director of the joint car project is from Volvo Car.
It is expected that the Renault version will replace its Renault Safrane
executive car, which was launched last year in Europe to replace the Renault
25. According to Renault, the new joint car range would also replace the
Volvo 850 which has been launched by the Swedish car maker during the past
18 months.
The joint Renault-Volvo car project is taking a similar approach to that
already used by the Peugeot group for its Peugeot and Citroen marques. Its
current top-of-the-range Citroen XM and Peugeot 605 cars share a common
platform, engines and gearboxes, but maintain very separate identities in
the market.
The joint car project marks a significant step forward for the two vehicle
makers, which have been developing a far-reaching alliance since September
1990. They were already co-operating in areas such as purchasing, quality,
research and marketing policies. Now, the two companies are seeking to use
their larger joint purchasing volumes in order to push down supply costs.
The aim is 'to control costs by reducing purchasing prices' with the target
of bringing the proportion of the two groups' total purchases from joint
outside suppliers to 80 per cent from only 20 per cent today.
Renault and Volvo have formed a Purchasing Economic Interest Grouping headed
by the French group's senior purchasing vice-president. Purchasing has been
a key area for the early development of a joint strategy. Outside purchases
of materials and components now account for about 60 per cent of the
production cost of vehicles, not including tooling costs.
Renault and Volvo's car and light commercial vehicle divisions made total
purchases of about FFr85bn in 1992.
They make purchases jointly for more than 30 families of products and
materials. Unified purchasing functions have been created for each set of
products, each headed by a Renault-Volvo executive purchaser. They issue
international calls for bids and assess the capacity of suppliers to meet
the product specifications of both groups.
Renault and Volvo Car have also formed an economic interest grouping for
quality, headed by Renault's senior vice-president for quality.
Overall, a common product plan has been finalised for the next 10-12 years
based on the principle of maintaining two distinct product lines and
separate identities for both brand names, but with common platforms and
components wherever possible.
The two companies have agreed on the common future use of engines, chassis,
gearboxes, axle assemblies and other components. Renault has been given
responsibility for developing diesel engines for the two groups and will
supply Volvo with its future diesel engine. This year, a version of Volvo's
latest petrol engine will be used to power a Renault vehicle.
Renault already supplies engines and gearboxes for the smaller Volvo 400
series which is built in the Netherlands by NedCar, the Volvo joint venture
with Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. In 1991, some 93,500 Renault engines and
82,000 gearboxes were supplied for the Volvo 400. Renault will also supply
engines and gearboxes for the successor vehicle to the Volvo 400 which is
now under development in a collaboration led by Mitsubishi and which will be
launched in 1995-96.
According to Renault, the cross-sourcing of engines with Volvo will involve
about 100,000 engines a year in each direction.
The commercial operations of the two groups are also being more closely
aligned around the world. In France, for example, the sales networks are
still kept separate but there is collaboration in areas such as distribution
of replacement parts, media buying and joint management of used-car
inventories.
Renault distributes Volvo cars in Argentina and Slovenia, while Volvo
distributes Renault cars in the Nordic countries, Australia, Malaysia and
Thailand.
The development of the Renault-Volvo alliance towards a full merger had
marked time in the run-up to last month's French elections, but it is now
expected to gather pace. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman and chief
executive, is keen to keep up the speed of collaboration with Volvo,
whatever pace is set by his shareholders.
'If you stop moving it is bad, you must keep up the momentum. The advantage
of a complete merger is simplicity and speed. Agreement between two
companies does not go as fast as managing a single group. I have a strong
priority to strengthen the links as fast as I can,' Mr Schweitzer said in an
interview last year.
At present, Renault owns a 25 per cent stake in the Volvo car operations, a
45 per cent stake in the Volvo truck and bus operations, and a stake of
close to 10 per cent in the Volvo parent company. Volvo holds a 20 per cent
stake in the Renault parent company, which includes the Renault car and
light commercial vehicle operations, and a 45 per cent stake in the Renault
truck and bus subsidiary.
While Renault and Volvo have different shareholders there will always remain
the basic thorny problem of how savings and profits - or losses  - are to be
apportioned between the two companies. Mr Schweitzer says, however, that 'it
is clear there is no way back. A single command structure would help make
things go faster.'
The influence in the alliance has inevitably shifted towards Renault as its
finances have strengthened and Volvo's financial performance has weakened.
In 1992, Volvo ran up an operating loss of SKr2.25bn following an operating
loss of SKr1.17bn in 1991. It is being forced to reduce its car assembly
capacity to cut the losses with closure of its two smaller Swedish assembly
plants, Uddevalla this spring and Kalmar in mid-1994. Uddevalla only started
production in 1987.
Including these closures, the group is cutting another 4,500 jobs, or 10 per
cent of the overall group workforce including commercial vehicles and marine
engines, by 1995. More than 11,000 employees, including consultants, have
been cut from the Volvo group workforce since mid-1990, with 3,900 leaving
during 1992.
It is also finally acting to simplify its product range. It stopped
production of the Volvo 740 during 1992 and is finally dropping the
venerable Volvo 240 this spring.
Volvo car sales have fallen from 405,600 in 1989 to 359,600 in 1990, then
309,300 in 1991 and 303,800 last year. The car operations have been in loss
since 1990 and suffered an operating loss of SKr1.828bn last year after an
operating loss of SKr1.776bn in 1991 and SKr855m in 1990.
The financial performance of the rival Saab car operations in Sweden has
been equally devastating and the GM-led management is still struggling to
staunch the losses.
Saab Automobile, which is owned 50 per cent by General Motors and 50 per
cent by Saab-Scania with GM holding management control, is forecasting a
'substantial improvement' in its results for 1993, but only after very heavy
losses over the past four years.
The two shareholders are having to pump in a further SKr2.8bn in new funds
this year to shore up Saab Automobile's battered balance sheet.
The company's loss, after financial items, rose again last year to
SKr2.688bn from a loss of SKr2.242bn in 1991 and SKr3.25bn in 1990. In 1989,
the Saab car division of Saab-Scania - before the GM rescue - made a loss of
SKr2.13bn following a marginal profit of SKr11m in 1988. Car sales have
fallen from 109,483 in 1989 to 93,224 in 1990, some 87,500 in 1991 and
86,800 last year.
The company was forced to launch another retrenchment programme late last
year with the aim of reducing costs by SKr2bn a year and eliminating another
1,980 jobs, mainly from the parent company in Sweden, which employed close
to 9,200 at the end of last year. The Saab car group had a workforce of
16,795 at the end of 1989.
Productivity of 57 hours per car at the main Trollhattan plant is supposed
to be improved to 45 hours per car by the end of 1993 and to 40 hours by
mid-1994. Saab has made savings of about SKr1bn on the costs of purchased
materials in the two years 1991-92, but it is now seeking to cut purchased
materials costs by another SKr1bn in 1993-94.
As part of the cost-saving campaign, the co-operation between Saab and GM is
being intensified and Saab is seeking to carry out development work on a
contract basis for GM. The two companies are also establishing a two-way
flow of components with Saab due to begin in 1993 supplying up to 65,000
gearboxes a year to GM Europe's Opel-Vauxhall operations, while it will take
supplies of GM's V6 engine from Vauxhall's new Pounds 193m engine plant at
Ellesmere Port in the UK.
The wait for a new product range at Saab has been long and wearying and the
Saab 900 replacement due this summer - it has been derived in part from the
Opel Vectra-Vauxhall Cavalier - can hardly come soon enough to try to revive
its battered fortunes.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (11): Prices are hardening month by
month - The marketplace, discounts and residual values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DERRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a truth universally acknowledged that discounting of new cars leads to
lower residual values when the time comes to sell. Therefore - because it is
a fact that in the past couple of years discounting has been rife even at
the upper end of the market where manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and
BMW had previously always managed to persuade their dealers not to resort to
price-cutting in order to move the metal  - residual values of these models
must inevitably fall.
Or must they? If there is a direct correlation between discounted new car
prices and used car prices, then why are residual values of executive cars
actually rising?
A glance at either of the two trade price guides - Glass's Guide and the CAP
Black Book - shows prices of good quality used executive and luxury cars
hardening month by month. For example, the April issue of CAP has higher
values for the Alfa Romeo 164, Audi 52, BMW 850 and Ford Granada 24v.
It reports franchised dealers scouring the country looking for late,
low-mileage Jaguars and Daimlers, Rolls-Royce and Bentley prices picking up
and the shortage of late Vauxhall Carlton cars pushing prices up in Vauxhall
dealerships.
'Residual values of executive cars are a lot better than they were a year
ago, mainly because of continued very poor new car sales,' says Mr Leslie
Allen, director of Glass's Guide Service. 'There has been a marked
improvement in one- and two-year-old vehicle values compared with a year ago
 -partly because there have been fewer trade-ins, but also because of the
rapid expansion of private number plates which disguise the true age of a
car.
'This in particular is having a far bigger effect on values than people
imagined', he said, explaining that many people - particularly the
self-employed or those running their own companies - were quite happy to
save money by buying a late-model used car instead of a brand-new one and
then fitting a private plate so neighbours and business associates were
unaware that the 'new' car was not quite what it seemed.
Furthermore, on top of this sort of demand, the very poor level of new car
sales since the peak in 1989 means there are inevitably fewer used cars
coming onto the market today, and the result of that shortage is to push up
values.
Mr Geoff Becque, director of Leasecontracts, one of the contract hire firms
buying thousands of cars a year and thus more exposed than most to falling
residual values, says that although discounting in the past did have an
effect on prices, that is no longer the case.
'The market had to respond to falling residual values which were suffered in
the early 1990s. The situation was not improved by certain manufacturers -
such as Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus - giving discounts where earlier no
such deals were available.
'But most of the depreciation suffered by executive and luxury cars was not
caused by the discounting but by the state of the economy, because the
majority of the buyers of second-hand BMW 7-Series or Jaguar XJ6 models are
small businessmen and they simply stopped buying when times got tough.
'When confidence does return, these people will return to the marketplace
and values will go up again, but in the meantime the manufacturers are
desperately trying to stop the discounting of the recent past'.
Mr Becque quotes examples, such as Pounds 8,000 off a Mercedes-Benz 500SEL
and massive deals being done on BMW 7-Series transactions in the recent
past, but he says there has already been a change in attitude, both at
manufacturer and dealer level.
'The majority of manufacturers and importers have now followed Vauxhall's
lead and reduced dealer margins to 10 per cent, so there is less money
available with which to deal. The discounts are simply no longer there to
give away'.
Furthermore, he says, any generalisation about residual values of luxury
cars is dangerous because the right cars in good condition and with low
mileage 'are making good money and prices are improving'.
To help residual values continue to increase, manufacturers and importers
are ensuring no great oversupply of new vehicles to dealerships, despite the
continuing low level of sales overall. BMW, for example, having found itself
in a position of oversupply at the beginning of the year, has simply turned
the tap off and reduced production of right-hand-drive cars until August
this year.
With fewer cars available to the dealers, salesmen are beginning to realise
that their bottom lines are going to suffer considerably if heavy discounts
are offered to their customers. While corporate customers may still find
themselves being able to negotiate a modest 7.5 per cent, there are far
fewer of the silly deals seen earlier in the year.
The result is already apparent. Mr David MacDougall, general manager of BMW
dealers Coombs of Guildford, says: 'In fact, residual values are very strong
at the moment because there are so few good used vehicles around. It's the
first time I can remember when used values are actually going up in Glass's
Guide'.
But today, as in the past, the first owner of a luxury executive car still
has to suffer quite horrendous losses in value over the first two years of
ownership. Typically, values of a two-year-old car in this sector of the
market will be between 45 and 60 per cent of the cost new.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (10): Budget changes will work
wonders - Advent of the Executive Diesel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor of the exchequer's decision to tax company car benefits on
list price alone, rather than on a combination of price and engine capacity,
will do wonders for the diesel's share of the executive car market.
So far, most of the growth in UK diesel registrations, which just topped
200,000 last year, has been in the below Pounds 15,000, under 2-litres size
and price class. That was a reflection of the financial penalty - roughly a
doubling of the monthly tax take - paid by executives public spirited enough
to run environmentally-friendly diesel cars with engines bigger than 2
litres.
The user-chooser who drives a Mercedes 190D 2.5 (list price Pounds 21,600)
for between 2,000 and 18,000 business miles a year paid Pounds 2,300 tax
under the old rules. This goes up to Pounds 2,481 in the current tax year
but drops by Pounds 467 to Pounds 2,017 in tax year 1994-95.
According to research by BRS Car Lease, 63 per cent of company car operators
believe the budget changes will encourage drivers to switch to diesel. A
similar number - 61 per cent - considered more companies would introduce
diesel-only policies for their fleets.
Hertz Leasing supports this view. It said the budget 'would stimulate
companies to consider the environmental impact of road travel in a way that
promotes thoughtful use.' This would mean the increased use of diesel cars
'which appear to have a positive contribution to make in reducing the
emissions of a wide range of pollutants.'
So the scene appears to be set for a considerable increase in registrations
of all kinds of diesel-engined company cars and of executive models in
particular. Glass's Guide, the motor trade's bible, forecasts 230,000 diesel
registrations this year. This may well turn out to be an under-estimate.
Much of the prejudice which used to lump all diesel cars together as slow,
boring, noisy and smelly has been swept away. Now, almost the only motorists
who believe such a calumny are those who have never driven a modern diesel
car. While a diesel engine can never be quite as silent and refined as a
petrol engine, some of the latest ones get very near to it. Improved
technology - such items as two-stage injectors and electronically-controlled
fuel pumps - have muffled the anvil chorus once heard when a car diesel was
cold-started. When warmed up to proper running temperature, a modern small
diesel does not clatter. It merely mutters.
Outstanding among the smaller ones are the Citroen ZX 1.9td and the Vauxhall
Astra, the latter fitted with a 1.7-litre engine supplied by GM's Japanese
affiliate, Isuzu. With 92 horsepower and 130lb/ft torque, the Citroen has so
much sparkle that it outperforms many petrol-engined cars in the same price
class. A Volcane version, just introduced, looks what it is; a diesel GTi
with a top speed of 115mph and 0-60mph acceleration in 10.3 seconds.
The Isuzu 1.7 turbo engine (82bhp and 124lb/ft torque) has significantly
boosted sales of both Vauxhall Astra and Cavalier diesels. The Citroen's
refined and muscular 1.9-litre XUD unit will be seen shortly in the new
Citroen Xantia (due in the UK in May) and Peugeot 306 diesels.
Direct-injection engines provide even better fuel economy than those with
indirect injection. Although Rover was first in the field with a
direct-injection turbo-diesel car (the Montego), the most successful
application so far is by Audi. The 1.9-litre Audi 80 and 2.5-litre Audi 100
TDI models are fast, with top speeds of 110mph and 124mph and 0-60 mph
acceleration times of 14 seconds and 10.2 seconds respectively. The 80TDI
averages 44.5mpg and the 100TDI, when equipped with a six-speed manual
gearbox, a superb 46.4mpg.
Now that the essential very high pressure fuel injection technology is well
understood and the equipment economically feasible to make, many more cars
will be fitted with direct injection diesels. Another growing trend will be
the use of multi-valves, pioneered by PSA with the 2.1-litre, 12-valve
Citroen XM and Peugeot 605 engines and soon to be taken a stage further by
Mercedes-Benz, with 16-valve engines in the C-class.
Today's diesel-engined executive cars are as quiet to cruise on motorways as
their petrol-engined equivalents. The old idea that diesel car drivers were
interested in nothing but economy was discarded long ago. Executive-class
diesel users may now choose models with the highest trim and equipment
levels, including ABS brakes, leather seats and air conditioning.
One area in which progress still has to be made concerns automatic
transmission. Few two-pedal diesels are available although Mercedes-Benz,
which has offered it throughout its diesel car range for many years, is a
notable exception. Citroen, too, has an automatic option in its small-medium
ZX as well as the big XM which soon will be joined by two-pedal diesel
Xantias. Vauxhall's Carlton is another good diesel automatic.
It is a pity that the choice is so limited because automatic transmission
marries very happily with a diesel engine in a car having adequate
power-to-weight ratio. The argument against it has always been high cost. At
one time the price premium for a diesel car was anything up to 10 per cent.
Now it is far less and in some cases has virtually disappeared, due in part
to the extra cost of fitting petrol cars with elaborate catalytic
converters.
It is not fanciful to suggest that as fuel prices steadily outpace
inflation, the turbo-diesel - up to 30 per cent more economical - will
become the typical executive car of the late 1990s. Drivers will grow used
to tanking up at 500-mile intervals; companies will cut costs; and the
environment will benefit.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (9): Shake-up in 'perk' sector -
Company Cars / The UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT since the 'perk' car first appeared in numbers as a way of getting round
pay restrictions in the early 1970s has the company car sector faced such a
shake-up as that which will arrive on April 6 next year.
On that day, out will go the long-standing system of personal taxation of
the company car benefit based on three engine-size bands and two price
'thresholds'.
In its place will come a much simpler system, in which tax will be payable
on a fixed percentage of the manufacturer's listed retail price of the car -
its 'list' price - plus any extras.
The percentage is fixed at 35 for drivers covering fewer than 2,500 business
miles a year (the classic 'perk' car), with a 'discount' of one third, to
23.3 per cent, for drivers covering 2,500-18,000 business miles and of
two-thirds, or 11.7 per cent, for drivers covering more than 18,000 business
miles. These mileage bands, at which more favourable tax treatment is given,
are about the only 'leftovers' from the current system.
Employees entitled to two company cars will find that both will be assessed
for tax on exactly the same basis, so that the second car - where no
business mileage is likely - will be taxed at the highest rate.
As with the current system, there will be no reduction in the scale charge
payable on a car until it is more than four years old, when the charge drops
by one third.
In the broadest terms the new system will mean a higher tax bill for about
700,000 of the Inland Revenue's estimated 2m company car drivers, but
unchanged or reduced bills for the majority.
In some cases, particularly that of executives with cars priced at just
under the Pounds 19,250 or Pounds 29,000 thresholds of the current banded
scale charge system, individuals face tax rises of up to 60 per cent.
Because there is no 'cap' on the system, drivers of very expensive cars face
tax bills of potentially daunting proportions. Anyone who is running one of
Jaguar's Pounds 415,000 XJ220 sports coupes on the company, for example, and
covering fewer than 2,500 business miles with it, will next year face a tax
scale charge of Pounds 145,000 or an actual cash payment of Pounds 58,100 at
the higher marginal rate of personal income tax.
Under this year's scale charge structure, that same XJ220 driver has a scale
charge of Pounds 15,060 and an actual payment of Pounds 6,024.
At a slightly less exalted level, the new taxation structure has sent a
tremor of dismay through companies such as Rolls-Royce Motors and Aston
Martin, each with cars in the Pounds 100,000-plus sector.
Rolls-Royce Motors, still struggling to emerge from heavy losses, has
already asked the government to relent and set a ceiling on car prices above
which the tax charge will not rise any further. So far, the appeal seems to
have fallen on deaf ears.
But it is not only new luxury cars which will fall foul of the fresh system.
Many executives have chosen to run classic cars, from James Bond-style Aston
Martins to exotic 1960s Ferraris, as low-mileage company cars providing
something 'different'.
They could do so because they were taxed on the basis of original market
value, rendered insignificant by inflation.
The new system will base tax levels on current market value, the precise
fixing of which has yet to be spelt out. Even though the bottom has already
fallen out of the classic car market because of recession, the new system
inevitably will damage the sector's hopes of recovery next year.
Despite this, the new system is not intended by the Treasury to produce any
increase in real terms in the total tax take - now approaching Pounds 1.5bn
 -from the company car benefit. That has already been taken care of by
further stiff increases in tax scale charges applicable during the current
tax year, and announced in last month's budget by Mr Norman Lamont,
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Mr Lamont now regards the company car overall to be fairly taxed relative to
private motorists as a result of this year's 8 per cent increase in the tax
scale charge on the car benefit itself, 20 per cent on the tax charge on
free fuel for private use and the ending of the 50 per cent reduction in the
fuel scale charge for high business mileage drivers.
If there are big losers under the new system, there will be a substantially
larger number of 'winners', particularly among the drivers of lower value
cars which are in genuinely essential business or working use. Tax bills for
these could fall by as much as one third.
The driver of a 2-litre Rover 800 with a price just under Pounds 19,000
currently pays tax on a scale charge of Pounds 4,485 if he or she covers
less than Pounds 5,000 business miles, as the car is assessed solely by it
being in the 1.4litre-2litre engine capacity band. Under the new system,
however, it will attract a scale charge of about Pounds 6,700, based on 35
per cent of 'list' price.
In order to avoid paying extra tax, and all other things being equal, the
driver would have to switch to a car with a list price of about Pounds
12,800.
Not only should the new system mark the end of production of the 'tax break
specials' and other market distortions already much criticised by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission - it has the benefit, from the
manufacturers' point of view in particular, of being self-adjusting.
Instead of the new car market holding its breath each year waiting to see by
how much the Budget would increase scale charges, no action should be
needed. The amount of tax payable will be determined by the rate of increase
in new car prices.
So the new system will contain inbuilt incentives for both companies and
employees to choose smaller and more fuel-efficient cars - seen as desirable
on environmental grounds - and act as a brake on manufacturer price
increases.
Once certain effect of the latest scale charge increases and the new system
is to make many more companies and their drivers examine whether the time
has come for the car keys to be handed over in favour of a cash alternative.
There are no straightforward rules to follow in determining whether the
company or employee will benefit from such a switch to cash. Whether it will
be worthwhile depends on each individual's circumstances and will need
precise calculation.
Nevertheless analysts such as Mr Stewart Whyte, a director of consultancy
Fleet Audits, and Mr Brian Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit
Consulting, predict that it will become much more widespread, particularly
for 'perk' users who would then be able to take advantage of current high
depreciation rates by buying 'nearly new'.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (8): British addiction has
gradually spread - Company Cars / Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The finance director at a large US group's European headquarters in Brussels
for years resisted all entreaties by middle managers to introduce a company
car scheme. The finance man was an American and he carried with him American
attitudes. Companies in the US usually allocate company cars to only a
handful of top executives, for status reasons, and to sales people when they
need them.
Eventually the finance director was promoted and replaced by an Englishman.
One of the first changes he made was to find a suitable company car scheme
for middle managers.
Almost certainly the new finance director had a personal interest. He would
have had long experience of the benefits that company car provision can
bring to an executive - benefits which would be just as valuable in Brussels
as in London. He would have enjoyed the hassle-free aspects of company car
ownership which most managers believe more than makes up for the tax they
have to pay on the notional value of this perk.
This is an illustration of how the UK addiction to the perk company car has
gradually spread through the rest of Europe.
The virus took hold in the UK for good reasons. During the 1960s and early
1970s there were periods of pay 'freezes' and continuous high personal
taxation. Companies had to find ways other than salary increases to capture
and retain skilled managers. Before long, even relatively junior members of
the management team were allocated company cars.
The UK government in recent years has been attempting to reduce the burden
of personal taxation and, to even the balance, has pushed up substantially
the tax on perk cars, arguing that companies no longer have to use this
benefit as an incentive. But, despite the government's determination and
even in the depths of the deepest recession the UK has witnessed since the
Second World War, very few companies have made big cuts to their car
schemes.
Meanwhile, the concept has been growing more and more popular in other
European countries. Executives all over Europe now enjoy having 'wheels'
supplied and maintained by their companies. The trend was certainly
encouraged by the speed in which perk car provision accelerated in the UK.
Many international companies have their European headquarters in the UK, so
their executives picked up the habit there. As the Brussels example quoted
above goes to show, UK executives at multinational corporations carried the
concept with them when sent to other parts of Europe.
The spread of the virus has also been helped by the fact that company car
provision policies are not usually decided at the centre in large
corporations but are left to local management to sort out.
Tax authorities all over Europe now take account of the perk car as a matter
of course and executives pay tax on the notional benefit one way or another.
According to Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt at Monks Partnership, the UK-based
remuneration consultants, the tax rate is usually based on between 20 and 25
per cent of the capital cost of the car. Since the recent UK Budget, Britain
is now coming into line with this concept.
Monks recently looked at 7,600 posts in 1,342 organisations in Europe and
found that a car was included in the remuneration package of most senior
managers in all countries except Switzerland. In that country there are good
tax reasons why only just over half the senior managers have company cars.
Mr Vernon-Harcourt stresses, however, that tax is by no means the prime
consideration when senior managers are considering their company car
policies. The status of individual managers and 'competitive practice' (the
fact that other companies are offering this benefit) are more important in
the decision.
The Monks research showed that the general manager of a subsidiary of a
multinational business is virtually assured of a company car wherever he
might be positioned in Europe. The number of companies offering this benefit
ranged from 98 per cent in Spain and Belgium - both beating the UK's 97 per
cent - to 83 per cent in Denmark and the Netherlands and 68 per cent in
Switzerland.
The pattern was very similar for directors responsible for a leading
function such as finance, sales or production and ranged from 100 per cent
in Ireland and 97 per cent in Germany to 65 per cent in Sweden and 56 per
cent in Switzerland.
Policies begin to diverge in Europe when it comes to allocating company cars
to less-senior managers, such as the chief accountant reporting to the
finance director or the sales manager reporting to the sales director.
Monks' Management Remuneration in Europe Survey shows that in some
countries, such as the UK, the Netherlands and Germany, the incidence of car
allocation at this level of management remains high - at about 80 per cent -
whereas it falls to about 65 per cent of similar posts in Italy and France
and below 40 per cent in Denmark, Spain and Switzerland.
Undoubtedly there is great reluctance in some countries to allocating perk
cars below board level. The car as a necessity is another matter and Monks
found that in France and Italy a manager below board level was more likely
to be allocated a company car if employed in sales and marketing rather than
in accounting.
Because a perk car is supposed to be an incentive to join and remain with a
company, in the UK the concept of the user-chooser has also taken hold: the
executive, or the sales person, can select a car from a list offered by the
company.
Monks estimates that only 2 per cent of UK companies do not offer this
benefit to directors and only 12 per cent do not offer it to sales people.
On the other hand, half the companies in Austria do not even give directors
a choice and 70 per cent do not offer a choice to sales representatives.
Germany follows the middle road, with 30 per cent of companies not offering
directors any choice of company car and 26 per cent not offering sales
people a choice.
Monks also attempted to discover differences in the cost of cars allocated
to various managers in European countries compared with the cost of those
used by sales representatives. Comparisons between countries are difficult
to make because of shifting currency alignments, but it is clear that in the
Scandinavian countries the sales person's car is often nearly as good as the
one offered as a perk to managers.
'The question is,' says Mr Vernon-Harcourt, 'does this reflect the fact that
Scandinavian sales reps have to travel long distances, often in poor weather
conditions and have to have cars as good as managers, or does it simply
reflect Scandinavian egalitarianism?'

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (7): Manufacturers are kept
guessing - The UK Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE size and structure of the UK executive car market has been dictated, to
a very large extent, by two price 'break points' and - since 1988 - a
2-litre engine size threshold above which company car taxation levels
increase considerably.
Carmakers and importers have adjusted their production and marketing
strategies to take advantage of this. That they have felt constrained to do
so is an illustration of the importance of the business car sector relative
to their total sales.
For example, although BMW makes 'only' 40 per cent of its sales to business
'fleet' buyers - its own definition is a company taking 10 or more of its
cars - it believes that as much as 85 per cent of its total sales are
business-linked, through sales to accountants, small partnerships and
similar entities. Thus these purchases are also subject to company car
taxation calculations.
From next year, the existing tax framework will be dismantled in favour of a
much simpler system based on a percentage of a car's retail list price.
Company executives will then be much freer to choose what cars they like.
For the moment at least, what those buyers will like remains a matter of
important guesswork for manufacturers seeking to determine what their future
model line-ups should be. Some strands of likely change are starting to
appear, however.
One of the most important is diesels. The arguments in their favour are
already powerful. They are much more economical than equivalent petrol
models, by up to 30 per cent. This is assuming greater importance as the
price of fuel continues to rise by well in excess of inflation.
The price premium demanded by manufacturers for their diesel models is also
disappearing as economies of scale on diesel engine production increase.
And, important in terms of improving their performance in the executive
sector, the larger engines size needed to deliver supposedly similar
performance to a petrol engine will no longer be subject to a tax penalty
next year.
The volume manufacturers fit diesels in their executive car ranges as a
matter of course. But the take-up to date has been relatively low because of
their sedate image and the engine-size tax penalty.
However, the latest high-speed turbocharged car diesels, far from being
inferior in performance to glamorous-sounding multi-valve 'Gti'-type cars,
are superior to them in most normal conditions of use.
Their relatively much greater torque delivered at low engine speeds is more
usable than high power - as the executive sector itself is poised to
discover.
Citroen is setting the ball rolling with a 'Volcane' version of its ZX which
it is marketing as a 'hot hatchback' in every sense, including outright
performance. Nevertheless, beneath the bonnet is a turbo diesel also capable
of up to 50mpg.
But the watershed will be reached in mid-year when BMW, the German executive
car maker whose image has been built largely on high performance, launches a
range of diesel cars in the UK.
It is doing so with trepidation, anxious that its performance image should
not be prejudiced among British customers who have been buying some 40,000
BMWs a year. Nevertheless, many industry observers believe its initial 900
sales target is an underestimate of likely demand for a car still capable of
about 120mph.
Vauxhall, Ford and some other makers also expect an increase in the capacity
of petrol engines chosen by many buyers as a result of the tax penalty
disappearing.
Under the existing taxation regime, the 'typical' executive car has tended
to be a highly specified model of just under 2 litres. Now, they expect,
many buyers of such cars will be willing to pay a bit extra for, say, a
2.5-litre V6 of the type that Vauxhall has just put into production at
Ellesmere Port. A further significant number of buyers, they believe, will
opt for the larger engine but a less luxurious specification in order to
minimise their liability to tax under the incoming list price taxation
scheme.
With traffic congestion continuing to increase, an already apparent business
car market trend towards smaller cars - so-called 'downsizing' - is likely
to be boosted further by the new freedom to specify cars with larger
engines. Vauxhall has already caused a stir in this context by launching the
V6 in a relatively cheap version of its medium-sized Cavalier.
A big problem with analysis of the executive sector is that each
manufacturer tends to define the sector differently.
However, BMW is widely regarded as the archetypal 'executive' car. On its
analysis, the lower end of the executive car market - which it defines as
including its own 3 Series, Volkswagen Golf GTi and VR6, top specification
Cavaliers, Rover 400s and similar - was badly hit last year by a sales drop
of 19.75 per cent in a total market which was almost unchanged from 1991. In
unit terms, sector sales fell from 555,319 to 445,637 - within which,
however, BMW's own share rose from 4.6 to 6.3 per cent. But it was a long
way behind segment leader Ford whose share was 22.5 per cent - even if down
from the 25.7 of 1991.
However, previously the sector had been doing relatively much better than
larger executive cars, which were themselves hit by the imposition of the
2-litre tax break in 1988, causing a sales plummet in 1989, for example, of
bigger-engined cars typified by Jaguars and BMW's 7 Series.
The 'middle' executive segment typified by BMW's 5 Series also went into a
sharp downturn in 1991, by more than a quarter, so that last year the fall
of 6 per cent to 105,802 from 112,554 was relatively mild.
It is a sector fought over fiercely by, among others, Volvo's 800 and 900
Series cars, Granadas, Rover 800s, Saabs and mid-range Mercedes. Last year,
BMW saw its share shoot up to 10.3 per cent from 5.9. But its satisfaction
was minor compared with that of Rover, which knocked Ford off its
market-leading pedestal and down to fourth place.
It is volume manufacturers, rather than their more obvious rivals, that
companies such as BMW and Audi have most cause to fear. For all the volume
makers are seeking to acquire for their more expensive products exactly the
same type of image that BMW and its cohorts are most anxious to protect.
Rover, with its just-launched 600 range - developed jointly with Honda,
whose own Accord version is now in increasing production at Swindon -
provides one of the most obvious examples of that threat.
Strictly speaking, it is no more a 'volume' manufacturer than BMW - indeed
Rover's own output was considerably lower than the Bavarian manufacturer's
last year.
But Rover has been working hard to distance itself from its BL 'volume car'
roots and many believe that with the 600 its success will accelerate
sharply.
Professor Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School, a motor industry guru, is
one such believer. He only half-jokingly refers to the new Rover as the 'BMW
400'.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (6): Appearances will be deceptive
 -The Future
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
What radical changes have the manufacturers of executive cars in store for
buyers as the decade draws to a close? On the face of it, not many. The real
developments will occur beneath the cars' more slippery surfaces. The
vehicles will look similar to today's.
Key components such as engines, transmissions and suspensions are unlikely
to change radically, despite experiments now taking place to change that.
The cars will also be made in a similar way.
The main differences will be hidden inside, driven by the frequently
conflicting requirements of environment concerns and safety legislation. The
designer's dilemma is to balance expectations of better fuel consumption and
lower exhaust emissions with those of higher equipment levels and greater
crash protection. The problem is that demands on one side mean taking weight
out, and on the other mean adding it.
Increasing attention to environment and safety will redefine future
executive cars every bit as much as they will city run-abouts. But as the
years unfold, the cost of putting the latest technologies and new materials
into showroom cars will ensure that executive cars are the earliest
pioneers.
It is far easier, for example, to incorporate the cost of an on-board
navigation system or rear-seat air bag on a Pounds 40,000 saloon than on a
Pounds 1O,000 hatch-back. Only later, as volumes increase and costs come
down, will similar devices spread to cheaper cars.
There are scores of precedents, ranging from fuel injection and anti-lock
brakes to multi-valve engines and air conditioning. Kit like this, regarded
as exotic only a few years ago, was once fitted only on expensive,
high-performance cars. Now it is commonplace on much more modest family
saloons.
For an indication of how little the executive car's appearance will change
over the coming years, it is necessary to look no further than the concept
coupe which Mercedes-Benz displayed at the recent Geneva motor show. While
sleek and rounded by Mercedes standards, its lineage is self-evident. But
that car, or one rather like it, will go into production as a coupe based on
the next 200-300 Series. That means it will still be on sale in the next
millenium.
Where future generations of cars will differ is in packaging. They will
contain similar amounts of passenger and luggage accommodation in smaller
bodies. It is part of an industry-wide downsizing. Just as mass-producers
such as Volkswagen and Fiat are pressing ahead to bring cars smaller than
the Polo and Uno to market, so up-market makers are planning models smaller
than those they have traditionally sold.
The best-known example is the surprise announcement by Mercedes in January
that it will build a town car. BMW's experimental Z13 city car is a clear
indication of its thinking. Audi, too, has decided to produce a Golf-sized
model later this decade. Saab is considering a small car rather than the
limousine it once planned.
None of this means abandoning the luxury market. Those cars will still be
made. But they will be more compact, without forfeiting the traditional
creature comforts and performance which buyers at this price bracket expect.
One significant departure may be the use of aluminium for a car's chassis.
The metal has long fascinated car engineers, who admire its weight-saving -
and therefore its potential to improve mileage or performance - while having
reservations about its cost and ease of production and repair.
According to Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman-designate of BMW, 'A BMW 318
made of aluminium would have the performance of a 325.' Ford's experimental
Synthesis 2010, an aluminium saloon in the Taurus category, is 8cwt, or 28
per cent lighter than the car around which it is based.
Honda's low-volume NSX sports car is so far the only production model to use
an aluminium chassis. Now the industry is awaiting Audi's replacement for
the V8 saloon this autumn. Known as D2, the top version will utilise an
aluminium chassis.
Equally important, electronics will feature even more prominently. They
already manage many automatic transmissions and engines for maximum
efficiency. Now they are at the heart of research into areas such as noise
control, active suspension, electronic steering, navigation systems, head-up
information displays, multiplex wiring and cruise controls which maintain
distances between moving vehicles.
'What we have now is a mechanical device with electronics attached to it,'
explains Mr Bruce Blythe, until recently Ford of Europe's vice-president in
charge of strategy. 'In the future, we will have electronic devices
complemented by mechanical parts.'
The other area claiming large proportions of research budgets is power
units, as companies endeavour to cut emissions and improve economy. They
were given added impetus when California - an important and wealthy market -
laid out a timetable requiring ultra-low and zero-emission vehicles (Ulevs
and Zevs) at the end of this century and into the next.
The development prompted America's Big Three manufacturers - General Motors,
Ford and Chrysler - to join forces for the first time in an electric power
consortium. Battery-powered cars are unlikely to have the same impact in
Europe, at least in the foreseeable future, although any company which
wishes to sell cars in California needs an electric car programme.
In the main, though, car companies are relying on further refinement of
internal combustion engines to give them the improvements they need in the
late 1990s. At Jaguar, that means testing two-stroke V6 engines. BMW and
Mazda think there is potential for hydrogen power. Direct injection of
diesels will become much more commonplace.
Many other companies are turning to methanol (neat or mixed with petrol)
fuel, or to hybrids. These usually combine battery power (for use in towns)
with petrol or diesel engines (for use over long distances and for
recharging the batteries).
Volvo's attention, on the other hand, is focused way into the future with
the Environmental Concept Car it revealed last September. The aluminium ECC,
which combines nickel-cadmium batteries with a diesel-fuelled turbine, is
Volvo's idea of a four-seater for the year 2000. Ambitious, certainly, but
few of Volvo's competitors believe anything like ECC will be on sale by
then. Their faith is in incremental improvements rather than the great leap
forward.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (7): Birthplace of
captive insurance movement - Bermuda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of its geographical location and rising competition from centres
nearer to home, Bermuda continues to attract its fair proportion of offshore
business from Europe. European investors are prominent in the British
colony's growing investment fund and trust management industries, but the
island's offshore insurance industry has attracted most interest from
Europeans.
The birthplace of the captive insurance movement in the 1960s, Bermuda is by
far the biggest of the world's offshore insurance centres and is home to
some 1,324 captive insurance companies - insurance subsidiaries which insure
the risks of their industrial or commercial parents. Last year 36 of the 59
new captives companies formed were from the United States, but surprisingly,
in view of the rising competition from centres such as the Isle of Man,
Guernsey, Luxembourg and Dublin, 16 of the new captives were from Europe,
six of them from the UK.
Mr Malcolm Butterfield, the registrar of companies in Bermuda, estimates
that between 15 and 20 per cent of the total number of captives on the
island are European and says he is 'cautiously optimistic' about the
island's prospects as a centre for European companies.
Many of the island's biggest European captives are British: companies such
as Grand Metropolitan, Hanson Group, and British Airways have a
long-established presence. Captive managers suggest that Bermuda is finding
it more difficult to compete with Luxembourg and Dublin, for the business of
companies which have operations in more than one European country. However,
Bermuda more frequently wins out when a company forming a captive is seeking
to insure risks on an international basis, especially when it has a US
subsidiary.
Mr Brian Hall, president of Johnson and Higgins, the US broker, which
manages several hundred Bermuda-based captives, says the island is
benefiting from the tendency for larger international companies to set up a
network of captive companies.
US companies such as Wang and Digital have captive insurers in Vermont, a
growing US captive domicile, as well as a reinsurance captive in Bermuda,
for example. Mr Hall predicts other international companies could follow
suit, possibly by setting up a European captive in Dublin or Luxembourg, a
US captive in Vermont, and a reinsurance captive in Bermuda. More
importantly, European investors have a large stake in the new independent
insurers and reinsurers which have grown rapidly in recent years. Zurich,
Europe's second biggest insurer, has a majority stake in the Bermuda-based
Centre Re, the world's fastest growing reinsurer. Centre Re underwrote more
than Dollars 1bn of premium income in 1992, its fourth full year of
existence and now counts with assets in excess of Dollars 4bn.
Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss group which is the world's leading
engineering company, is the ultimate holding company of Scan Re, another
fast growing Bermudan reinsurer, which set up in 1988.
Both companies specialise in 'finite risk' reinsurance, often offering
buyers multiyear contracts to cover their biggest risks. The deals, which
also include provision for the reimbursement of premiums if losses do not
occur or are lower than expected, are designed to bring greater stability to
the reinsurance marketplace.
According to Mr Jens Juul, the president of Scan Re, Bermuda's regulations
and tax rules, as well as the extensive network of legal and accounting
services, provide an ideal framework for the development of this business.
'There is no question that worldwide knowledge in these type of products is
concentrated in Bermuda.'
ABB underlined their confidence in Scan Re by investing a further Dollars
50m in the company, bringing its total capitalisation to Dollars 100m.
Revenues in 1992 amounted to between Dollars 140m and Dollars 150m.
Indeed over the past six months there have been indications that
Bermudan-based finite risk reinsurers could play an important part in
bolstering the beleaguered Lloyd's of London insurance market.
Towards the end of last year the UK's Commercial Union joined with a number
of US investors to back a Dollars 365m-strong reinsurance company, Mid
Ocean, formed partially to reinsure business originally underwritten in
London. The group expects premium income to amount to more than Dollars 200m
in its first year of operation, says Mr Henry Keeling, Mid Ocean's
underwriter, who was formerly deputy underwriter at syndicate 51 in Lloyd's.
More recently Merrett Holdings, the Lloyd's agency, has sponsored the
formation of a Dollars 70m Bermudan-based reinsurer, to exclusively
reinsurer business originally underwritten by Merrett's nine syndicates at
Lloyd's. In between these developments Centre Re agreed an ambitious
programme to provide reinsurance to Lloyd's Names, in a deal negotiated by
the insurance brokers, Steel Burrill Jones.
Outside the reinsurance arena Bermuda is attracting increasing European
interest in its mutual fund industry. European demand is responsible for a
third of the sales by the 235 mutual fund companies based in Bermuda.
Europeans are also interested in taking advantage of Bermuda's new trust
law, which allows a limited number of overseas companies to manage
Bermudan-based trust companies. Coutts, the private banking arm of the UK's
National Westminster Bank, is one of three new trust companies to have been
set up in the last six months. Schroders, the UK merchant bank, and Lombard
Odier are the other two.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (9): Aggression
increases - Channel Islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Channel Islands may be the legacy of an ancient feudal past, with their
loyalty to the English Crown and independence from its parliament. But when
it comes to cultivating financial services, they are extremely up-to-date.
From a low base in the early 1960s, the financial sector has grown
substantially and now compromises around half of national income in both
bailiwicks, while employing about one-fifth of the workforce.
For a long time, the flows of offshore funds helped keep the economies of
the Channel Islands buoyant and sheltered them from the downturn in the UK.
As the recession spread throughout the world in 1992, activity began to slow
considerably.
That has brought a new sense of aggression to the islands. Mr Colin Powell,
chief adviser to the states of Jersey, says he has begun running selective
seminars and lunches across Europe to encourage new 'high quality business'.
There are also negotiations to launch new bilateral arrangements with EC
countries for the marketing of financial service products.
He claims Jersey coined the phrase 'offshore Europe', to describe the
Channel Islands, which are adjacent to the EC and yet free of its
requirements - notably the financial services directives.
While other onshore European centres with tax advantages such as Luxembourg
and Dublin gradually see their privileges eroded, the Channel Islands have
no plans to relinquish their special status.
Mr Powell sees Switzerland as his main competitor, and says there has been
considerable interest from business looking for new offshore centres since
that country announced it was considering membership of the European
Economic Area and the EC.
Marketing efforts by Guernsey are more vigorous still. The island is
conscious it has fallen behind Jersey, and is making attempts to catch up.
'When anyone thinks of the Channel Islands, they think of Jersey,' admits
one local Guernsey official.
The blunt fact is that there are more similarities than there are
differences between the two islands, except that Jersey has a larger share
of the market.
The Channel Islands initially grew as a centre for offshore funds after
decolonisation in the 1960s, which left a large number of British
expatriates looking for new safe locations in which to live or to deposit
money.
The contraction of the sterling area and the search for new locations for
offshore funds by US banks and other institutions helped boost flows during
the 1970s.
More recently, a lifting of exchange controls in countries such as Taiwan
has helped increase the volume of money looking for a home.
Both the principal Channel Islands were able to take advantage of their
perceived stability, respectability and historical links to help garner new
business.
Mr Powell thinks Jersey was able to benefit most because it had already
attracted a substantial tourist industry, which brought with it
infrastructure of communications, restaurants and hotels. Once financial
services followed and legal, accounting and other specialist expertise built
up, the momentum rapidly gathered pace.
Both islands have attempted to regulate financial services by controlling
the quality of institutions which are permitted to set up operations there.
The authorities have the power to refuse new admissions, and their policy
has been to increasingly reject all but the more prestigious businesses,
with a good reputation, healthy profits and a strong regulator in the
country of the parent.
That does not mean the islands have been free from use as a channel for tax
evasion by companies and individuals through bank accounts, the contents of
which are shrouded in commercial confidentiality.
Neither are the company reporting requirements too arduous. Little public
information such as financial performance or even beneficial owners is
available for public consumption on the official returns filed by Guernsey
and Jersey corporations.
But they stress that they have introduced legislation to help co-operate on
money laundering and fraud.
Both Guernsey and Jersey also proudly point out how they refused application
to open branches by the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
There are differences between the two islands. Guernsey is far ahead of
Jersey in the cultivation of captive insurance companies - it had the
largest net additions for any offshore centre in the world last year.
Jersey was impeded by Victorian companies legislation which forbade the
creation of insurance companies and which was was only repealed in 1983.
In general, the authorities keep one eye on business and the other on what
their rival island is doing. The International Business Company is a new
concept to be enshrined in both islands' laws this year. It allows companies
to pay tax on a sliding scale from less than 1 per cent to more than 20 per
cent. The signs are that the market for offshore funds - always insulated
from domestic recession - is beginning to recover. Mr Richard Wilkinson,
chairman of the Guernsey Fund Managers' Association, draws confidence from a
recent survey of his members suggesting that profits will be higher this
year than last.
Meanwhile, the challenge for the Channel Islands will be to balance the
importance of future financial service growth against the needs for other
sources of income such as tourism, and the physical constraints and growth
policies of the islands as they try to maintain their identity.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (8): Triple shock for
principality - Liechtenstein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE normally tranquil Alpine principality of Liechtenstein has been rocked
by three shocks in the past year or so.
Revelations that some of the large frauds perpetrated by Mr Robert Maxwell
were executed through secretive Liechtenstein-based foundations severely
battered the principality's image as a reputable tax haven.
Then, just as the blaze of publicity surrounding the Maxwell shenanigans
died down, the people of Liechtenstein themselves upset their financial
community, voting in December to join the European Economic Area (EEA).
The EEA is the new expanded free trade area being established between the
European Community (EC) and the seven countries of the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) except Switzerland. While tax matters are specifically
excluded from the terms of the EEA treaty, the signatories are committed to
respecting EC laws, both those that exist and those that will be passed in
the future. And it would be rash to assume that the EC will not some day
require all member countries to co-operate in tax matters.
Also, after a three-year transition period, Liechtenstein will have to allow
foreign banks and legal firms, up to now prohibited, to establish offices in
the principality.
The latest blow has been the publication of a substantial book* written in
English by a Zurich banker, Mr Uri Ramati, on how its trusts and foundations
work. The title, Liechtenstein's Uncertain Foundations, betrays its emphasis
on some of the potential dangers for users of the principality as a refuge
for capital, an emphasis not universally welcomed in Vaduz.
Financial leaders have taken these shocks largely in their stride. Lessons
have been learned, reforms have been made and others are in the works and
the government is working hard to align its financial laws and practices
wherever possible with those of the EC.
Liechtenstein is an unusual tax haven anyway. For one thing, it is an
industrialised country, with a very high standard of living among its 29,000
inhabitants. The principality's main economic problem is a chronic shortage
of labour. Consequently, while it is content to operate an offshore
financial centre, it does so on its own terms. Its stock in trade is total
secrecy and non-co-operation with other governments, but only on tax
matters.
It will not tolerate any other form of financial criminality. Whether in the
Maxwell case or in others involving fraud or insider trading, Liechtenstein
has always been eager to co-operate with foreign governments' investigators,
and they try hard to prevent wrongdoing.
Although the government believes its legal structures have been largely
adequate to fight financial crime, it has continued to improve them. Insider
trading, for example, is now a criminal offence as is drug money laundering.
A reform to the banking act last year has obliged auditors to pass on their
reports on banks to the Banking Commission.
The due diligence treaty between the government and the five local banks is
considered adequate, even though it allows beneficial owners of bank
accounts to hide behind lawyers. It may be brought in line next year with
the Swiss convention, which requires bankers to know the identity of
beneficial owners, because of Swiss pressure.
Mr Hubert Buchel, secretary of the Banking Commission, says a general money
laundering law is needed, but the government would rather wait until
Austria, which has a similar legal system, has developed its legislation in
this area.
In the area of trust law too, reform is in the works. Trustees and bankers
have formed a new association and Mr Werner Keicher, its head, hopes to have
a first draft of a new law ready by 1994.
Mr Keicher, a director in the trust firm Allgemeines Treuunternehmen and the
director of the Maxwell Foundation, was not specific about what reforms
would be made, but he acknowledged some of the criticisms made in Mr
Ramati's book were fair.
The principality's most popular trust products for non-residents are
anstalts (establishments) and stiftungs (foundations). The typical user of
these entities is someone who wants to be able to stand up in a court in his
home country - for whatever reason - and deny ownership of assets other than
those registered at home.
Legally speaking, the denial is usually accurate. The typical ownership of
an anstalt is in bearer form, with the identity of the owner left blank,
while the so-called 'founder' of the stiftung is usually a Liechtenstein
trustee or lawyer.
Mr Ramati points out that in the case of the anstalt there is always a risk
that the ownership document can be misplaced or fall into unfriendly hands,
and a recent legal case arose over who actually owned the assets in an
anstalt because of this problem.
In the case of the foundation, Mr Ramati says the risk is that the
Liechtenstein-based 'founder' or director may take a more restrictive view
of how to disburse funds to heirs than the real founder intended. And if, as
in most cases, he is the sole director, there is no possible appeal.
Mr Ramati's recommendation is that someone thinking of forming a
Liechtenstein foundation should not do so unless he has a close family
friend who can be appointed as a director to represent the family interest.
Mr Keicher said that he often recommended to clients that they select the
person who is to succeed the Liechtenstein founder rather than leave it to
the Liechtenstein trust firm.
He also wanted to see the taxation of foundations of non-residents move away
from a simple capital tax to a more normal system. As foundations do not
have to file financial statements, many now only pay the minimum SFr1,000
required by law.
He said he recommended that clients agree to have their foundations pay on
the full capital amount as this helps in proving that the assets belong to
the foundation.
Mr Keicher said the main lessons from the Maxwell case were personal rather
than professional. 'For our firm, the mandate was far too big. It was
impossible for us to keep up with 400 different subsidiaries.'
Liechtenstein's Lilliputian dimensions also mean that its membership in the
EEA could cause problems. The country does not want to become another
Monaco, teeming with tax exiles and offices of foreign banks. Mr Buchel
doubts that many foreign banks will set up offices, simply because it would
be difficult to staff them.
Mr Rene Ott, deputy managing director of Bank in Liechtenstein, the
principality's largest bank with SFr39bn under management, hopes some do
come. 'The more competitors you have, the more seriously you are taken as a
financial centre,' he says.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (6): Haven across the
Irish Sea - Dublin
</HEADLINE>

ANYONE who has journeyed across the Irish Sea in one of the frequent storms
that blow there, can appreciate how this stretch of turbulent water truly
separates Ireland from mainland Europe.
Even the strongest of stomachs can be put to the test by the heaving deck of
a rolling car ferry, battering its way through white-crested walls of water
to the haven of Dublin port.
An easier passage has been found though for billions of pounds of funds
which have encountered a financial haven lying within the legislative and
physical boundaries of the EC. It lies just upriver from Dublin port in a
large complex of new, glass-fronted buildings and is known as the
International Financial Services Centre (IFSC).
A relative newcomer to Ireland, the offshore financial services industry has
flourished like a hybrid seed landing on well-prepared soil.
Since 1990, when the first new IFSC office block opened at the derelict
docklands site, more than 150 offshore financial services companies have
been established in Dublin, and another 80 are in the pipeline. Some 1,300
people are employed in the sector, a figure which is expected to rise to
more than 3,000.
Activities include corporate and group treasury management, fund management,
captive insurance and reinsurance, asset financing and management, and
foreign exchange dealing.
A 10 per cent corporate tax rate until 2005 approved by the European
Commission, tax write-offs on infrastructure investment, rent allowances,
the availability of skilled labour, state-of-the-art telecommunications and
a flexible legislative environment have all been factors in encouraging some
of the biggest names in the corporate and financial services world to
establish offshore operations in Dublin.
Mr Ray Pillai, the director of IBM's international treasury services company
in Dublin, which organises long and short-term finance for the parent, said:
'The low tax rate was just one of the reasons for setting up our group
treasury here. Our principal intent was to establish an in-house banking
operation, but we wanted to find a place where we could have the flexibility
to add on other services such as captive insurance or fund management as
appendages to the core operation. Belgium rather than Ireland would have
provided the lowest tax environment, but the licences issued in Ireland
allow us flexibility and to operate with other parties outside of the group.
For instance, if we wanted to finance a joint venture we could do so out of
Ireland. The tax regime is a bonus.'
According to Mr Brendan Logue, the manager of the financial services
programme at the Industrial Development Authority(IDA) which is responsible
for the overseas marketing of the IFSC, more than 300 offshore financial
services companies have so far received certification to operate out of
Dublin.
A problem facing the IFSC's further growth, however, and which could also
affect existing operations, is a shortage of office space. The Customs House
Dock Development Authority, which is licencing the property development side
of the IFSC, has approved the construction of 1m square feet of office space
at the centre, of which the first stage comprising 450,000 square feet has
been completed. This is now 95 per cent occupied by 30 companies.
The Authority says that the second phase to build the remainder, is due to
be completed by 1997 and should be sufficient to house the remaining
companies which have licences and which are scattered around the capital.
The negotiations have been stalled, however, for the past 12 months.
Under the terms of the offshore licences, the remaining 270 companies must
move into the IFSC out of their temporary accommodation, or risk losing
their tax concessions. The problem is that since the IFSC development work
began, office rents in Dublin have dropped considerably from the IPounds
29.50 per square foot that is the going rate at the IFSC.
According to commercial property agents in Dublin, average office rents in
the capital are now as low as IPounds 10-15. They say that those companies
operating outside of the IFSC are concerned about the high rents being asked
at the IFSC, the long leases involved which are between 25 and 35 years, and
the high fit-out costs at the high-tech IFSC which in many cases are surplus
to many of the smaller companies' requirements. The second phase of the IFSC
development has been planned to offer a slightly lower rental rate of
IPounds 25 per square foot, but the developers say that they cannot afford
to finance it if they cannot be guaranteed minimum 25-year leases with their
tenants.
Mr Kilian O'Higgins, of Sherry Fitzgerald, one of the largest commercial
property agents in Dublin, said: 'Many of these financial services companies
want the option to be able to leave when their tax incentives run out. It is
a mobile business and they don't want to be locked into long leases.'
The government has been leaning on the larger and longer established firms
with licences to move into the IFSC, or to sign up leases for the second
phase development. A government spokesman said that the pressure will
continue and that revocation of licences 'is an option that could be used,
but we would rather not have to exercise it. We hope that this is a matter
that can be negotiated between the tenants and the developers'. However, all
the new leases signed so far of a pre-letting programme for the second phase
are for 25 years.
Mr Keith Hazley, the general manager of Gaiacorp Ireland, the currency
trading subsidiary of a Danish company Gaia Trust, which moved to Dublin
from the Cayman Islands two years ago, said: 'We are a small but expanding
company. The problem with the IFSC is that it is simply not economic at the
current rates being asked, to move there and take on surplus space to allow
for future growth of the company. There are so many uncertainties for us to
move there.' He said that the company would not pull out of Dublin though
'unless we were forced to do so'.
He like others also complained of the lack of ancillary facilities at the
IFSC such as parking, restaurants and pubs, which would make it more
attractive for staff to work there. These are due to be built under the
phase two development, which remains stalled.
According to one finance manager working at the IFSC: 'The buildings
themselves are very modern and well equipped, but outside there are very few
facilities close at hand such as restaurants or pubs. There have been a lot
of promises, but nothing, literally nothing has materialised.'
So unless a compromise can be reached, allowing companies to take shorter
leases at the IFSC, or by offering additional incentives for them to move in
there from cheaper office space elsewhere in Dublin, some doubt must remain
whether the IFSC can grow much further.
