FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (5): Fine-tuning the
regulations - Isle of Man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ISLE OF MAN has achieved a broad-based maturity over the past 10 years
and earned a place among the best-regulated international financial centres.
Its products are sold worldwide, it has the largest off-shore life assurance
industry and one of the largest captive insurance industries.
But the transition from the gung ho days of the 1970s and early 1980s to
today's exacting standards required the dogged persistence of regulators and
legislators. The emphasis now in the island is on fine-tuning the
legislation and mopping-up any remaining malpractices.
Before the institution of the financial supervision commission (FSC) in
1983, the island did little to dispel its image of a haven for tax evaders
and other assorted people of dubious practices. Though regulation existed,
it was not backed up by supervision and malpractice was rife. However, the
attitude of the legislators was dramatically changed in 1982 by the Pounds
42m crash of one of the island's banks, the Savings and Investment Bank.
The grief and furore surrounding this event prompted the Manx government to
set up the FSC, which has subsequently worked hard to introduce a regulatory
regime that makes the island safe for investors. But it is a constant
juggling act - on the one hand ensuring investors and depositors are
protected and on the other ensuring the regulations do not become so onerous
as to frighten away firms and institutions that make up the sector.
The island, in the middle of the Irish Sea, is a self-governing Crown
dependency of the UK. It is not a member of the EC but has some access to it
through the UK and shares in its customs and excise administration.
The financial services sector produces around one-third of the island's GNP,
a contribution expected to expand over the next 10 years to 50 per cent as
other industries decline. The sector's client base is largely individual
rather than corporation - high net worth individuals and expatriates based
all over the world. Services offered include banking, investment, insurance,
trust and company administration and a shipping register.
In spite of the recession, the island continues to experience growth, albeit
at a slower pace than two years ago. With corporate tax fixed at 20 per cent
and interest paid gross, it remains an attractive place to do business. But
the Manx government is not complacent and last year reduced tax payable by
fund managers on fee income from 20 per cent to 5 per cent to add to the
island's attractions.
Because of its size, population 70,000, the island offers easy and frequent
access to members of the industry, civil service and government. The
downside of this is that with so much business and social contact, the lines
defining conflict of interest in the long term become blurred in some
instances.
Though this does not happen to the majority of those in the finance industry
because most top executives have been brought in from outside the Isle of
Man. It is likely to be at least a decade before the island can produce
sufficient staff with the levels of education and experience to fill most of
the top posts.
But commercial courses are now more readily available at the island's
college of further education and jobs exist to draw back those who go to
England to graduate. Expansion of the island's professions is producing some
excellent young lawyers and accountants, most of whom are choosing to eschew
the previously de rigueur membership of freemasonry or other closely-knit
groups in the island and to retain their autonomy.
Mr William Cain, QC, the Manx attorney-general, said: 'There are no major
legislative changes in prospect for financial services. But in the current
legislative programme we are addressing time-share operation and company and
trust administration.' He added that in the longer term the island will
update its insolvency law and company law.
The Isle of Man is the first offshore jurisdiction to tackle the problems
created by abuse of facilities for trust and company administration. These
fiduciary services were initially instituted as aids to legitimate tax
planning and much of the business remains in that category. But over the
years, criminal elements have found them ideal instruments to aid their
illicit money-go-round.
Some practitioners appear to attract dubious clients with persistent
regularity. The proposed legislation hopes to deal with this type of client.
Preparation of the legislation is the remit of the FSC. Mr Jim Noakes, its
chief executive, said: 'The majority of people in the industry think some
action in this area is desirable but there is a lot of anxiety about what
the FSC may propose - anxiety about the unknown.'
Mr Peter Vanderpump, senior partner of Touche Ross in the Isle of Man, said
his firm has always supported the government's efforts to ensure the island
is well regulated. But he is less sure about this proposal and said: 'There
is a danger of over-regulation with the consequent risk of losing
good-quality business. In our view, the proposed regulation of company and
trust managers, in the form that we have seen it, falls into the category of
over-regulation.'
Mr Noakes said there will be full consultation with members of the industry
before the legislation is drafted next year.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (4): Hiccups on the
economic horizon - Gibraltar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairman of the Madrid stock market's Securities and Exchange
Commission, Mr Luis Carlos Croissier, pays Gibraltar the sort of backhanded
compliment that every offshore centre thirsts for. 'Lately we've been seeing
Gibraltar crop up again and again,' says Mr Croissier. 'We are used to the
Dutch Antilles, to the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands but now, when
we are investigating, we are also up against Gibraltar.'
Never mind that the guardian of honest broking in Spain is following up
allegations of dubious financial dealings conducted, in this case, by
companies linked to the Kuwait Investment Office. If one, or several, of the
trails leads to Gibraltar then the British crown colony on the tip of south
Spain is living up to its offshore pretensions and is on a level with its
peers in the secretive and tax efficient game.
In Gibraltar itself, however, a lot of the brashness that was evident just a
year ago seems to be evaporating. 'People were far too bullish about the
offshore business,' says one well-established lawyer on the Rock. 'The
business, if it is coming along at all, is not coming quick enough. There
are a lot of hiccups on the economic horizon.'
The main evidence of this is a Pounds 220m office complex that was developed
by the Scandinavian Baltica group on land reclaimed from Gibraltar's
harbour. It is virtually empty, more of a Canary Wharf look-alike at the
entrance to the Mediterranean than the hive of activity that had been
intended.
The truth of the matter is that when Europe catches an economic cold, a
place like Gibraltar risks getting pneumonia. The Rock still has a long way
to go before it becomes a robust offshore centre.
Baltica has written off the Europort complex and is ready to take around
Pounds 50m from any group that can take the white elephant off its hands.
Rather more embarrassing than the massive investment miscalculation is the
fact that serious fraud investigators from the UK and Denmark have been
going through the Europort books. The investigations in this case involve
allegations of political bribes and scams that lead from Gibraltar to
Liechtenstein.
This is the sort of publicity that Gibraltar does not need. It is bad enough
to have the Madrid government, which continues to press for the eventual
devolution of the crown colony to Spanish sovereignty, periodically
rubbishing the Rock as a centre for drugs smuggling and money laundering.
Nor does the Rock need a row that has just blown up over the privatisation
of the colony's companies register. Rather than pitting Gibraltar against
angry investors, fraud squads and Spanish coast guards, this row has
seemingly divided Gibraltar's own business community down the middle.
At issue is the allegation that the privatised body, called Company House
(Gibraltar) Ltd, is owned by a Liechtenstein-registered trust that will
provide the working capital for registry's overdue computerisation. The
colony's government, led by Chief Minister Mr Jose Bossano, 'referred to
nobody (over the privatisation), tendered nothing and did everything
secretively,' says an opposition member in the colony's House of Assembly.
The main opposition party to Mr Bossano's government has termed the
privatisation process 'entirely unacceptable'. This is in part because
Liechtenstein has become a dirty word for many on the Rock ever since it
emerged that the late Mr Robert Maxwell was trying to switch his
Liechtenstein registered companies to Gibraltar at the time of his death.
'Revenue authorities the world over are suspicious of that place,' says Mr
Christopher Samuelson of Gibraltar's Riggs Valmet asset management group.
'Liechtenstein is where you hide things, it is not the sort of base that you
use for open tax planning.'
Critics of the privatisation have a point when they say they cannot
understand why a Liechtenstein trust should have access to the inner
workings of Gibraltar's corporate life. 'How would the Isle of Man like
Gibraltar to run its registry?' asks Mr Samuelson.
Mr Bossano's government is also in the business firing line because it has
moved in on Gibraltar's fledgling Investment and Business Development Board.
Originally intended to be a joint venture between the private sector and the
government, the board now looks as if it will be taken over entirely by the
latter and its chief executive has resigned as a result.
Those who are hostile to Mr Bossano claim the turnaround over the board is
yet another example of Mr Bossano's high-handedness. The government insists,
however, that it must reserve for itself the right to channel all inquiries
over the Rock's development and should have all the decision-making
responsibilities.
The worst row, however, is one that has far more serious implications for it
pitches Mr Bossano's executive against the UK government, the Treasury and
the Department of Trade and Industry. Essentially it is over Gibraltar's
exact status within the EC and it concerns the degree to which the UK, as
the Community member that is responsible for Gibraltar before the European
Court of Justice, should regulate in the colony so as the ensure the
compliance of Brussels' directives.
Seen from Gibraltar the prospect of UK officials running day-to-day business
on the Rock is disquieting. It will, for a start, throttle the sort of local
initiative that is required to search out the niche business in the highly
competitive offshore sector. Mr Bossano has forcefully argued this point in
London, much to the Madrid government's annoyance, and it is still not clear
what sort of compromise arrangement can be worked out.
Rows of one kind or another will always break out in the sort of hothouse,
over-crowded community that Gibraltar has become. Exacerbating matters,
intensive checking by Spanish customs officials at the colony's land
frontier with Spain ensures horribly long queues and serves to fuel the
tempers. Add to this the economic climate and, in the circumstances,
Gibraltar does remarkably well to bring in the high quality business that it
does.
Hassan and Partners, a top law firm on the Rock, says it is 'very busy' at
present. This is partly because it has just launched a Pounds 100m ADR
(American Depositary Receipts)issue in New York on behalf of Spain's Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya. This was a follow-up to a similar issue last year and a
third is now likely thus demonstrating that when it comes down to money
Spanish institutions tend to forget the nasty politics that envelop the
Gibraltar dispute.
'At a time of recession, our units continue to grow and this shows we have a
healthy banking community,' says Gibraltar's banking supervisor Mike
Davidson. 'I'm reasonably happy in the current environment.'
Gibraltar needs to mend fences with its own business community, with the UK
and with Spain. A tall order perhaps but should it carry off such a trio of
tasks and should global confidence return, developments such as the Europort
complex will cease to be a disaster zone.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (4): The sheen has faded - Japanese
Perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WAYNE APONTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sheen has faded for executive carmakers in Japan. After six consecutive
years of double-digit growth, with sales 69.1 per cent higher in the year
ending in March 1991, top-of-the-line vehicle builders are coming to terms
with the maturing of the domestic market.
The slowdown has come as a shock to Japanese makers who invested in new
capacity on the presumption that the hectic growth of the late 1980s would
continue through the 1990s. The sluggishness has given these makers all the
more incentive to broaden their market share in Europe and the US.
European carmakers have also been forced to rethink their strategies in the
Japanese executive car market. When imports rose by 35 per cent in 1989, the
Japanese market appeared the most lucrative in the world, but that rapid
growth now seems more a by-product of the bubble era than a sustainable rate
of expansion in an increasingly competitive market.
Sales volumes for Japanese cars with engines above 2,000cc - regarded as
luxury-class vehicles - for the fiscal year ending March, were down 2.1 per
cent, compared to the 7.2 per cent decline of total new car sales, excluding
mini-cars.
Japan's leading executive car producers, confronted by the realities of
economic downturn are now recalculating their longer-term projections. Even
an immediate economic recovery will hardly produce the sudden surges in
sales that were characteristic of the late 1980s. Mr Ken Sawada, general
manager of the international department at the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers' Association, expects sales growth of about 1 per cent over
the next few years.
Japanese consumers' emphasis in 1993 is on value not luxury. Companies are
cutting administrative costs and reducing the number of cars available to
executives. Individual buyers are holding onto their cars for longer periods
or looking to second-hand vehicles. Last year, second-hand car sales grew
4.2 per cent. That trend is also reflected in the luxury market.
While the nation's new car ownership rose 3 per cent last year, sales of
used cars with engines bigger than 2,000cc increased by 33.2 per cent,
according to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association. Japanese carmakers
hope they have already touched bottom, as better figures in March, when
sales rose by 5.9 per cent, have generally been hailed as a sign that the
economy and the car industry are heading into better times.
Toyota was the luxury leader in Japan for 1992 with a 42 per cent share,
while Nissan captured second place with 20.7 per cent and Honda acquired
third place with 13 per cent.
Mitsubishi and Mazda claimed 4.25 and 4.50 per cent of the domestic luxury
car business respectively.
The Mazda case highlights the changed conditions in Japan. The
Hiroshima-based carmaker was hoping that its Amati would be in the big
league with Toyota's Lexus, Nissan's Infiniti and Honda's Acura - called the
Legend in Europe - the three luxury brands that are making inroads into the
international market at the expense of manufacturers such as BMW and
Mercedes-Benz of Germany.
Mazda cancelled plans in March to produce cars in Europe with Ford and
dumped blueprints last October to set up a separate dealer network in the US
and Canada to sell high-priced cars under the Amati name.
The fifth-ranked Japanese carmaker has been unable to keep pace with the
heavy investments needed to compete in the luxury sector. Mazda is expecting
pre-tax profits for the fiscal year ended in March to drop 69 per cent to
Y6bn yen, and simply does not have the resources or the models to match
Nissan and Toyota at present.
During the bubble era of the late 1980s, when the Nikkei average rose ever
higher, many companies were able to raise funds at almost no cost and they
supplemented profits with financial dealings known as zaiteku. But the fall
in stock prices and the market's inability to digest new issues has made
carmakers more conscious of capital costs and return on investment.
In response to the nation's sluggish economy and low demand, co-operative
relationships among Japanese vehicle makers are on the rise, where each
company serves as the ideal supplier of models or parts for the other. Also,
Japanese carmakers strive to trim production costs by standardising parts
and reducing personnel.
Nissan, for example, plans to cut full-time staff by about 10 per cent by
1995, while Honda has cut one shift at its Saitama factory.
Mr Takashi Oka, general manager of passenger car production planning and
marketing at Nissan's technical centre in Atsugi City, said that Japan's
carmakers were having to come to terms with new a identity. He recalled that
30 years ago, prices were low and quality was poor, yet Japanese still
bought vehicles.
'Ten years ago, the quality was good and the prices were low and people
bought them; now the quality is good but prices are high', he said,
explaining that consumers had their price limits. Awareness of these limits
is part of the 1990s atmosphere.
The troubles at home have not dampened the enthusiasm of carmakers to build
a share in the European and the US executive car markets. Toyota and Honda
started producing cars in the UK last year, alongside Nissan, which has been
producing in Britain for six years. Mitsubishi is laying the ground work for
a 1994-95 joint venture plant with Volvo in the Netherlands.
But the recent appreciation of the yen puts extra pressure on Japanese
carmakers who had hoped to have a pricing and quality edge over western
competition.
In the US, the strong yen, coupled with improved consumer perception of
American cars, has eroded Japanese carmakers' market share, which in
February was 27.2 per cent - the lowest level since 1989.
According to Mr Rainer Jahn, president of Mercedes-Benz Japan and chairman
of the European Business Council's automotive committee, EC luxury car
manufacturers who invested heavily in the Japanese market at a time when the
nation's economy was considered invincible in the late 1980s, will
eventually benefit from a Japanese economic recovery.
The fact that the total Japanese market has been growing over the past 15
years has created space for importers. But whether imports of foreign cars
will expand rapidly is open to question, Mr Jahn noted.
So far, the downfall of Japan's powerful economy has hurt EC manufacturers,
which dominate about 75 per cent of the imported car market in Japan. Sales
volumes of EC carmakers fell 14.5 per cent last year, compared to an overall
drop of 8.6 per cent for the passenger car sales.
Meanwhile Ford, General Motors and Chrysler collectively increased sales by
3 per cent, according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association.
The big gains on imported cars are ironically being made by Japanese
producers. In March, for the first time, the top-selling manufacturer of
imported cars in Japan was Honda, overtaking Volkswagen, BMW, and
Mercedes-Benz, which have traditionally dominated the market. Honda's
success shows that Japanese carmakers are not relaxing. They continue to
emphasise quality and reliability, and may emerge when the present downturn
ends even better equipped to compete with their European rivals.
Mr Oka at Nissan said that while corporate attitudes to cost had changed,
the value-orientation of customers was not much different than during the
1980s. He is confident that rapid growth will return by the end of the
decade.
However, it is not clear how long the downturn in Japan will last. Japanese
carmakers have found it difficult to forget the rapid growth of the recent
past, and still expect the executive car market to be an engine for profit
growth. It is not clear how much room for expansion remains on Japan's
already clogged roads.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (3): Extensive realignment of
product policy - The Germans / Mercedes-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a surprising departure from corporate tradition, Mercedes-Benz has
decided to re-think the whole way it does business.
Under the radical leadership of Mr Helmut Werner, who takes over as chief
executive in May, it is embarking on what he describes as 'a very extensive
realignment of its strategic product policy'.
In practice, Mercedes-Benz has decided to transform itself from 'a car
manufacturer with a long tradition in the luxury class' into 'an exclusive
full-line manufacturer offering high-quality vehicles in all segments of the
market,' says Mr Werner.
Before the end of the decade the company is planning to launch a
Mercedes-Benz people carrier or multi-purpose vehicle similar to the Renault
Espace or the Toyota Previa; a four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicle for
off-roading or, more probably, for cruising the more elegant suburbs of the
world's cities; and a small Mercedes-Benz city car for urban commuting.
These will be produced in addition to the present three ranges of luxury and
executive cars.
Mr Werner, in an important policy speech outlining the change of direction,
admitted with surprising frankness earlier this year that Mercedes-Benz's
present luxury cars were 'over-engineered'. He said that if the company
persisted with such a policy for developing new models it would end up being
'priced out' of world markets.
The break with tradition and the new awareness of pricing is to be marked
already this summer with the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz C-class car
range which will replace the 190 series.
The company has accepted that radical changes in the world vehicle market
mean that Mercedes-Benz will no longer be able to demand premium prices for
its products based alone on an attractive image.
In order to avoid the 'trap' of being priced out of markets, Mercedes-Benz
has decided to turn on its head its whole product development strategy.
Instead of developing the ultimate car and then charging a correspondingly
sky-high price as in the past, Mercedes-Benz is taking the dramatic and
radical step of moving to 'target pricing'.
It will decide what the customer is willing to pay in a particular product
category - priced against its competitors - then add its profit margin. It
will then cost every part and component to bring in the vehicle at the
target price.
Such an approach is not entirely new. Chrysler has begun to use it to great
effect to fuel its renaissance in the US, but in Stuttgart this is the stuff
of revolution.
Mercedes-Benz's brave new world is not going to be won without pain and
dislocation, however. Mr Werner accepts that the company still lags way
behind its rivals in costs and productivity.
Fixed costs are 'still appreciably too high', layers of management are to be
removed, there will be a 'rigorous pruning' of the white collar central
staffs. The life-cycles of Mercedes products have to be reduced to about
eight years from 11 years, while the development time for new products has
to be cut from up to 57 months to less than 44. The break-even volume for a
vehicle line must be cut to 60,000 a year, he says.
About 13,000 jobs were eliminated last year in Germany, reducing the
workforce from 225,000 to 212,000 by the end of 1992. Another 14,500 jobs
are scheduled to be cut in the coming two years.
There is to be a new decentralised organisational structure, with so-called
'performance centres' aimed at achieving cost savings of up to 30 per cent.
And more vehicle assembly will be moved outside Germany to locations such as
Mexico, South Korea, Spain and probably the US.
Mercedes-Benz is to invest DM800m to build a new technical centre in Germany
for the development of future car models. The new research and development
centre will play a crucial role in the company's controversial reform plans.
According to Mr Dieter Zetsche, Mercedes-Benz director for car development,
the company plans to concentrate all its new vehicle design, development and
engineering operations at only two locations instead of the present 18 sites
in south-west Germany.
The new technical centre will be built at Sindelfingen in south-west Germany
near Mercedes-Benz's main domestic car assembly plant. It is planned to
begin operations in 1996 and will have a workforce of about 4,500. The
design and development of engines and transmissions will be concentrated at
the group's Unterturkheim plant in Stuttgart.
Mr Zetsche says that the company is also seeking to increase its use of
outside components suppliers to develop and produce parts and systems for
future vehicles. It is aiming to reduce the amount of so-called 'vertical
integration' - the share of a vehicle made in-house rather than purchased
from outside suppliers - from the present high level of 45-50 per cent.
Among Mercedes-Benz's new product plans, the people carrier or multi-purpose
vehicle is closest to the market and should be launched by late 1994 or
early 1995, says Mr Werner.
The vehicle, code-named T0, will be built outside Germany at Mercedes-Benz's
plant at Vitoria in Spain. The company is planning to invest DM356m in
Spain, and the capacity of the plant will be expanded from 28,000 vehicles a
year to about 60,000 a year.
The new vehicle will be produced in two variants, as a passenger-carrying
MPV and as a light commercial vehicle to replace the present MB-100 van.
According to Mr Werner, Mercedes-Benz's new direction is being forced by
'radical changes in the structure of the car market.' He maintains, that
'the traditional vertical market structure defined by engine size is
increasingly giving way to a horizontal market structure.
With a proliferation of niche vehicles such as MPVs, off-road vehicles and
roadsters, it is body shapes and forms of propulsion (petrol/diesel/hybrid,
electric) that are becoming the more important distinguishing features,
rather than engine size and performance.
'Mercedes-Benz has to gear itself to a future market structured primarily
around a diversity in vehicle concepts rather than around engine prestige
value,' he said.
As car buyers forsake the conspicuous consumption of the 1980s and place
more stress on a vehicle's functional use than on its role as a status
symbol, Mercedes is also beginning to investigate radical new ideas of car
ownership and of selling cars.
By the late 1990s, Mr Werner suggests that personal car leasing programmes
could be available, where the customer might have access to several
different vehicles during the year, for winter and summer use, for holidays
or for commuting.
In terms of production sites outside Germany, Mercedes-Benz has been
developing plans for passenger vehicle production in the US and is
assembling cars in small volumes in Mexico.
In South Korea, it has recently entered a far-reaching co-operation deal
with Ssangyong Motor to enable the South Korean vehicle maker to begin car
production in Korea based on Mercedes-Benz technology.
Ssangyong, the fifth-largest Korean vehicle maker, is planning to produce up
to 50,000 cars a year from 1996 for sale both in the domestic and export
markets. The Ssangyong car will be based on components and systems from the
existing mid-range Mercedes-Benz 200/300 series.
According to Mr Werner Niefer, who retires as Mercedes-Benz chief executive
next month to be replaced by Mr Werner, the deal with Ssangyong gives the
German carmaker 'the key to one of the biggest growth markets of the
future.'

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (2): Important strategic moves -
The Germans / Porsche, Audi, Volkswagen and BMW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a marketing wheeze, the joint-venture project under which Porsche will
help Audi develop a new sporty car to pad out its range has much to
recommend it.
Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, the new man in charge of Volkswagen's classiest
marque, was enlisted from Mercedes-Benz last year to polish up the marketing
of a technologically advanced and virtually all-new range of quality motors.
His job description, drafted by his predecessor, Mr Ferdinand Piech, now
clearing up the mess at Volkswagen group headquarters, involves him in
closing the gap between Audi and BMW and Mercedes-Benz, market leaders in
the German quality league.
The prestige of Porsche, which will build the vehicle and help market it,
can hardly fail to help. But the joint venture, which aims to unveil the new
model in just six months and launch it next year, is also an important
strategic move. It spells the end of an extravagant project for Audi to
develop and build its own Spyder sports car.
Audi is sticking to its knitting. A recession is no time for gambling or
diversions into expensive prestige projects. Accordingly, the new car,
although 'very sporty' according to Mr Kortum, will be based on an existing
Audi model. It will fill out rather than extend the company's range.
The project should offer some assistance to Porsche (majority owned by Mr
Piech's family) through an exceptionally lean spell. 'Substantial' losses
are expected this year after a DM120m deficit in the first half. But the
deal will also help Audi contain development costs and forge a relationship
which could conceivably lead to even closer links in the future.
Porsche insists that it will remain independent, but with losses running at
the current rate and the motor industry down-turn expected to continue into
next year and beyond, its renowned cash reserves of DM600m are not going to
last long. Recent renewed speculation suggests that once Audi is fully
established as an able competitor in the big league, it may be floated off
from the VW group as a potential future parent for the fragile Porsche.
The venture also highlights an emerging trend, especially noticeable among
Germany's top-quality carmakers, towards greater co-operation. BMW and
Mercedes, for example, are planning their first collaboration in components.
The big three manufacturers - and classy little Porsche  - have clearly
accepted that the job of speedily reducing their cost disadvantages
vis-a-vis the Japanese competition (estimated at 30 per cent upwards) will
be made all the harder if they try to do all the work alone. Although BMW
has so far had a less-than-catastrophic ride through recession, Mercedes and
Audi are both running losses. Audi's deliveries to customers were more than
30 per cent down at the three-month mark. BMW, meanwhile, is still enjoying
some of the benefits of the launch last year of its new 3-Series which
helped it for the first time in its history to overhaul Mercedes in terms of
unit sales, and to deliver a total 595,000 cars.
It did especially well in the US, raising deliveries last year by 20 per
cent. But it could not escape the effects of currency turbulence which cut
net profits to DM726m from DM783m. And now it is feeling some of the
pressures which have driven its competitors into the red.
First-quarter sales in the new year have fallen more than 6 per cent. Later
this year its 3-Series is likely to feel the squeeze when Mercedes comes to
market with its new entry-level C-class model which will be competitively
priced at about the same level as the outgoing 'baby-Benz'.
According to Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, some 150,000 of the
new model will be made this year, rising to about 200,000 in 1994 and
250,000 in 1995.
The stage, clouded with grim forecasts of nose-diving domestic demand and
only sluggish (if any) recovery in export markets, is set for lively
competition as manufacturers bid to catch the executive buyer's eye. The
action is likely to be all the more interesting because all the main actors
are new and, apart from Mr Helmut Werner, the former commercial vehicles
boss assuming control at Mercedes, virtually unknown quantities.
Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, who built up BMW into a world-ranking brand during
his 23-year tenure as chairman, recently appointed Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder,
45, his youngest board member and production chief, to take over his role.
Audi's Mr Kortum, 42, was brought in from a Mercedes sales outpost in North
Rhine Westphalia to head an almost entirely new management board. Porsche
recently replaced Mr Arno Bohn with Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, 40, who was
formerly production director.
It is no coincidence that BMW and Porsche both chose production men to take
over at a time of what Mr Piech calls the worst crisis since the war. The
name of the game for the foreseeable future will be squeezing manufacturing
costs at every level, manufacturing in-house only those parts which cannot
be made more cheaply by outside suppliers.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (5): Most competitive market -
North America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent announcement by Mercedes-Benz that it intends to build a new
sport-utility vehicle in the US underlines the changing nature and intense
competitiveness of the American executive car market, where an extraordinary
burst of Japanese success in recent years is now being met by a much
stronger challenge from US and European rivals.
Mercedes is to make its first significant foray into manufacturing passenger
cars outside Germany by building a new four-wheel-drive vehicle at a
yet-to-be chosen site in the US. The new plant will cost some Dollars 300m
and will have the capacity to make 60,000 vehicles a year, of which some
40,000 will be earmarked for export.
Its move underlines some important changes in the executive car sector.
First, the 'sports utility' category - which includes vehicles under the
Jeep and Range Rover brand names - has not traditionally been regarded as
falling under the executive car heading, but increasingly in the US this
fast-growing market segment is competing at the upper end of its range
against traditional executive sedans.
As Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes' deputy president, said in announcing the US
project: 'The classic division of the market into luxury class, mid-size
class and compact class is losing its importance.'
Second, German luxury car manufacturers, no less than American ones, are
having to adopt new tactics to cope with the inroads made over the past few
years in the US market by Japanese executive cars, sold at extremely keen
prices.
Mercedes is the second German company to decide to manufacture in the US and
is following a lead set by BMW which broke ground last year for a new plant
in South Carolina.
The advantages for both companies include much lower production costs than
in Germany and proximity to the North American market, the biggest and most
competitive in the world. The dangers include losing the status associated
with a product bearing a 'Made in Germany' label.
The Japanese have come from nowhere in recent years to account for almost
one third of the US luxury car market, with Toyota's Lexus epitomising their
success. Introduced in 1989, it changed perceptions of the relationship
between price and performance by presenting buyers with a superior-quality,
volume-produced luxury car selling below Dollars 40,000.
Nearly 40 per cent of Lexus buyers trading-in their old cars are defectors
from European marques, with slightly less coming from American marques and
22 per cent from Japanese manufacturers.
However, the Japanese have been finding it harder to add market share over
the past 15 months. In 1992, they gained 1.6 per cent of the US luxury
market for a 30.8 per cent total, leaving the Big Three US carmakers -
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - with a market share down 3.6 per cent at
47.9 per cent and the Europeans up 2 per cent at 21.3 per cent.
Ms Susan Jacobs, an independent analyst, says the Japanese slowdown signals
'an end to the period of easy gains when expansion of the product line-up
across body styles and price levels supported rapid sales and share growth.'
She says that this year the dynamics of the market will change, with
'competition among the Japanese - as opposed to the Japanese versus the
European and US Big Three makers - becoming an increasingly important factor
in the pricing environment.'
Certainly, intensifying competition among all manufacturers in a weak US
market played an important role in last September's decision by Mazda, the
Japanese manufacturer, to abandon plans to follow the lead of its rivals and
establish a separate luxury car distribution channel in the US.
The channel, to have been called Amati, was to have begun operations in
1994. Other reasons for the company's decision included its existing heavy
investment burden, appreciation of the yen, and a slump in Mazda's domestic
Japanese market.
The US market was particularly weak last year when unit sales totalled
1.189m, down 5 per cent on 1991, with sales from the Big Three US
manufacturers down 11 per cent, the Japanese up 1 per cent and Europeans up
5 per cent.
Contributory factors included an overhang from the recession of 1991 and the
Bush administration's imposition of a 10 per cent luxury tax on cars costing
more than Dollars 30,000.
Analysts expect the luxury market as a whole to grow modestly this year,
possibly by about 5 per cent.
The sales recovery by European manufacturers is expected to continue, helped
by keener prices and new product launches, while the Big Three are likely to
see a further loss of market share as they phase out some of their more
traditional models, which account for more than four-fifths of their luxury
sales.
However, the Americans are also fighting back with a range of new products
which are designed on more European lines. Cadillac, GM's luxury car
division, has enjoyed particular success over the past two years with its
new Seville and Eldorado models.
Chrysler is about to launch its new luxury cars, the New Yorker and LHS,
which are slightly bigger versions of the much-praised LH series of sedans
it introduced last autumn.
It is aiming to attract more sophisticated baby-boomers who usually buy
imported cars, and its advertising campaign emphasises the models' departure
from the traditional 'floating boat' stereotype of American luxury cars.
'Float, wallow, dive and other American luxury car diseases cured,' says one
advertisement, while another claims the LHS is a car for those who 'drive
for sport' rather than seeking to 'encapsulate themselves in a living room
on wheels.'
Ford, for its part, recently introduced the Lincoln Mark VIII - an all-new
sports coupe with much more of an 'import' look, designed to compete against
the Lexus SC400 and the Cadillac Eldorado.
Cars such as these offer Detroit hope that its long slide against the
Japanese in the luxury segment of the market can at least be stemmed, if not
easily reversed.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (3): Most popular refuge
for funds - Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A literal definition, Switzerland is the biggest offshore financial
centre in the world.
Various estimates indicate that something between one third and one half of
all funds placed by investors outside their home countries are in the hands
of Swiss banks.
That amounts to roughly SFr2,000bn, and puts the country far ahead of places
such as Jersey or Gibraltar as a refuge for funds. But the term offshore, as
most people have come to understand it, is increasingly misleading when
applied to Switzerland.
With the exception of the canton of Zug, the country cannot be described as
a tax haven. Its tax levels are not remarkably different from those in other
industrialised countries, and foreigners must pay either normal taxes on
their earnings from investments in Switzerland or forfeit a stiff 35 per
cent withholding tax.
Nor is bank secrecy sacrosanct in Switzerland. Contrary to a widespread
perception, Switzerland has never guaranteed to protect criminals' money
from foreign investigators. It has mutual assistance treaties with most
countries and will co-operate in investigations provided that the crime
being investigated is also considered a crime in Switzerland.
Nevertheless, following widespread criticism of laxity in the 1980s, the
government and the banking community have introduced a number of specific
measures designed to prevent the country from being used by drug money
launderers, insider traders and other criminals to hide their dirty money.
Today, anyone seeking to put his investments in Switzerland must reveal his
identity to the Swiss bank he uses. He can no longer hide behind a lawyer or
trustee. And if the banker suspects that the money is tainted, he may tell
the police.
The Swiss federal justice department is now preparing a new series of
amendments to the criminal code to make it even tougher for criminals to use
the country's banks. The main element of the package will be a provision to
make membership in a criminal organisation a criminal offence in itself.
That means that Swiss police will be able to co-operate with their
counterparts from other countries chasing members of criminal organisations,
such as the Mafia.
The new package will also clarify the right of bankers to tell the police if
they are suspicious about a client. There has been some discussion of making
it an obligation to tell the police, but Swiss bankers recoil from such a
measure. 'They must understand that bankers cannot be policemen,' says Mr
Thierry Lombard, an associate in the Geneva private bank of Lombard, Odier.
Bankers also fight any attempt to extend Switzerland's co-operation with
other governments to the area of tax. But they point out that this is not to
help their clients evade tax. Rather, it is to make sure that the client's
rights are not abused by foreign governments. They observe that it is not
unknown, even in respectable countries, for political leaders to use their
tax agencies to damage their enemies.
Given this tight legal and regulatory framework, it can be fairly asked why
Switzerland continues to be the world's most popular refuge for funds. Until
a few years ago, part of the answer would be that the country was a rare
haven of political stability and monetary propriety. But today, several
other countries are at least as stable, and the Swiss franc has not
performed as well as some other European currencies.
Mr Georges Vergnion, chairman of Chase Manhattan Private Bank (Switzerland)
in Geneva, says the country is still regarded by many people as a safe
haven. Mr Vergnion points out that Chase Manhattan's private banking
operations are organised in such a way that customers may have their money
kept wherever it will make them feel most comfortable. And a large
proportion still prefer to keep it in Switzerland.
This feeling has apparently been reinforced by the decision by the Swiss
people in a referendum last December not to join the European Economic Area
(EEA). The EEA, a widened free trade area joining the European Community and
the countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), would not, in
fact, have had any impact on Switzerland's status as a safe haven, but
bankers say many high net worth individuals were reassured by the rejection.
Swiss bankers' other claims are they offer better service than private banks
elsewhere at competitive costs and they achieve good investment performance
for client assets.
As little comparative information is published, these claims are difficult
to test. But the latest results of some of the leading Swiss private banks
indicate they are thriving.
Consolidated net profit of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, for example, jumped
15 per cent last year to SFr68m, driven mainly by a 27 per cent rise in
commissions from asset and portfolio management. Vontobel, another Zurich
group, reported a consolidated net profit up 9.9 per cent in 1992 to
SFr24.5m. Among foreign-controlled private banks in Switzerland, Union Bank
Privee had a 16 per cent rise in net profit last year to SFr93m and Chase
Manhattan's net was up 14.5 per cent to SFr13.5m.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (2): Cross-border
launching pad - Luxembourg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLING between Germanic and Latin Europe is Luxembourg, the tiny country
whose liberal tax and regulatory regime has made it the centre of choice for
companies marketing investment products.
'If Luxembourg's status was not available within the European Community,
somebody from outside the EC would invent it,' said Mr Mike Hemming,
marketing director at Commercial Union Financial Management International.
Forget tax, Mr Hemming said. Luxembourg's charm is its proximity to central
Europe, its reputation for Swiss-like banking secrecy laws, its
multilingual, multicultural workforce and the sway it holds in the minds of
the sort of European investors that CU hopes to persuade to buy its
products. CU offers two so-called 'umbrella funds', totalling Pounds 150m in
assets, which are based in Luxembourg and marketed throughout Europe.
'Most mainland Europeans would recognise Luxembourg as a European banking
centre. They wouldn't recognise Dublin,' he said, referring to Luxembourg's
nascent rival in the north-west corner of the European map.
Moreover, in spite of the high quality and low cost of Dublin's workforce,
'we decided we needed a multilingual workforce who could talk to our series
of distribution outlets throughout Europe,' Mr Hemming said.
And in spite of its reputation as a high-cost location with red tape to be
cut, competition from other offshore centres has failed to dent Luxembourg's
popularity as the centre from which European cross-border products are
launched. Moreover, Luxembourg has moved to cement its role as the centre
for European financial services by developing a fiscal regime for the sale
of life insurance and pensions products which rivals any other offered
within the EC.
Luxembourg's greatest strength has been its historical role as the centre
for retail investment funds which have been marketed as pan-European
products. From the late 70s to the end of the 80s Luxembourg funds have
posted annual growth rates of 12 to 60 per cent. The greatest spurt came
from the 1983 law establishing the SICAV (an open-ended fund similar to a
unit trust) as the capital investment company which offered collective
investment opportunities.
By October 1992, there were 2,248 such schemes with assets totalling
LFr6,016bn. That corresponds with 70 schemes with assets of Lfr118bn in
1980.
Investment professionals caution against viewing Luxembourg as a low-tax
regime. Indeed, quite the opposite. Unlike any other European centre, funds
carry an annual six basis point tax d'abonnement which does not exist in any
other country. However, Luxembourg does allow non-domestic investors to be
paid interest and dividends gross of withholding tax, making it the logical
home not only for investment trust-type products but also myriad other
investments such as Eurobonds which appeal to the proverbial 'Belgian
dentist' seeking to avoid tax in his home market.
Still, Luxembourg's pre-eminent position in the sale of European financial
services is not unassailable. For one thing, according to Mr Bob Ash,
vice-president at Chase Investment Bank who oversees the marketing of
offshore centres products, 'service providers in Luxembourg are expensive'.
One regulatory quirk which has stuck in the craw of those who market
collective investment schemes has been the requirement to use a Luxembourg
bank - not the Luxembourg-based branch of another European bank - as a
depository. This limits the choice to roughly three providers and the lack
of competition has quite understandably affected fees.
Britain's Unit Trust Association and other similar European trade
associations have successfully lobbied for changes to the so-called Ucits
legislation which governs cross-border collective investment products. The
changes will force local governments to allow the choice of depository to be
a branch of any EC-based bank, and should result in lower costs.
Also, Mr Ash said, staff costs are relatively high in Luxembourg. 'We have
been able to expand our staff in Dublin by about 30 people over the past
year at no problem,' he said. Well qualified staff are available at
affordable salaries, another factor when considering where to base the
European centre for the sale of cross-border products.
However, Luxembourg's regulatory authorities, the IML, have been sensitive
to the rising competition from other offshore European centres. 'They have
started to cut a lot of the red tape,' Mr Ash said. 'In 1990, the approval
queue was up to six months,' Mr Ash said. 'Now, depending on complexity, you
can receive approval in under four weeks,' he said.
Moreover, the IML has shown its willingness to allow for innovation in
product design for collective investment vehicles, a factor which is likely
to help Luxembourg compete. Among the recent innovations given the green
light by the IML within the past year are the use of derivatives, the
creation of real estate investment funds, corporate finance funds and the
so-called fund of funds which purchases shares of other collective
investment vehicles.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (1): Exploiting the
differences - The success of offshore centres has been their ability to
provide financial services that offer generous tax advantages. But the older
centres now face competition from ambitious new rivals eager to attract
their traditonal clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN

<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the increasing harmonisation between European states, there is
still much scope for the financial services industry to capitalise on
differences in tax and regulation.
The march towards synchronisation of regulation has given additional impetus
to businesses seeking a more liberal environment. Moreover, the lack of a
standard tax structure has allowed some European states to export their more
favourable laws to other parts of Europe.
'Offshore centres fall into three main camps,' said Mr Robert Ash, vice -
president in charge of marketing offshore centres products for Chase
Investment Bank. 'First, there are the well-regulated onshore centres of
Luxembourg and Dublin. Second, there are the offshore specialist markets
which provide particular products. Then there are the unregulated markets of
the Caribbean which cater for the sophisticated investor who is not
concerned about risk.'
But the unspoken charm of offshore centres, particularly for the various
sectors of the financial services industry which have made them their home,
lies in the tax advantages which providers can attach to products
originating there. That has been the secret of their attraction for decades
and is likely to remain so for some time to come.
The success of Luxembourg in establishing itself as the offshore centre for
retail investment products sold into Europe - or of the Channel Islands, for
similar products sold into the UK - has not escaped the notice of other
centres and competition for similar business has become fierce.
The question is whether the newer centres, with their liberal tax regimes
and obliging regulatory bodies eager to cut bureaucratic red tape, can
successfully challenge the dominance of the older centres.
By all accounts, Dublin has done a creditable job of establishing itself as
an alternative to Luxembourg, with its relatively higher costs, as an
offshore centre for retail investment products. The investment bank of
Singer and Friedlander, for instance, recently recruited the highly
successful unit trust division of Morgan Grenfell with the idea of basing a
new division in Dublin, which would market Ucits (Undertakings for
Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) in Europe. Japanese and
other European banks have recently been selecting Dublin in preference to
Luxembourg, although Luxembourg is continuing to grow.
GT Management has also just shifted six of its unit trusts to Dublin,
intending to market them as pan-European Ucits. The ability of Dublin to
attract business which would once have headed for Luxembourg demonstrates
the vulnerability of offshore centres to determined rivals.
Still, Luxembourg has signalled its determination to hang on to its status
as the offshore centre in the heart of Europe. It has moved to strengthen
its bank regulatory structures in the aftermath of the collapse of the Bank
for Commerce and Credit International, in an effort to buttress its
reputation as Europe's banking sector. Among other things, it has put in
place a compensation scheme covering the first Lfl500,000 in deposits.
It also has put in place a fiscal regime for the sale of pan-European life
insurance and pensions products which rivals that available anywhere else on
the Continent.
And its financial regulatory body, the IML, has moved swiftly to cut the red
tape associated with the establishment of new offshore funds, so that it now
takes no more than four weeks to launch a new product - down from six months
three years ago. Also, approved investment vehicles now include the latest
innovations in derivatives, real estate funds, and so-called 'funds of
funds' which allow diversification of investment.
However, the attraction of an offshore centre in the heart of the EC could
well be undermined by moves to standardise tax regimes. The Belgians, who
will take over the chairmanship of the EC in June, have said they wish to
place the issue of minimum withholding taxes back on the agenda. While
Luxembourg successfully fought off the issue several years ago, the move
would certainly remove some of the relative attractions of Luxembourg-based
retail investment products which do not require withholding tax on interest
and dividend payments to non-residents.
Meanwhile, the Channel Islands, which have noted the defection of some of
their offshore products to Luxembourg and Dublin, have moved with
considerable energy to replace lost funds with wholesale deposits from
investors in places such as Japan who want access to UK investment
opportunities but wish to remain outside its tax structure.
Also, a series of financial scandals since the late 1980s has forced a
rethink about the liberal regulatory regimes which once characterised some
offshore centres. Gibraltar and the Isle of Man have both been badly hit by
the collapse of financial institutions based there in the 1980s and both
have moved to put effective investor compensation schemes and regulatory
structures in place. Jersey and Guernsey have enacted some of the world's
toughest money laundering rules for banks based there, and tiny
Liechtenstein is taking a hard look at its own secretive trust system.
Liechtenstein has come under scrutiny from British MPs since it became known
that the late Robert Maxwell had used a series of secretive trusts based
there to carry out transactions using funds stolen from pension schemes he
controlled.
Meanwhile, the Caribbean has raised its profile as an offshore centre for
European businesses, building on its strengths as the home of the captive
insurance industry for American companies.
But Bermuda, with its well-entrenched regulatory framework and networks of
insurance experts, is now also attracting the captive insurance subsidiaries
of European companies. Among the island's biggest European captives are
Grand Metropolitan, Hanson Group and British Airways. Because the
infrastructure is already in place, European companies are finding Bermuda
more attractive as a home for captive insurance subsidiaries than offshore
centres closer to home, such as Gibraltar or Dublin.
Meanwhile, Bermuda is also attracting a portion of the reinsurance market
which would once have been based at Lloyd's of London. Late last year,
Britain's Commercial Union insurance company joined a number of US-based
investors to form a company to reinsure risks underwritten in London.
Bermuda is also taking advantage of the interest of European financial
companies to expand its own mutual fund business. A new trust law which
allows a limited number of overseas companies to manage Bermuda-based trust
companies has been used to run mutual funds aimed at wealthy private
clients.
The message from the newer offshore centres is that the traditional hubs of
business face continual competition from hungry and ambitious rivals eager
to draw away their traditional clients. The question is whether the
established offshore centres are up to the challenge.

THE map of the world's executive and luxury car industry is being re-drawn.
In the process, and sometimes to the dismay of die-hard traditionalist
customers, some of the taboos which have determined parts of the industry's
structure for many years are being dismantled.
The re-drawing is most apparent in North America, the world's biggest single
executive and luxury car market, where Japanese manufacturers have captured
nearly one third of the sector in less than six years with marques such as
Toyota's Lexus, Nissan's Infiniti and Honda's Acura.
The European executive specialist manufacturers such as Mercedes, BMW and
Jaguar, who once dominated this part of the market, now control only one
fifth.
The competitiveness of the German manufacturers, in particular, has been hit
hard by the strength of the D-Mark and spiralling wage and social costs
which have left Germany by far the most expensive country in which to
produce cars in Europe.
So, in moves which might have been unthinkable to many industry observers in
the car industry boom years of the late 1980s, German manufacturers are
moving out of Germany. Last year, BMW announced that its next new production
facility would be in South Carolina, to build a new sporty car at a volume
of up to 90,000 a year.
At the beginning of April, Mercedes-Benz announced that it intended to build
a Dollars 300m plant, also in the US, to produce a four-wheel-drive sports
utility vehicle at a rate of up to 60,000 vehicles a year, beginning in
1997.
Such moves are the German makers' main hope of narrowing what they
acknowledge to be the big production costs gap between them and Japanese
rivals, even allowing for the occasional accusation against the Japanese of
dumping.
According to Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes' vice-chairman, the US plant's
production costs should be 30 per cent lower than those of its European
facilities - and will also reduce the impact of currency fluctuations. Not
least, the learning experience should help prepare it for the time when - as
is regarded as inevitable - the Japanese manufacturers move into the
European luxury car market in earnest.
However, in Mercedes' case the re-drawn map includes much more than plant
locations. The company, says Mr Werner, is to transform itself from luxury
carmaker into 'an exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high-quality
vehicles in all segments of the market'. Thus, before this decade is out,
there is to be a 'people carrier' or multi-purpose vehicle, the US
four-wheel-drive machine and even a small 'city' car as well as its current
three-model conventional car line-up.
In an astonishing admission, he asserts that the current cars are
'over-engineered' - a practice which, if continued, would price Mercedes out
of its markets.
The breaking of old taboos is not confined to the German industry: Jaguar,
the loss-making luxury car subsidiary of Ford, has been helped by sterling
devaluation since Britain's ERM withdrawal. But Jaguar, too, faces possibly
substantial change which is fundamentally cost-driven.
The old idea that a 'proper' Jaguar could never be built anywhere but
Coventry is already being eroded by the prospect of future engines coming
from Ford's Bridgend plant in Wales. Yet more trauma-inducing for the
traditionalists, the smaller Jaguar planned for the late 1990s is expected
to share the floor pan of Ford's 'world car' replacement for the current
Granada.
These upheavals come at a time when, as recession has tightened its grip on
large swathes of continental Europe, the flamboyance of the 1980s is
disappearing, replaced by a more low-key, sober approach to motoring which
is affecting both design and engineering.
Greater concern with economy and the environment is reflected in surging
sales of diesel cars. They are both 'cleaner' in terms of their exhaust
gases and much more economical than petrol engines of similar power.
Hitherto regarded in markets such as the UK as appropriate more to
high-mileage utilitarian than executive cars, the picture is about to change
with the launch in the summer of BMW's first diesel cars in Britain.
The old axiom that 'safety does not sell' is also under challenge as never
before.
An increasing proportion of manufacturers' promotion of their products is
being allocated to safety features rather than performance or styling. One
of the main planks of Ford's advertising for its new Mondeo 'world car' is
the standard fitting of driver airbags to all models.
Mercedes and other manufacturers are now in a race to develop the first
commercial airbags to protect passengers in side collisions.
German manufacturers of executive cars, in particular, believe they must
broaden their market presence to survive - thus Audi is planning a new
'entry level' Audi, the 50, which will be little more expensive than a
well-equipped Golf. As well as the Mercedes small car, BMW has been
investigating the production of a 'city car', a concept for which, the Z13,
was shown at the Geneva motor show.
At the other extreme, Audi will take the industry into a new era of
technology from next year when it launches a new V8-engined flagship with
its main body structures made from aluminium, not steel.
The car will mark the first use of aluminium body assembly systems which, in
future, may lend themselves to high-volume production of lightweight,
energy-efficient and easily recyclable cars.
Old customer allegiances are fading; replaced by a greater willingness to
sample a variety of manufacturers' wares.
Audi is considering joining BMW and Mercedes in production on the American
continent although it may opt not to set up in the US but to extend its
existing assembly facilities in Mexico. Not to do so could leave Audi at a
significant disadvantage vis-a-vis other manufacturers, particularly
Japanese, who have already opted for sites within the North American Free
Trade Area (Nafta).
'To be successful in the world a company has to be successful in the US,'
declared Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, chairman of BMW, when he broke ground
late last year for the company's new Dollars 400m plant in South Carolina.
Increased competition is not just coming from the Japanese, however. General
Motors, Ford and Chrysler have also begun to enjoy a product revival in the
executive and luxury sectors, while the UK's own competitive position is
being increased through the long-standing collaboration between Honda and
Rover bearing increasing fruit. This month, Rover unveiled its long-awaited
Rover 600 range, the Cowley-built version of Honda's Swindon-built Accord,
with which both are making a significant assault on the middle-range
executive car market.
The cars look different but have the same engines and gearboxes and mostly
shared components.
For Rover, they represent the biggest step yet in its drive to transform
itself into a producer of premium upmarket models capable of competing with
the likes of BMW and Audi and with a similar production level of about
500,000 units a year.
The benefits of the relationship with Honda go beyond technology and
resources. 'We have acquired an insight into Japanese best practice and
processes,' says Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman, who maintains that it
opens the way to significant cost reductions in every area of the business.
In continental Europe, where Rover has started a dealership expansion
programme despite recession, the 600 is being promoted as a head-on rival to
BMW's 3-Series and Audi's 80 and Mercedes' 190 models.
A side-effect of the cold climate for the German industry is increasing
collaboration between its manufacturers.
For example, towards the end of this year Audi will launch an Audi-badged
sports model built in collaboration with Porsche, the deeply-troubled luxury
sports car maker. The deal, inspired by Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen group
chief executive who is also a member of the family which controls Porsche,
is aimed at helping underpin loss-making Porsche's finances while giving
Audi an image lift.
Even Mercedes-Benz and BMW have been discussing possible collaboration on
parts manufacture, according to Mr Werner. Hitherto, each has remained among
the most determinedly independent and vertically integrated of all the
world's car companies.
Audi exemplifies some of the troubles of the German industry. It fell into
loss in this year's first quarter and slashed production by more than 40 per
cent in order to reduce its backlog of unsold vehicles. Total sales in the
period were down by about one third. Volkswagen, which includes also SEAT of
Spain and Skoda of Czechoslovakia, made a net loss of DM1.25bn (Pounds 515m)
in its most recent quarter.
However, with costs being cut extensively - about 12 per cent of the 37,000
workforce is expected to go by the end of this year - Mr Piech maintains
that Audi should be profitable for the year as a whole.
The effects of achieving this goal are likely to be felt throughout
Germany's extensive motor components supply industry. Suppliers are being
asked to cut their prices by 5 per cent on average this year, with cuts of
up to 10 per cent being required in some cases.
German suppliers, who contribute about 90 per cent of Audi's parts, do not
only face price cuts, however. They are also exposed to loss of business as
a matter of policy by Audi, which is embarking on a programme of global
component sourcing to help it escape German manufacturing costs.
Helping it along the way is the group's new purchasing director, Mr Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, former head of purchasing at General Motors, who
revolutionised GM Europe's supply chain to give it the most competitive
purchasing cost base of any European producer - and who was doing the same
thing for GM in North America when he was poached by VW after a bizarre
tug-of-war between the two big manufacturers.
But Audi's subdued outlook is of the kind that Porsche might envy. Riven by
management disputes last year which saw the departure of Mr Arno Bohn, chief
executive, Porsche plunged into a DM120m loss in the first half of its
financial year and has warned that sales and profits will be down
significantly for the full year ending July.
It is a measure of the extent of Porsche's decline that this year it expects
to produce only 15,000-17,000 cars, less than one third of its mid-1980s
levels. Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, appointed chief executive in September,
insists, however, that new models due to be launched over the next two years
will see demand for its products back up to 30,000-plus a year from 1996
onwards.
He also maintains that widely-expressed doubts about whether Porsche can
retain its independence are unjustified.
He has a point: Porsche is privately owned by two extremely wealthy
families, the Porsches and the Piechs, and the company was debt-free and
harbouring net cash of DM600m at last financial year's end. It can soldier
on for several more years yet, either to a new model-led revival or until
the families feel the competitive pressures are such that the game is no
longer worth the candle.
Not only the German industry is suffering. Saab, the Swedish car maker
jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors, is receiving its second
capital injection in two years against a background of four years of
consecutive losses. Its fate will depend heavily on the successor to its 900
model, to be launched later this year. Saab-Scania has hinted that it will
be reluctant to provide further finance.

FT  30 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce slides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aero engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was hit by a credit downgrading, which
outweighed the feeling that the US might be about to turn buyer of aerospace
stocks.
The announcement by Moody's Investors Service that it was considering a
downgrade of the company's A2 senior debt prompted the shares to slide
quickly. Moody's is concerned about persistent weakness of the commercial
and military markets for the company's jet engines and engine spares.
Later, the market learned that US investment house Lehman Brothers had
turned buyer of Boeing. Analysts said that because US shifts tend to revolve
around sectors rather than specific stocks there was a chance of Rolls-Royce
benefiting from the change of heart.
However, Mr Nick Cunningham from SGST said: 'Moody's is pointing to
fundamental problems that Rolls-Royce faces. It is a very late cycle
industry and people are being overly optimistic.' The shares closed 4 down
at 129p.
Drugs issue Wellcome fell 13 to 722p as a press report gave an opportunity
to mark down the stock. The article said an Aids victim's widow was suing
the company and a health authority over her haemophiliac husband's death,
which she believed was hastened by Wellcome's anti-Aids drug AZT.
An early rise for BAT Industries, helped by a buy note from Japanese house
Yamaichi, was cut back by reports that Philip Morris, of the US, might adopt
deeper tobacco discounts if needed. BAT finished unchanged at 838p.
Conglomerate Lonrho rose 5 1/2 to 93 1/2 p after stating that it had
received an acceptable offer for The Observer, the UK Sunday newspaper, from
fellow publisher The Guardian and Manchester Evening News.
Meyer International surprised the market by a Pounds 70m rights issue, a
one-for-four offer at a deeply discounted 290p, to reduce borrowings. The
company accompanied the fund-raising with a profits forecast and a warning
that the dividend total will be chopped from 16.5p to 10p.
The stock fell to 348p immediately following the news but rallied to end
only 3 off at 365p. UBS was said to have been an aggressive seller and to
have decided that any positive move in the shares after a big rights issue
and a severe dividend cut was perverse.
The announcement that France had cut both its key rates again by 25 basis
points helped companies with heavy exposure to the country, especially
marketing and advertising groups, which are geared for early recovery.
Aegis put on 5 1/2 at 29 1/2 p and exhibitions organiser Blenheim rose 15 to
535p. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, which is active in France, closed a penny
cheaper at 193p: enthusiasm was tempered by a sector review from Kleinwort
Benson which featured the stock as its principal sell recommendation.
First-half results from Kwik Save were largely in line with market
expectations, profits leaping 19 per cent, although it warned that this
degree of performance would not be maintained in a tougher second half.
This, together with one leading broker warning of the effects of
disinflation, left the shares trailing.
However, a more positive analysts meeting brought out the bulls, with the
group's strong sales growth being pointed up. The shares turned around 23p
during the session to finish 4 ahead at 780p.
A positive agm statement from Hillsdown Holdings helped the shares forward a
penny to 157p. Volume was a hefty 12m.
Some investors took another swipe at Boots, this time over worries it was
engaging in a price war with Superdrug, owned by Kingfisher. Superdrug is
said to be cutting its sun protection product prices by 25 per cent.
Supermarket group Tesco was reported to be also making 30 per cent cuts to
its sun care range. However, one stores specialist pointed out that the sun
protection business was only 5 per cent of Boots' overall sales and that the
effect of stiffer price competition would not be great.
Boots shares were badly mauled earlier this week when it announced details
of dangers attached to using its Manoplax drug. Yesterday, they fell 11 to
451p. Kingfisher slipped 2 to 588p and Tesco 4 1/2 to 217 1/2 p.
Worries about possible litigation instigated by US brokerage PaineWebber
unsettled Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, which lost 12 to 389p. SG
Warburg fell 15 to 643p, with the market said to be unsettled by concern
about the group's tax charge.
British Gas dipped 2 to 302p after news of the retirement of chairman Mr Bob
Evans.
Lasmo continued to move ahead, adding 3 at 151p, still boosted by hints that
Total's fund-raising earlier this week could prompt corporate activity in
the oil sector. Most of the demand for Lasmo came from the US, according to
dealers. Premier edged higher to 28 3/4 p after the latest drilling success
off the coast of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.
Regent Inns, reintroduced to the market by stockbroker Greig Middleton after
a company restructuring and a placing of shares at 135p, closed at 151p,
having touched 165p.
Hotel group Forte eased 2 to 190p. Nomura was advising clients to buy the
shares as a cyclical recovery play.
Guinness recovered from recent underperformance to end 8 up at 476p.
Speculation that a bid for engineering group Fenner might be in the air
proved well founded. The group confirmed that it has received indications of
interest and the shares shot up to 93p before closing marginally firmer at
85p. Wassall, the mini-conglomerate whose name has been linked by the
market, shed 3 to 237p.

<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Container leasing group Tiphook was the market's biggest casualty yesterday,
the shares plunging more than 36 per cent at one point after a shock profits
warning.
At worst the shares touched 186p. They later stabilised to end a net 63 down
at 230p after heavy turnover of 7.4m.
Tiphook said its second-half profits would not match those of the first half
but the final dividend would be not less than 14.4p, indicating that the
dividend total would be 19.3p, against last year's 17.3p.
Analysts had previously been expecting Tiphook to achieve profits of some
Pounds 75m. After the warning estimates were chopped to around Pounds 58m.

FT  30 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI pleases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy trading followed the announcement of higher first-quarter results from
ICI, with concentrated share buying in the London market boosted by demand
in the unofficial 'grey' market.
It was expected that ICI would pull something out of the hat for the last
set of figures before its impending demerger and consequently the pre-tax
figure would be comfortably above the consensus forecast of Pounds 180m.
However, Pounds 233m was better than the most confident predictions.
In spite of a certain amount of caution in the accompanying statement, the
stock shot up 43 on the announcement and closed 31 ahead at 1278p after very
heavy turnover of 4.8m. In the grey market operated by US investment bank
Salomon Brothers, ICI 'new' were quoted sharply higher at 580p while Zeneca
held steady at around 705p, with dealers talking of additional volume of
around 1m shares.

FT  30 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Switch in oils by US funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE switching from Shell Transport to British Petroleum by US funds was
responsible for driving the latter sharply higher against the market and
leaving Shell languishing. The switching included one block of 5m Shell
shares traded at 568 1/2 p and several large lines of BP at 282 1/2 p.
At the close, BP was 4 higher at 285 1/2 p after keen turnover of 8.6m,
while Shell was 3 1/2 off at 550 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 9.6m, the
highest single day's business since November last year.
BP shares, among the Footsie's best performers since the turn of the year,
have come back sharply in the past couple of weeks, reflecting the steep
rise in sterling. BP announced recently that US investors now speak for more
than 25 per cent of the company's shares.

FT  30 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in steadier
trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE ON stock index futures appeared to relax a little yesterday, much
to the relief of London share traders. Although the stock market gave
further ground, the final picture was much less gloomy. In spite of being
upset at first by a fresh setback in UK government bonds, equities halved
early losses after the FT-SE 100 Index bounced from the 2,773 area, regarded
as the bottom end of the trading range.
Good first-quarter results from ICI, now on the verge of its demerger move,
helped sentiment. Managers at many of the big institutions were locked in
meetings yesterday as final decisions were made regarding investment in
Zeneca, the drugs and bio-science side of the demerged ICI.
Early dealings saw the Footsie down by 23 points until some initial
nervousness in stock index futures was offset by news that the Bank of
France was lowering its two key interest rates.
Rate cuts in France, following similar moves in German money rates,
fulfilled hopes in the London markets, but the impact was muffled by the
weakness seen in UK equities since the beginning of this week.
However, the reduced pressure on the June futures contract on the FT-SE 100
Index was a more positive sign for UK equities. Shares rallied in modest
trading and the fall in the Footsie had been trimmed to about 8 points when
traders turned nervous again ahead of the opening of the New York market.
Wall Street started cautiously, and the Dow Average was 16.75 off in London
hours. But more important for UK traders was the absence of the cohorts of
US sellers which hit the Footsie future on Wednesday. The stock market eased
back towards the close but little selling pressure was reported.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,786.8 for a net fall of 10.5
points. Dealers said the final two hours of the session had seen a good deal
of switching as securities houses put their books in order ahead of the
three-day weekend in London which begins tonight.
Basket trading between the futures and the underlying equity market
continued, albeit on a reduced scale, so that business in blue chip issues
again outpaced that in the second liners. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed 11.3
to 3,110.4, while non-Footsie business slipped lower to total around 56 per
cent of the day's Seaq volume of 542.1m shares. On Wednesday, Seaq volume of
699.1m was worth Pounds 1.39bn in retail business, an average but not
exciting daily figure.
Market strategists expressed relative confidence in the new levels of the UK
stock market. At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall commented that the
setback prompted this week by action in the futures market only had such
effect 'because the market has been so lacklustre'.
Mr Nicholas Knight, London's super bull, reviewing the 'pros and cons' of
the market, suggested that 'the pros are in danger of being conned by the
bear move'.
The strategy team at Natwest Securities headed its advice to clients 'Seller
beware', stressing the better performance than expected from economic
indicators. The easing of credit stance at the Bundesbank, Natwest comments,
might have reduced the possibility of a rise in UK interest rates.

FT  30 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUIETER but still heavy day's trading in the futures yesterday brought
hints that the selling pressure of recent sessions may be easing, writes
Christopher Price.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened weakly at 2,783 as worries
persisted over the interest of US speculators and the bearish sentiment over
the UK equity market. However, the contract then hit another bout of
sustained selling and June tumbled to a day's low of 2,767.
This level brought out the buyers, dealers reporting that these included
some of the previous day's biggest sellers - suggesting that at least some
of the bearish view of the market may have been exhausted.
June rallied throughout the rest of the day, suffering continuing short
periods of volatility. It finished at 2,788, two points ahead of the cash
market but around 4 points below its fair value level. Volume was a bulky
13,300 contracts.
One seasoned dealer said the contract was likely to trade within a 70-point
range in the short term, with selling pressure probable up to a level of
2,820 and buying at the 2,750 mark.
Traded options were busier, with several stocks recording large trades. BTR
led the way with 5,560 contracts dealt, followed by Shell (5,005), Hillsdown
(5,004) and Lonrho (3,368). The overall total was 47,286 lots, of which
11,862 were in the FT-SE 100 option.

FT  30 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow higher in spite of
disappointing GDP
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
AFTER trading lower for most of the day on news of weaker economic growth,
US share prices moved into positive territory on a surge of late buying,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 11.62 ahead on balance at
3,425.12. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a net 0.87 up at 438.89 and the
Nasdaq composite 0.29 firmer at 658.45. Volume on the New York SE totalled
249.7m shares.
Early trading was dominated by a raft of economic data. The good news - a
7,000 decline in weekly jobless claims and a 4.8 per cent rise in March new
house sales - was mostly overshadowed by the long-awaited first-quarter
gross domestic product report.
The Commerce Department announced that GDP grew by an annualised 1.8 per
cent in the quarter, compared with 4.7 per cent growth in the previous three
months. Although the markets had been bracing themselves for a slowdown in
economic growth, the figure was still disappointing, coming in below
forecasts of GDP expansion of 2.3 per cent.
The markets were also unnerved by news of a 3.3 per cent increase in the
implicit price deflator - the measure of inflation published along with the
GDP numbers.
The news of slowing growth, possibly reviving inflation, and generally
depressed equity markets (before yesterday prices had fallen on seven out of
the last eight days) all contributed to the early decline. Late in the
session a rush of buying helped the leading indices end higher on the day.
Improved earnings failed to lift General Motors. The car manufacturer
reported first-quarter net income of 42 cents a share, a turnround from the
big loss a year earlier. Although the figures were ahead of analysts'
expectations, investors took the opportunity to book some profits earned in
the stock's recent climb (it started yesterday within Dollars 2 of its
52-week high) and GM shed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40 7/8 in volume of 3.6m
shares.
UAL fell Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 140 5/8 after the airline group reported a
larger than expected quarterly loss of Dollars 5.92 a share, prior to an
extraordinary charge.
American International Group jumped Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 124 1/2 after
the insurer unveiled operating income of Dollars 2.24 a share, up from
Dollars 1.91 a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, President Riverboat rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 323
after Missouri legislators passed a bill that will pave the way for
riverboat gambling to begin in the state.
Canada
TORONTO forged ahead in heavy volume, helped by strong showings in
transportation, banking and gold issues. The TSE 300 index climbed 44.9 to
3,755.1. Rises led falls by 443 to 262 on 77.5m shares traded.
Dealers said a swift fall in interest rates and recovery in the Canadian
dollar fuelled gains in banking shares.
Twelve of the 14 stock groups rose. Transportation led the way, advancing
3.39 per cent, followed by financial services, up 2.63 per cent. Golds added
1.93 per cent.

FT  30 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Kuala Lumpur rallies in
the absence of Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tokyo market was closed for the start of the Golden Week holiday.
KUALA LUMPUR continued its rally, rewriting its record high on a strong rise
in blue chip issues. The composite index climbed 9.57, or 1.4 per cent, to
705.00.
Traders noted US institutional funds supporting lead-ing stocks. Fund
managers adjusted their portfolios to the composition of the Morgan Stanley
Capital International index, which will split its Malaysian and Singapore
stock grouping on May 1, giving a larger weighting in Malaysia.
HONG KONG ended a volatile day slightly lower as investors were cautious
over the third round of the Sino-British talks, which have been set for May
21 to 23. The Hang Seng index eased 10.85 to 6,884.05 in turnover of
HKDollars 4.73bn, against HKDollars 4.88bn.
Britain and China finished the second round of talks yesterday, but major
progress over the negotiations has not been announced. Traders said the
underlying tone remained firm, but a sharp rise was unlikely.
Interest focused on speculative issues moving on rumours. Hutchison Whampoa
advanced 80 cents to HKDollars 19.80. Banks were weak, HSBC losing HKDollars
1 to HKDollars 72.
AUSTRALIA fell on arbitrage selling prompted by heavy sales of index
futures. The All Ordinaries index lost 23.2, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,680.3,
the lowest level since April 8. Turnover rose to ADollars 534m from ADollars
308m as Newmont Mining, of the US, sold its stake in gold producer Newcrest
Mining.
Newcrest shed 13 cents to ADollars 3.09, depressing the gold sector in spite
of a rise in gold prices. Plutonic Resources jumped 38 cents to ADollars
3.72 on reports of a gold discovery in western Australia.
MANILA saw its index break a record high as optimism was fuelled by a rise
in blue chips. The composite index rose 29.2, or 1.9 per cent, to 1,594.59,
breaching the previous high set on April 15.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone added 15 pesos at 970 pesos in volume of
26.2m pesos.
SINGAPORE edged lower as investors remained sidelined due to the lack of
fresh news. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 0.70 off at 1,779.22
in volume of 207.3m shares, after 232.4m previously.
Singapore Airlines Foreign rose 40 cents to SDollars 9.20 with some 4.1m
shares traded.
SEOUL was mixed as profit-taking in blue chip shares offset selective buying
centred on small and medium-sized companies. The market index eased 3.65 to
724.76.
Some analysts believe that the time will soon be right for a mild rebound in
large-capitalisation shares.
In the meantime, active buying interest is being seen in small electrical
and electronics companies and textiles and chemical engineering groups which
missed out in the recent bull run.
Among the losers, Samsung Electronics shed Won400 to Won39,600 and Hyundai
Motor declined Won100 to Won28,300.
TAIWAN saw a similar trading pattern, with early gains largely erased by
profit-taking. The weighted index ended just 0.4 up at 4,527.47 in further
thin turnover of TDollars 28.9bn.
Concern over threatened US trade sanctions and talks between Taiwan and
China in Singapore left investors reluctant to take new positions during the
session.
JAKARTA was firmer in moderate trading, in late reaction to corporate
results. The official index moved up 1.03 to 313.22.
Against the trend, Modern Photo retreated a further Rp200 to Rp14,000 amid
unconfirmed rumours of resignations by some expatriate managers. Argo Pantes
closed Rp100 down at Rp2,600 following reports of a 71 per cent plunge in
net profits.
BANGKOK was lower for the fourth consecutive day on worries about the
political implications of an investigation into alleged share price
manipulation. The SET index weakened 7.28 to 849.57 in light turnover of
Bt2.47bn.
The index has fallen 51.69, or 5.74 per cent, since Monday following news
that 153 individuals and companies are under investigation for price
manipulation.
There is the added worry that some of the individuals or companies involved
could be linked to ministers in the coalition government.
NEW ZEALAND was the focus of strong foreign demand which drove the NZSE-40
index up 5.29 to 1,627.87, the highest close since the index began in
mid-1991. The previous record finish of 1,627.31 was set on February 16.
Turnover was a substantial NZDollars 40m.
Forestry groups remained the centre of attention. Fletcher Challenge
appreciated a further 4 cents to NZDollars 2.89, while Brierley Investments
firmed 2 cents to NZDollars 1.02 in volume of almost 6m shares.

FT  30 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris edges down after
interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses were weaker yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS gave only a second glance to the cut in interest rates by the Bank of
France, which had been anticipated. The CAC-40 index closed down 21.96 or
1.1 per cent at 1,920.55.
Mr Ian Furnivall, Paris-based analyst at Hoare Govett, commented that real
interest rates still remained very high in France, and the rate cuts were
happening at a more leisurely pace than the market desired. The real worry,
he said was that the government's privatisation plans, while on the one hand
an attempt to reduce the budget deficit, were coming about at a time when
institutions were overweight in France and the market was overbought. 'There
is a risk of the market being swamped in new paper,' he said. 'An imbalance
in supply and demand is an issue that will loom large in people's minds over
the next few months'.
Total eased further following Wednesday's capital increase announcement, the
shares ending down FFr5.20 at FFr259.90, but off the day's low of FFr255.20.
Accor, which has had to cut prices in some of its hotels in Europe for the
first time, also added to its fall of the previous day, slipping FFr21 to
FFr625.
MILAN eased as it digested the composition of the new cabinet and awaited
indications of the new legislative programme. The Comit index fell 4.80 to
539.13.
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's broadly-based government and strong economics team
have won the broad approval of analysts. However, Mr Michele Pacitti of
NatWest Securities in London expected prices to mark time until there was
tangible evidence that the new government was ready to tackle the country's
economic ills.
He thought it encouraging for the privatisation programme that Mr Piero
Barucci was remaining as treasury minister. 'The economic reality is that
there is no alternative to the privatisations,' he said.
Benetton fell L599 or 3.3 per cent to L17,810 as it forecast growth this
year in line with 1992 performance.
FRANKFURT recouped some early losses on short covering with the DAX index
slipping 4.93 to 1,623. Many investors remained on the sidelines after a
fall in the domestic bond market and ahead of the strikes in east Germany
which may begin next week.
Some analysts commented that traders were active in chemical issues which
have made dividend payments. Mr Glen Liddy at Kleinwort Benson said that
trading in the sector had inflated volumes this week, and the market could
slip in lower turnover in the near term. BASF, which announced first quarter
earnings yesterday, closed up DM4.1 to DM235.3, but fell in post bourse
trading as the stock went ex-dividend.
AMSTERDAM featured DSM which closed off Fl 1.00 at Fl 84.30 after a sharp
decline in first quarter profits over the same 1992 period. Akzo slipped Fl
1.70 to Fl 150.20.
James Capel rates the latter a buy, noting efforts to control costs and
improve efficiency, gearing to recovery in the US and its 'lower cyclicality
compared to some if its European counterparts'.
The CBS Tendency index lost 1.3 to 107.6.
BRUSSELS extended its losses for the 10th consecutive session and the Bel-20
index lost 11.72, or 1 per cent, to 1,193.96.
Some analysts suggested that institutional investors who had purchased
Generale de Banque from a leading shareholder which released its stake
earlier this week, had sold off other shares to maintain exposure to the
Belgian market. Petrofina plunged BFr280 or 3.2 per cent to BFr 8,540.
Speculation of a takeover bid subsided after denials from its leading
shareholder that it would not sell its stake.
ISTANBUL was again unstoppable, surging 4.3 per cent to this month's 10th
all-time high close. The market index rose 325.95 to 7,896.92 on strong
demand. Gains over the last four days total 14.2 per cent, in spite of
continuing political uncertainty over forthcoming elections.
Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London noted that many investors appeared
to be targeting the 8,000 level. He added that local press reports of
bullish comments by the stock exchange chairman and a continuing strong
inflow of funds by new, equity based mutual funds continued to fuel the
rally.
HELSINKI firmed on lower money market rates. The HEX index advanced 21.5, or
1.9 per cent to 1,173.1. OSLO also gained ground as the central bank cut the
overnight lending rate to 7.75 per cent. The All-share index rose 1.68 to
471.84.

FT  30 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Pakistan enters uncertain period -
Equities following the government's dismissal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistani stocks have entered one of their most uncertain periods due to
concern over the country's political and economic future after last week's
fall of Mr Nawaz Sharif's 29-month long government.
Although the Karachi stock exchange yesterday inched ahead, reversing
earlier expectations of a steep fall, that in itself has not ended
speculation that the market will become increasingly bearish during the next
three to five months.
The KSE-100 index closed yesterday at 1,098, but still remains some 147
points below the start of the year.
That fall reflects both the newly emerging pressures on the market and a
downward trend which has continued for more than a year.
The market took its biggest drop in a single day this year on April 19, when
the KSE index lost some 3 per cent, after President Ghulam Ishaq Khan
dismissed the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Under his administration economic reforms and fiscal incentives for
businesses were initiated. The reforms in turn were widely believed to hold
the key to greater confidence in the market which, for the first time, saw
the entry of an increasing number of local and foreign investors.
Mr Farooq Leghari, the new finance minister, assured business leaders in
Karachi this week that the reforms would not be reversed and that there
would be further economic liberalisation. However, many observers say they
will only accept such assurances from the new government that will be
appointed after elections scheduled for July 14, rather than the present
interim administration.
The present government's efforts to restore political stability have
suffered a setback, due to signs of an internal split. Ms Benazir Bhutto,
the opposition leader, is at odds with President Khan and Mr Balakh Sher
Mazari, the prime minister, over the future of Pakistan's four provincial
assemblies.
Ms Bhutto is demanding the dissolution of the provincial legislatures after
last week's dissolution of the national assembly.
But both Mr Khan and Mr Mazari are opposing her. Some observers fear that
the split could lead to Ms Bhutto's colleagues withdrawing from the interim
government.
Among those to leave could be Mr Leghari, the finance minister, who is among
her closest supporters.
Regarding the economy the most pressing concern is that of a worsening
budgetary deficit this year which is expected to be in excess of Rs100bn
(Dollars 3.8bn), compared with an earlier target of Rs65bn (Dollars 2.5bn).
In addition, a recession in the textile sector, especially in spinning, has
caused additional uncertainty over textile shares, which make up almost
one-third of the 643 companies registered on the stock exchange.
Mr Arif Habib, president of the KSE, agrees that there is an uncertain
climate, which would only go away once a new government was elected.
'When a government changes, investors have apprehensions about its future
policies,' he comments.
But Mr Nasir Ali Shah Bukhari, a leading broker, while accepting the bearish
trends, expects some selected companies to remain good buys.
He recommends companies which present good opportunities for medium to
long-term growth, where new investments at present are expected to yield
good profits when the market recovers.

GOLD shares continued to be driven by a higher bullion price, leaving a rise
in the share index of 104, or 7.5 per cent, at 1,497, write Philip Gawith in
Johannesburg and John Pitt in London.
Demand has been coming from overseas, particularly the US and Europe, with
investors attracted by high dividend yields. Since the beginning of the year
the index has gained 47 per cent.
Mr Dave Giese, gold analyst at Davis Borkum Hare, noted that in rand terms
the price has gone to levels it has never reached before.
Following severe cost-cutting programmes over the last three years, most
South African mines were 'lean and mean'. Another analyst cautioned that
buying was speculative, with highly geared marginal mines doing better than
heavyweights.

FT  30 APR 93 / Money Markets: Futures follow bunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROMARK futures contracts continued to fall yesterday, reflecting another
sell-off in the German bond market in the wake of this week's repo rate cut,
writes James Blitz.
The cut of 36 basis points in the Bundesbank's repo rate on Wednesday
initially took money market dealers by surprise. But instead of getting
bullish about the prospect for more Bundesbank rate cuts, futures dealers
were struck yesterday by another  1/2 percentage point fall in German
10-year bond prices.
The bund market has been sold off because of fears that inflation will erode
real returns if German monetary policy is eased too quickly.
At the same time, fears of industrial unrest in eastern Germany continued to
raise concern of wage inflation.
The IG Metall trade union announced yesterday that it plans strikes in the
state of Saxony next Monday.
These worries pushed the June Euromark contract down to a close of 92.68
from a previous 92.75. The September contract dropped by 11 basis points on
the day to finish at 93.48.
By contrast, the mood in French money markets was distinctly upbeat
following another reduction in France's official interest rates.
The Bank of France lowered its intervention rate by 25 basis points to 8.25
per cent and its 5 to 10-day lending rate by a similar amount to 9.25 per
cent.
The size of these cuts mirrors the 25 basis-point reduction in the
Bundesbank's discount rate last week. But French cash rates have been
converging fast on German rates in the last two days.
With three-month francs at 7.91 per cent and three-month D-Marks at 7.73 per
cent, France now only carries an 18 basis-point premium over Germany.
This convergence is still not reflected in the June Pibor and Euromark
contracts, where the spread is some 42 basis points, making some futures
dealers think that French futures are cheap.
Conditions in the sterling cash market were very tight following
difficulties removing a Pounds 1.6bn shortage forecast by the Bank of
England.
The overnight lending rate was at 10 per cent at one stage. Three-month
money ended unchanged at 6 1/16 per cent. The June short sterling future
finished 6 basis points down on the day, depressed by a weak pound, at
93.84.

THE DOLLAR was depressed by a poorer than expected headline figure for US
growth yesterday, but recovered in the European afternoon on closer
inspection of the data, writes James Blitz.
US GDP in the first quarter of this year expanded at an annual rate of 1.8
per cent, compared to market expectations of a 2.3 per cent rise.
Shortly before the indicator was released, the dollar was trading lower at
DM1.5770 to the D-Mark. It then fell to bottom out at DM1.5693. However, the
US currency recovered on a closer analysis of the data, which suggested that
underlying growth was relatively strong.
According to Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America in
London, the headline GDP figure was depressed by a record monthly drop in US
military spending. He also belives that, if storm damage during the first
three months of 1993 is taken into account, underlying growth was in the
order of 3.5 per cent.
The dollar ended in London at DM1.5815, down about  1/2 pfennig on the day.
Towards the close of European trading, the currency remained immobile as
dealers awaited the outcome of the G7 finance ministers' meeting in
Washington. It finished New York trading at DM1.5785.
In Europe, the main focus was on the continuing appreciation of the French
franc against the D-Mark in the wake of this week's easing in German
monetary policy.
For the first time this year, the franc pierced the FFr3.37 level against
the German currency to close at FFr3.369 from a previous FFr3.374.
A stronger sign of the French currency's strength was the narrowing of the
spread between three-month francs and D-Marks, now down to 18 basis points,
indicating the withering away of the franc's premium against devaluation.
Earlier this week, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, said
there was no reason why French rates should not go below German ones.
However, a big discount to German rates is unlikely. The French authorities
would be wary of lowering French official rates too far for fear of having
to instantly reverse an interest rate cut, as they did in the winter of
1991.
There were indications, too, yesterday that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, was troubled by the sharp fall in German bunds
following the cut in the repo rate this week. After a dovish newspaper
interview earlier this week, Mr Schlesinger yesterday said Germany had not
beaten its inflation problem.
The Spanish peseta was affected by these comments and fell back in late
trading to end at Pta73.20 to the D-Mark from a previous Pta73.07.
The pound weakened gently throughout the day on suspicions that the Bank of
England was selling sterling to boost foreign exchange reserves. The
currency closed  3/4 pfennig down at DM2.4850.

COPPER prices fell to fresh session lows on the LME, dragged lower by New
York. Business was not particularly active yesterday, as the markets
re-adjusted after Wednesday's advances were snuffed out and traders became
more cautious. Comex opened sharply down, but was recovering some of the
losses in later trading. 'Copper opened up on the defensive and sustained
another round of heavy losses in the early hectic, almost frenetic,
trading,' said one New York analyst. 'The selling spate was relatively
short-lived however, but supported by looming industrial action in eastern
Germany and news of yet more increases in production coming this time from
Chile.' New York raw SUGAR stayed lower at midday and was perched just above
the lows of the week as the market shrugged off a bullish report from FO
Licht, which cut its estimate of world sugar production in 1992-93 to
113.01m tonnes from a previous projection of 114.88m. New York COTTON prices
were ahead at midday following Wednesday's steep sell off. One broker said
the low prices had probably attracted better inquiries for US cotton.

FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold hits 9-month high as
buying spree continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRE in the gold market ignited by high-profile investors Sir James
Goldsmith and Mr George Soros continued to rage yesterday as the price moved
up to a nine-month peak of 356.60 a troy ounce and the excitement spilled
over into silver and other precious metals markets.
'The propaganda about the Goldsmith and Soros deals has been overwhelming,'
said one trader. 'I am getting calls from no-brain investors who have
difficulty picking up the 'phone, let alone understanding the gold market.
But nobody wants to sell gold. Professionals are having to buy to cover
option positions. They (Sir James and Mr Soros) have provoked a weight of
money that means rationality is suspended. Who knows where or when it will
end?'
Some traders said silver was centre stage yesterday as the price moved to a
21-month peak of Dollars 4.36 an ounce in London before easing back to close
at Dollars 4.325, up 21 cents from Wednesday's close. Platinum, like gold,
reached its highest price for nine months in London and closed at Dollars
384.50 an ounce, up Dollars 10.30.
Gold eased back to close last night at Dollars 355.25 an ounce, up Dollars
3.60. Seven weeks ago the metal was at its lowest for seven years but at the
weekend it was revealed that Mr Soros, who made Dollars 1bn in the currency
markets last September, had bought shares in Newmont Mining, the biggest
North American producer, and Sir James, the Anglo-French deal-maker, had
taken out a huge number of options to buy gold.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst with the Union Bank of Switzerland, said: 'In the
next few weeks, until Sir James's options mature, gold buying by call option
writers will mean that the more the price rises, the more it will rise.'
Mr Jeff Christian, managing director of CPM, the New York-based precious
metals consultancy group, suggested gold was ready for 'an extended move
upwards', but it was still susceptible to sales by central banks - which
have 35,000 tonnes in their vaults.
He took to task those organisations and gold bulls who in recent weeks had
'attempted to mislead the public on the essence and nature of official
sector gold activity'. He said a large number of central banks had sold gold
in the past few years and these disposals had brought about 33.7m ounces net
of additional bullion to the market since 1987.

FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Albania offers onshore
exploration blocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALBANIA IS extending its oil and natural gas exploration programme to
onshore areas, offering concessions in six blocks covering 700 square km
along the country's Adriatic coastline.
In a separate project, international oil companies are being invited to
submit bids for a Dollars 70m recovery enhancement programme at existing
oilfields in southern Albania.
The offers mark a reversal of previous Albanian policy on oil exploration,
which restricted foreign companies to offshore drilling. The government is
now trying to attract large-scale investment from abroad to help modernise
the country's crumbling industrial base.
Following completion of seismic testing last year, five international oil
companies are due to start offshore drilling in the Adriatic this summer.
However, there have been considerable administrative delays caused by
uncertainty over Albania's legal framework for investment.
Mr Albert Isai of Albpetrol, the state oil company, said that the tender
offer for onshore concessions was prepared in partnership with Western
Geophysical, the US-based surveying company, which re-processed data
provided by Albanian geologists.
He said seven international companies had so far shown interest in onshore
exploration. Bids are due by June 15.
The onshore contracts, expected to have a 25-year duration, foresee a
five-year research and exploration period, with on-site training to be
provided for Albanian technical staff.
Under a production-sharing agreement, capital expenditures would be
recovered over five years. Up to 40 per cent of yearly crude oil production
would be payable for cost recovery, while profit sharing would be
negotiable, Mr Isai said.
Natural gas discoveries would remain the property of the Albanian state. The
government hopes that Albania will be linked with a planned gas pipeline
from Skopje in Macedonia and another under construction in northern Greece.
Both would supply Russian natural gas.
The recovery enhancement project covers oilfields at Divjaka, Povelca and
Ballaj where total production of crude has declined to around 800,000 tonnes
a year from more than 2m tonnes a year in the late 1970s.
Albpetrol invited bids in the form of joint ventures, production sharing or
service contracts, specifying that local staff and services should be used
wherever possible.
The three-year project would probably involve new drilling 'for exploitation
not exploration' and use of new technology, such as steam injection
techniques, to increase oil yields, Mr Isai said.
'Production has been steadily declining. We are using antiquated Russian,
Chinese and Romanian equipment, and there are no spare parts,' he said.
The project also calls for spending Dollars 5m for environmental
improvement, mainly on a clean-up of contaminated land and streams around
the oilfields.
Negotiations are under way with several international companies, including
Mol of Hungary, and two US-based companies, Transmark and Anglo-Suisse, with
contracts due to be signed this summer, Mr Isai said.

FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: France gets permission to
restrict banana imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE IS to restrict direct imports of bananas from African, Caribbean and
Pacific producers until a new European Community-wide quota regime comes
into force on July 1.
The European Commission decided yesterday that France could peg direct
imports of ACP-produced bananas in May and June at the average import volume
for those months over the last three years.
French officials said they were also seeking permission to block parallel
imports of ACP bananas from other EC countries, principally Belgium and
Italy.
The commission is still considering that request, which, if granted, could
lead to the reimposition of internal border controls lifted on January 1
when the single European market came into force.
The French banana market has slumped this year, with prices dropping from
FFr6 to FFr3.50 (42p) a kilogram this month. France has blamed a steep
increase in cheap imports, particularly from the Dominican Republic, a
charge certain to be denied by the Caribbean state.
The influx of cheap bananas has hit France's traditional suppliers in the
overseas territories of Martinique and Guadeloupe and in former colonies
such as the Ivory Coast and Cameroon. Mr Dominique Perben, minister for
French overseas territories, said yesterday that these were one-off measures
which would start having an effect on the French market from the beginning
of next week.
However, ACP banana exporters will be free to compete in the EC from July 1
under the controversial quota regime agreed in February, which is intended
to protect them from Latin American competition. 'There will of course be a
drop in price on the French market from July 1, but the difference is that
(traditional ACP producers) will be compensated for their losses,' said a
French official yesterday.
The French action has been taken under the safeguard clauses of the 1989
Lome Convention between the ACP countries and the EC. The commission had
already given France and Britain temporary rights under the Treaty of Rome
to limit parallel imports of Latin American bananas.

FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Organic profits go against the
grain - Surprising results from a farming experiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of switching land from conventional to organic wheat production is
about Pounds 800 a hectare. This is one of the earliest conclusions that can
be drawn from an experiment begun three years ago at Boarded Barns Farm near
Ongar in Essex.
Mr Lister Noble, the farm manager, believes his first organic crop of 5.8
tonnes a hectare, harvested last year, was one of the best in the UK - it
compared with just under 8 tonnes a hectare obtained on the same farm using
conventional methods.
To his surprise, however, the gross margin on the conventional crop was
higher than on the organic at Pounds 608 compared with Pounds 556. That
figure was arrived at after spending Pounds 100 a hectare on pelleted
chicken manure after the organic crop appeared to be suffering from stress.
'I was not expecting the higher gross margin on the conventional crop,' he
says. 'Even with no fertiliser the organic gross margin would still have
been only Pounds 656. That's not much of a premium considering there has
been no income for two years.'
This is a reference to the need to leave a field fallow for two years before
it can be used for an organic crop. In the first year each hectare intended
for organic production incurred a cost of Pounds 32 as it was put to grass.
The second year saw an income of Pounds 48 from the grass. The third year's
wheat output brought in an income of Pounds 555 a hectare, giving a gross
margin for the period of Pounds 571.
Using a conventional cropping policy, a similar hectare earned Pounds 128 in
year one from rape, and Pounds 641 and Pounds 607 from wheat in years two
and three, giving a gross margin of Pounds 1,376 a hectare for the three
years.
Mr Noble points out that most farmers would need a large subsidy to be able
to bear such a cost. 'I would be wary if it was my own money about
committing myself to it - and we have had good crops.'
However, there is nothing a farmer can do about market forces and the
premium for organic wheat has come down sharply in the last three years. In
1990 organic wheat was selling at Pounds 260 a tonne, while the price for
conventional was Pounds 125. Early this year organic wheat was fetching only
Pounds 187 a tonne, while conventional had risen to Pounds 147.
The Boarded Barns experiment, which is being run by Rhone-Poulenc, Europe's
biggest agro-chemicals manufacturer, is in only the early stages of its
10-year life, and Mr Noble is determined not to jump to premature
conclusions. He also vigorously attacks any suggestion that the experiment,
which has excited huge interest from outside bodies, will lead to
conclusions which the company might be expected to want.
'It is totally unbiased,' he says. 'Every single project is being run or
monitored by an outside body.'
The company points out that it has not sought out people to join the
experiment. Rather, organisations wanting to carry out experiments have
sought permission to join in. New studies started in the last year include
one by the Agriculture and Food Research Council into the relation between
birds and the insect population on both sides of the farm and one by the
University of Plymouth into dragonflies. This year Boarded Barns is the
display farm for Essex for the Farm and Wildlife Advisory Group.
Mr Noble is a member of Organic Farmers and Growers and the farm is
registered with the UK Register of Organic Food Standards.
The soil at Boarded Barns is similar to that across most of south-east
England's grain growing country. The conventional side of the farm has
followed a normal rotation policy of milling wheat, beans and oilseed rape.
Herbicides, pesticides and fungicides are used when deemed necessary.
However, a great deal of attention has been paid to conservation. There is a
detailed tree and hedge programme and a one-metre strip around each field is
kept clear of all chemicals.
Not that the organic side of the farm will reject the use of all chemicals -
UKROF has a list of allowable sprays, including sulphur to control mildew.
The effect of these will also be studied. 'There is no such thing as
chemical free farming,' says Mr Noble. 'Natural products can be quite toxic
 -that is one of the things we are looking at.'
He believes a lot of the success of his first organic wheat crop can be
traced back to excellent weather. For example, he invested Pounds 6,000 in a
12-metre wide harrow comb, which was efficient at removing big weeds when
the weather was dry. The little weeds then withered.
However, if it had rained the little ones would have grown, and uprooted
weeds could have taken root again, he points out.
He also believes that Boarded Barns benefits from being surrounded by
well-run conventional farms, although he fears the results of set-aside,
which could lead to reservoirs of disease.
Aside from the good weather, the organic crop was the first from land left
fallow for two years. 'The soil has had a good rest. It's first wheat - you
always get a good crop.'
Samples of the wheat from both crops were sent to the Flour Milling and
Bakery Association, which found there was effectively no difference between
the two.
The flour was then sent to a panel of the Campden Food and Drink Research
Association, the authoritative food tasting body, which baked loaves for a
blind testing. The results were surprising - the panel preferred the bread
baked from the conventional wheat, describing the organic brown loaves as
having a significantly more musty/mouldy flavour than the conventional.
However, the two wheats were not of the same variety. Future crops will
switch the same varieties from organic to conventional and vice versa.
Such is the attention to detail in this experiment. 'We may not come to any
conclusions for 10 years,' says Mr Noble. 'At the moment all the research
projects will say is that we have established a good baseline.'

FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: German smelters 'under threat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING,
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NONE OF Germany's aluminium smelters would survive if present low prices
continued into 1994, said Mr Karl Wobbe, management board member responsible
for production at VAW Aluminium.
Even VAW's most-efficient and biggest smelter, the 210,000 tonnes-a-year
plant at Neuss, would have to close unless the London Metal Exchange price
recovered to Dollars 1,200 a tonne and stayed above that level - VAW needed
Dollars 1,150 a tonne to cover the smelter's cash costs. The three-month
aluminium price closed at Dollars 1,123.75 a tonne on the LME last night.
His warning comes at a time when VAW is about to enter negotiations for new
power supply contracts for its smelters and EC producers are pressing the
European Commission to impose quotas on aluminium imports from Russia.
However, Mr Wobbe denied that the threat of closure, which would affect
about 1,000 people, was motivated by these factors. 'Even with a new power
contract it would not make sense to continue at Neuss at today's prices,' he
explained.
Total German aluminium output this year would be 25 per cent below the 1988
level at about 550,000 tonnes.

FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian move reverses coffee
rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS THAT Brazil is to sell 600,000 bags of coffee from stock to help
finance investment in its industry put this week's rally in coffee prices
into reverse.
Traders and analysts were sceptical about the announcement as there was no
indication of when the sale would take place or at what price. They agreed,
however, that it was enough to turn sentiment. London's July robusta
contract shed Dollars 19 to close at Dollars 876 a tonne, while in late
trading the New York May arabica price was off 1.40 at 58.70 cents a lb.
In the first two days of this week the New York May arabica contract rose by
more than 6 cents a lb, and touched a high of 61.20 on Wednesday. The London
market followed, moving above Dollars 900 a tonne.
The main factor behind the move was a fall of 100,000 bags (60 kg each) in
US certified stocks - although traders were quick to point out that 5.57m
bags of stocks remained.
In addition delivery notices against the May contract were well absorbed. As
the market rose, fund and commission house buying emerged.
Yesterday's reverse followed a Reuter report of a news conference by Mr
Celsius Lodder, of the Brazilian Industry Ministry, at which he said the
country would invest Dollars 860m in its coffee sector by raising funds
through sales from its 17.5m bags of stocks.
However, one London analyst said it appeared that Mr Lodder's remarks had
been made off the cuff. Such schemes were mentioned every so often as a
possibility - 'but I can't see it happening. It would be a bad time to sell
off, the harvest is just starting'.
Mr Lawrence Eagles of GNI, the London futures brokers, said the quality of
the 600,000 bags was unknown. But if they were sold on to Brazil's domestic
market, good quality coffee would be released for export.
A meeting of the International Coffee Organisation's executive board
yesterday was discussing a possible one-year extension to the coffee
agreement. A month ago negotations for a new agreement broke down, and
members have to decide a future form for the ICO. Several smaller producers
are questioning why, with no market support measures in place, the ICO
should have a central London office and a staff of about 60.

FT  30 APR 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries strengthen on decline in GDP
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices firmed across the board yesterday on news of a decline in
gross domestic product growth.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 103
1/16 yielding 6.878 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 3.777 per cent.
Market sentiment was lifted by the Commerce department's announcement that
GDP rose by only 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Although
the figure was expected to come in below the 4.7 per cent growth recorded in
the previous three months, it was also below analysts' forecasts.
At first, dealers and investors hesitated to buy on the news because they
were worried that the 3.3 per cent increase in the implicit price deflator,
published along with the GDP numbers, suggested that inflation was picking
up pace.
However, analysts judged that the rise in the price deflator would be
temporary, and by mid-morning bond prices were firmly in positive territory
as investors focused on some of the other details in the GDP data, notably a
0.3 per drop in final sales and a 7.1 per cent decline in exports.
Prices gained further ground later in the day, helped by the successful
auction of Dollars 14.3bn of 52-week bills.
THE UK government bond market continued to slide yesterday in the wake of
Wednesday's disappointing gilt auction and amid general European
bearishness.
The new partly-paid 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998 fell by more than half a
point to 49 7/8 . One view of the auction was that the yield ended up being
too low after too heady a rally in advance. The slide was more accentuated
at the longer end with falls of over a point in bonds with more than a
10-year maturity.
After the futures contract's key 104.31 support level was breached,
chartists were pointing to about 102.20 as the next stopping point. By
yesterday, a decline of about 4 points had been registered since a high of
107.16 at the start of April.
The decline followed a change in perception about the rate of recovery in
the UK economy. Most indicators over the past fortnight have pointed to a
stronger pick-up than anticipated. Another factor affecting all the European
markets yesterday was switching into US Treasuries.
AFTER the mid-week good news on German interest rates, with the repo rate
cut by 34 basis points to 7.75 per cent, the government bond market was in
decline yesterday, particularly at the long end.
Profit-taking was part of the reason and, as with gilts, the futures
contract breached its technical support level of 94.91.
The June bund contract opened at 95.13 and fell to 94.60, with the low
coming close to the next support level of 94.53. Volume was again heavy with
more than 100,000 contracts traded.
Factors weighing on the market include the queue of impending bond issues to
fund swelling public debt and a strike vote by the IG Metall union over
wages in the former East Germany.
CONCERNS about the German outlook seem to have outstripped those on
post-election France. The yield spread on French 10-year bonds over German
ones has reached a historically tight landmark of about 40 basis points.
Only a month ago, the spread was well over 60 and it was about 86 at the end
of 1992.
With the French inflation rate of 2.2 per cent about half that of Germany
and French public borrowing growing less quickly - albeit from a higher base
 -perceptions have changed. The Bank of France's   1/4 point cut in its two
leading interest rates yesterday had been discounted, and with the franc
buoyant in spite of the cut, the currency risk is seen as diminishing.
IN Spain, a Pta700bn government bond auction, the second biggest for more
than a year, attracted only weak foreign interest. This was reflected in the
low allocation of 10-year bonds - about Pta100bn compared with Pta300bn each
for the three and five-year stock - which was unhelpful to the Spanish
government's drive to lengthen its debt maturity.
THE Italian market's long rally skidded into reverse yesterday as profits
were taken. High expectations of Mr Carlo Ciampi, the new prime minister,
were tempered by a realisation of the practical problems he faces.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Morgan Stanley plans issue of
up to Dollars 10bn Opals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN STANLEY has designed a new range of securities, offering investors
exposure to country-specific equity indices through Opals - Optimised
Portfolios As Listed Securities.
Morgan Stanley plans to issue up to Dollars 10bn of Opals, structured as
three-year bonds, but declined to reveal how much has been sold in two weeks
of marketing so far.
The securities are backed by a basket of shares, designed to replicate the
index.
Instead of a coupon, the bonds pay the share dividends semi-annually. Like
index futures, Opals can be used for asset allocation.
However, some institutions cannot use futures, for legal or tax reasons, or
because they are not allowed under trust deeds.
Thus, although it has some characteristics of a derivative instrument, Opals
are actually bonds backed by shares, and can be exchanged for the underlying
shares at any time, or at maturity.
Unlike investments trusts, Opals will not trade at a discount, because the
bonds can be traded in for shares.
Further, it is designed as a passive investment tool, that is, it merely
replicates an index, and does not involve stock-picking.
'The product is dependent on being able to package a lot of different
services - such as equity analytics, international stock lending, and global
custody,' said Mr Bob Tull, a director of Morgan Stanley.
Many institutional investors will prefer to use the futures markets, which
offer the best liquidity.
However, index futures contracts are not available in all markets, and Opals
may be a welcome alternative in some areas.
There are plans to offer Opals in market such as Norway, Italy, and New
Zealand, for example.
Opals are likely to suit institutional investors wanting to make reasonably
long-term investment decisions, rather than taking short-term positions.
Futures are more suitable as a trading instrument, since they can be sold
short.
Earlier this year, the American Stock Exchange launched Standard &amp; Poor's
Depositary Receipts (SPDRs), known as Spiders.
The product is backed by a trust which holds the main S&amp;P shares, allowing
investors to track the performance of the S&amp;P 500 stock index.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Bonds: Bupa makes its Euromarket debut with
Pounds 100m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUPA, Britain's biggest private healthcare group, made its debut in the
Eurobond market yesterday with a Pounds 100m, 25-year issue aimed primarily
at UK institutional investors.
The deal, which is subordinated, has a coupon of 10.5 per cent and is
callable at par after 20 years. Mr Edward Lea, finance director at Bupa,
said the money would be used to provide additional capital 'so that we can
continue the development of our private medical insurance business'.
Bupa has seen a turnround in its financial position, reporting a 1992
pre-tax surplus of Pounds 36.5m last month, against a 1991 surplus of Pounds
1.3m and a 1990 loss of Pounds 38.2m.
Mr Lea said the deal complied with the new EC third non-life insurance
directive, under which an insurance company can count long-term subordinated
loan capital for solvency margin purposes. The solvency margin will rise to
50 per cent from 45 per cent as a result of the fund raising, according to
lead manager Samuel Montagu.
The deal was generously priced to yield 185 basis points over the 9 per cent
gilt due 2012 and the spread later tightened to 183-184 basis points. The
lead manager looked at several recent subordinated debt deals for banks and
building societies in order to establish a price for Bupa's first offering
in the capital markets.
For example, earlier this year, the Leeds Permanent Building Society
launched a Pounds 150m issue of subordinated bonds due 2018 which was priced
to yield 140 basis points over the comparable gilt, and whose yield spread
has narrowed to 134 basis points.
The Royal Bank of Scotland launched a Pounds 150m 20-year issue of
subordinated bonds at around the same time, priced to yield 140 basis points
more than the comparable UK gilt. The spread on these bonds has narrowed to
around 118 basis points.
Bupa, which is a provident association, lacks a credit rating but is likely
to seek one soon.
Elsewhere, British Gas tapped the Eurolira market yesterday with a L150bn,
10-year issue.
The bond, which has a 10.75 per cent coupon, was swapped into sterling to
give attractive sub-Libid money (Libid is 12.5 basis points below Libor).
Deutsche Bank, which owns the lead manager BAI, said the bonds were priced
at 101.71 and traded outside the full fees at 99 5/8 on the bid side,
blaming the weakness of the Italian market.
The Eurobond market continues to see the launch of more collared
floating-rate notes which have been a regular feature of the market in
recent months. New deals were launched yesterday for the Mortgage Bank of
Denmark and Credit Commercial de France.
The Dollars 100m deal for Mortgage Bank of Denmark, lead managed by Kidder
Peabody, pays 30 basis points below six-month Libor and has a floor of 5 per
cent and a cap of 8 per cent.
The deal was swapped to provide sub-Libor funding for the borrower, which is
state-owned and has a AA1/AA+ credit rating.

ARGENTARIA, the state-owned Spanish banking corporation which is in the
process of being partially privatised through a Dollars 1bn international
placement, has lifted first-quarter net profits 14 per cent to Pta21.2bn
(Dollars 184m).
The figures come as individual and institutional investors in Spain and
institutional investors outside Spain await the allocation of shares in the
close to 25 per cent of Argentaria equity that is being put on the market.
Argentaria raised financial revenues by 9.1 per cent to Pta264bn, financial
margin by 5.3 per cent to Pta60.2bn and operating margin by 17.7 per cent to
Pta32.1bn, in what are likely to be some of the best quarterly results among
Spain's leading banks.
The subscription period for Argentaria share issue ends on May 5 and trading
in its stock is due to start on May 12.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Leif Hoegh earnings rise to
NKr117m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, yesterday reported it had
increased first-quarter net profit to NKr117m (Dollars 17.6m) from NKr97m
last year and forecast that profit, after financial items, for the year as a
whole would show an improvement.
Group net revenue was lifted by NKr9m to NKr414m, as operating profit rose
by NKr11m to NKr101m. The company's share price rose by NKr3 to NKr94 on the
Oslo bourse yest-erday.
Hoegh said it expected operating profit for 1993 to emerge at around
NKr350m, up from the NKr309m of 1992. The shipowner said it was satisfied
with the first-quarter performance and that its financial position was
strong.
Norgeskreditt, the private sector mortgage company, said first-quarter
pre-tax profit rose more than threefold to NKr81.7m from NKr26.9m, helped by
higher gains on securities and an increase in net interest income.
Norgeskreditt said plans to become a commercial bank, announced earlier this
year, had been approved by shareholders. It expects banking operations to
commence by the end of this year.
Group first-quarter net interest income rose to NKr73.1m from NKr45.9m, as
gains on bonds and securities increased to NKr34.5m from NKr0.5m. Loan
losses rose to NKr11m from NKr9.3m.
Jyske Bank, Denmark's fourth largest bank, has reported an increase in
first-quarter profits before bad loan provisions to DKr363m from DKr158m a
year ago.
Earnings from interest and fee income increased by 8 per cent to DKr474mn.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Christiania Bank returns to
profit in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second-biggest commercial bank, yesterday
reported a return to profits for the first quarter of 1993 following several
years of successive losses.
The bank achieved a net profit of NKr209m (Dollars 31.2m), against a loss of
NKr86m in the first three months of 1992. The improvement was attributed to
gains on securities, a 7 per cent reduction in costs and lower credit
losses.
The performance helped boost Christiania's capital adequacy ratio to 8.9 per
cent from 5.8 per cent in the same period last year.
Mr Borger Lenth, chief executive, said there were still problems in the
corporate lending sector.
'The other major worry is the declining loan volume, which has resulted from
the prolonged lack of interest in investing in Norway, both among
individuals and in the corporate sector,' he added.
Net loan volume fell by NKr5.8bn to NKr78.85bn, while net interest income
was largely unchanged at NKr779m. Non-interest income increased by NKr210m
to NKr699m, with gains on securities more than doubling to NKr281m and
foreign exchange gains rising by NKr15m to NKr117m.
Group operating profit, before credit losses and write-downs, increased by
NKr264m to NKr783m, while losses on loans and guarantees fell by NKr61m to
NKr504m. Operating expenses fell by NKr55m to NKr695m.
Christiania warned of higher risk associated with exposure to fish-farming
and said this had increased general loan-loss provisions by NKr100m to
NKr2.64bn.
The bank was also forced to make a specific provision of NKr260m to cover
potential loan losses.
Net non-performing loans decreased by NKr200m to NKr5.7bn, while gross
non-performing loans fell by NKr500m to NKr11.6bn.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: ICI Australia 29% ahead at
half-time on static turnover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ICI Australia, a subsidiary of the UK chemicals group, yesterday announced a
29 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 37.8m (USDollars 27.2m) after
abnormal items for the six months ended March, on turnover little changed at
ADollars 1.39bn.
The group said abnormal losses of ADollars 10.6m mainly comprised a
restatement of future income tax benefits in anticipation of a proposed
reduction in the rate of corporate taxation from 39 per cent to 33 per cent.
The board said the lack of sales growth reflected the lack of any worthwhile
recovery in the Australian economy. The profit improvement followed higher
productivity, lower costs, and the closure of lossmaking businesses.
The closures included an ephedrine plant in Newcastle, an advanced ceramics
factory at Rockingham in Western Australia and plants at Rhodes, NSW, all of
which had been making losses.
ICI said prices for its chlor-alkali and sodium cyanide products remained at
historically low levels because of world over-supply. Plastics prices also
remained low and dumping continued to be 'a significant problem'.
The directors said the full-year result would 'satisfactorily exceed' last
year unless trading conditions worsened, but 'significant improvement
depends mainly on recovery in the Australian economy and international
petrochemical prices'.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 7 cents a share, up 2 cents.
The board said the increase reflected the directors' intention to increase
the interim dividend as a proportion of the total dividend.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AGA, the Swedish industrial gas group, yesterday reported unchanged profits
after financial items in the first quarter at SKr415m (Dollars 57m) compared
with the same period last year, despite a sharp rise in sales to SKr3.7bn
from SKr2.8bn.
The company, with more than 80 per cent of its sales outside Sweden, said
the sales figure was boosted by the devaluation of the Swedish krona last
autumn and the consolidation of CEGF, a French cold storage company 98 per
cent owned since the end of last year.
Although depreciation charges rose to SKr342m, from SKr235m, reflecting
increased levels of investment in eastern and other parts of Europe,
operating income was up almost 20 per cent, at SKr392m, thanks to the
devaluation effect.
However, net financial expenses soared from SKr3m to SKr89m as a result of
higher interest charges in krona terms for foreign loans and the cost of
financing the purchase of CEGF.
This left profits little changed. The 1992 results were restated to take
into account results from the Swedish power group Gullspangs Kraft, which is
34 per cent owned by Aga and is now treated as an associated company.
Mr Marcus Storch, chief executive, said the company was feeling the effect
of economic downturn in Europe and had yet to see much improvement in the
US, despite a general upturn in the American economy.
He expected an improvement for the full year over last year's SKr1.48bn
profit.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Tivoli gives Danes more than
their share of fun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE typical shareholder in Copenhagen's Tivoli gardens, the world's oldest
amusement park, owns just nine shares, the minimum number required to obtain
free entry.
Now entry costs DKr35 (Dollars 5.80), whereas nine shares have a stock
market value of around DKr25,000. Why do people pay so much to save so
little? 'It's inexplicable,' said Mr J. Birger Larsen, Tivoli's finance
director.
But it is not entirely so. Danes pay as an expression of their pride in, and
affection for, Tivoli, a quintessentially Danish creation which this year
celebrates its 150th anniversary.
The shares are among the least liquid on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.
There are just 155,000 A shares and 188,000 B shares, and they often become
available only when one of the 11,200 shareholders dies.
Boosted by the expectation that this year's 150th birthday will set a
turnstile record, the shares have been selling at around DKr2,800 each, for
a price-earnings ratio of 39. This puts a stock market value of DKr960m on
Tivoli, in contrast to an asset value of DKr544m. Turnover last year was
DKr253m and net profits totalled DKr24m.
One of Tivoli's attractions is that it is on a prime site in the centre of
the city, bounded on one side by the main railway station and the other by
the City Hall. Last year, Tivoli purchased the site from the City Council
for DKr234m, financed by a new issue.
However, planning laws mean that the company can never use the site for any
other purpose. Also, the city of Copenhagen has the right to reacquire the
site after 100 years.
Mr Orson Nielsen, public relations director, says that Tivoli ranks as the
eighth most popular amusement park in the world by the number of visitors -
just over 4m in a normal year. But the year consists of a season which lasts
from mid-April to mid-September.
Tivoli's popularity is based on its appeal to the Danes themselves. About 40
per cent of visitors are tourists. And its appeal? Among the firm principles
on which the park is run are: no neon, no plastic and only live music.
Add 876 trees, 134,700 spring bulbs, and thousands of bedding plants, and
one begins to get an inkling of the charm which Tivoli exercises. There are
rollercoasters, roundabouts, fruit machines and shooting galleries; and 28
restaurants cater for almost every taste and pocket.
The open-air stage attracts many of the world's leading popular artists.
There is a revue theatre and a jazz club. At the Tivoli Concert Hall, there
are 134 concerts, mainly of classical music, in the course of the season.
Unlike the Disneyland parks (Walt Disney dreamt up the idea of Disneyland
while on a visit to Tivoli in the early 1950s), there are no restrictions on
the sale of alcohol. The Carlsberg brewing group has a controlling interest
through its holding of A shares, which have 10 times the voting power of B
shares.
There is considerable interest abroad in establishing amusement parks on the
Tivoli formula. A subsidiary, Tivoli International, was set up a few years
ago to design new parks.
So far, only one park - 'a version, but not a copy' - is under construction.
A DKr2.5bn, 82,000 sq. m. project in the Japanese city of Kurashiki is due
to open in 1996.

PEPKOR, South Africa's largest mass-market retailer, overcame a difficult
operating environment to record a 17 per cent increase in earnings per share
for the year ended February.
With Tradegro, acquired in October 1991, included for 12 months for the
first time, turnover jumped by 70 per cent to R7.8bn (Dollars 2.4bn).
Operating income was 26 per cent higher at R267.3m and pre-tax profits were
30 per cent ahead at R252.2m.
Mr Christo Wiese, chairman, said the past year had been one of the most
difficult ever for the South African economy. This had caused problems at
Cashbuild, the building materials unit, and slowed the rate of growth of
Pep, the clothing retailer. However, the Checkers supermarket chain returned
to profit sooner than anticipated and Stuttafords was trading well.
Mr Wiese said the past year had been mainly one of restructuring and
consolidation - combining Shoprite and Checkers, the two food operations.
He said trading conditions were unlikely to improve in the short term, but
he expected 'acceptable results' in the coming year.

QUEBECOR, the north American publishing, printing and forest products group,
tripled first-quarter profit in spite of the long recession and pressure on
advertising volumes.
Revenues were CDollars 671m (USDollars 527m), up 13 per cent, and net profit
was CDollars 15.4m, or 24 cents a share, up from CDollars 5.2m, or 8 cents,
a year earlier.
All segments improved, but most of the gains came from the fast-expanding
commercial printing business, now the second-biggest in north America
following the 1992 acquisition of Maxwell Graphics in the US for CDollars
510m.
Quebecor Printing, which has since gone public, is seeking acquisitions in
the western and south-western US and a beachhead in Europe.

MCCAW Cellular, the largest cellular telecommunications company in the US,
yesterday reported strong increases in revenue and cash flow from its
cellular operations, along with a much-reduced first quarter net loss of
just Dollars 14m, against Dollars 99m last year, writes Martin Dickson in
New York.
The fast-growing, heavily indebted business, which prefers analysts to focus
on cash flow from its cellular interests - income before depreciation and
amortisation and interest charges - said this figure totalled Dollars
163.6m, up from Dollars 113m.
Cellular revenues rose 31 per cent, from Dollars 276.6m to Dollars 363.1m.
Mr Craig McCaw, chairman, said the company was pleased with the continued
growth in subscriber revenues and operating cash flow.

<TEXT>
HOME OIL of Calgary no longer has a controlling shareholder following a
public offering of the combined 59.7 per cent stake held by Olympia &amp; York,
the crippled property developer, and Gulf Canada Resources.
A group of underwriters led by Burns Fry of Toronto paid CDollars 396m
(USDollars 311m) on Wednesday for the 23.6m shares held by O&amp;Y and Gulf. The
shares had been re-sold to institutional and retail investors by early
yesterday morning. Burns Fry estimated that European investors had bought
about 10 per cent of theshares.
Home Oil is the latest in a string of large Canadian companies whose
troubled parents have been replaced by a widely dispersed group of
shareholders. Earlier this year, underwriting groups distributed blocks in
MacMillan Bloedel, the west coast forestry producer, and John Labatt, the
beer and entertainment company, previously held by the troubled Edper group
which is controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.
O&amp;Y's creditors are considering similar action to dispose of the developer's
controlling stakes in Gulf Canada and Abitibi-Price, the newsprint producer.
Mr Brent Fullard, director of equity markets at Burns Fry, said investors
had reacted enthusiastically to the sales because of the prospect of
companies being freed from a 'constrained owner'.
Furthermore, these companies' share prices have been depressed for some time
by concern that a large block would be placed on the market.
Home Oil earned CDollars 6.9m last year on revenues of CDollars 281.2m. Its
main strength is in natural gas, with output averaging 214.2m cubic feet a
day last year.
Gulf Canada, 75 per cent owned by O&amp;Y, said its share of proceeds from the
Home Oil sale, totalling CDollars 145m, would be used to reduce debt. It
aims to raise another CDollars 400m this year from asset sales.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Kleinwort Benson rejects US
allegations by PaineWebber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK investment bank Kleinwort Benson defended itself yesterday against
allegations that several new senior officers at its US asset management
affiliate conspired to steal the core of a fixed income asset management
department run by PaineWebber, the Wall Street securities house.
In announcing the appointment of Mr Stephen Canter as executive chairman and
chief executive officer and Mr Emad Zikry as president and chief investment
officer of its New York-based subsidiary Kleinwort Benson International
Investment, the UK bank denied that the two men, who until last week were
employed at the PaineWebber unit Mitchell Hutchins Institutional Investors,
had solicited employees or clients of MHII, or had denigrated MHII, while
still at that company.
Angered by the defections, PaineWebber yesterday filed a civil lawsuit in
New York against three former MHII executives and Kleinwort's US affiliate.
In the suit, PaineWebber alleges that Mr Canter and Mr Zikry, along with Mr
Thomas Goepfert, another senior MHII officer who left to join Kleinwort,
recruited other MHII employees while still at the firm and used confidential
and proprietary client information, including investment objectives and fee
structures, to solicit MHII clients.
PaineWebber also says that the executives undertook a mass solicitation of
MHII clients one day after they resigned from MHII, and persuaded other MHII
staff to leave the firm and join Kleinwort.
In London late yesterday the UK bank said that it had not yet received
notification of the lawsuit. But Mr Lesley Knox, chairman of Kleinwort's US
money management subsidiary, said the accusations outlined in press reports
of the impending legal action were 'totally unfounded'.
In New York meanwhile, PaineWebber was playing down the significance of the
staff departures at MHII - in total, 10 people left the firm - while still
angrily decrying the actions of the three executives who left for Kleinwort.
Ms Joyce Fensterstock, president of PaineWebber's mutual fund unit and the
executive who has taken over as president of MHII, said that only one client
had removed its account from the firm because of the uncertainty surrounding
the defections.
She was confident the client would return, but said she may lose others: 'We
will lose some accounts because when there's this kind of upheaval . . .
some people use it as an excuse to move their money.'
PaineWebber insisted that the financial impact of the defections would be
minimal. The fixed income unit where the departed executives worked manages
Dollars 4bn of assets and generated revenues of almost Dollars 8m last year,
out of a total of more than Dollars 300m in recurring fee revenues generated
at the PaineWebber group.

VITRO, the leading Mexican glass company, reported net profits of 197m new
pesos (Dollars 65m) in the first quarter, 5.2 per cent less in real terms
than the same period last year, writes Damian Fraser.
Vitro was mainly affected by higher interest rates on its peso debt, with
the cost of financing more than doubling over the year from 64m to 130m new
pesos.
Operating income reached 343m pesos, 7.2 per cent more in real terms more
than the first quarter of 1992, while sales were up 6.6 per cent to 2.57bn
pesos.
Mr Ernesto Martens, chief executive, said the state of the US glass
container market affected the results of Anchor Glass, Vitro's US subsidiary
while the glassware operations in Mexico were hit by imports from Asia and
Europe.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Kaiser Aluminum turns in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KAISER Aluminum, the US integrated aluminium company that is 87 per cent
held by the natural resource company Maxxam, reported its first quarterly
loss in six years.
Earnings were battered by the deterioration in world aluminium prices and
production cuts brought on by electric power cuts at Kaiser's plants in the
US Pacific northwest.
The company recorded a first quarter loss of Dollars 16.6m, or 29 cents a
share, before the inclusion of special accounting charges. This compares
with income of Dollars 8.4m, or 15 cents, in the first quarter of 1992.
In the latest first quarter, Kaiser took an extraordinary loss of Dollars
21.8m to retire and reschedule debt.
Kaiser's sales for the quarter were Dollars 442.6m, down from Dollars 463.7m
last year. The company shipped 166,100 tonnes of primary and fabricated
aluminium products, compared with 176,500 in 1992.
Largely as a result of Kaiser's loss and operating deficits in its real
estate business, Maxxam said it recorded a loss of Dollars 25.9m, or Dollars
2.74 a share, in the first quarter, exclusive of special accounting charges.
That compares with net income of Dollars 900,000 or 10 cents in the first
quarter of 1992. Maxxam had first quarter sales of Dollars 513.7m, down from
Dollars 529.5 last year.
Separately, Asarco, the integrated US copper producer, announced it was
cutting its dividend by half after reporting continuing losses. The company
will reduce its June 1 dividend from 20 cents per share, to 10 cents. That
is its lowest payout since 1987.
Asarco, earlier this week reported a first-quarter loss of Dollars 31m or 74
cents a share.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROTHSCHILD group of the UK has been given permission to open a financial
advisory company in Mexico, making it the first foreign investment bank to
win such authority.
The holding company of NM Rothschild, with the Chilean bank BICE, and
Mexican partners, have been granted authorisation to open Rothschild Mexico,
a financial boutique that will advise Mexican companies on corporate finance
issues, such as mergers and acquisitions, privatisations, project finance,
and international equity offerings.
Under Mexican law foreigners cannot own a bank or brokerage, although this
will be changed when and if the North American Free Trade Agreement is
implemented.
Until now foreign investment banks, like Rothschild, have had to make do
with representative offices, from which they can offer off-shore the full
range of corporate finance advice, but cannot be incorporated under Mexican
law.
Rothschild's new status, says Mr Charles Alexander, the head of Latin
America for NM Rothschild, would make a colossal difference.
'We will be able to compete in Mexico without worrying about the regulatory
environment,' he said.
The company expects to expand on-shore business significantly in Mexico as a
result.
The corporate finance business in Mexico is booming, as companies seek
foreign capital and foreign partners to improve competitiveness before the
proposed North American Free Trade Agreement comes into force.
So far American banks - such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs - have won the
lion's share of the business.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: BNL seeks new partner and
L3,000bn injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCA NAZIONALE del Lavoro, the Italian Treasury-controlled bank, needs to
raise L3,000bn (Dollars 2bn) in fresh capital and in the absence of
additional state funds is looking for a new partner.
Mr Gianpiero Cantoni, chairman, speaking after the board approved the 1992
accounts, said the capital injection was not 'to cover losses but to develop
BNL's mission as a universal bank'. BNL has been weakened by the scandal
over Dollars 4bn in loans made by the bank's Atlanta branch to Iraq.
Last July, when it was converted into a public company with the Treasury
holding a 57 per cent stake, the government estimated BNL needed L2,000bn in
fresh funds. The Treasury as well as its other main shareholder, INA, the
state insurance institute in line for privatisation, made it clear no public
funds were available.
BNL has been looking for an outside partner, but the authorities are
considering first an Italian alliance.
For 1992, the bank raised net earnings 5 per cent to L78bn. Gross profit
before depreciation and provisions rose to L1,419bn from L1,204bn. As in
1991, the gap between net and gross earnings is explained by the need to set
aside depreciation charges and provisions totalling L1,839bn.
Mr Cantoni said BNL was awaiting the outcome of legal developments in the US
over the BNL-Atlanta affair and the trial of Mr Christopher Droghoul, former
branch manager, to see how much of the Dollars 350m credit guaranteed by the
CCC, the US credit guarantee body, could be recovered.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: DeGroote agrees to CDollars 23m
penalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL DeGroote, former chief executive and controlling shareholder of
Laidlaw, the Canadian waste services group, has been barred from trading
securities for five years and has agreed to a substantial financial payment
in settlement of insider trading allegations.
The Ontario Securities Commission said Mr DeGroote, his business associate
Mr Henri Herbots, and Seakist Overseas, a Channel Islands company, had
agreed to pay a total of CDollars 23m (USDollars 18m).
The bulk of the money will be distributed among Laidlaw shareholders as
compensation for losses they suffered in early 1991 when the company's
shares were driven down by heavy short-selling, much of it initiated by
Seakist.
In addition, Mr Keith Walker, a stockbroker employed by Midland Walwyn of
Toronto, who handled Seakist's account, will surrender his broker's licence.
The insider trading allegations relate to a period shortly after Mr DeGroote
stepped down at Laidlaw. Mr DeGroote provided a CDollars 27m loan to Seakist
to finance short sales of about 3m Laidlaw shares.
Within a few weeks of the short sales, Laidlaw announced a sharp drop in
revenues and earnings. Seakist then covered its short positions, earning a
gross profit of about CDollars 16.5m.
The OSC alleged Mr DeGroote knew that Laidlaw's earnings would be lower than
earlier forecasts, and he was aware of mounting tensions between the company
and ADT, the international security systems and car auction group in which
Laidlaw is the largest single shareholder.
Mr DeGroote has insisted that he had no material undisclosed information
about Laidlaw. His lawyer said that the loan to Seakist was not illegal, but
that Mr DeGroote 'is tarnished by an error of judgment that will continue to
haunt him'.
Mr DeGroote has accepted the settlement to avoid a 'lengthy, intensive and
emotionally draining' hearing. The others involved in the case did not
dispute the OSC's charges. Mr DeGroote, who now lives in Bermuda,
spearheaded Laidlaw's growth from a small Ontario trucking company into one
of North America's largest waste services and school bus operators.
The insider-trading allegations are not the first controversy over Mr
DeGroote's departure from Laidlaw. He sold his Laidlaw shares to Canadian
Pacific near the peak of the market and shortly after leaving, started a new
waste-management firm.

Domtar's fine paper mills continued to gain in efficiency and the lower

First-quarter net loss was CDollars 35m (USDollars 27m), or 28 cents a

shares were outstanding in the latest period. Sales were CDollars 460m, up 2

DE DIETRICH, the French engineering group, yesterday confirmed that net
profits had fallen sharply from FFr130.6m in 1991 to FFr85m (Dollars 16m) in
1992 and announced plans to pay a preferential dividend to long-term
investors.
The payment of preferential dividends, which is intended to encourage
investors to take long-term holdings in companies, is a topical issue in the
French corporate sector following the announcement earlier this week that
the finance ministry was forming a working party to assess the subject.
De Dietrich is one of the first companies to declare its interest in
adopting a preferential dividend scheme since the ministry's announcement.
SEB, the industrial group, on Wednesday said it planned to adopt a
preferential dividend policy.

WANG Laboratories, the US office computer systems company attempting to
emerge from bankruptcy proceedings, reported third-quarter net losses of
Dollars 87.2m, or 51 cents a share. These included estimated restructuring
charges of Dollars 75.8m related to a reorganisation plan.
Last year there was a first-quarter loss of Dollars 6.3m or 4 cents, when
Wang recorded a pre-tax gain of Dollars 29.4m from asset sales and changes
in its US pension plan.
Last month, Wang filed a restructuring plan with the bankruptcy court
describing its plans to end manufacturing operations and transform itself
into a software and services company.
For the nine-month period, the net loss was Dollars 153.4m or 90 cents a
share, against a net loss of Dollars 22.9m or 14 cents for the same period
last year.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: UAL registers deficit of Dollars
138m in first quarter

<TEXT>
UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, one of the big three US
carriers, yesterday reported a loss of Dollars 138m for the first quarter of
1993, compared with an underlying deficit of Dollars 108m in the same period
of 1992.
United also said it had agreed with Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer, to
slow its delivery schedule for A-320 aircraft and to retire other aircraft
on an accelerated basis as the A-320s enter the fleet.
Both the first-quarter losses were stuck before accounting-related changes
and extraordinary items; after these items the 1993 loss stands at Dollars
157m, against a Dollars 648m deficit in the previous year.
But at the operating level the airline said that there was a small
improvement, with the loss narrowing from Dollars 168m to Dollars 121m.
Total revenues improved by 12.1 per cent to Dollars 3.33bn, while operating
expenses increased only 10 per cent to Dollars 3.45bn.
Mr Stephen Wolf, UAL's chairman, said the group's cost reduction programme
had helped the comparisons, but added: 'We continued to move forward with
plans to reduce further our costs by making structural changes to the
company.'
UAL shares took the news badly, falling Dollars 4 7/8 to close at Dollars
140 5/8 .
As for the Airbus deliveries, UAL said 14 of the 29 A-320s scheduled to be
delivered in 1995 and 1996 would be rescheduled for the 1997-1998 period.
However, the 21 aircraft due to be delivered in 1993 and 1994 would be taken
as planned.
The aircraft which are due to retired on an accelerated basis include
McDonnell Douglas DC-10s, Boeing 747s, and Boeing 727s.
The group's results virtually end the airline industry's reporting season -
in which results have been mixed.
A couple of carriers - like American Airlines and USAir - generally pleased
the market, giving it grounds for believing that profitability may be in
sight.
However, results from UAL and Delta have painted a less encouraging picture.

dividend

COMINCO, the Canadian base metals group buffetted by a series of setbacks in
recent years, has suspended its semi-annual dividend.
The Vancouver-based company also said yesterday that it plans to seek
financial compensation from Lurgi, the German engineering firm, for a
disastrous investment in a CDollars 160m (USDollars 126m) lead smelter at
Trail, British Columbia.
The smelter, which uses technology supplied by Lurgi, has been idle since
shortly after it was commissioned in late-1989.
Mr Norman Keevil, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday that Cominco
now expects to spend CDollars 100m to modify the smelter. He said the
facility will probably be converted from Lurgi's QSL process to the Kivcet
technology developed in Kazakhstan.
Mr Keevil said that tests have shown that the Kivcet process 'has the
reduction capacity and availability that we need at Trail'.
Cominco paid a semi-annual dividend of 15 Canadian cents a share last
December. It suffered a loss of CDollars 30.2m last year following a
CDollars 41.3m setback in 1991.
Cominco has also struggled to achieve full production at its new Red Dog
zinc mine in Alaska, and has been hit by falling metal prices.

SOTHEBY'S Holdings, parent of Sotheby's worldwide auction, finance and real
estate operations, incurred a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 5.2m or 9
cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 5.7m or 11 cents a year
earlier, Reuters reports from New York.
The company said the results represented a 9 per cent improvement over the
same period last year. Sotheby's said the first and third quarters were
generally loss periods, as at least 80 per cent of auction sales took place
in the second and fourth quarters.
Auction sales for the quarter fell to Dollars 129.6m from Dollars 141.4m in
1992.
This was due mainly to currency movements, as well as a large sale by a
single owner in Monaco in 1992, which had no equivalent the first quarter of
1993.
The jewellery sale in St Moritz totalled Dollars 23.9m, the highest result
achieved there, the company said.
The jewellery market continued its strong performance into the second
quarter when the New York sale generated Dollars 19.8m.

INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, has thrown more legal
hurdles in the path of Advanced Micro Devices, a rival Silicon Valley chip
maker that last week began shipments of its own version of Intel's top
selling 486 microprocessor chip.
Intel said it had filed a new copyright infringement suit against AMD,
continuing a seven-year litigation feud between the two companies over
intellectual property rights.
AMD's entry into the 486 market last week followed a judge's decision
setting aside a jury verdict favourable to Intel in a related copyright
licensing dispute. The judge ruled that a new trial should be held because
Intel had failed to produce documents that could have been relevant to AMD's
case. Intel said yesterday it had asked the judge to reconsider his
decision.
Separately, in another legal dispute, Intel said Cyrix, a small
semiconductor company that makes clones of Intel's microprocessors, was
denied a preliminary injunction that would have prevented Intel from making
patent infringement claims against Cyrix's customers.

INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, has thrown more legal
hurdles in the path of Advanced Micro Devices, a rival Silicon Valley chip
maker that last week began shipments of its own version of Intel's top
selling 486 microprocessor chip.
Intel said it had filed a new copyright infringement suit against AMD,
continuing a seven-year litigation feud between the two companies over
intellectual property rights.
AMD said that Intel's latest lawsuit was not unexpected.
AMD's entry into the 486 market last week followed a judge's decision
setting aside a jury verdict favourable to Intel in a related copyright
licensing dispute. The judge ruled that a new trial should be held because
Intel had failed to produce documents that could have been relevant to AMD's
case.
Intel said yesterday it had asked the judge to reconsider his decision.
Separately, in another legal dispute with a competitor, Intel said Cyrix, a
small semiconductor company that makes clones of Intel's microprocessors,
was denied a preliminary injunction that would have prevented Intel from
making patent infringement claims against Cyrix's customers.
Intel claimed it held patents covering the design of personal computers that
run the popular Microsoft Windows operating system.
It maintained that by selling clones of its microprocessors, Cyrix was
encouraging its customers to infringe on these patents.
Cyrix charged that Intel was harassing its customers. AMD has filed an
identical suit against Intel in a Texas court. That case has yet to go to
trial, but the decision in the Cyrix case could make potential AMD customers
wary of becoming entangled in the Intel-AMD legal battle.
Intel said it was seeking royalty payments from Cyrix and AMD customers,
rather than threatening law suits.

<TEXT>
LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez is in no hurry to sell its 68 per cent voting
interest in United Westburne, now that the North American plumbing, heating
and electrical goods wholesaler is benefiting from a strengthening US
economy, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
'We have stated our intention to divest, but there is no particular haste,'
said Mr Guy de Panafieu, a senior Lyonnaise vice-president, after the United
Westburne annual meeting.
The Montreal-based wholesaler hopes to become profitable again over the next
18 months. The group operates 21 divisions and 390 branches with 6,000
employees after being restructured to deal with the recession and
construction slump. About 25 per cent of annual sales of more than CDollars
2bn (USDollars 1.57bn) are made in the US, mainly in California.
Mr de Panafieu said it would be logical for the control block in Westburne
to be sold to a single shareholder rather than through a wide public
distribution. But Lyonnaise would not object to a management buy-out.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: De Dietrich plans to pay
preferential dividend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DE DIETRICH, the French engineering group, yesterday confirmed that net
profits had fallen sharply from FFr130.6m in 1991 to FFr85m (Dollars 16m) in
1992 and announced plans to pay a preferential dividend to long-term
investors.
The payment of preferential dividends, which is intended to encourage
investors to take long-term holdings in companies, is a topical issue in the
French corporate sector following the announcement earlier this week that
the finance ministry was forming a working party to assess the subject.
De Dietrich is one of the first companies to declare its interest in
adopting a preferential dividend scheme since the ministry's announcement.
SEB, the industrial group, on Wednesday said it planned to adopt a
preferential dividend policy.
The De Dietrich board has decided to hold its 1992 dividend at FFr45,
following a difficult year. Turnover rose from FFr3.35bn in 1991 to
FFr3.78bn in 1992, due to the addition of Cogifer, and operating profits
increased from FFr181m to FFr193m but net profits still fell.
So far 1993 has been another chastening period with turnover falling by 6.5
per cent in the first quarter to FFr849.3m.
Club Mediterranee, the French leisure group, is on course for a gruelling
year, according to Mr Gibert Trigano, chairman, who yesterday told a
shareholders' meeting that 1993 would be 'very strained'. Club Med returned
to the black with a net profit of FFr161m in 1992 after a FFr17.3m loss in
1991.

<TEXT>
JOHNSON &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare group, yesterday unveiled a plan to buy
back up to Dollars 500m of its outstanding common stock and raised its
quarterly dividend by 13 per cent.
Mr Ralph Larsen, chairman and chief executive, said the share repurchase
programme was for general corporate purposes.
'We believe that Johnson &amp; Johnson's current stock price level reflects the
uncertainty in the US marketplace for health care stocks, rather than the
market's perception of our deep product pipeline and our prospects for
future growth,' he added.
On Wall Street, shares in the company were unchanged at Dollars 42 5/8 at
mid-session.
The news prompted Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, to affirm its
triple-A long-term debt ratings on the company. S&amp;P said its
well-established positions in diverse health-care markets would provide the
financial strength to complete the share repurchase programme without
affecting credit quality.
The dividend increase, to 26 cents a share from 23 cents, represents the
29th consecutive year of higher dividends on the stock.
The company also posted net income yesterday of Dollars 503m, or 77 cents a
share, for the first quarter of 1993 on sales of Dollars 3.56bn.
A year earlier, Johnson &amp; Johnson had underlying earnings of Dollars 452m,
or 68 cents, on sales of Dollars 3.36bn. Charges of Dollars 595m for
changing accounting standards contributed to a 1992 first-quarter deficit of
Dollars 143m, or 22 cents.
Domestic pharmaceutical sales rose 11 per cent in the latest quarter, led by
recently introduced products, such as its Ortho-cept oral contraceptive and
Leustatin, a drug that treats hairy cell leukaemia.
But more restrictive labelling reduced sales of Hismanal, a once-a-day
antihistamine. Sales of Tolectin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug,
also fell. The drug went off patent in 1992.
US consumer sales were flat, but international consumer sales rose 8.1 per
cent.

<TEXT>
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit dwindled to Fl 6m (Dollars
3.4m) in the first quarter of 1993 from Fl 100m in the same quarter of 1992.
Recession in Europe and particularly in Germany led to a decline in demand
for caprolactum, a feedstock for nylon, while industry-wide overcapacity
forced down the price of ethylene and its down-stream derivatives.
Another negative factor was the strength of the guilder compared with other
currencies. At the same time, financial expenses rose by Fl 5m to Fl 37m as
a result of additional loans taken on in 1992.
Sales in the first quarter were down 14 per cent at Fl 2.1bn under the
combined influence of reduced prices, lower sales by volume, currency
effects and divestments.
DSM said it had faced the roughly the same situation in the 1993 quarter as
it did in the final 1992 quarter, with a deepening recession in Europe
outweighing faint signs of recovery in the US.

OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office equipment group, yesterday said
Digital Equipment, the US computers company, is to raise its shareholding
ahead of schedule despite the Italian company's bleak financial outlook.
Digital will bring forward to May the next step in its three-stage plan to
buy almost 10 per cent of Olivetti, agreed last June.
The original deal, which saw the US group buying an opening 4.03 per cent of
Olivetti when the accord was signed, envisaged that the final tranche would
be acquired from the pool of shareholders which control Olivetti by the end
of 1994. Digital also agreed to purchase 1.89 per cent of Olivetti's stock
on the stock market by the end of June this year.
Olivetti confirmed it had lost L649.9bn (Dollars 445m) last year on sales
which fell by 6.8 per cent to L8,025bn. Despite persistent pressure on
prices, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman, told shareholders yesterday that
Olivetti should break even at the operating level, before extraordinary
items, this year and return to profit next year.
But he added that the 'very turbulent' market conditions made precise
predictions impossible.
Mr De Benedetti did not say when the group, again passing its dividend,
would restore its payout to shareholders.
Sales in the first quarter of this year rose by 5.5 per cent, against the
same period in 1992, with sharp volume rises for personal computers and
printers. Moreover, Olivetti's most powerful personal computers had
accounted for a higher proportion of sales than the previous year.
But the company gave no absolute figures for its sales and Mr De Benedetti
did not clarify whether the first-quarter turnover figure had been adjusted
for currency factors. Olivetti exports a large proportion of its sales, and
foreign revenues are likely to be swollen this year by the sharp fall in the
lira's value.
Shareholders at Olivetti's annual general meeting approved the its L903bn
capital increase, comprising a rights issue and a convertible bond, proposed
in March. Mr De Benedetti shed no further light on the destination of the
funds, but confirmed Digital would take up its full entitlement in shares,
not bonds.

IBUSZ, Hungary's largest travel agency and the first east European company
to go public, suffered a Ft1.745bn (Dollars 20m) consolidated loss in 1992
after breaking even the year before.
The size of the deficit caused the company's shares to slip Ft100 yesterday
on the Budapest stock exchange to end the day at Ft800.
This compares with the Ft4,900 price at which Ibusz shares were offered in
1990 in the first stock market flotation in a former communist country. The
fall has wiped out the bulk of the investment made by the western
institutions which own most of the travel agency.
Mr Eric Bedo, newly-appointed financial director, blamed the share price
collapse on the overly high expectations which had surrounded Ibusz at the
time of its flotation in 1990.
Ibusz said that its core tourism business suffered from a decline in traffic
last year, partly because of the war in former Yugoslavia.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Nabisco set to buy Royal Brands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO is poised to re-enter the European food sector with the
Pta34.5bn (Dollars 297m) acquisition of Royal Brands, the food and
agricultural division of Tabacalera, Spain's state-controlled tobacco
company.
The Nabisco bid, which requires approval by the Spanish cabinet, was
preferred by the Tabacalera board over a rival offer from United Biscuits of
Britain and an unnamed partner.
UB would not disclose the value of its offer, but said that it was 'not
significantly different' from Nabisco's.
Royal Brands, which earned net profits of Pta2.7bn on Pta27bn sales last
year, owns Artiach, Spain's leading biscuit producer, and Royal, the
country's biggest baking powder and home-made desserts company. Nabisco is
believed to have promised to maintain Carcesa, a formerly state-owned Royal
Brands canning subsidiary.
The US company sold its extensive European food businesses in the late 1980s
to pay off debt raised to finance a Dollars 26bn leveraged buy-out. The
businesses included Spanish assets which were sold to Tabacalera and now
form the core of Royal Brands.
It is unclear whether the deal presages further European acquisitions by
Nabisco. Analysts believe the company's cash-flow is likely to be
substantially reduced by the recent US price war in cigarettes and point out
that most of the best European acquisition candidates in biscuits, Nabisco's
main food business, have already been bought.
The sale will realise net capital gains for Tabacalera of Pta9bn, almost as
much as the Pta10.8bn net profits that the group is forecast to declare this
year, and will help cut Tabacalera's Pta45bn consolidated debt.

<TEXT>
AMER GROUP, the Finnish consumer goods group which includes Wilson Sporting
Goods in the US, bounced back into the black last year. It reported a
profit, after financing costs, of FM93m (Dollars 17.2m) for the year to the
end of February, compared with a loss of FM35m in the previous year.
Net group sales of FM7bn were up only a fraction from FM6.96m, but increased
sales and profitability overseas, particularly in the sporting goods
division, helped strengthen the group result in spite continued recession in
the home market.
Sporting goods sales rose 18 per cent to FM2.9bn. The vast majority of this
 -FM2.7bn - was accounted for by Wilson, which saw sales growth of 4 per
cent in dollar terms and 18 per cent in markka terms, as demand grew for its
racquets, golf equipment and team sports goods.
By contrast, Korpivaara Companies, Amer's vehicle importing division in
Finland, saw sales fall by 10 per cent to FM1.67bn as new car sales in
Finland declined for the third year in succession.
There was an 11 per cent fall in sales at the paper division, to FM1.43bn,
and a 4 per cent fall in the tobacco arm to FM569m. Publishing and printing
rose 18 per cent to FM463m.
Amer predicted net sales for the 1993-94 full year of FM7.5bn, with overseas
sales accounting for 70 per cent of the total, compared with 62 per cent
last year. It said profits would improve.
Earnings per share were FM2.80 in the year to the end of February, compared
with a loss of FM1.80 in 1991-92. The dividend was unchanged at FM2 per
share.
Amer, traded on the London Stock Exchange since January following changes in
Finnish law to allow foreign ownership of Finnish shares, said 25 per cent
of the group's outstanding shares were now owned by foreigners.

FLUGHAFEN WIEN, operator of Vienna airport, has reported a 36 per cent jump
in consolidated net income last year to Sch554m (Dollars 49.6m).
However, the Austrian state-controlled group, 27 per cent of whose shares
were floated in international equity markets last June, forecast a slowdown
in growth this year because of the worldwide recession and intensifying
competition in Europe.
Revenues last year were up 17 per cent to Sch2.88bn and operating profits
jumped 46 per cent to Sch677m.
Passenger numbers rose 16.5 per cent to 6.8m last year, flight movements
rose 10.6 per cent to 107,000 and maximum take-off weight, on which airport
fees are based, rose 11.9 per cent to 3.4m tonnes.

FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: RJR warns on impact of cigarette
price war in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the US tobacco and food group, warned yesterday that profits
this year from its domestic cigarette business - which accounts for more
than half of group operating profits - would be hit by the looming cigarette
price-war in the US.
Additional marketing and promotional investments would have a negative
effect on full-year 1993 results, 'although it is still too early to
determine the degree of impact', the group said.
The price war began when Philip Morris, RJR's US rival, said it would cut
the price of its flagship Marlboro brand by Dollars 4 a carton, or 40 cents
a packet. Earlier this week, RJR revealed plans to match this cut on its
Winston brand - its leading full-priced brand, and the one that competes
most closely with Marlboro - with some other promotional activity applied to
its Camel brand.
RJR's cuts would apply in June, and be reviewed at the end of that month.
The company has already amended a 'targeted stock scheme' - designed to
create two separate classes of stock pegged to the tobacco and food
divisions respectively - because of the uncertainty hanging over its tobacco
division's profitability.
The warning came as RJR announced first-quarter profits of Dollars 163m
after tax, compared with a loss of Dollars 15m in the same period of 1992.
Most of the advance was due to lower interest costs, however, and operating
income increased only marginally from Dollars 664m to Dollars 683m.
The domestic tobacco division saw slightly lower profits at Dollars 500m
(Dollars 512m), while international operations advanced from Dollars 139m To
Dollars 159m. The fall in domestic tobacco profits reflected higher unit
volume - up 9 per cent - but more sales coming from less profitable
'discount' brands.
On the food side, RJR saw operating profits increase from Dollars 189m to
Dollars 203m, on sales up from Dollars 1.54bn to Dollars 1.63bn. Group sales
in the first quarter were Dollars 3.74bn, compared with Dollars 3.64bn in
the same period of 1992.
Mr Michael Miles, chairman of Philip Morris, told the group's annual meeting
yesterday that if the 40 cents a packet price cut was not enough to regain
the ground that full-priced brands have lost to discount cigarettes, 'we are
prepared to go beyond that if we have to protect our brand franchise'.
However, he was upbeat about long-term prospects, and indicated that a
dividend increase might be forthcoming in August.

<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals group, is heading for a further profits fall this
year after a 41 per cent slump to DM1.24bn (Dollars 781m) last time. Pre-tax
earnings in the first quarter slumped 50 per cent to DM238m, the company
said in an interim report yesterday.
Orders on hand at the parent company at the end of March were 14 per cent
lower than a year earlier, Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman, told the annual
meeting. 'We are no longer counting on being able to reach last year's
profits level,' he added.
In 1992 the parent provided 90 per cent of group pre-tax earnings.
BASF's progress report, following news earlier this week that Hoechst's
first-quarter earnings were down 28 per cent and profits at Bayer had fallen
21 per cent, compounded the gloomy mood in the German chemicals sector.
Its figures confirmed the dramatic effect of cost-cutting reforms in the
German health service and the domestic recession, which have exacerbated
difficulties in international markets caused by over-capacity, low prices
and setbacks in agricultural markets.
'Incoming orders and orders on hand are stagnating at a comparatively low
level. There is no sign of a fundamental change for the rest of the year,'
the interim report said.
Approval of new investment projects was lower than last year, although
spending was continuing as planned on building up plant in Antwerp and
Schwarzheide in eastern Germany, and the extension of a natural gas
pipeline.
Total capital spending was down almost 7 per cent in the quarter. Group
sales fell 7 per cent to DM11bn while domestic turnover at the German parent
dropped 20 per cent.
The company, which shed 4,600 workers in the 12 months to the end of March,
reported satisfactory developments in speciality and fine chemicals, and
said it had increased deliveries of polypropylene in Europe and of technical
plastics in north America.
Parts of its plastics and fibres businesses had suffered considerable
turnover falls, and prices were still unsatisfactory. Paints had been hit by
the sharp decline in the European automotive industry, and the troubled
recording tapes business was still making losses, although within the
group's range of expectations.
Pre-tax profits at Bayer, the German chemicals company, fell 21.2 per cent
during the first three months. This was incorrectly reported in a headline
in yesterday's Financial Times.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MERIVALE Moore, the property company, cut pre-tax losses in the six months
to December 31 from Pounds 1.68m to Pounds 747,000.
The shares advanced 10p to 49p, a new high for the year.
Mr Grenville Dean, chairman, said: 'These figures, whilst no cause for
euphoria in themselves, suggest that the blood letting has been arrested and
that the company has commenced its recovery.'
For the rest of the year he said shareholders could look forward to much
better news as a result of the Pounds 5m settlement of its claims for
damages concerning the collapse of a building and improved trading
conditions.
Turnover for the six months was Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 12.2m). The pre-tax
result was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 4.08m).
Losses per share were 3.66p (7.9p).
The interim dividend is omitted - 1p was paid previously but the final was
passed.

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons tumbles to Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPKINSONS Group saw profits tumble from Pounds 5.16m to Pounds 2.06m
pre-tax over the 12 months to January 31 leading the Huddersfield-based
abrasives, plastic products and gas control equipment company to cut its
dividend.
The shares fell 4p to 40p.
Profits were struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 600,000 (Pounds
900,000) to cover redundancies at the Bryan Donkin engineering operation
which was hit by the decision by British Gas, its largest customer, to
reduce capital spending.
The figures marked the first full year's inclusion of Carbo, the industrial
abrasives group acquired for some Pounds 31m in 1991. The move wiped out
Hopkinsons' cash pile and led to a turnround from interest income of Pounds
1.46m to payable of Pounds 1.13m.
Net borrowings amounted to Pounds 12.8m at the year-end, giving gearing of
38 per cent. Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 2.8m in a
'closely-controlled investment programme' according to Mr Bill Goodall,
chairman.
Group turnover amounted to Pounds 102.5m (Pounds 59.4m including Carbo for
four months). After a 49 per cent tax charge earnings per share fell from
4.57p to 1.31p; the proposed final dividend is cut to 0.4p (2.5p) for a
total of 1.3p (3.7p).
Mr Goodall said the group had been hit by the impact of 'deepening
industrial recession' on the abrasives business.
Current trading was about the same level as in the second half of last year,
he added, with the exception of Germany which was 'particularly affected by
the recession'.

Molyneux Estates, the USM-quoted property investment group, reported
increased losses before tax of Pounds 245,000 for the six months to December

of Pounds 222,000.

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: SE looks at small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange yesterday announced a 16-person working party with
a wide brief to look at all aspects of how small companies raise capital.
The group has been assembled following the decision last month to keep alive
the Unlisted Securities Market for smaller companies for a short period,
rather than close it this year.
The group has been asked to 'define the scope of the financing problem,
assess potential investor interest and recommend whether or not an
alternative market is the right solution,' the Exchange said.
It will be headed by Mr Ian Macpherson, a member of the Exchange's board and
chairman of Low &amp; Bonar and Watson &amp; Philip, both listed companies.
It includes a number of members of the City Group for Smaller Companies, a
pressure group of financiers, brokers and others whose efforts have been
instrumental in persuading the Exchange not to close the USM immediately.
Mr Macpherson said that his group would look at all aspects of capital
raising by small companies.

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown finance director resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN HOLDINGS, the food group, has lost the finance director it
appointed only last June.
Mr Simon Moffat resigned because his appointment 'has not worked out as
envisaged by either side', the company said yesterday.
He is expected to receive compensation but the amount has yet to be agreed.
Sir John Nott, who yesterday took over as chairman from Sir Harry Solomon,
told shareholders of the departure at yesterday's annual general meeting.
Mr Moffat is being replaced by Mr Ray Mackie who joined the group in January
as corporate affairs director.
He came from KPMG Peat Marwick, the group's auditors, where he was corporate
finance partner.
Sir John refused to elaborate on the reasons for Mr Moffat's departure, but
suggestions were that the personal chemistry had not worked out.
Sir John also told shareholders that 'the current year has started
reasonably well for the company. Trading is up to our expectations'.
Analysts are forecasting a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 154.1m to
about Pounds 170m-Pounds 175m. Sir John said it was too early to make firm
predictions but he was confident over prospects.
After the meeting Sir John said the sharp increases in input costs following
sterling's fall last autumn were now beginning to settle down.
He said that the group had decided not to float its housebuilding business
this year after all.
The division was doing well and its earnings and cashflow were more
important to the group than the funds which might be raised from a
flotation, he added.
Similarly, sales of parts of the furniture division might be delayed as the
business was performing well.
However, other asset disposals were progressing, he said.
A number of shareholders thanked Sir Harry for his contribution to the group
which he co-founded in 1975.
He remains a non-executive director. Sir John said that Hillsdown had been
through a period of difficult trading but nevertheless under Sir Harry's
leadership profits had risen from Pounds 1m in 1980 to over Pounds 150m in
1992.

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Kwik Save mounts advance to Pounds 61m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KWIK SAVE, Britain's largest discount grocery retailer, yesterday reported a
19.1 per cent increase to Pounds 61m in interim pre-tax profits despite
growing competition.
However, the group cautioned that it did not expect to maintain this level
of growth against a comparatively stronger second half last year.
Earnings per share of 26.5p for the 28 weeks to March 13 were 18.9 per cent
ahead of the 22.29p recorded a year earlier.
The interim dividend is increased 15 per cent to 5.4p (4.7p).
Mr Graeme Seabrook, the chief executive who is leaving next month to become
managing director of Dairy Farm International, the Hong Kong-based group
which owns 28 per cent of Kwik Save, said the results demonstrated the
continued success of the group's 'no-nonsense' approach to food retailing.
He will be replaced by Mr Graeme Bowler who has been running Franklins,
Dairy Farm's wholly owned Australian subsidiary.
Yesterday, Mr Seabrook acknowledged the growing competition in the discount
grocery sector but brushed aside suggestions that Kwik Save's margins could
come under increasing pressure.
He said the group had continued to make 'substantial gains' in market share
in a strongly competitive environment and was continuing to reduce overheads
as a percentage of sales, in part by investing heavily in new technology.
Sales, including VAT, grew 14.3 per cent in the first half to Pounds 1.49bn
(Pounds 1.31bn). Underlying volume from like-for-like sales rose 8 per cent,
while the 35 new stores opened during the period added 6 per cent.
The group operates more than 788 stores and its recently accelerated
expansion plans call for opening at least one new store a week, including
its first in Scotland. It has also recently launched a range of own-label No
Frills generic products which will be sold alongside discounted branded
groceries in all its stores.
Drinks and tobacco, sold through the Liquorsave off-licence chain, increased
slightly as a percentage of total sales and represented about 23 per cent of
the total mix.
Overall, grocery sales rose 13.4 per cent while lower-margin liquor sales
increased 18.7 per cent. Mr Seabrook said grocery margins were consistent
with the previous year and liquor/tobacco margins slightly improved.
Operating profit increased 16.3 per cent to Pounds 61.4m (Pounds 52.8m),
including Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.6m) of rental income mostly derived from
in-store concessions.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 1.6m) and the group ended
the period with net cash balances of Pounds 25.9m. The group expects to
maintain a low level of underlying borrowings.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
based producer of power transmission equipment, industrial conveyor belting
and fluid power products, which has seen its profits slide over the past few
years yesterday responded to the recent sharp rise in its share price by
confirming takeover interest in the company.
Fenner said it had 'received indications of interest which might or might
not lead to an offer being made' for the company. The shares have risen from
65p over the past week and yesterday closed 1p higher at 85p following the
company's statement. At this level the group is valued at Pounds 37m.
The statement immediately increased speculation that Wassall, the
mini-conglomerate which acquired a 1.6 per cent stake last June, might be
preparing a bid. Mr Chris Miller, Wassall's chief executive, would not
comment yesterday.
Mr Mark Abrahams, Fenner's finance director, said the statement was made in
the interests of shareholders, and without any acceptance or denial of the
speculation about Wassall.
The announcement raises the prospect of a bid for a company which has
recently been going through a difficult period. Over the last three years
pre - tax profits have fallen from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 5.5m in 1991 - 92.
In February Mr Tom Brown resigned as managing director and on March 26
Fenner said it expected to report an attributable loss for the six months to
February 28.

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Plateau spurns Kingstream offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KINGSTREAM Resources, the small Australian exploration company which has
made a hostile bid for Plateau Mining, the former UK natural resources
company that is now a shell, virtually doubled the terms of its all-share
offer to Pounds 2.37m yesterday but was met with immediate rejection.
Mr Donald Driver, Plateau's chairman, said the bid continued to be 'without
merit'. He added: 'Plateau shareholders are concerned about the quality, not
the quantity, of Kingstream's shares.'
He pointed out that Kingstream's latest accounts were heavily qualified by
its auditors on the grounds of a deficiency of working capital. 'This was in
spite of Kingstream borrowing money from its shareholders and pledging
certain of its major assets as security. I can see no merit in anybody
accepting shares of this doubtful value.'
Mr Driver said Kingstream's shares had dropped by more than 15 per cent
since the first offer on April 13.
Kingstream said it was increasing its offer to three of its ordinary shares
for every 10 Plateau ordinary to take account of the increased value of the
UK company following the agreement for Plateau to sell its interest in the
Mhondoro joint venture in Zimbabwe to Delta Gold for shares worth more than
Pounds 1.5m.
Kingstream said the new offer valued each Plateau share at about 5.18p
against a suspension price of 3p.

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lord Forte to retire from board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, Britain's largest hotel and restaurants group, yesterday handed over
formal control to a new generation with the announcement that Lord Forte,
its founder, was to retire from the board together with five other
long-serving directors.
The retirement of Lord Forte, 59 years after he set up his first milk bar in
London's Regent Street, comes six months after he handed over the
chairmanship to his son, Mr Rocco Forte. At the time, the company said that
Lord Forte would remain on the board as president as his experience remained
a valuable resource for the group.
The announcement that Lord Forte, 84, will now retire from the board at the
group's annual meeting next month strengthens his son's claim that he is in
charge of the company.
Mr Forte has appointed three well-respected non-executive directors - Sir
Anthony Tennant, former chairman of Guinness, Sir Paul Girolami, chairman of
Glaxo, and Mr Alan Wheatley, departing chairman of 3i - since taking over as
chairman.
The retiring directors have over 200 years of service between them. They
include Mr Eric Hartwell, 77, a partner in the original milk bar business
and now a non-executive director. Another departing non-executive is Mr
Donald Durban, who joined the Trust Houses company in 1939. Trust Houses
merged with Forte in 1970. Also going is Sir David McNee, the former
Metropolitan Police commissioner who has been a non-executive director for
10 years.
Two executive directors - Mr Dennis Hearn, who has been running the US
business, and Mr Ian Johnston, managing director of Forte Supplies - are
leaving at the end of this month.

2.65p, and the final dividend is 0.175p, making a total of 1p (2.05p).
Restructuring resulted in an Pounds 1.3m extraordinary debit but above the
line there were exceptional items of Pounds 1m relating to redundancy costs.
The payroll is now 19 per cent smaller than a year ago at 1,060.
Recession hit the group hard last year, reducing turnover on continuing
operations from Pounds 69.4m to Pounds 64.7m.

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Flat first half expected from British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS yesterday fore-shadowed flat results for the first half of this
year when Mr Robert Evans, chairman, told some 500 shareholders that the
conditions which had led to a fall in 1992 profits had continued into 1993.
Speaking at what he said may be his last annual meeting, Mr Evans said:
'This year so far we have seen a continuation of the warmer weather, no
respite in regulation and a further increase in competition.'
Last year British Gas made Pounds 1.16bn (Pounds 1.46bn) before tax and
exceptional items.
Recalling that his term as chairman ends in June 1994, Mr Evans said 'steps
will now be taken by the board to seek my successor' and he will retire when
that person is ready to start.
Mr Evans's successor will immediately become embroiled in the effects of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into British Gas.
Its report is due in July. Mr Evans said that 'whatever the outcome of the
MMC inquiry British Gas will undoubtedly be involved in a major
reorganisation of its business'.
Mr Evans could not resist a tilt at Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry
regulator, although he did not mention him by name. 'Unless mechanisms are
introduced to make the watchdog organisations as accountable as we are, we
face the prospect of an arbitrary and unbalanced regulatory environment,' he
said.

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Shareholders criticise Barclays' chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW Buxton, chair-man and chief executive of Barclays, was yesterday
subjected to fierce criticism, including repeated calls for his resignation,
at the bank's annual meeting in London.
Mr Buxton, whose bank last year incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m, was
told by several shareholders that he should take responsibility for lending
mistakes that led to it making Pounds 2.5bn provisions against bad and
doubtful debts.
A group of the 400 shareholders at the meeting applauded as Mr Buxton was
told by one shareholder that there was 'no reason to believe that someone
who has failed in the past should succeed in the future'.
Mr Buxton, who was appointed executive chairman in January, told
shareholders that they should 'look to the future' and accept that the
management had put in place measures to improve risk management and
earnings.
'I have been given a job to do by the board as chairman, and I think we
should be getting on with it and improving the company. We have started that
process,' said Mr Buxton, who answered largely hostile questions for two
hours.
Despite the verbal criticism, all motions proposed to the meeting were
passed. Lord Camoys, Sir Nigel Mobbs and Mr Humphrey Norrington were all
re-elected as directors with only a handful of shareholders voting against.
Mr Buxton said that the appointment of a new chief executive, which he
announced last month after criticism from institutional shareholders,
'should not be rushed, but I assure you that does not imply any lack of
progress.'
He was 'looking forward' to the arrival of a chief executive who would be
responsible for ensuring 'the hands-on implementation of strategy, and the
smooth running of the group' while he ensured the correct strategies.
He said one of the functions of the chief executive would be to 'maximise
the benefits of co-operation' among the operating divisions, including
branch banking and the BZW investment bank.
Mr Buxton also announced that Barclays was setting up a pilot telephone
banking service covering 10,000 customers from this summer, as well as
making a number of experimental changes to its branch network and use of
technology.
He faced calls for cuts in the salaries and bonuses of the directors to
reflect the halving of the final dividend last year. However, he said that
the level of bonuses had already fallen as a result of the loss.
'I do not think that wholesale sacking of your board and your management
would be in the interests of the company', Mr Buxton told one shareholder.

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Sinclair Goldsmith rights and merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCLAIR Goldsmith, a quoted property surveyor, is to merge with Conrad
Ritblat in the latest of a series of mergers by chartered surveying
practices.
The deal values Conrad Ritblat, which is headed by Mr John Ritblat, chairman
of British Land, at about Pounds 11.3m. Its shareholders will receive 32.3m
shares of Sinclair Goldsmith, which were suspended in February at a price of
35p.
Sinclair Goldsmith also announced a 1-for-4 rights issue to raise Pounds
2.66m. Up to a third of the cash will be used for working capital; the
remainder will fund its expansion into areas such as the Midlands and the
north of England.
Sinclair Goldsmith said its decision to merge stemmed from a search for ways
'to improve the company's profitability and strengthen its position in the
market.' It incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 525,000 for the year to May 31
1992 and a pre-tax loss of Pounds 265,000 for the six months to November 30.
Conrad Ritblat made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.2m for the year to April 30
1992 and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 374,000 for the six months to October
31. British Land accounts for about a quarter of Conrad Ritblat's turnover.
After the merger and rights issue, about 49.4 per cent of the shares will be
held by directors of Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith, the name for the
combined group. Mr John Ritblat will own 10.8 per cent of group.
Dealings in the shares are expected to resume on May 25. An extraordinary
meeting to approve the merger will be held on May 24.

FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Meyer launches Pounds 70m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEYER International, the timber supplier which owns the Jewson builders'
merchants chain, yesterday announced a Pounds 70m rights issue.
The money is to be used to reduce debt and to help finance working capital
as the construction industry moves out of recession and demand for building
material increases.
The group is offering shareholders one new share at 290p for every four
already held. Following the announcement, Meyer's share price slid 20p to
348p but recovered to close only 3p down at 365p.
Mr Richard Jewson, chairman, said that it was unlikely that profits in the
short term would return to previous levels. The company therefore intends to
reduce the final dividend to 5.8p (12.3p) making a total for the year of 10p
(16.5p).
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to end-March this year were estimated to
be not less than Pounds 14.2m, producing earnings per share of 10.2p under
the new FRS 3 accounting standard.
For the previous year Meyer reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.6m and
earnings of 19.2p. Under FRS 3 this was restated to a Pounds 19.9m deficit
and losses per share of 23.3p.
Proceeds from the issue initially would be used to reduce net borrowings,
which had risen to Pounds 131m - equivalent to gearing of 51 per cent on
shareholders' funds of about Pounds 255m.
COMMENT
Meyer has estimated that working capital needs to increase by an average of
Pounds 18m for every extra Pounds 100m of turnover. It remains cautious
about the speed of recovery in UK construction - commercial building remains
severely depressed, but clearly needs to raise money at some stage. Given
the recent rise in the group's share price, now was as good a time as any to
launch a rights - particularly as other construction related companies may
be queueing up to follow its example. The company has done well to reduce
its overheads, but Wolsey, given its exposure to US recovery, still looks a
more attractive investment for supporters of this sector.

FT  30 APR 93 / Tiphook shares fall 22% on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in transport rental group Tiphook fell 22 per cent yesterday after
the company issued a profits warning and said its trailer division was
losing money.
Tiphook said profits in the year to April 31, due to be announced in July,
would be about 20 per cent below expectations. UBS, the company's broker,
cut its forecast from Pounds 75m to Pounds 55m. Tiphook's often volatile
shares fell from 293p to 170p at one stage, before recovering to 230p.
Analysts were surprised at the scale of the downgrade, especially since Mr
Robert Montague, chairman, was optimistic about the trading outlook when
announcing interim profits in December.
'They misjudged their markets,' one analyst said.
Most of the downgrade stemmed from the trailers division, which was hit by
downturn in Germany and slower than expected recovery in the UK.
Utilisation rates fell from 62 per cent to 56 per cent and analysts expect
the division to incur a Pounds 10m loss instead of a Pounds 5m profit.
The company is cutting its fleet from nearly 34,000 trailers to 24,000 by
selling 9,532 trailers back to manufacturers. In return, Tiphook will spend
Pounds 387m buying 11,000 new trailers over the next five years.
The fleet reduction had been planned for some months and will improve
utilisation rates from below 60 per cent to 75 per cent. It will also delay
the benefit to Tiphook of any economic recovery in Europe.
The cuts follow the bid for the company's main competitor, TIP Europe, from
General Electric Capital Corp of the US. GECC plans to increase and upgrade
TIP Europe's trailer fleet.
A Pounds 16m profit from the trailer disposals will be balanced by certain
charges totalling Pounds 13m. These include a Pounds 2.7m loss on a
shareholding in TIP Europe and costs of Pounds 3m from the redemption of
Pounds 150m of preference shares last week.
Tiphook said it expected to recommend a final dividend of not less than
14.4p to make total dividends of 19.3p, an increase of 11.6 per cent.

FT  30 APR 93 / Counting the cost of a Dollars 2bn troubleshooter: Eastman
Kodak's loss of financial officer Christopher Steffen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HE was called 'the Dollars 2bn man'. That was the tag attached to Mr
Christopher Steffen in January when this corporate troubleshooter was named
chief financial officer of Eastman Kodak, as the appointment sent the
company's share price soaring and added more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn)
to its market capitalisation.
This Wednesday the magic went into reverse when Mr Steffen quit Kodak after
just 11 weeks because of a dispute with the company's management. Wall
Street knocked more than Dollars 1.5bn off the company's valuation in a
single morning.
The stock market had regarded the appointment of Mr Steffen, a man with a
reputation for turning around troubled companies, as the most positive sign
that insular, conservative Kodak was at last beginning to tackle its
deep-seated difficulties.
His departure therefore poses a serious credibility problem for the
company's board and, in particular, for its chairman, the cautious Mr Kay
Whitmore, who has headed Kodak since 1990 and spent 35 years with the
company.
Can they deliver the shock therapy which many analysts and dissident
shareholders believe is necessary, and which Mr Steffen seemed likely to
provide?
And if not, will yet another proud old giant of American industry, fat and
complacent by success, follow the examples of International Business
Machines and General Motors and undergo major boardroom bloodletting?
The company's earnings and share price record over the past decade has been
lacklustre and four restructurings during that time have failed to improve
matters. In an era of increasing shareholder militancy, such mediocrity is
no longer enough.
'The market thinks the wrong guy resigned,' says Mr Ralph Whitworth,
president of the investor activist group United Shareholders Association.
Mr Whitmore clearly got more than he bargained for when, under shareholder
pressure to inject fresh blood into the business, he lured Mr Steffen from
his job as chief financial officer of controls group Honeywell.
Mr Steffen, who played key roles in the turnround of Honeywell in 1989-92
and carmaker Chrysler in the mid-1980s, has a reputation for careful,
sometimes ruthless cost-cutting and a willingness to divest poorly
performing parts of a business.
One of his guiding principles is that 'change has to be all-encompassing,
all at once'.
That evidently did not go down well at cautious Kodak, where he and Mr
Whitmore seem to have disagreed over how quickly and extensively to
restructure the business. The normally genial Mr Whitmore also seems to have
been unhappy at the degree to which the 'Dollars 2bn dollar man' was
upstaging him. According to Mr Whitmore, Mr Steffen left 'not because we
disagreed on what needs to change, but because we could not agree on the
process for making that change happen'.
Certainly, Mr Whitmore had begun to set change in motion well before Mr
Steffen's arrival - though largely under pressure from shareholders restive
at Kodak's recent history. The 104-year-old company, the largest
photographic equipment company in the world, was hit in the 1980s by a
slowdown in the growth of this 'imaging' market, and fierce competition from
companies like the innovative Fuji Photo Film of Japan and America's 3M,
which is making inroads into Kodak's market share with inexpensive,
store-brand film.
For years Kodak wrongly assumed that the slowdown was temporary, and planned
accordingly, with a cost structure based on annual revenue growth of 6 per
cent to 8 per cent. In a sharp change of stance, Mr Whitmore announced early
this year that the company would plan for photographic revenue growth of
around 3 per cent a year and 'view the world as it is, and not as we might
it to be'.
He announced cutbacks in the imaging group's extremely generous research
budget. He also ordered extra scrutiny of capital spending and eliminated
2,000 jobs - Kodak's first significant redundancies in years.
However, many analysts say the pruning needs to be more radical than this
and should involve the sale of some or all of Kodak's other leading
businesses, which now account for around two thirds of group sales but only
around 40 per cent of income.
The most obvious candidate for disposal is Kodak's office copier business,
which has annual sales of Dollars 2bn but is losing money.
But a more radical management could also consider selling Sterling, a
pharmaceuticals company bought for Dollars 5.1bn in 1988 and folded into a
joint venture with Sanofi of France two years ago; or Eastman Chemical, a
commodity chemical manufacturer which might fetch more than Dollars 4bn; or
household products group Lehn and Fink.
Analysts say a substantial reduction in Kodak's heavy Dollars 9bn debt
burden - much of it taken on for the Sterling acquisition - will require
some big asset sales but could leave Kodak as a more sharply focused
business, with a substantially higher share price.
One of Mr Steffen's declared aims was to cut debt-to-capital ratio from 59
per cent to between 30 and 40 per cent. Mr Whitmore has sold off some
peripheral interests, such as Atex, makes computer systems for newspapers.
In his Wednesday talk with investors he declined to name the big divestiture
being planned. He also said the group's latest restructuring plans would be
unveiled by September - a timeframe which may not satisfy militant
shareholders looking for more urgent remedies, and who may vent their
frustration at next month's annual meeting.

FT  30 APR 93 / Ferranti seeks to pull out of US

FERRANTI, the British defence electronics company whose former US deputy
chairman is now in prison for fraud and illegal arms sales, is winding up
one of its US companies and seeking buyers for its remaining US assets.
In the UK, a spokesman for Ferranti said the loss-making group was
refocusing its operations and had a number of 'peripheral operations' such
as the US businesses. He said Ferranti was 'cash hungry and under tight
financial control' and was open to offers where it could find a suitable
buyer for its US assets.
Ferranti's US assets, which still employ nearly 1,000 people and have annual
turnover of close to Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m), represent about one quarter
of the group's worldwide turnover. In Ferranti's last financial year, ended
on March 31 1992, the US businesses contributed Pounds 113.9m of total group
turnover of Pounds 409m.
The US company being wound up is Ferranti International Simulation and
Training, a small part of the group's Pennsylvania-based operations that
featured in criminal proceedings last year against Mr James Guerin, the
former group deputy chairman serving a 15-year sentence for financial fraud
and illegal arms sales.
Fist's engineering services were sold off in January and as US military
contracts have been completed, the the company, which earlier had nearly 100
employees, is being wound up.
Also being wound up is Fist's proxy board, a group of three former US
military and intelligence officials who were supposed to safeguard
classified US defence information because Fist was owned by a non-US
company. Among the board members was Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, former
chairman of President Bush's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board who last
year hailed Mr Guerin as a 'patriot' who had worked in the past with the
Central Intelligence Agency and therefore deserved leniency.
Remaining Ferranti US businesses available for sale include the headquarters
in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Sciaky, a Chicago-based automated manufacturing
systems company; EMP in Los Angeles, a missile tracking equipment company;
and Ferranti Venus, New York.

FT  30 APR 93 / ICI helped by cutbacks and sterling's fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries increased pre-tax profits by 10 per cent to
Pounds 233m in the first quarter of the year, the last time the chemicals
and bioscience group will produce results on its pre-demerger basis. The
group's shares rose 31p to 1278p despite the market's fall.
Except for the fall in sterling and cost cutting measures ICI has
undertaken, group profits would have fallen. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman,
said recovery from recession remained patchy. Mr Colin Short, finance
director, said sterling's fall benefited pre-tax profits by about Pounds 50m
while savings from the cost-cutting programme instituted in 1991 were
running at around Pounds 100m a quarter.
At the trading profit level, the group achieved a 10.3 per cent advance to
Pounds 279m, excluding exceptional items. But Zeneca, the bio-science
business to be floated in June - if ICI shareholders approve the demerger at
next month's special meeting - raised trading profits 13.3 per cent to
Pounds 204m, while the ICI side increased profits 2.7 per cent to Pounds
75m. Group turnover rose 9 per cent to Pounds 3.33bn. Zeneca's sales were up
13 per cent to Pounds 1.13bn, but exchange rates alone accounted for a 14
per cent rise, price increases added 1 per cent but disposals took off 2 per
cent. The ICI side increased sales by 7 per cent to Pounds 2.29bn.
Zeneca's pharmaceutical division increased trading profits from Pounds 121m
to Pounds 154m, helped by a 57 per cent sales rise from four leading drugs,
but partly offset by a 10 per cent drop in sales worldwide, and a 21 per
cent fall in volume, of Tenormin, Zeneca's biggest selling drug, whose
patent recently expired in the US.
Agrochemical profits fell from Pounds 51m to Pounds 37m as uncertainty over
the European agricultural policy continued. But specialties profits rose
from Pounds 14m to Pounds 20m.
Within the ICI business paints profits fell from Pounds 22m to Pounds 18m,
but there were strong advances from industrial chemicals and regional
businesses, notably Australia. Materials, which includes fibres, recovered
from a loss of Pounds 49m in the second half of 1992, to a profit of Pounds
1m, although down from Pounds 12m in the first quarter of 1992.
The group interest charge rose from Pounds 48m to Pounds 61m. A rise in the
tax rate left earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, up 5.6 per
cent to 20.9p.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the US carmaker in the throes of a big restructuring,
yesterday reported better-than-expected first quarter income of Dollars 513m
(Pounds 333m), but acknowledged its results had a long way to go to be
satisfactory.
Earnings improved Dollars 680m from the first quarter of last year, when GM
lost Dollars 167m, while sales and revenues rose 8.4 per cent from Dollars
32.3bn to Dollars 34.9bn.
A key element was less red ink in its North American automobile operations -
the main source of the group's difficulties - which produced an attributable
loss of Dollars 194m, against a loss of Dollars 1.2bn a year ago.
Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said North America was on track to achieve
its 1993 target of break-even before interest, taxes and accounting for
retirees' health benefits. It earned Dollars 525m on this basis in the first
quarter, a Dollars 1.5bn improvement.
Cashflow was also continuing to improve, with cash and marketable securities
totalling Dollars 8.4bn on March 31, up from Dollars 8bn at December 31.
Detroit rivals Ford and Chrysler have also announced better-than-expected
first quarter figures, helped by the gradual US economic recovery, lower
rebates on American model sales and a loss of US market share by Japanese
rivals.
Mr Smith said GM's improvement in North America showed the company was
succeeding in implementing a lean manufacturing system, streamlining its
business practices, improving productivity and executing its new global
purchasing strategy. He noted that rationalisation efforts at GM's large
components business were generating improved operating results.
However, he added: 'We still have much to do to achieve competitive levels
of cost and productivity in North America.'
GM's international automotive operations earned Dollars 165m, down from
Dollars 482m, due to market weakness in Europe and the start-up of
manufacturing the company's new Corsa models.
Mr Richard Wagoner, chief financial officer, said the European market had
been 'far weaker than any of us had expected' and was likely to remain weak
until a modest pick-up in 1994.
Group net income translated into earnings per share of 42 cents, against
last year's Dollars 33.96 loss on a Dollars 21bn non-cash charge.

LORD OWEN and Mr Cyrus Vance, joint mediators to the Bosnian dispute, said
last night at the UN that they were convening a meeting this weekend with
Bosnian Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders as well as the presidents of Croatia,
Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro.
A spokesman for Mr Vance and Lord Owen said the meeting was prompted by a
decision of the Bosnian Serbs to reconsider the Vance-Owen peace plan they
had rejected earlier this week.
The meeting, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday in Athens, would include
Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic,
Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban, Serbian president Slobodan Milosovic,
Croatian president Franjo Tudjman and others.
It is seen as a last-ditch attempt to save the Vance-Owen peace plan and to
put pressure on the Bosnian Serb Assembly when it meets on Wednesday to
reconsider its initial rejection. The Athens meeting will also see Mr
Vance's handover of his position as mediator to Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg,
former Norwegian foreign minister.
Western governments yesterday were struggling to maintain a united front on
proposals for outside military intervention in Bosnia, amid growing reports
of disagreements over what option should be chosen.
A senior Nato official said the chances of decisive western military
intervention in Bosnia were fading. The official blamed European opposition
to the use of force which had proved 'highly influential' with the Clinton
administration and closed military options.
EC foreign ministers this week expressed strong reservations about military
intervention and defence chiefs on both sides of the Atlantic went public
with their concerns about using force without clear-cut goals.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton is struggling to reach a consensus
among his own civilian and military advisers on US action to force the
Bosnian Serbs to sign the Vance-Owen plan. A decision is expected in the
next few days.
Britain, however, yesterday indicated it was ready to back a US ultimatum
threatening air strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia if the US
administration agreed to maintain the international arms embargo.

FT  30 APR 93 / Italian government faces collapse after Craxi immunity vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S 52nd post-war government faced the threat of immediate collapse last
night hours after being sworn in, pushing the country towards early
elections.
The threat sprang from an explosion of parliamentary rage, reflected in
street demonstrations, over the surprise refusal by a majority of parliament
to waive full immunity on Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, to
face corruption charges.
The parliamentary vote favouring Mr Craxi provoked the immediate resignation
of the one Green member of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's cabinet and the more
serious prospect of a withdrawal from the government of the three members of
the formerly communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The trio includes
Mr Vincenzo Visco, named as finance minister.
The presence of the PDS in the government was negotiated with great
difficulty by Mr Ciampi, who is also the governor of the Bank of Italy. It
was the central element in his attempt to forge a consensus for electoral
reform after he had been summoned to form a government. A cabinet statement
said the government would seek a vote of confidence.
The parliamentary vote was immediately seen as an effort by the Christian
Democrats and Socialists, the main parties in the outgoing four-party
coalition, to protect a political class discredited by the country's
corruption scandals.
There were suggestions that the vote on Mr Craxi was caused in part by an
attempt by opposition members such as the Lombard League and hardline
communists of Reconstructed Communism to embarrass the new government.
Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, said he would urgently seek a meeting
with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro saying that the understanding on which
PDS members had entered the government was that there would be backing for
magistrates' requests for immunity to be waived in cases of corruption.
Observers said that if the resignations of the three PDS ministers were
accepted early elections would become inevitable - even before electoral
reform had been introduced.
Milan magistrates indicated they would take the matter to the constitutional
court, foreshadowing a confrontation between parliament and the judiciary.

FT  30 APR 93 / Schlesinger damps rate cut hope: Bundesbank president warns
fight against inflation continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK president yesterday damped hopes for a rapid decline in
European interest rates, warning that Germany was 'still not over the hump'
in its attempts to control inflation.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank's president, warned that this week's
sharp reduction in German money market rates did not signal the start of
aggressive interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank.
Speaking at a press conference before yesterday's meeting of Group of Seven
finance ministers, he said there would be negative consequences for the
D-Mark and German capital markets if the country cut rates aggressively.
In spite of Mr Schlesinger's remarks, the level of German interest rates was
discussed at the G7 meeting. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, welcomed
the German interest rate cuts but said he thought they could have come
sooner.
According to UK officials, Mr Lamont said he feared that recession would
continue in continental Europe. He believed, however, that the recovery in
Britain was sustainable.
Underlining his cautious approach, Mr Schlesinger said Germany had the
highest inflation rate of the leading industrialised countries and that only
four members of the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development had higher inflation.
It was true, he said, that inflation was a lagging indicator that reflected
past events. However, it also influenced people's expectations and had to be
taken seriously.
The Bundesbank president said Germany had used its available manoeuvring
room to cut rates. Germany's short-term interest rates had fallen by about 2
percentage points since September. Long-term rates at about 6.5 per cent
were among the lowest in the world and should foster investment.
He also rebuffed criticism that Germany's short-term rates were keeping
borrowing costs too high on the European continent. The recent fall in
French interest rates showed that the credibility of countries' policies was
the key factor determining interest rates. Inside the European exchange rate
mechanism, Belgium and the Netherlands had lower rates than Germany, he
noted.
Germany had been able to cut rates because its money supply growth had moved
into line with the Bundesbank's target. But inflationary pressures had not
weakened in the first months of this year, Mr Schlesinger said.
He appeared less hopeful about inflationary trends in Germany than Mr Theo
Waigel, the German finance minister. Mr Waigel acknowledged that consumer
prices were rising too strongly but prospects were not bad for a
deceleration in the inflation rate.
In his comments to the G7, Mr Lamont rejected suggestions that the UK's
economic recovery was the result of sterling's departure from the ERM last
September. Activity had picked up because of interest rate cuts when Britain
was still in the ERM, he said.
The chancellor was also critical of barriers in Europe to imports from the
new market economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He
warned of a 'new iron curtain' caused by protectionism against goods from
the former communist countries.

FT  30 APR 93 / Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook was clearly trying to contain scepticism about the company's trading
prospects with its profits warning. But the wholesale dumping of bad news
has done little to reassure the market - as yesterday's 22 per cent fall in
the share price demonstrates. While the sale of 9,500 trailers reduces the
fleet during the continental recession, the management has simultaneously
committed itself to a Pounds 378m order for 11,000 trailers over the next
five years. It will be vindicated if markets turn up in 1980s-style. If not,
Tiphook is avoiding pain today by buying more expensive pain tomorrow. With
its largest competitor TIP Europe being acquired by General Electric Capital
Corporation, it will face opposition from a company backed by a
deep-pocketed parent.
Tiphook has high operational and financial gearing, while its interest cover
is likely to fall to 1.6 times by the year end. Most of its banking
covenants become operable at a cover of 1.25 times, but there are a few set
at 1.5 times. The company can repay its more stringent borrowings from other
cash reserves if necessary, and is increasing the proportion of unsecured
loans in its debt portfolio. Yet gearing of over 300 per cent with such low
cover does increase the financial risks. Investors might be more reassured
if the mangement's sunny disposition had not proved over-optimistic in the
past. By the conventional yardsticks of multiple and yield, the shares are
cheap. With the market nervous about trading prospects, they are likely to
remain so.

FT  30 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Kwik Save
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few investors have included food retailers' shares on their recent shopping
lists. Since the start of the year, the sector has underperformed the market
by 11 per cent. Shares have been hit by anxiety attacks about grocers'
expansion plans, the proliferation of deep discounters and an increase in
price pressures. Kwik Save's interim figures suggest such pessimism is
overdone.
Kwik Save's 19 per cent rise in pre-tax profits on a 14 per cent sales
increase hardly smacks of an industry in crisis. And, although growth will
slow in the second half, Kwik Save still seems set to record earnings gains
in the high teens for a while to come. The company is adding stores at the
rate of one a week. Large areas of the country, such as Scotland, remain
untouched. The lack of any price inflation in Kwik Save's sales figures
certainly emphasises the tough trading environment. But Kwik Save maintained
its competitiveness by improving operating efficiencies rather than
sacrificing margin. The launch of cut-price No Frills own-label products
offers an alternative means of suppressing fire from deep discounters.
That said, investors contemplating a return to the grocery sector are more
likely to chase J. Sainsbury or Argyll. The shares of the superstore
operators have been sold more aggressively and appear relatively cheaper.
Such companies should also benefit more from recovery as shoppers again
treat themselves to a little of what they fancy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That ICI is faring better than its European competitors is due in large part
to the devaluation of sterling. Yesterday's first-quarter figures benefit to
the tune of Pounds 50m from improved competitiveness and the translation of
overseas earnings at a favourable rate. ICI's policy of buying currency
forward should help earnings later this year even if sterling appreciates.
By this time next year, though, exchange rates could be working against it.
Firmer prices seen in bulk chemicals might also evaporate if customers
de-stock through the summer and three months of strong sales in
pharmaceuticals does not constitute a trend.
The cautious tone of the chairman's statement and dire results from DSM and
BASF yesterday should stop the bulls getting too carried away about the
cyclical upside in chemicals. The Germans and Dutch are some way behind in
restructuring. The benefit from ICI's 1991 reshaping is around Pounds 100m a
quarter, with the promise of more to come from last year's exceptional
charge. But with Europe in such bad shape, ICI is running to stand still.
There is little in the figures, then, to alter the valuation of the group
ahead of demerger. If sentiment towards the drugs industry does not
deteriorate, the grey market price for Zeneca of around 700p quoted by
Salomon Brothers looks about right. At that price, the bioscience shares
would yield a shade more than the market average. Institutions may demand a
heavy discount to the share price in order to get Zeneca's rights issue
away.

FT  30 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Lessons at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be no flood of corporate capital to fill the vacuum caused by
Lloyd's ruinous losses. By reducing the expected underwriting capacity in
the second half of the decade, its business plan recognises as much. If the
target 20 per cent rate of return on incorporated capital can be achieved,
though, corporate members will doubtless come forward. The overdue
cost-cutting and centralisation proposed yesterday should give underwriters
a better chance of delivering on that score.
But Lloyd's cannot hope to attract much capital of any variety until past
pollution and liability risks have been ring-fenced. That will entail a full
audit of liabilities and reserves right across the market. Tax and
regulatory hurdles must then be overcome before the new holding company can
be set up. Even then, the security of the ring-fence will turn on the
unpredictable level of awards made by US courts. All but the most
speculative providers of capital will take time to convince.
Insurance companies which already write international risks - using their
own underwriters - may anyway see few advantages in Lloyd's membership.
Selling a Lloyd's unit trust will hardly be easy against the sorry backdrop
of losses and litigation. Specialist providers of risk capital and private
equity funds are thus more likely sources. Most pension funds devote a small
portion of their assets to such high-risk ventures. But, if the mistakes of
the 1980s are not to be repeated, some scarcity of capital is a good thing.
The ability of Lloyd's executive to ration the inflow of capital may
ultimately be the most important innovation of all.

FT  30 APR 93 / West split over use of force in Bosnia

WESTERN governments yesterday struggled to maintain a united front on
proposals for outside military intervention in Bosnia, amid growing reports
of disagreements over what option should be chosen.
A senior Nato official said yesterday the chances of decisive western
military intervention in Bosnia were fading. The official blamed European
opposition to the use of force which had proved 'highly influential' with
the Clinton administration and closed military options for dealing with
Serbian aggression.
The failure to intervene decisively at an earlier stage in the Bosnian
crisis means the Vance-Owen peace plan sponsored by the European Community
and the United Nations is 'highly unlikely ever to come into being', the
official said.
This gloomy assessment follows a week in which EC foreign ministers
expressed strong reservations about military intervention and defence chiefs
on both sides of the Atlantic went public with their concerns about using
force without clear-cut goals.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton is struggling to reach a consensus
among his own civilian and military advisers on US action to force the
Bosnian Serbs to sign the Vance-Owen plan. A decision is expected in the
next few days.
Britain, however, yesterday indicated it was ready to back a US ultimatum
threatening air strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia if the US
administration agreed to maintain the international arms embargo.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is expected to travel to
European capitals next week to consult US allies and discuss the plan Mr
Clinton chooses for Bosnia.
Neither British nor US officials believe that an international conference on
Bosnia, as proposed yesterday by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president,
can be reconvened as early as next week. To be successful, it would have to
be carefully prepared, the British Foreign Office said.
As a House of Commons debate revealed intense concern that Britain risks
being dragged further into the Bosnian conflict, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, refused to rule out the option of air strikes.
But he emphasised that Britain did not see military action as a substitute
for sanctions against Serbia and the eventual goal of a negotiated political
settlement, and he underlined his strong opposition to lifting the
international arms embargo.
Against a background of threats from their paymasters in Belgrade, Bosnian
Serbs yesterday announced they would reconsider an international peace plan.
The speaker of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament said a new session
would be held on May 5. The assembly rejected the peace plan on Monday.

FT  30 APR 93 / Personal View: Russian arithmetic doesn't add up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAYARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that President Boris Yeltsin has survived the political battle, the
focus shifts back to the economy. Can Russia really stop printing money and
control inflation? One might think that, with the western aid already
promised, it should be easy. But the arithmetic shows otherwise. That is why
the US is urging the other Group of Seven industrial nations to support an
additional Dollars 4bn privatisation fund. The proposal will be discussed
when G7 finance ministers meet in Washington this week.
Without this extra money Russian industry can only be restructured with
printed roubles. And that would ruin everything.
Let us examine the arithmetic. The government is pledged to reduce inflation
to 5 per cent a month by Christmas (compared with 25 per cent a month since
last September). This means a massive cut in the growth of central bank
credit. Even if the government's share of this credit is limited to 5 per
cent of the national income, and even with all the aid already promised,
enterprises will be able to borrow very little. In fact they will be unable
to borrow even enough to maintain the real value of their working bank
balances. There would be no finance for investment or budgetary costs of
restructuring.
That would defeat the objective of the exercise. But, more important, it
would make the government's whole disinflation programme politically
infeasible.
What is needed is a two-handed approach. There should be a sharp tightening
of central bank credit, including what goes to the commercial banks. This
will apply hard budget constraints to enterprises, and will stop them
borrowing to pay wage increases and to finance unproductive labour. It will
sharply reduce obsolete lines of production.
But at the same time there must be a source of finance for new lines of
production and to cover the social costs of closures. Enterprise loans
should be made only to privatised (or privatising) enterprises that produce
viable business plans.
For such plans there is currently no source of long-term finance; most loans
are for six months or less. And there could be no domestic source of
investment finance that is not inflationary, because profits get squeezed
during a stabilisation programme.
So substantial money for restructuring should come from abroad. Though some
oil loans are in the pipeline along with a few other western export credits
for industrial buyers, the industrial sector as a whole will on present
plans get no money beyond what is needed to protect its working capital.
That is why the US government has had the vision to propose, at Russia's
request, a Dollars 4bn privatisation fund. It would have three main, closely
related parts. The first would be a large financlng facility under joint
western-Russian control, to respond to requests coming from enterprises,
regardless of sector, and using western criteria of risk appraisal.
The only criterion should be the likely profitability of the project, and
lending would be step-by-step for specific expenditures, with later tranches
depending on adequate performance.
If the lending agency is to approve a project, it must receive an
intelligible business plan. The agency would have to specify the form in
which such plans were to be drawn up. But to produce such plans the
enterprises will need independent business advice.
This is the second critical need in Russia. Many enterprises makepromising
products for which they could find foreign markets as domestic markets
collapse. But they have no marketing skills and often no idea who to contact
in the west. If there is not to be a devastating collapse in the industrial
sector, these enterprises desperately need advice.
Training is also vital. Russia desperately needs workers trained in
commercial skills that were totally lacking under communism. Almost a third
of the workforce needs to be retrained.
The third need is for money to cover the budgetary costs of restructuring.
Adequate severence is vital, and housing and healthcare formerly paid for by
enterprises will have to moved on to the budget.
Thus the concept of the fund is an integrated whole. Business plans are no
good without money, and money is no good without sound business plans. And
both will fail if the government cannot provide a sound social basis for
reform.
The whole of the west should endorse this plan, and do it now. The World
Bank is not short of money and the US government has offered to put up
Dollars 500m. Why delay agreement till the Tokyo summit in July?

FT  30 APR 93 / A blind eye to the enemy within: Brazil's new economic plan
takes a long-term approach, but are its measures tough enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For once, a Brazilian government has kept its word. Six months after taking
office, President Itamar Franco has unveiled an economic strategy that
abandons the unsuccessful 'shock therapy' of his predecessors. Out go wage
and price freezes, the confiscation of bank accounts and currency
devaluations; in comes a realisation that structural economic problems
cannot be resolved overnight.
The plan offers the first clear indication of Mr Franco's priorities since
he was propelled into office by the impeachment of the disgraced Mr Fernando
Collor, and signals an awareness that Brazil is trailing behind the rest of
Latin America in reforming its economy. 'We have said goodbye to the era of
magic solutions,' said Mr Roberto Freire, the government's congressional
leader, after the package was announced. 'This plan tackles the problems
which are strangling the economy without interfering with peoples' lives.'
But positive reaction to the plan centres on what it does not do, rather
than what it does. There is understandable public relief at the absence of
grandiose measures, given the disruption caused by the five shock plans
imposed since 1986. What has alarmed many observers is that, with prices
rising by 30 per cent a month, the government has elected to make growth its
priority rather than fighting inflation.
The main focus of the package is a controversial cut in interest rates and a
boost in government spending to alleviate poverty and stimulate growth this
year of 3.5 per cent. Mr Franco announced that his empty Treasury coffers
would finance a Dollars 2.6bn housing programme, Dollars 4.8bn in farm
subsidies, Dollars 590m in road repairs, and provide Dollars 8bn in hunger
relief and incentives to labour-intensive industries such as car making and
construction. To finance the extra spending as well as plug a Dollars 10bn
hole in this year's budget, Mr Franco is relying optimistically on a new tax
on bank cheques, speeding up privatisation, cutting spending by state
companies and a crackdown on tax evasion.
Critics have attacked his plan for its focus on spending rather than on
reducing the deficit. A former central bank governor warns: 'This plan is
simply more fuel to the fire of inflation. We have spending decisions on one
hand and intentions of cuts on the other. Well, the road to hell is paved
with good intentions.' Mr Carlos Langoni, economics professor at Getulio
Vargas Institute in Rio de Janeiro, likens the idea of reducing interest
rates in Brazil's current climate to 'lighting a cigarette in a room full of
gasoline'.
Finance ministry officials retort that three years of tight monetary policy
have succeeded only in shrinking per capita income by 10 per cent without
reducing inflation. They say the Itamar plan is aimed primarily at
re-establishing business confidence which, combined with sound budget
management, will lead to a fall in inflation to monthly levels of 17 per
cent by the end of this year. If the government restores its credibility
through the plan, the argument runs, business will stop putting up prices
defensively and the government will be able to fund its short-term Dollars
36bn domestic debt more cheaply.
But most economists question this analysis and whether it is possible to cut
Brazilian inflation without shock therapy. Such measures have been
discredited by the failure of former plans but this was largely because they
were badly implemented and lacked accompanying fiscal reforms such as making
the tax system more efficient.
Tough fiscal measures - needed to bring down the budget deficit, the main
cause of inflation - are similarly absent from the Itamar package. Yet one
reason why the proposals have not been more widely attacked is because
inflation is seen as far less of a problem inside the country than outside.
For years, Brazil has been living with levels of inflation considered by
most economists to be unsustainable. For the past 18 months inflation has
increased by more than 20 per cent a month; for most of the past 15 years it
has been above 100 per cent a year.
Inflation has become institutionalised. Daily or monthly indexes are issued
for everything from construction materials to rents. The cruzeiro has
retained its monetary credibility because 95 per cent of the money supply is
in bank accounts which are indexed at the daily inflation rate.
Mr Francisco Gros, ex-governor of the central bank, complains: 'Brazilians
do not see inflation as the enemy. I could fill a stadium within minutes for
a protest against recession but I doubt I could gather half a dozen
stragglers to rally against inflation.'
But inflation clearly is damaging the economy. Brazilian industry retains
its competitive edge largely through cheap labour and tax evasion. Equipment
is outdated and investment negligible because financial speculation is more
profitable. Anyone who has driven on a Brazilian road or tried to make a
phone call from Rio can see that the infrastructure is collapsing. The
country has the world's largest income gap between rich and poor and holds
the world record for the number of deaths in traffic accidents last year.
Speaking at a recent conference in Sao Paulo, Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard
economist active in Russia's economic programme, attacked Brazilian
complacency. 'If this isn't a crisis, I don't know what is,' he said,
accusing Brazil's leaders of 'luxuriating in the morass' with the excuse
that the country's problems are too complex. He continued: 'Brazil's
problems are not fundamentally different to other Latin American countries -
it's just the last to get its house in order.'
One result of the instability is that foreign investors are increasing
reluctant to commit funds to the country. A western diplomat points out:
'Brazil's high inflation is damaging its credibility as a place to invest or
do business. It's the world's ninth-largest economy and fifth-biggest
country but people just don't take it seriously.'
A prime factor in Brazil's slow progress on economic reform is the lack of
political will to push through tough measures. Instead, successive
governments have used shock plans to try to combat inflation at minimal
social cost. But political leaders are beginning to understand that there is
no easy way out. The lack of alternatives is illustrated by Mr Franco's
conversion to privatisation - a policy he opposed as vice-president.
In any case, his ability to implement reform is hindered by the 1988
constitution which allocates more than half of central government revenues
to the free-spending states and municipalities. The fragmented political
system, with 19 parties represented in Congress, means constant bargaining.
But the main obstacle to reform is the number of people benefiting from
inflation and with no incentive to change. Important industries, such as
cement and cars, gain from protection in the form of high import tariffs,
allowing them to charge excessive prices for poor-quality goods. The banking
sector saw record profits last year. State companies closely guard their
privileges, such as access to cheap finance, and support bloated workforces.
Some observers believe that the country needs a hyperinflationary crisis
similar to those suffered by Bolivia and Argentina to jolt it into action.
Mr Roberto Macedo, the former economic policy chief, recalls that when
feeling 'desperate' about political inertia he considered provoking this by
giving in to all spending demands.
The Itamar plan, while not subjecting the economy to more shock treatment,
still flinches from badly needed fiscal surgery. The government will have
another chance in October with a planned constitutional revision. This could
change the funding balance between central and local government and could
enable state employees to be sacked for the first time. But spending
pressures are already mounting as campaigns get under way for next year's
unprecedented simultaneous elections for president, Congress and governors.
While the Itamar plan is a welcome signal that the government has at last
acknowledged the deep-seated nature of its problems, few expect the
small-town senator who came to the presidency by accident to have the
political muscle or vision to set Brazil on a non-inflationary path to
growth. Most Brazilians have already turned their attention to 1994. The
fear is that they are still hoping for a miracle.

Best-sellers though they're unlikely to be, the full texts of the latest
British accounting standards are a hot topic for publishers struggling, on
grounds of both price and quality, to take control of the documents issued
by the Accounting Standards Board.
One focus of the argument is the emphasis in the accountancy profession's
ethical rules on the need not only to be, but to be seen to be, independent.
In which case, some ask, how much longer can the publishing arm of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales continue printing
the standards produced by the supposedly independent board, and designed to
cover all of the UK?

FT  30 APR 93 / Observer: Singular rival
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wheeling in from the past comes former British Leyland whizz-kid Ian
McKinnon, now running Alcan Specialities' aerospace division in Birmingham.
He doesn't aim to stay there much longer, judging by his wish to pay what
must be at least Pounds 200m for Leyland Daf's truck business just when a
management buy-out was apparently going ahead.
Numerous members of the rival team of course used to work for McKinnon.
While he says he'd like them to do so again, they were lukewarm about same
yesterday after already agreeing outline terms for the buy-out with the
receivers, Arthur Andersen.
Despite McKinnon's promise to equal or better his rivals' offer, the
receiver may prefer a bird i' th'and - as they say in Lancashire - to two in
t'bush. Aberdonian engineer McKinnon also apparently has some way to go to
finalise the financing.
Still, his cv doesn't look bad. After rising rapidly to run Leyland Trucks
throughout the UK, he led the management buy-out of Leyland Bus once the
trucks business had gone to Daf. He then sold out very profitably to Volvo
in 1987 after turning round the bus operation. At only 46, he is clearly
champing for the next challenge.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems that the gravitas of foreign secretary Douglas Hurd will no longer
be balanced around the world by the urbanity of his spokesman Francis
Cornish, whose humorous as well as authoritative daily briefings have been
like manna to diplomatic correspondents.
Observer hears he is to be British trade commissioner in Hong Kong - a job
in which he'll report to London, rather than to governor Chris Patten, and
represent Britain's as distinct from the HK government's interests.
What's more, the office Cornish will head is set to be the core of Britain's
future diplomatic representation in Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.
He's replacing former ambassador to Tunisia Stephen Day, who only moved to
the job last year.
Cornish is also well stocked with diplomatic skills, and not only as a
result of dealing with the media. He has been a High Commissioner to Brunei
and an information counsellor in Washington, not to mention an assistant
private secretary to the Prince of Wales.

FT  30 APR 93 / Observer: Who will turn on the gas?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the hunt for a successor to chairman Bob Evans, British Gas seems
prepared to look beyond a deep-in-the-pipe gas chap to complement chief
executive Cedric Brown who is settling down as an effective 'operations'
man.
Lord Walker, a non-executive director likely to be influential in the
search, is indeed reputed to be angling for it himself, but, given the
controversy over privatisation on his watch as energy secretary, that would
not be an inspired solution.
What is needed is an outsider who can tackle a bureaucratic giant and,
maybe, preside over its break-up. Evans, who joined the company in 1950, was
never likely to turn the company on its head.
Sir Peter Holmes retires from Shell shortly - and oil men have been
considered before. David Simon is thought to have been approached for the
chairmanship when Sir Denis Rooke left; later, of course, he took charge of
BP on the ousting of Bob Horton. (Now there's a terrifying thought for the
board; Horton is, after all, distinctly under-employed heading Railtrack.)
But a completely fresh mind is really what is needed. No doubt a blue-eyed
boy like Sir Christopher Hogg would be hard to persuade. But how about Sir
Denys Henderson? Or perhaps BT chairman Iain Vallance fancies a change of
watchdog? Since leaving British Steel, Sir Bob Scholey hasn't picked up
anything that would stand in the way. Finally, who says the gamekeeper won't
turn poacher? Sir James McKinnon, whose views on Evans were warmly
reciprocated, retires from Ofgas in September.
Meanwhile, the Ofgas boss is believed to favour a woman as his own successor
 -on the quaint theory that most gas consumers are female - given that they
do the cooking, pay the bills and write the complaining letters. Sally Hunt,
director of economic consultancy Nera was on the list for the Oftel job
following Sir Bryan Carsberg, so perhaps someone will ring her.

FT  30 APR 93 / Leading Article: A last chance for Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST over a year ago, Mr David Rowland offered Lloyd's of London a blueprint
for its future. Yesterday, transformed in the meantime from adviser to
chairman of the insurance market, he started building. The contrast between
the two occasions is striking.
Last year, Mr Rowland's tone was optimistic: Lloyd's faced serious
challenges, but, provided the market cut its costs, it stood every chance of
prospering.
This year, the tone is far more sombre. 'Many members have been brought to
the brink of financial ruin,' he says. 'Should membership and market not
unite behind this plan then Lloyd's may have no future.'
There are other noticeable contrasts. The launch of last year's Rowland
report was marked by a brisk dismissal of one of its central recommendations
by the Lloyd's Council. This year, the Council is gone in all but name,
overshadowed by an executive team that has done away with rule by committee.
The plan itself is a far more drastic break with Lloyd's traditions than was
envisaged in last year's consensus document. True, the central building
blocks - lower costs, separation of market management and regulation,
membership by companies as well as individuals, greater professionalism -
are the same. But no one, a year ago, would have envisaged the
centralisation now intended, nor the abandonment of the market's
laisser-faire past.
'We need to protect Names from excessive exposure to catastrophic losses,'
says the plan - a modest sentence which breaks with a tradition that made
members and their agents solely responsible for judgment of risk.
Competition case
Mr Rowland makes no bones about the scale of the change. Competition -
between underwriters, between members' advisers, between managers of run-off
syndicates - is an important element of his plan. But it is to be
competition within limits, ruthlessly suppressed where it is seen as
inappropriate.
Thus, administration of Names' affairs is to be centralised; computer
processing is to be mandatory and standardised; claims handling is to be
simplified and centralised; managing agents' fees are to be capped; and the
weaker agencies closed or merged.
Reinsurance practices that help individual syndicates but harm the market as
a whole - such as those that fed the LMX spiral in the late 1980s - are to
be banned. The market cannot be left 'red in tooth and claw' to do what it
likes, says Mr Rowland, or it may bring itself to the brink of destruction.
Members are, in effect, to be owner/franchisees, free to compete within
limits, but not free to harm the nature of the franchise itself.
Breaking free
These are drastic measures. They may not be enough. As a future recipe for
prosperity, they are dependent on the restored health of the international
insurance industry. As a means of breaking free from the past, they hang on
three unpredictable processes: the way US courts handle liability cases; the
creation of a complex and potentially fragile vehicle to 'ring-fence' past
liabilities; and the successful resolution of the spate of lawsuits that
sets Name against Name and syndicate against syndicate.
Lloyd's can do little to influence the working of the US judiciary. It is
intimately involved in the other two processes, but its managers cannot
guarantee success in either. Even if they carry out their part of the
processes perfectly, either may be undone by the difficulty of reaching
agreement between a large number of people with fiercely conflicting
interests.
Names faced with acute financial pressure as a result of the market's past
excesses will find a frustrating contrast between the new management's
willingness to admit the errors of the old, and its inability to summon up
the resources necessary to compensate for them. That is, however, both a
more honest, and perhaps a more realistic, response than Lloyd's has
previously offered.
Mr Rowland and his colleague Mr Peter Middleton have no illusions about the
difficulty of the tasks they face. By making a break with the past, and
setting themselves explicit targets and timetables, they have given
themselves the right to ask for the support of the Lloyd's community in
general, and the goodwill of the litigating Names in particular. If Lloyd's
is to survive, that is the least they deserve.

FT  30 APR 93 / Leading Article: Competition on line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS something of an achievement that the European Commission has agreed on
any plan to liberalise the Community's telecommunications market in the face
of determined lobbying by many phone companies to protect their monopoly
positions. But the particular approach agreed this week is distinctly
unambitious and will saddle the European economy with an uncompetitive
telecommunications sector for much longer than is necessary. There is also a
risk that the plan could be further diluted, as it must receive the blessing
of the Council of Ministers before it becomes law.
The Commission's plan involves the abolition from 1998 of the phone
companies' monopolies to provide basic voice services, which account for
about 90 per cent of the Ecu 100bn (Pounds 78.7bn) a year market. (Data
communications and specialised voice services are already largely
liberalised.) The five-year delay is designed to appease the monopoly phone
companies and their governments, which in most cases still own them and act
as spokesmen for their interests.
Pressures from producer interests also explain the dilution of proposals
originally drawn up by the Commission's competition directorate. These would
have allowed competition in the provision of cross-border phone services
several years earlier and would have permitted infrastructure competition
for those services where monopoly rights have been abolished. The latter
idea would have appealed to groups such as cable television, railway and
electricity companies which already have telecommunications networks of
their own.
Public interest
The problem - as too often - is that producer interests have dominated and
the wider public interest has been marginalised. The decision on
telecommunications does not set an encouraging precedent, given that there
are other monopolies - particularly gas, electricity and post services - to
which the Commission should be turning its attention.
European businesses suffer a competitive disadvantage by comparison with
their US and Japanese counterparts, which enjoy competitive
telecommunications markets. Cross-border calls in Europe are between three
and six times as expensive as calls over a similar distance in the US, while
private circuit charges can be 10 or more times the price.
Domestic consumers
Nor has the monopoly served domestic customers well. In some countries,
consumers can wait six months to be connected to the network and, in regions
such as eastern Germany, the wait can be even longer. Unfortunately, the
Commission has bought the argument that the more backward a region or
country, the longer it should have to adjust to competition. The truth is
that the more backward a region the more desperately it needs competition so
that its infrastructure can be modernised more quickly.
It is not even clear that the system is good for the monopolists, as some -
the most recent convert appears to be France Telecom - realise. The absence
of competition explains why the European market is shrivelled by comparison
with America's. There are 20 per cent fewer phone lines per head of
population and each line is used only a third as much.
Innovations - such as freephone services, voice messaging, call-waiting and
call-forwarding - are also much more common on the other side of the
Atlantic. That is despite the fact that the Community has been pouring cash
into research projects such as Race which are designed to encourage the
development of an advanced communications infrastructure for Europe.
Europe cannot afford to continue like this. Telecoms companies obviously
need time to adjust to a new competitive regime. But that is no excuse for
endless delay. The companies should recognise that competitive markets are
in their long-run interests. If they fail to, consumers will have to speak
with louder voices. And politicians will have to liberate themselves from
the grip of their monopoly lobbies and articulate the wider public interest.

FT  30 APR 93 / Guardian of tradition: A battle for Britain's oldest Sunday
title
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few conspiracies succeed in the newspaper industry. Those involved cannot
help gossiping or boasting, the scheme leaks and is stifled before birth.
But a conspiracy involving a small number of senior journalists at the
Observer may have played a significant part in saving the paper, by steering
its idiosyncratic proprietor Mr Tiny Rowland, joint chief executive of
Lonrho, away from the embrace of Mr Andreas Whittam Smith of The Independent
and The Independent on Sunday and into the arms of The Guardian.
The group of journalists, fearful that the paper could be merged with The
Independent on Sunday, and lose its separate identity, have been talking
secretly to Guardian executives for many months.
Twice last year, in May and October, there were handshake agreements on a
sale to The Guardian, apparently with the knowledge and acquiescence of Mr
Rowland. On both occasions Tiny changed his mind and the deal was off.
The group moved fast last week when it looked as if Newspaper Publishing,
publisher of The Independent and its Sunday sister, was getting close to a
possible deal. Unlike The Guardian, it was able to offer a slice of equity
as well as cash.
A deliberately exaggerated version of events was leaked to the Evening
Standard, which led its front page with the story last Friday, saying the
Observer was in its death throes and that a sale to The Independent was
close.
Members of parliament were encouraged by Observer journalists to join the
debate last weekend, condemning any deal which would involve Britain's
oldest Sunday newspaper disappearing after nearly 202 years.
The Financial Times inadvertently played a role in the outcome. Mr Rowland,
it is believed, was furious after three executives from The Independent were
allowed into the FT printing plant last Saturday to see the Observer being
printed. The Observer is printed under a contract on the FT's presses in
London's Docklands which runs until January 1995.
But perhaps the most telling weapon used by Observer journalists was a
letter to Mr Rowland thanking him for all his efforts to sustain the paper
through its years of losses, but asking whether he wanted to go down in
history as the man who killed the Observer. It seems to have hit its target.
Although Mr Rowland no longer had the power or even perhaps the dermination
to prevent other Lonrho shareholders, such as Mr Dieter Bock, pushing ahead
with a sale, he did have the influence to help determine who the buyer
should be. Mr Bock is joint chief executive of Lonrho and its largest
shareholder.
Newspaper Publishing was told early yesterday that negotiations had been
broken off and that there would be an announcement later in the day. Talks
between Newspaper Publishing had failed to reach agreement on Wednesday.
Mr Whittam Smith said yesterday that he had never intended to close down the
Observer. There would have been, he insisted, a 'genuine union' involving
the staffs of both newspapers.
However, Mr Donald Trelford, editor of the Observer for 18 years, was
applauded when he told his journalists at 10.30am yesterday that Lonrho had
received an offer from The Guardian and Manchester Evening News 'which it
finds acceptable'. The offer, in effect an agreement subject to contract,
will be put to the Observer board on Tuesday and is likely to be accepted.
Neither side would disclose the terms, but it is believed to be worth about
Pounds 25m.
The deal is bad news for Newspaper Publishing. A merger could have created a
'non-right-wing' title with a circulation of about 750,000 which not only
would have been profitable but which might have challenged the dominance of
The Sunday Times for the first time in many years.
Newspaper Publishing yesterday announced pre-tax profits of more than Pounds
341,000 for the six months to March. It believes if it can be profitable in
a recession it can do even better in a recovery.
A Guardian-owned Observer is likely to increase competition in the
broadsheet Sunday market, which has been static or gently declining over the
past few years.
Few details of the new Observer could be confirmed yesterday, although Mr
Peter Preston, Guardian editor, told his staff that the paper would have a
'more distinct voice' than that of being merely The Guardian on Sunday.
Observer staff believe The Guardian will take on 60 to 65 of its 80
journalists and that there will continue to be a separate advertising
department.
The key question now is whether there is room for four broadsheet Sunday
newspapers. Senior Newspaper Publishing executives believe there is,
particularly now the market has been rising for the past two months.
Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times with a circulation of up to 1.26m
in recent weeks, says the battle between the Observer and The Independent on
Sunday has to be resolved before he faces a significant challenge.
In a reference to Scottish football teams, Mr Neil said yesterday: 'Brechin
City have to play Raith Rovers for the right to play Glasgow Rangers.' The
Sunday Times editor says he has many plans, including publication of the
Thatcher memoirs, to make his paper more impregnable before any big
circulation assault comes.
Newspaper consultant Mr Harold Lind said yesterday he was surprised that The
Guardian had not decided to wait until an Independent-Lonrho deal was turned
down by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Then, Mr Lind said, the
Observer could have been picked up for a knockdown price.
Competition between the Observer and The Independent on Sunday was now going
to be like the western front during the first world war. 'One more push and
we'll win by Christmas is their hope. Let's see which Christmas,' Mr Lind
said.
But in the Observer's Marco Polo building in Battersea last night there were
many happy journalists - some prepared to pay tribute to Mr Trelford for
keeping many of the Observer traditions alive; above all for keeping the
paper alive until it could find a new home.

FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: 'Game' of picking winners has worked well in east
Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW ALLCOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I hope that the leader writer responsible for 'Mr Heseltine's magic
lantern' (April 26) will have read Michael Prowse's adjacent article. While
the leader writer was concerned to draw attention to the 'unrewarding and
outdated game of picking industrial and technological Euro-winners', Mr
Prowse's article highlighted the positive aspects of just such action for
the successful Asian economies: 'Government played a big role (in their
economic success), trade was not open and financial markets were repressed .
. . The lesson from east Asia is that you need a government guiding hand:
you cannot just abdicate development to the private sector.' And the article
concludes, saying: 'The implication is that sufficiently determined
governments can work similar miracles in other places.'
Just because the UK is an old, established industrialised country, it does
not mean that it cannot or should not adopt the practices of successful
newcomers.
Indeed, the government is very fond of talking about the fact that UK
manufacturing industry has benefited from the imported working practices of
Japanese companies, for example. Quite right. But why should it, or your
leader writer, believe that other elements of Japanese or Asian practice are
not also suitable candidates for adoption?

FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: In defence of Attali's preference for marble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN A D LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your current enthusiasm for attacking Mr Jacques Attali and his
expensive toy, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, seems
to be seriously misdirected.
The essence of the criticism is that rather than lend huge amounts of
depositors' money to borrowers who are unlikely to repay any of it, Mr
Attali has chosen to invest his bank's limited resources in bricks and
mortar (or Carrara marble).
Given the disastrous record of most big international banks in trying to
make loans which are repaid, surely Mr Attali's policy should be commended?
Pawnbrokers and, until recently, building societies have coped quite
successfully with the intellectual challenges of money-lending. Bankers, on
the other hand, have in general failed abysmally and the least unsuccessful,
such as Mr Attali, have preferred to build palaces on the Bahnhofstrasse and
elsewhere, rather than to finance bankrupt countries, highly leveraged
management buy-outs or fantasy projects.
If Mr Attali's approach is considered too conservative by his shareholders,
no doubt Barclay's Mr Andrew Buxton could be drafted in to replace him and a
radical change in the bank's lending policy would then be assured.

FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: St Ethelburga must be fully restored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The virtual destruction of the ancient church of St Ethelburga on
Saturday morning ('Historic church reduced to rubble after 600 years', April
26) represents far more of a loss to the City than the loss of a few office
blocks which can easily, if somewhat expensively, be replaced.
St Ethelburga's is a symbol of the will of the City to survive and prosper
and the psychological boost of its complete restoration would both do
immeasurable good and send the clearest possible message to terrorists of
any description that the City's spirit is unbreakable.

FT  30 APR 93 / Howard's way on energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The thought that a spot of sunbathing this summer may give us skin cancer
serves to concentrate the mind. In November it scared governments into
agreeing at Copenhagen that the production of most chlorofluorocarbons will
be phased out by 1996, some years earlier than previously envisaged. This -
the fear factor - is the first law of environmental policy. We do respond to
threats, as with the news that the ozone layer over Europe is thinning out.
Believe me, restrictions on CFC substitutes, some of which also destroy
ozone, will follow the next upward blip in the graph of reported cancers.
There is no similar bogey that might have such a dramatic effect on the
burning of coal, oil, gas or other fossil fuels. The threat of global
warming is neither clear nor imminent. The damage will not begin to be felt
until the middle of the next century. The most serious harm comes much
later. Yet 'do nothing' is not a serious option. Mr Norman Lamont may still
be chancellor on April 30 2093 but everything else will be different. 'Do
nothing' would probably result in the planet, and our own species, being
afflicted by a mostly adverse change in climate patterns.
If human behaviour was rational the precautionary principle would therefore
inform the actions of individuals and governments alike. Emissions of
greenhouse gases would be steadily reduced in order to minimise global
warming over a long period. Humans are, however, irrational. We enjoy
ourselves that way. This devalues the government's presumption in favour of
using economic instruments to reduce emissions of CO. For the market alone
will not save the global environment. It depends too much upon rational
decisions by the mythical robot known as 'economic man'. We lunatics have to
be bribed, cajoled or coerced. into reducing our consumption of energy.
Just how much of the mix the British polity will take will be debated in
London next Friday at a conference called by Mr Michael Howard, secretary
for the environment. This exercise in open government is aimed at producing
a British strategy for meeting the country's commitment to reduce CO and
other greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000, as agreed at last
year's Earth Summit in Rio. There is no need to get carried away by this.
Britain is responsible for just a twentieth of the world's emissions. It can
do little on its own. It might, however, do a lot if it became a model of
both economic and green behaviour. Then when it tries to press a particular
strategy on, say, China, it can argue from example.
Mr Howard's conference papers will address three broad possibilities. First
comes voluntary action, such as a partnership agreement between the
chemicals industry and the government on monitoring energy efficiency.
Further specific taxes, such as the extension of value added tax to domestic
heating fuels, are not ruled out. Yet we all know that the chancellor does
not favour a specific carbon tax. Other mechanisms, such as regulation, come
third.
The last should be placed first. The limits of both the price mechanism and
voluntary behaviour became clear to me on Tuesday. Always a sucker for
seminars on greenhouse gas emissions, I could not resist an invitation from
Green College Oxford. This charming institution owes its name to its
founder, not Tuesday's subject matter, although the college does house a
centre for environmental policy.
The talks after the first coffee break, as ever the ones for which I am most
awake, should be reprinted and forwarded to the environment secretary. For
example, Dr Mary Archer, chairman of the National Energy Foundation, told of
a marketing exercise aimed at selling home energy ratings. These estimate
payback periods for various ways of insulating your house. A bargain deal on
ratings at Pounds 50 a throw was advertised on regional TV, but the results
were disappointing. Plenty of 'awareness' was created, but few orders.
Then Dr Brenda Boardman, research fellow at Oxford's environmental change
unit, rattled out some fascinating figures of her own. Rational householders
would all insulate their lofts tomorrow. It is cheap, and the payback is
quick. Yet between 1974 and 1989 only 17 per cent of 9.3m insulated
properties in Britain laid the woolly stuff in their attics as a result of
private initiative. The rest is there because it is obligatory in new
buildings, or because there has been a government grant, or because it was
installed by the landlord - usually in the public sector. Annual value:
Pounds 40m. Against that about 7m homeowners spent some Pounds 1.4bn a year
on double glazing, the 'energy-saving' measure with the most unlikely
payback ever. This was entirely the market at work: we can all picture the
salesmen and their lists of mostly spurious reasons for installation. I
bought some myself, fool that I am.
Very well, you might say, individuals have their own reasons for buying
things. Industrialists are more sensible. Perhaps. But Dr Tim Jackson of the
Stockholm Environment Unit showed us slides depicting savings made by
various energy-efficiency strategies, such as switching fuels (greatest
saving) to advanced coal technology (additional cost). He then flashed a
slide showing no savings at all. He had simply changed the discount rate in
his model. The moral is clear. When Mr Howard flourishes an agreement for
voluntary action by this or that energy-intensive industry, or when he talks
of tradeable pollution permits, ask the simple question - at what rate of
interest?
Please do not conclude from all this that I see no value in the price
mechanism, particularly when it is manipulated by adding green taxes or
subsidies. The switch to unleaded fuel is an example of how this can work.
Voluntary action also has its place, as with the growing fashion for taking
rubbish to recycling points. But stop there. At Oxford Dr Philip Goodwin of
the university's transport studies unit, said that the average out-of-town
supermarket is filled by seven 38-ton lorries every day - and emptied by
5,000 cars. Multiply the mileage, and, I would add, take in an extra 20 per
cent for trips to recycling depots, and bang goes your CO reduction plan.
The government will have to regulate. If it shrinks from that, there is one
possibility left: nuclear power.

FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: Survival of the Travelcard after bus deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G E HUTCHINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your transport correspondent recently reported on the proceedings of
the cross-party Commons transport committee indicating that the London
Travelcard was likely to disappear after the planned deregulation of London
bus services.
This disappointing prospect compares unfavourably with the position in Tyne
and Wear where the Travelcard scheme has survived and developed since bus
services were de-regulated in 1986. The Travelcard scheme in Tyne and Wear
is open to all 30 or so public transport operators (bus, rail, metro and
ferry) and a revenue sharing arrangement is in place.
The key features of the Travelcard scheme in Tyne and Wear are that it has a
commercially sound basis of sharing and that it is operated by a company
owned by the local public transport operators.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was extremely concerned to read your report (April 22) that the new
chief executive of London Transport was predicting the death of the
Travelcard in London once buses are deregulated.
I was responsible at London Transport for the launch of the Travelcard and
the marketing of it for the first three years of its existence. I think it
is useful to remember the main objectives of the Travelcard's introduction.
to provide a period ticket that would be more economic for the commuter than
paying the single journey fare every day, thereby encouraging people to
pre-purchase for one week, four weeks or longer, meaning fewer transactions
and hence fewer queues at booking offices as well as providing a cashflow
advantage to London Transport.
to promote public transport in off-peak hours when the Underground and buses
have extra capacity. This encourages not only additional journeys,
particularly in central London to destinations such as Oxford Street with
the resulting benefits to retailers there, but also encourages general use
of public transport when the alternative is to stay at home or use the car.
The tickets proved and still prove to be extremely popular and have done a
lot to maintain public transport's market share in London (markedly
different to experiences in conurbations outside London where bus
deregulation has now been in place for nearly seven years).
They have resulted in a higher proportion of the population not only using
public transport on a regular basis but being aware of a greater part of the
public transport network than that required just for their journey to work.
If people really believe in public transport and wish to see its market
share increased, then on no account should they create the conditions under
which multioperator and multimodal tickets would cease to be available to
the travelling public.

FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: Pro Ned's future role in non-executive selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN ST JOHNSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In welcoming your review of Pro Ned's first 10 years (April 26), I would
like to make two further points. Yes, the non-executive message has been
received but appointments are far too often made in an amateur way where
selection starts with the man rather than the job.
The boards of many UK-listed companies still have to be persuaded of the
benefits of a thorough and professional selection procedure which is
understood and respected. Our research (July 1992) showed that only a third
of non-executive appointments in the previous 12 months were made with the
help of professional advisers. Pro Ned was involved in half of these.
Research also revealed that more than half of non-executive directors
believe they could be more effective. Companies must therefore be encouraged
to provide the conditions which allow non-executive directors to contribute
fully to boardroom debate.
Pro Ned's role is clear: we will continue to provide guidance on practice,
roles and responsibilities; we will continue to provide the most
comprehensive client-driven register and search facility in the UK; and we
will continue to promote the benefits of appointing independent
non-executive directors through an open and respected process.

FT  30 APR 93 / Arts: A pot pourri of pleasures - Art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing quite like the Bowes Museum at Barnard Castle. With its
massive stone facade, 100 yards long and 100 feet high, it looks as if an
ornate French chateau - or some grand, provincial Hotel de Ville  - has been
transported, formal park and all, to the edge of a small market town in
County Durham in northern England.
Inside the imposing granite hall, the first object that the visitor
encounters is a life-size silver swan automaton devised by JJ Merlin, an
eccentric 18th century 'Mechanick' and inventor whose other contributions to
the pleasures of mankind include the pianoforte-harpsichord and the
rollerskate.
In daily performances the graceful silver bird appears to swim in a glass
pool that convincingly creates the illusion of moving water. It preens its
feathers and swoops to catch a fish which is seen wriggling in its bill. The
swan raises its head, displays its trophy, and then gobbles it up. That this
is no ordinary museum is apparent from the start.
Automata, toys and clocks form one of many lesser collections. The Bowes is
a pot pourri of period rooms, remarkable Old Master pictures, French
porcelain, furniture and textiles, metalwork and glass, books and
manuscripts. Here, outstanding 17th century Flemish tapestries and a
glorious GB Tiepolo rub shoulders with a mass of lesser wares hoovered up
wholesale at the great international exhibitions. It is a fascinating period
piece reflecting the eclectic taste of its founders, John Bowes, and his
French wife Josephine, and of the opportunities afforded by the art market
in the mid and late 19th century.
A visit to the 29 paintings currently on loan to the National Gallery in
London while the Bowes picture galleries are closed for re-wiring is a pale
substitute for a trip to Teeside. Yet even this small selection succeeds in
reflecting the quality and breadth of this highly unusual collection.
Moreoever, the show brings to the capital pictures of a type not to be found
elsewhere in England.
John Bowes began his collecting career conventionally enough. (As the
illegitimate son of the 10th Earl of Strathmore he was to inherit his
father's estate but not his title, in spite of the latter's death-bed
marriage.) His first purchase, aged 19, was a Temptation of St Anthony
believed to be by Teniers; his second, a boar hunt by Snyders. The 1840s saw
him branch out into the Italian school, paying, for instance, Pounds 25 for
the grandiose and mannered 'Rape of Helen' by a follower of Primaticcio, and
9.5 guineas for Solario's delightfully fantastical 'St Jerome in the
Wilderness'.
Sassetta's glowing 'Miracle of the Holy Sacrament' was a mere Pounds 6 15s.
This Sienese predella panel of the 1420s presents an account of a Carmelite
lay brother struck dead at Communion, presumably because he doubted the real
presence of Christ in the Eucharist. While the Host gorily bleeds on its
paten, a black devil flies in through the window to pull a ghostly soul out
of the brother's mouth. Sassetta's church interior, studded with gold-ground
altarpieces, and his elegant group of onlookers in contemporary dress,
provides an informal insight into the life of the time.
The unexpected was provided in 1862 when the collection of the late Conde de
Quinto, formerly director of the National Museum of Paintings in Madrid,
became available on the Paris market. Bowes had already begun to entertain
the idea of establishing a public museum. Some 75 out of its 217
predominantly Spanish pictures were eventually acquired through the dealer
Benjamin Gogue. Many of those acknowledged today as masterpieces were bought
as wall-filling job-lots to the now discredited heavyweights.
Witness the most compelling picture in the show. In 'The Tears of St Peter',
El Greco reproduces through oil and pigment the anguish and repentence of
the faithful disciple overcome with sorrow for having denied Christ. This is
no typical Counter Reformation performance of sentimental, dewy-eyed
hand-wringing. El Greco spurns the standard histrionics. Instead, he
exploits the tension of contrasts, the painterly gesture and the emotive
power of colour - harsh blues and sulphurous yellows - to give force to the
anguish of St Peter's soul.
To our eyes, it is a profoundly sincere and affecting image by this most
idiosyncratic of painters. For Bowes, El Greco was an artist whose star had
not yet soared into the ascendant. He purchased the canvas for 200 francs,
around Pounds 8.
Two small Goyas also find their way to London. There is the sensitive
portrait of his friend, the poet and lawyer Melendez Valdes. 'An Interior of
a Prison' is a grim indictment of man's inhumanity. The last great treat of
the show is the 18th century French painting - not only the highly
decorative Boucher and Hubert Robert (seen through blue- and rose-tinted
spectacles respectively) but the classical landscapes and genres by the
likes of the wonderfully named Achille-Etna Michallon and Granet, artists
most familiar in this country for their fresh, outdoor oil sketches.
An appropriate postscript is Courbet's 'View of Ornans', purchased the year
after it was painted in 1864 and perhaps the first work by the Realist
master to enter a British collection.
The exhibition continues at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square,
London, until June 20. The picture galleries at the Bowes Museum re-open at
the end of October.

You sometimes get the impression that British terrestrial television is
deliberately trying to make life easy for the satellite and cable people.
Glance across Britain's four main networks in peak viewing time tonight,
nine o'clock, say, and what do you find? On BBC1 a party political broadcast
followed by the news. On BBC2 snooker. On ITV The Chief and on Channel 4
Grow Your Greens. If you are hooked on events at the Crucible no doubt
BBC2's offering will enthrall you. If not, and entertainment is your aim,
then ITV's police series is the only choice. At least The Chief is a
superior example, with Tim Pigott-Smith being succeeded today by Martin Shaw
in the key role of Eastland's Chief Constable. Remember Shaw as Doyle in
'The Professionals'? Hasn't he done well? Kaleidoscope (9.15 Radio 4)
considers the way that 'sculpture is colonising our town squares' (something
new?) And in Michael Bakewell's play A Sorceress Of Her Time, Jane Lapotaire
plays Alma Mahler, who managed to marry - successively - Gustav Mahler,
Walter Gropius and Franz Werfel (10.30 Radio 3).

FT  30 APR 93 / Arts: Gruber's marvellous confection - London Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mahler's death-haunted Das Lied von der Erde was preceded, in the London
Philharmonic concert on Tuesday, by HK Gruber's 'pan-demonium' cabaret
Frankenstein]] from 1978. Bizarre, but not unreasonable - granted a long
interval between them, which there was: though Gruber is a wild card, even
at his jokiest he embodies a deep Viennese continuity. Mahler too had a
sense of humour, not so very different.
The planners of the 'Alternative Vienna' series may have missed a trick by
not putting this programme first. In a pretty well-filled Festival Hall, the
audience - of whom some unknown but sizeable proportion must have come for
Das Lied - were evidently entranced and delighted by Gruber's marvellous
confection, as audiences invariably are. It was a pity that they had already
missed his Cello Concerto last Saturday, and had only 24 hours' notice for
his Violin Concerto no. 1 ('aus schatten duft gewebt', 'woven from the scent
of shadows') which Ernst Kovacic played on Wednesday with the London
Sinfonietta. After all, it was Frankenstein]] that revealed to a wider
public that something quite original was going on in Vienna.
A few shellbacks make it a point of honour to resist Gruber's blandishments
(a chap in front of me stalked out after the third or fourth song), some of
them old-style conservatives and some severe modernists, who can all agree
that he is slumming. Yet this off-the-wall entertainment, set to wicked
'children's verses' by HC Artmann, fairly wriggles with bright twists on
familiar tropes, popular and classical alike; makes inspired play with
toy-instruments; relies shamelessly upon the composer's own ripe
idiosyncrasies as chansonnier - and yet fixes the goal-posts for a serious
new game.
Franz Welser-Most conducted it sympathetically, though without the flair and
crackle that Simon Rattle bestowed on its Liverpool premiere. In the event,
the subversive charms of Frankenstein]] were enhanced by contrast with
Welser-Most's lacklustre Das Lied: better than his spavined Mahler Ninth
last week, but still stiff and short-breathed - as he left his tenor Thomas
Sunnegardh, starved of air by his unrelenting beat. The mezzo was Doris
Soffel, whose clarion eloquence wanted softer edges for 'Von der Schonheit'
and the visionary Abschied.
Next night in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Gruber himself conducted his
ravishing violin concerto: all its fey excursions generated with cogent
fantasy, and in Bergian shot-silk textures, from a tender pop song of his
own which is revealed only at the close. Kovacic, its dedicatee, played it
sweetly and soulfully, rejoicing in the stratospheric new flights the
composer devised to flank the final song fore and aft.
Gruber also led, and was heard in (both live and on tape), the Groove Music
of young Lukas Ligeti, son of the celebrated Gyorgy. Jazzy material - much
like Michael Torke's and mostly loud - was distributed among the performers,
following different computer click-tracks on their own earphones, which
ensured that their disparate paths would crisscross regularly and
resoundingly. Plenty of raw, candid energy, less of finesse; at some 22
minutes, slightly overstretched.
That concert began and ended with vintage Kurt Schwertsik, Gruber's senior
colleague and incessant inquirer. For his 1974 Music from Mu ('Mu' was a
mythical Pacific Atlantis, the terrain of '30s novels by Colonel Churchward)
he drew upon his investigations of Javanese music to create a pithy, pawky
sound-world in little. The Sinfonietta brought it to palpable life.
Eight years later Schwertsik wrote a fairytale opera after Brentano, Das
Marchen von Fanferlieschen Schonefusschen - 'The Wondrous Tale of
Fanferlizzy Sunnyfeet' - which has been travelling Europe ever since (Paul
Driver reviewed it warmly on this page when it reached south London a year
or two ago). Its interludes add up to a delectable sequence: laconic, funny
and various, affectionately backward-looking but fractured, and scored for
an off-balance ensemble that establishes its own suave terms. The nearest
comparison that comes to mind is Walton's Facade Suite - but I could listen
to these Schwertsik 'Transformation Scenes' much more often, expecting fresh
post-modernist disclosures every time.

FT  30 APR 93 / Arts: Just a comic-strip Moll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a good idea to stage Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders; I can easily
imagine a big production along the lines of the RSC's Nicholas Nickleby. And
it would have been a bright idea to set it to music, were there a composer
with the talent for it. Moll Flanders (1722) is the English counterpart to
the Abbe Prevost's Manon Lescaut (1733). Both Moll and Manon are women who
learn how to use sex and crime (and to forgo love) for economic gain. Both
are departed to the New World. But whereas Manon - whose fatal allure
appealed so much to the Romantics - has acquired famous reincarnations in
opera and ballet, Moll, a more liberated lady who is in firmer control of
her own destiny, is too little known. .
But here the writer Claire Luckham has told Defoe's richly adult tale as if
Moll were a strip-cartoon for 14-year-olds. Everything is all narrative,
silly tableaux, and more narrative, with the odd bubble of live dialogue
(sung) popping out of the characters' heads. Only when Moll returns for the
last time to London, and discovers thieving, does the show stop treating the
18th century in terms of cheap caricature; and, as with so many inferior
musicals, the most gripping moments are spoken. Paul Leigh's lyrics are in
wiseguy rhymester vein. They have a certain satirical energy which - though
it grows tedious overall - animates such episodes as Moll's arrival in Bath.
A good composer might just have injected this libretto with enough lyricism
to make it winning. But George Stiles's score - partly based, along The
Beggar's Opera lines, on period tunes - is deft and negligible. The only
tune that could stay in your head is good old Greensleeves, which becomes
Moll's and Jemmy's big love tune; and even that is cut up into short phrases
and rearranged so that it never opens into full bloom. This is a musical
conceived by people who do not love singing.
What I hate about Peter James's direction is that it so caricatures Moll's
world that any kind of serious, fully-fleshed-out playing would be
unstylish. The crudest, playing onstage comes from Issy Van Randwyck, but I
came to be almost grateful for her sheer energy in a largely underpowered
show. In the only episode that the show treats with any 3-D humanity, Angela
Richards gives the thieves' agent Mother Midnight a brooding eloquence.
As Moll, Josie Lawrence gives Moll no character. She goes through the
motions, either in sardonic or earnest mood. But this Moll is just a bland
girl caught up in a naughty world. And her singing and acting are all in
dull shades of grey.
At the Lyric, Hammersmith, until May 22.

FT  30 APR 93 / Arts: Enthralling Ariodante - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports of death, or at least a serious wasting disease, at the English
National Opera have been piling up this season, the last under the artistic
triumvirate of Jonas, Elder and Pountney. On the evidence of the new
Ariodante, they have been exaggerated.
Wednesday's account of Handel's 1735 Italian opera - one of his three based
on Ariosto's Orlando furioso, one of his most original and beautiful -
lashed out with powerful theatrical vitality. At every moment alarming risks
were taken and disquietingly intense, complex states were being searched
out. On such an evening the ENO could be seen and heard to recover the form
established in its keynote productions of recent years.
Musically, the performance, scrupulously prepared, was delivered with
notable (if not uniform) virtuosity and fidelity to the score - all of it,
lasting four engrossing hours, and including the ballet episodes. And
dramatically, the modern re-imagining of Handel's opera seria dramaturgy
demonstrates, I insist, its own fidelity - to the spirit, if not the letter,
of the notes and words.
It is not a 'sure-fire' Ariodante that David Alden and his associates
(designer, Ian MacNeil, lighting director, Wolfgang Gobbel) have devised.
The style essayed is not the supremely civilised late-20th-century survey of
18th-century modes and manners achieved by Nicholas Hytner in Xerxes, the
previous Handel production at the Coliseum. People who have kept apace with
Alden's work on this stage would hardly expect it to be; surreal dislocation
is his well-documented forte. What may surprise them are the new elements in
his production vocabulary: a new design-partner (the Olivier Award-winner
for the National's An Inspector Calls) has encouraged him to shed the bare
light-bulb, tiled bathroom wall and kitchen chair that have provided the
identificatory flourishes to the Alden signature, and work up a fresh surge
of theatricality.
The atmosphere of Ariodante is unique. The libretto (drawn by Antonio Salvi
from the same tale in Orlando furioso that inspired Much Ado about Nothing)
is focused on a single act of carefully planned treachery, yet shows
pastoral warmth, courtly delicacy, romantic ardour, irony, pathos, and
tragic agony, all in full-blending co-existence. It permitted Handel to move
through the entire range without clash or absurdity, creating a drama of
conflicting emotions that is as 'personal', as intimately charged, as any in
opera.
In Alden's and MacNeil's re-invention, it all takes place under (and, in one
scene, upon) a mobile segment of Baroque ceiling, frescoed and corniced,
which - like much else in the decor and costumes - infuses controlled bursts
of brilliant colour into the theatrical pattern. Its action defines the
production hallmark: 18th-century shapes and figures, wrenched out of
'period' context and on to a 1993 stage, now fiercely, now with hypnotised
slowness, with the purpose of heightening the intensity, and often the
disturbing ambiguity, of Handel's emotional spectrum.
In common with Alden's ENO versions of A Masked Ball and Bluebeard's Castle
 -outstanding productions both - this show is full of startling visual
sleights-of-hand, movement-mannerisms developing thematic function and also
a dangerous potential for audience irritation. Acts of violence are
plentiful. Moments of dream-fantasy (such as those tormenting the betrayed
heroine Ginevra in the remarkable finale of Act 2) are horribly -
gratuitously? - vivid. The opera's architectural variety, and the lighter
moods that come to re-inforce it, find little representation. On the other
hand, I have experienced few Handel productions based on a more tautly woven
ensemble of flesh-and-blood characters.
Many Handelians will loathe this Ariodante. They have my understanding, even
sympathy: Alden, even at his peculiar, idiosyncratic best, has always
excited passionate response. For Nicholas McGegan, an experienced Handel
opera-conductor making a belated debut at a London opera-house, there will
surely be praise all but unstinted. In so big a theatre, with a
modern-instrument band disposed in so deep a pit, he had passing difficulty
holding voices and instruments together; but the vitality of sound, with
each astonishing rhythmic inflection and streak of colour given its due
weight of emphasis, afforded the production a wonderfully secure and solid
basis.
In the title role Ann Murray enjoys the latest of her London Handel
triumphs; early on she seemed a mite below best form, putting too much
verismo into 'Scherza infida', but then bringing absolute authority to the
light-after-dark final aria. Amanda Roocroft, vulnerable and touching as the
tragic Ginevra, continues to develop her richly endowed soprano - more
clarity is still needed in low-lying phrases, more verbal thrust everywhere.
Lesley Garrett (Dalinda) and Christopher Robson (Polinesso), ENO Handelians
of masterly stage authority, draw sharp, strong lines in the schemers'
roles: both offer moments of uneven tonal emission, whole stretches of
superlatively singing-acting. Only the ill-equipped bass King counts as a
weakness.
Amanda Holden's new translation strikes me as a shade less skilful than
usual: well-shaped phrases sit alongside less singable ones, and one or two
of pure translatorese. Even so, opera in the language of the audience is a
cause well served by this latest example. I found this Ariodante enthralling
from start to finish, warts and all. I cannot imagine anyone left
indifferent to it.
Supported by ENO Trust: in repertory at the London Coliseum until June 10.

FT  30 APR 93 / Technology: Prudential lightens up - A simple software
rethink that is saving Pounds 13.5m a year and giving customers a friendlier
service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From next month, customers of the Prudential, Britain's biggest life
insurance company, should notice an improvement in their annual statements.
Gone will be bulky standard documents and booklets. In their place will be
prettier, slimmer forms, each one containing only information that affects
the addressee.
It is the realisation of an 18-month marketing project to simplify what
customers receive. But behind the marketing revamp lies a simple software
rethink that will save the company more than Pounds 13.5m a year in staff
and printing costs.
The Pru's marketing department began research on Operation Facelift in 1991.
The aim was to make friendlier the notoriously complicated forms it sent out
to existing customers.
At the same time, it wanted to change the way such forms were produced.
Traditionally, the Pru sends out its 3m annual statements on 49 different
kinds of pre-printed form. It overprints on to each form a statement on the
customer's pension plan or life policy.
It wanted to be able to produce both pre-printed and statement information
simultaneously. Statements would then be printed only when needed.
'We wanted a kind of just-in-time delivery in the financial services
market,' says Keith Hicks, brand communications manager. By last spring, the
marketing department had decided on specifications for the new product. But
the computer department baulked at the prospect of rewriting the software.
'Our software is like an archaeological dig, with 17 or 18 layers that we
have built up since the late 1960s,' says Andrew Pinder, director of systems
and business operations.
Worse than that, he says, each category of product - such as pension plans
or life policies - has its own software, written in different languages,
some now obsolete. 'If we want to change anything, it's very laborious. It
made a lot of sense to try to find something to overlay the archaeological
dig.'
The task then was to find a single program to fit between all the financial
programs and the printing machines. The company began to hunt for an
off-the-shelf document processing package that could be bolted on to its IBM
mainframe.
By the summer of 1992, the Pru had narrowed the search down to two packages:
Documerge, from Texan company Image Sciences, and Custom Statement Formatter
(CSF) from M&amp;I Data Services of Wisconsin. The Pru ran an in-house
evaluation looking at, among other things, ease of amending documents,
consumption of computer time, how well each package created the documents,
ease of slotting in the new software and cost of maintenance.
The final choice was CSF, which, at roughly Pounds 100,000, was several tens
of thousands of pounds cheaper than its rival.
The design point of the software is that the size of the horizontal
divisions is determined by the amount of information that needs to go into
the space. But the change also produced savings in two main areas.
The Pru's annual printing bill was Pounds 30m. Half of that was on
contracted-out lithographic printing for booklets and pre-printed forms. All
the litho work has now been transferred on to in-house laser printers.
Meanwhile, the efficiency of the in-house printing has improved. Previously,
printing machines had to be stopped frequently to switch the paper feed
between any of the 49 preprinted forms. There is now only one type of
pre-printed sheet.
Even though the litho print work is now done in-house, the result of the
change is that eight laser printers on two sites have been reduced to six on
one. There is also no need now to keep large stocks of each of the different
types of form, saving on delivery time, storage and handling.
Paper consumption itself is being cut by between half and two-thirds. The
pre-printed forms were designed to be overprinted with statement information
for any customer, however large. This meant that the forms needed large
spaces under each heading. With the new software, the space under each
heading varies to fit each customer's information (see graphic).
The second area of savings was staff. For example, the laser printers
include a barcode on each statement sheet to tell letter stuffing machines
which extra leaflets should be included for any customer. Previously much of
this work was done manually.
The new set-up also needs fewer computer programmers. The software allows
changes to documents across the range of products, so there is no need for
specialist print program writers working separately on each product.
And time and money are saved in the introduction of any new designs. Before,
each new design meant a new contract with outside printers and the dumping
of obsolete stocks.
The new program is still far from perfect. The marketing department has to
take its designs to the computer department for re-programming. There are
plans to improve this by installing a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (wysiwyg)
screen so that new designs can be plugged straight into the printing
software.
Nor is printer technology yet being properly exploited. The Pru's printers
still use 'line mode' whereas the latest lasers have a 'page mode' which
allows entire pages to be printed at once.
Finally, the Pru is planning to move from IBM's mainframe operating system
MVS, which manages the working of the computer, to the rival Unix system
which works with computers from many manufacturers, not just IBM. CSF does
not yet work with Unix.
The Pru is the first insurance company in Europe to install the software,
although the European distributor, Geneva-based Lasercom, has sold it to
some private Swiss banks. According to Pinder, the Pru is earning 'a very
good rate of return in a sensitive part of the industry' on its software
investment. Hicks is blunter: 'I'm trying to persuade LaserCom not to sell
it to our competitors.'

Glass-maker Corning and disc drive specialist Seagate Technology have teamed
up to make a computer storage disc of glass, rather than the traditional

A voice-activated word processor is now available for less than Pounds
5,000. Developed in the UK by Shakespeare Speechwriter, the Compaq hardware
uses the latest Intel 486 to give dictation speeds of 30 words a minute.
The Speechwriter has a 80,000-word dictionary and users can add their own
catalogue of words.
To train the speaker-dependent system, the user says 200 words three times
each, from which the software extrapolates pronunciations for all the other
words in the dictionary.

<TEXT>
Companies with interlinked local and wide area networks invariably use
network management tools to warn them of network failure. But not all of
them use the tools to get optimal use from the network.
With this in mind, data-networking specialist Datarange, of High Wycombe, is
launching a service to help companies 'tune' their networks to get them
running as efficiently as possible. The solution could be as simple as
filtering out broadcast messages from PCs on neighbouring networks and
giving certain calls priority.

Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skiers could soon get a better run for their money if the industry harnesses
the latest in software.
A university lecturer, David Unwin, and student, Simeon Preston, have
developed a geographical information system which means up-to-date ski maps
can be produced on a weekly or daily basis. Developed initially for use in
Scotland's Cairngorm mountains, the system enables skiers to better plan
their downhill routes.
Eventually the developers say the GIS could have video capability, with
television screens at the bottom of major ski lifts so skiers could take a
simulated trip down a slope before deciding whether it really was for them.

The Home Series, developed by computer-aided design specialist Autodesk in
Seattle, uses two-dimensional Cad techniques to enable the amateur to plan
room lay-outs or even an extension. Measurements are accurate enough for an
architect or builder to work from.
Four modules are available for use with Dos-based PCs: home; kitchen;
bathroom; and landscape, for garden design. Each module, distributed in the
UK by Force 2 International, costs Pounds 59. Autodesk: US, 206 487 2233.

FT  30 APR 93 / Technology: Dial a court report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence is growing in England and Wales that some lawyers' clients are
paying for unintended repeat litigation of the same point in law because of
fundamental weaknesses in the traditional shambolic 'system' of law
reporting.
In some cases highlighted by Kenneth Bagnall QC, chairman of New Law
Publishing, contradictory conclusions are even being reached by courts
unaware of each others' decisions.
For centuries it has been up to private publishers like New Law Publishing
to decide which cases to report and when to publish their reports. This
means that although a court decision may set a binding precedent, the date
and the content of a judgment can be delayed for years, or go completely
unrecorded.
'We have a legal system with two legs, one of which is broken off at the
knee,' says Bagnall, who last year was asked by Lord Justice Neill, chairman
of the Information Technology for the Courts committee, to look at ways of
speeding up law reporting.
Now he believes he has found a solution using Mercury's Surefax automated
facsimile service. New Law scans written judgments into its computer system,
and types in relevant verbal judgments. The text is then edited and brief
digests based on a 'menu' of case types are drawn up. These are faxed to the
Surefax switch - a kind of automated fax exchange - using a code.
Initially New Law focused on real property and town planning cases, but has
expanded its service to commercial law, insolvency, shipping and
intellectual property cases among others.
The Surefax software maintains the list of subscribers' details and faxes
the relevant digests to them overnight. If a line is busy it is retried
until the fax goes through.
Next morning subscribers select those they are most interested in and can
then receive a fuller version of the judgment by fax. Subscribers, who are
expected to include the big City law firms, are billed according to usage.
Most subscribers prefer fax delivery, but an electronic mail alternative is
expected to be available in the future.

FT  30 APR 93 / People: More team-building at Yamaichi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is no secret that Yamaichi International plans to set up as a gilt-edged
market-maker once it gets the official go-ahead from the Bank of England. In
the meantime, the Japanese house has been busy buying up the City's gilts
talent so that it has a full team in place ready to start business once it
gets the green light. The latest addition to its stable is John Shepperd
(right), who has been appointed chief economist of the Japanese bank.
Shepperd's move strips SG Warburg Securities of its second gilts supremo in
less than six months. Earlier this year Nigel Richardson, former sidekick to
Shepperd in the gilts research department of Warburgs, joined Yamaichi as
head of bond research.
During his ten-year stint at Warburgs, Shepperd built up a considerable
reputation for himself as one of the market's key oracles. But at Yamaichi,
which he joins on July 1, his brief will be wider, concentrating on G7
economies and co-ordinating international economic research.
Yamaichi International lost its chief economist - Neil Mackinnon - to
Citibank at the end of last year. However, it has lost no time in poaching
various City gilts experts. It is understood that Jim Goodey, director of
NatWest Capital Markets, will join Yamaichi on the gilts side in mid-May.
Philip Tyson, a UK economist at UBS, recently joined as an international
economist.
Yamaichi clearly wants to move into the UK government bond market at a time
when the gilt market expects to see plenty of new issuance in order to meet
the PSBR. It seems likely that Yamaichi will get its authorisation from the
Bank of England either this summer or autumn once its full team is in place.
In the meantime it is scouting for gilt traders and salesmen.

FT  30 APR 93 / People: O&amp;Y's Spiers moves to RBS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stream of finance directors being appointed to banks from outside took a
twist yesterday with the announcement by Royal Bank of Scotland that it has
found a new finance chief from a most unlikely source. Despite the trouble
Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf development has caused banks over the past
couple of years, Royal Bank has recruited its finance director.
Robert Speirs of Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf is moving to Royal Bank from
July on the retirement of the bank's current finance director Kenneth
Thompson. Speirs (right)acknowledged the irony yesterday, but insisted that
he had learned some 'salutary lessons' from the property sector.
Both Speirs and Thompson believe the job of a bank finance director has
become more complex. They have to have a deep understanding of balance
sheets and treasury operations these days, according to Thompson, who joined
RBS in 1988 from Glaxo. 'I am not exactly sure what bank finance directors
used to do,' he says.
In recent years banks seeking finance directors have increasingly looked
outside for candidates with knowledge of capital markets and an
understanding of risk management. Richard Goeltz, who was appointed chief
financial officer of National Westminster last year, came from Seagram.
Speirs, who is 56, has Scottish connections from his time at Britoil, where
he was finance director before the company was taken over by British
Petroleum. He originally trained as a tax specialist with the Inland Revenue
before switching into finance and moved to O&amp;Y Canary Wharf in 1988.
'I think a bank finance director used to be the person who kept the books.
Now they are moving more towards the corporate way of doing things,' says
Speirs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Wilson, the former chief executive of corporate affairs at GPA, the
aircraft leasing company, has been appointed finance director of Waste
Management International, the UK-listed overseas arm of Waste Management of
the US.
Wilson, 36, is a former managing director of Stanhope Property and group
commercial director of Dixons.
The appointment is part of Waste Management International's desire to be
seen as a blue chip stock in the UK. The company, which operates in Europe
and Asia, last year offered 20 per cent of its equity to investors.
Although Wilson's tenure with GPA only lasted a year, his decision to leave
was a blow to the group's hopes to restructure its debts. He was primarily
responsible for the company's communication with the outside world and is
expected to use his good relationships with investors and bankers to produce
a bigger profit for Waste Management International outside the US,
particularly in Europe and the Far East.
Wilson says he is excited by environmental services which has become a
global business. WMI provies a range of solid and hazardous waste management
services.

FT  30 APR 93 / Management: The art of guesswork - Economic forecasters can
help companies predict where future profits lie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mick Marshall, economics manager at regional electricity supplier Midlands
Electricity, has just handed himself a 'Golden Guru' award. Marshall's
projection 18 months ago of how much electricity Midlands' customers would
use in 1992-93 turned out accurate to within 1 per cent, enabling the
company to gain maximum value from its power contracts.
Kevin Mahoney, managing director of double-glazing company Caradon Everest,
is similarly pleased. With an economic model of the hard-hit UK home
improvements industry, he correctly diagnosed the broad trends in the sector
over the past year, helping him to stabilise sales through cutting prices.
At the Prudential insurance company, strategist John Cozens says his company
made a 'very good' return last year on its Pounds 57bn asset portfolio,
partly due to its foresight in converting a significant amount of its
sterling holdings into other currencies months ahead of September's
devaluation.
These examples underline the potential for increasing business success by
guessing correctly the path of economic events. In each case, the decisions
owe much to companies' use of economic consultancy, a sector which has
boomed despite the recession.
The trend has been helped by moves within industry to contract out more
specialised services on grounds of lower cost and improved flexibility.
Partly because of rivalry among the consultancies, many offer services on
the basis of what looks like good value for money.
The typical cost of buying in a full economic service from a consultancy -
taking in quarterly forecasts, reports on specific trends and access to a
computer model of regional economies or specific industries - is perhaps
Pounds 10,000 a year. That works out at around one sixth of the cost of
hiring a full-time in-house economist. Many consultancies offer services for
even less, based around individual meetings with clients or regular reports.
One frequent advantage is that the customer can 'plug in' to a network of
other businesses which use the same consultancy. This happens through
seminars and other meetings. Leslie Gunde, chief economist at engineering
group GKN, says his company spends 'a few thousand pounds' a year on
services from Oxford Economic Forecasting, a UK consultancy. One spin-off is
gaining access to ideas from other Oxford clients - which are in areas as
diverse as computers, chemicals and banking.
The move towards using economics consultancies has also been aided -
somewhat paradoxically - by the unpredictability of recent economic events.
Few economists foresaw the seriousness of the UK recession, the impact of
the demise of communism or the high European interest rates which followed
German reunification.
Yet the uncertainties surrounding such changes have demonstrated the
importance of having as robust a view as possible of what may lie ahead. 'In
the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,' says Doug McWilliams,
head of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a four-strong
consultancy which he started last year after a career as economic adviser at
the Confederation of British Industry.
It was McWilliams to whom Mahoney of Caradon Everest turned when he wanted a
computerised model of the Pounds 2bn-a-year home improvements business,
based on supply of double glazing for doors, windows and conservatories. For
about Pounds 12,000, McWilliams provided computer software built up from
consumer studies and sales data. The model predicted the 15 per cent decline
in sales in the industry in the past year, a drop which Mahoney says has now
levelled off amid signs of fragile recovery: 'It was a real help in our
decision-making.'
Midlands Electricity also used a computer model to simulate demand for
electricity by its 2.1m customers. This was based on work by Business
Strategies, a consultancy which specialises in UK regions and which charges
Midlands about Pounds 20,000 a year.
At the Prudential, the 18-strong global policy unit in which Cozens works
uses the services of several economic consultancies, including the London
Business School's centre for economic forecasting, Oxford Economic
Forecasting and Tim Congdon's Lombard Street Research. Cozens says the
outsiders are 'a comfort factor' which provides a check on in-house
opinions. These views supported the suspicions of Pru economists last year
that the UK would be forced to give up its fight to stay inside the European
exchange rate mechanism.
The UK division of International Business Machines is another member of the
16-company group - including Barclays Bank, the PosTel investment group, Sun
Life and Salomon Brothers - which collaborates with the LBS on its
thrice-yearly forecasts.
Keith Telford, IBM's economist, says he finds invaluable the sharing of
ideas with a wider group: 'The specific numbers in the forecasts are less
important than the framework for trying to understand broad trends.'
This point has not been lost on the UK Treasury, which has been severely
criticised for the inaccuracy of its recent forecasts and is considering
whether to contract out the supervision of its computerised model of the UK
economy. Such a move, some believe, could improve forecasting accuracy and
lead to greater openness in the Treasury's debate on the economy.
Discussions about this possibility took place in January between the
Treasury and DRI, a big US consultancy.
If they reach a deal, the UK government would be replicating what already
happens in many parts of the private sector. At United Distillers, part of
the Guinness drinks group, the job of preparing economic projections which
take in a broad view of social and consumer trends is left to Henley, one of
the biggest UK economics consultancies. Another Henley customer is the
Vauxhall car group, which asked the consultancy to prepare a Pounds 50,000
report on the potential market for its Frontera sports vehicle, launched two
years ago.
With the range of services on offer - the accompanying table, incidentally,
does not claim to be comprehensive - companies can shop around for the
consultancy which suits them best. ICI, for instance, left the LBS group for
Oxford some years ago on the grounds that the latter gave a better view of
world trends.
Meanwhile Unilever, the big consumer products group, is examining the three
consultancies it currently uses - LBS, Oxford and the US consultancy WEFA -
with a view to dropping two of them in a bid to cut costs. However, Tony
Romeo, Unilever's head of economics, says whichever consultancy it decides
to concentrate on will continue to play a useful role in helping to give
Unilever a wider view of the world.

Technological know-how is an asset on any board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Shareholder activism is generally associated with institutional investors
such as the big US pension funds that have recently told companies to trim
executive pay and appoint more non-executive directors.
Yet as International Business Machines, the world's largest computer
company, found out this week, individual investors holding only a few
hundred shares can also rock the boat.
About 2,500 IBM shareholders, many of them retired employees of the company,
attended IBM's annual meeting in Tampa, Florida earlier this week. Angry and
frustrated by the 50 per cent drop in the value of their shares over the
past year, they pilloried the company's directors with questions about their
competence.
The board is 'too insulated and too old' one elderly shareholder charged, to
applause from the crowd. 'Most of them come from the era of manual
typewriters and carbon paper.' Another accused directors of operating an
'old boy network' and having been management cheerleaders, rather than
shareholders' watchdogs.
'If I were a director I would be embarrassed to even show up here and have
my name on the list to be elected,' said Gilbert Jannelli, a shareholder who
said that he had already sold 90 per-cent of his shares. 'How can you work
with that group of people when their attitudes and decisions and trusting
manners have caused this company's rapid demise?' he asked Louis Gerstner,
IBM's new chairman and chief executive.
'(The board) surely lacks the pertinent current knowledge, skills and vision
to deal with and add value to and guide IBM. I believe the board should have
current chief information officers of companies, current deans of
engineering schools, and current entrepreneurs, people who are really up to
date,' said another.
Although IBM board nominees were ultimately elected by a large majority, the
questions raised by individual shareholders at the company's annual meetings
may force changes in the future.
'The composition of the board and the board's ability to contribute to
building this company is a subject of great interest to me and to the board,
and I am sure that this board will spend a lot of time thinking about the
right representatives of shareholders to carry forth what we have to do to
(improve the performance of) the company,' was Gerstner's ultimate response.
'We will, and this board does already, share your statement that the board
has to be relevant, appropriate and evolving as the corporation evolves.'
IBM is hardly alone in the information technology industry in having a board
of directors dominated by individuals whose age might suggest that they are
not up to date on the latest technology. Twelve of IBM's 18 directors are
over 60. The average age is 61.3. Digital Equipment, the second largest US
computer company, which is also struggling to regain its momentum, has a
10-member board with an average age of 66.3 years.
It is perhaps significant that the average age of directors at two of
today's most successful high-tech companies is lower. Microsoft's average
director age is 50.5, while Intel's is 58.25.
Hewlett-Packard, one of Silicon Valley's oldest electronics companies, whose
board is chaired by co-founder and octogenarian Dave Packard, has enough
'youngsters' on its board to make the average age 58.8 years.
Age is hardly the best way to determine the fitness of an individual to
serve on a company's board of directors. However, the conventional
qualifications - experience and business achievements - generally ensure
that there are plenty of grey hairs on the board.
It may be time to consider younger candidates, as IBM's shareholders in
Florida, the 'retirement capital of the US', suggested. Up-to-date
technology know-how is a valuable asset on any board of directors, whether
it be a computer company, or a company that spends heavily on information
technology. Today, there are few companies that do not fall within that
spectrum.

FT  30 APR 93 / The Property Market: Hint of small uplift
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The property investment market showed a small hint of a recovery in March,
according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group.
The IPD monthly index's all properties total return of 0.5 per cent for
March was the highest monthly movement for well over a year.
The overall valuation yield has remained relatively stable at 10 per cent
since December. But capital and rental values continued to fall.
The office sector returned 0.5 per cent in March, the first positive
performance since the corresponding month in 1990. Yields shortened by 0.06
of a point, lowering the equivalent yield to 10.4 per cent and reducing the
continued decline in capital values to -0.4 per cent.
The sector registered a zero return for the quarter to March, the first
non-negative quarterly performance since February 1990.
The return on industrial property improved slightly, to 0.5 per cent. The
equivalent yield rose slightly in March to 11.5 per cent. The decline in
rental and capital values was less severe than in February at -0.7 per cent
and -0.4 per cent respectively.
The return on retail property improved marginally in March. For the quarter
to March 1993, retails returned 1.2 per cent.

FT  30 APR 93 / The Property Market: Green shoots on building sites /
Examining tentative evidence suggesting that the worst may soon be over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'There is now a widely held view that the property investment market has
reached the bottom of the cycle.' - Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
'It seems that the worst is now behind us.' - Jones Lang Wootton
'There is a feeling that we are at the bottom.'
 - Investment Property Databank
After numerous false dawns, claims that the property slump is approaching an
end are rightly treated with scepticism. None the less, there is hope that a
recovery of sorts in certain parts of the market may be within sight.
Yields have already hardened in pockets of the market in response to
selective buying. In the central London office market, which has been the
focus of interest from German investors, yields have dropped by as much as
1.75 per cent.
There is also anecdotal evidence of increased interest from potential
occupants. Brixton Estate, which owns offices and industrial property in the
home counties, this week reported a significant rise in tenant inquiries
over the past month.
The case for optimism was summarised this week by the Investment Property
Databank, a research group. 'Yields have risen to a point where many
commentators argue that returns will exceed those of other investment media
(gilts or equities) over the next five years,' said Mr Rupert Nabarro,
director.
'When capital values cease to fall, a 9 per cent return or so will be on
offer; in the medium term real rents, at historically low levels, are likely
to rise,' said Mr Nabarro. Values, he added, are well below replacement
costs, which will force rents to recover rapidly as and when new buildings
are needed.
'High income yield, low market rents and property capitalisation rates above
gilts are a potent cocktail,' he said.
Optimists might draw further comfort from the equity market. Property shares
have outperformed the rest of the market by 27 per cent over the past seven
months. Investors recognised that sterling's 15 per cent devaluation
following its exit from the exchange rate mechanism last September and
falling interest rates rescued the market from its hopeless condition of
last summer in which companies' ability to pay dividends came under
increasing pressure.
So far, so good. However, the fundamental problems facing the market remain
largely unresolved. A swift turnaround in the fortunes of the industry has
never been on the cards.
The end of the recession, officially declared by the government this week,
does not, by itself, signal an end to the property downturn. An economic
recovery is a necessary, but not sufficient, requirement for an end to the
property slump.
With the exception of the retail warehouse market, rents are still falling.
Last year, rents dropped by 12.2 per cent, according to IPD.
Rents will continue to fall until the glut of empty buildings have been
occupied and the trend of rising unemployment is reversed.
It will also take a period of sustained economic growth before demand from
investors spreads throughout the market. At present, investor demand is
confined to buildings with financially secure tenants on long leases, which
account for less than a quarter of the market. Investors will continue to
play it safe until they are confident they would be able to relet a building
if a tenant defaulted.
Other factors that are likely to constrain recovery are the shortage of
buyers compared with the numbers of would-be sellers, and the unwillingness
of banks to lend to the industry. Banks are currently burdened with a
mountain of property debt.
Predicting the likely balance of buyers and sellers is complex. There is
certainly no dearth of buyers. Even during the depths of recession, the
market never dried up in the way it did during the property crash of the
early 1970s.
Some big players have emerged. The Wellcome Trust is to invest Pounds 250m
in the market over the next few years. 'The market is coming to the bottom
of the cycle . . . With yields of 7 to 8 per cent, property is looking very
attractive. There must be opportunities to buy,' says Mr Ian Macgregor,
director of finance.
Moreover, overseas investors are increasingly important players, with a
rapidly growing portfolio of about Pounds 9bn, according to IPD. Overseas
buyers have increased their activity since sterling's departure from the ERM
devaluation last September. That said, the current burst of optimism may
well prove a blip in the same way as the surge of investment by Japanese and
Swedish buyers in the late 1980s eventually came to nothing.
Many investors still lack the funds to make new investments. For instance,
most of the big property companies and several non-property groups with
large property holdings may be forced to sell property. The decline in asset
values has pushed their gearing up to unacceptable levels.
This trend might be reversed if the recent outperformance of property
equities allows companies to raise fresh equity. According to Andrew Walker
of Erdman Lewis, chartered surveyors, if companies are able to raise Pounds
1bn this year balance sheets will have strengthened sufficiently to enable
them to become net investors once more.
The institutions are also reluctant purchasers, partly because of the sharp
reduction in their own cash flow and partly because of the disastrous
underperformance of property over the past decade.
Last year net investment by pension funds and insurance companies was the
lowest in 12 years at Pounds 750m - 32 per cent down on the previous year
and only 40 per cent of the high point in 1989.
The uncertain state of the British economy makes for unreliable forecasts.
But some indication of the prospects of different sectors is gradually
emerging.
Retail property appears to be leading the pack. Industrial property rents
will be depressed by the overhang of second-hand space, although strong
manufacturing growth would generate a robust upturn in the mid-1990s.
Prospects for the office sector are bleak, but the small supply pipeline
could revive prospects in the mid-1990s.
London and the south-east will suffer disproportionately this year from weak
demand and oversupply. None the less the gap between north and south is less
pronounced than it was two years ago, according to IPD. The disparities in
market conditions across the country are narrowing rapidly.

FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd firm on Bosnia arms embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S implacable opposition to the lifting of the embargo on arms
sales to the former Yugoslavia was underlined yesterday by Mr Douglas Hurd.
In a Commons debate which saw the Labour party call for the west to threaten
air strikes on Serbian supply lines, the foreign secretary stressed that
there could no military solution to the civil war in Bosnia.
Speaking as Whitehall officials said negotiations with Washington over the
Bosnian crisis were still far from reaching a conclusion, Mr Hurd said that
in the end a negotiated political settlement would provide the only durable
answer.
But acknowledging the intense frustration in Washington at the refusal of
the Serbs to respond to sanctions, he made it clear that the threat of air
strikes remained a live option to intensify pressure on Serbia.
In a carefully crafted speech which sought to balance anxiety to avoid an
open rift with Washington with scepticism over the effectiveness of military
action, Mr Hurd said that 'the only alternative to a real negotiated
solution is indefinite fighting and suffering'.
His remarks came as Conservative backbench MPs warned against the risk of
military entanglement in the civil war. The overwhelming mood among MPs was
that air strikes should be used only as a last resort.
There were repeated calls - accepted by the foreign secretary - that the
British troops serving with the United Nations in Bosnia should be withdrawn
if they risked coming under direct attack from Serbian forces.
Mr Hurd, echoing the sentiments expressed by Mr John Major in earlier
exchanges with Labour leader Mr John Smith, set out four clear priorities
for policy towards Serbia:
To provide a framework, through the Vance-Owen plan, for a political
solution.
To apply pressure to end Serbian aggression.
To maintain the humanitarian aid effort.
To prevent the fighting from spreading to other provinces of the former
Yugoslavia and beyond.
Stressing that international solidarity was 'essential' if peace was to be
restored, Mr Hurd said that if the political and military objectives were
carefully defined 'air strikes might have a value as a threat, to deter the
Bosnian Serbs from certain strategies. If defied, actual strikes could
prevent them from adopting those strategies.'
The foreign secretary won support from Labour for an unequivocal rejection
of any move to lift the arms embargo. That would risk spreading the conflict
and 'far from tilting the balance towards the Bosnian Moslems, lifting the
embargo could lead to an increase in the supply of weapons to the Serbs and
Croats'.
Mr Smith told the House that the acknowledged risks of limited air strikes
were increasingly outweighed by the real dangers of inaction.
He said the Serbs would continue to flout the UN's authority unless
subjected to an ultimatum backed by a credible threat to their lines of
communication and supply.
Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, clashed with Ms Clare Short
(Lab Birmingham Ladywood) who argued that if there was no willingness to
create 'safe havens' and no willingness to stop Serb aggression the Bosnians
were entitled to arms to defend themselves.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said inaction had closed off the
best and less risky options, and that continued failure of leadership would
lead to a completely uncontrollable situation.
Replying to the debate, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the
Serbs should not be allowed to take for granted certain forms of policy or
inaction on the part of the international community.
The debate, on a technical motion for the adjournment, ended without a
division.

SIR EDWARD HEATH, the former Conservative prime minister, called on the
government to veto any attempt to secure the backing of the UN security
council for air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, Ivor Owen Writes.
He said such a course would necessitate the withdrawal of British and other
forces which were discharging such a significant humanitarian role, and
involve risks far outweighing any possible advantages that might be secured.
Sir Edward dismissed the Vance-Owen peace plan as hopelessly out of date,
and suggested that Lord Owen - whom he criticised for having advocated the
use of force - should retire from his role as the European Community's chief
negotiator.
In an earlier intervention during Commons question time Sir Edward pressed
for an absolutely clear and categorical assurance that no British forces of
any kind would become involved in the former Yugoslavia except for
humanitarian reasons.
He told Mr John Major, the prime minister, that without such an assurance
any other initiative would be suspect because it would be thought that
Britain would be dragged stage by stage into a European war, or pushed there
by the US.
Mr Major, who emphasised the emerging and changing situation, told Sir
Edward: 'I take to heart your remarks as will every member of the House.'

FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht battle resumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE at Westminster over the next stage of the Maastricht bill
intensified yesterday as the coalition of opposition parties and Tory rebels
stepped up the pressure for an effective vote on the social chapter.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, may announce later today her provisional
selection of amendments - more of which were tabled last night - for further
detailed debate on the bill ratifying the Maastricht treaty, next Tuesday
and Wednesday.
But last night both the government and supporters of a vote on the chapter
were voicing confidence that the decision would go in their favour.
Almost 300 MPs of the 650 in the Commons have put their names to the
amendment excluding the social protocol, which contains both the social
chapter and the UK's opt-out from it, from the bill.
This was debated in the earlier committee stage, but a fierce row erupted
over the decision by Mr Michael Morris MP, the deputy speaker who chaired
the committee, not to allow MPs a separate vote on the issue.
Although Labour and the Liberal Democrats want the UK to adopt the social
chapter, and the Tory rebels want to stymie the treaty altogether, their
united support for the amendment puts the government's majority of 20
severely at risk.
The government has said passage of the amendment would have no effect on its
ability to ratify the treaty. But a decision to allow a vote would be seen
as a severe setback because of the contortions ministers have been through
to avoid one.
Government lawyers have also warned ministers that if the Tory Euro-sceptics
were successful in applying for judicial review of the government's
decision, then the UK's ratification of the treaty could be delayed by up to
six months.
It also emerged yesterday that a telephone poll on Maastricht, the results
of which are to be unveiled next week, has resulted in an overwhelming
thumbs down for the treaty.
There were indications last night that the proportion against Maastricht in
the poll, launched in February with the support of Lady Thatcher, could be
as high as 90 per cent.

FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Nuts reprieved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORTILLA CHIPS, pistachio nuts in their shells, packets of poppadums and
other savoury snacks have been granted a reprieve from value added tax,
Customs and Excise ruled yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Following consultation with snack manufacturers and other trade bodies
Customs has rejected suggestions that 17.5 per cent VAT should be imposed on
a wider range of snacks.
The decision follows a Customs consultation document in March last year
which suggested the possibility of widening the definition of snacks that
would not be classified as food.
The clause - originally drafted for purchase tax introduced in 1969 and
incorporated into VAT legislation in 1974 - said there would be no
zero-rating for potato-based products, for those made from the swelling of
cereal products or for salted or roasted nuts, except for those in their
shells.
That has left a growing number of anomalies, as more exotic snacks have been
introduced in the past two decades. Snacks which are currently zero-rated
include sugar-coated biscuits, Twiglets and gingerbread women dipped in
caramel - though not in chocolate.
Customs now accepts that VAT can be recovered by builders of new houses for
the purchase of materials for fitted furniture, it said yesterday.
The action follows a ruling in the High Court following an assessment
relating to McLeans Homes (Midland) Ltd.

FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Privatisations bill set for
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES TO streamline the process of giving parliamentary approval to
future privatisations are likely to be included in next year's legislative
programme.
The government is planning to incorporate a measure making it unnecessary to
enact specific paving bills giving ministers the power to sell individual
government-owned entities.
Senior ministers are expected to finalise next week their decision on which
bills are to be put forward in the parliamentary session beginning in
November.
Deregulation, law and order, and improvements in public services have
emerged as the main themes of the programme, which was discussed by the
cabinet yesterday following a presentation from Mr Tony Newton, the Commons
leader.
It is so far unclear whether the privatisation measure is to come to the
House as a stand-alone bill or take the form of additional clauses
'piggy-backing' on another bill going through parliament.
One candidate for such an approach would be a general deregulation bill put
forward by the Department of Trade and Industry. One minister said yesterday
he would be 'astonished' if the privatisation measure was not included in
one form or another.
The deregulation theme is also expected to feature in the deregulation of
London buses and changes to the law on Sunday trading.
A criminal justice bill, a police bill, and action to curb new age
travellers will underline the government's commitment to regaining the
initiative on law and order.
Further action on improving the efficiency and quality of public services
will be shown by, for example, measures such as the bill setting up the
environmental protection agency, and re-organising local government in
Wales.
The fate of the legislation needed to equalise the pension age still hangs
in the balance, with ministers divided on whether to move ahead with the
plans in spite of their probable unpopularity, or to delay the controversial
move until the following year.
The programme may well not contain as many bills as other parliamentary
sessions, but will involve a high proportion of substantial measures.
The government has not required paving legislation to carry out every
privatisation in the last 14 years, but a bill was enacted earlier this year
covering both British Coal and British Rail.
Among the principal prospective sell-offs to be affected if current
proposals are included in the legislative timetable could be the Post
Office. The government recently decided to delay that sale until the 1994-95
session at the earliest.

FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major promises not to destroy
'economic gains'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major pledged yesterday not to 'throw away' recent hard-won economic
gains as he set the government's sights on achieving a 'steady and
sustainable' recovery.
The prime minister seized on this week's confirmation that Britain has
emerged from one of the longest recessions for 50 years to claim that
government policies were largely responsible for the upturn.
He said figures that had recently emerged indicated the recovery had started
to 'get under way' last summer, within months of the Conservatives' fourth
consecutive general election victory.
But - challenged by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader - he was
careful to acknowledge that the recession had led to difficulties and
suffering for many people.
Warned by a Tory backbencher that Britain must at all costs avoid 'a return
to the cycle of boom and bust,' Mr Major said: 'I share that objective . . .
we have said from the outset that we wanted a recovery that was steady and
sustainable.' He said the government had repeatedly taken action to achieve
this 'over the last two years'.
The government had said that recovery would follow the reduction of
inflation and this now appeared to be happening. Interest rate cuts were the
result of that achievement and did not precede it.
Mr Major said it had been 'extremely difficult for everyone to get the
fundamentals right'. He added: 'We now have them right. I have no intention
of throwing that advantage away.'
Mr Ashdown, urging the prime minister to pause in his 'campaign of
self-congratulation', said the price of the government's policies for
Britain had been '3m unemployed, borrowing at Pounds 1bn a week, a devalued
pound and a burden of debt that will not be paid off until the end of the
century'.
Mr Major retorted that the recession was 'not unique' to Britain and quoted
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, as
saying British industry now had 'almost everything it had been asking for'.

FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Figures blunt Fowler's attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR NORMAN Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, accused Labour yesterday
of admitting that in some parts of England it was not a serious electoral
contender.
Returning to the Tories' local election theme of pacts between Labour and
the Liberal Democrats, he highlighted the cases of two Labour candidates in
Berkshire standing down to give the Liberal Democrats a better prospect of
defeating the Conservatives. He also referred to similar examples in
Wiltshire and Oxfordshire.
Standing down was 'an admission that Labour has no prospect whatsoever of
victory in large parts of England', Sir Norman said.
But Conservative Central Office later said the Tories themselves were not
fighting about 500 of the 3,500 seats up for election on May 6. No party is
fighting all 3,500.
According to figures from Tory headquarters, in Durham the party is fielding
only 25 candidates although there are 72 county council seats. In
Northumberland it is not fighting 20 of the 66 seats and in Cornwall it is
standing in fewer than 60 of the 79 seats.
Taking England and Wales together, Labour is fielding slightly more
candidates than the Tories, although more Conservatives are standing in
England alone.
Labour's headquarters list of candidates shows that in some counties, such
as North Yorkshire and Shropshire, where there is no overall control but the
Tories are the largest single party, it is not fielding candidates in a
significant number of seats.
The Liberal Democrats are fighting fewer than half the seats in Cumbria and
are putting forward only five candidates for the 45-seat Powys county
council. Altogether, they are fielding just over 2,500 candidates.
Mr Andrew Stunell, of the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors, said
yesterday that the party was particularly hopeful of extending its influence
in Leicestershire, Bedfordshire and Somerset.

SUPPORT for the Liberal Democrats reached its highest level for six years in
a Mori poll for today's issue of The Times.
The Liberal Democrats' standing in the poll is put at 20 per cent, up three
points from the previous month. The Conservatives remain at their
post-election low of 32 per cent and Labour is at 46 per cent.
The survey also suggests that Lib Dem support in the shire counties is at 28
per cent.

MR ROGER Freeman, the public transport minister, said last night that
British Rail is to set up new companies to take over responsibility for all
its passenger rolling stock by April 1 next year.
The BR passenger fleet consists of 11,000 vehicles worth about Pounds 2bn
and the firms will lease vehicles to the new operators after privatisation.
Mr Freeman said: 'Our provisional view is that there should be three
rolling-stock companies.
'Wherever reasonably practicable franchisees should have more than one
potential source of supply for rolling stock in any particular market
segment,' he said.

EUROPE'S EFFORTS to dismantle land and trade frontiers are helping to ease
sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, secretary of

Northern Ireland secretaries rarely link the province's problems with wider

But Sir Patrick said: 'When land and trade frontiers are being dismantled,
it is harder to generate enthusiasm for keeping up sectarian fences.'
He told the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce in London that there was
a 'genuine desire' by most people 'to look more towards the future and less
towards the past'.
Sir Patrick added: 'No one should underestimate the influence which
developments within the EC have exerted on this process for change.' He
hopes to restart round-table talks after the province's May 19 local
elections.

FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour plan focuses on skills
training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR a Labour economic strategy emphasising greater investment in
skills training - and aiming the party away from engaging too heavily in
debate with Tories on taxation - will be unveiled this weekend.
The document drawn up by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, forms part of
Labour's rolling policy review and will be presented next week to its
elected National Policy Forum, which represents all sections of the party.
are Papers on Europe policy and on constitutional reform, excluding
proportional representation, are also to be submitted to the forum.
Mr Brown argues that over the next decade the competitive advantages of
industrialised nations will stem increasingly from the quality of their
workforce, rather than in-digenous resources.
He attempts to shift the debate in the Labour party away from taxation and
public borrowing - traditionally weak areas for the party in elections - and
towards how the state, possibly in conjunction with the private sector, can
improve education, training and infrastructure.
The focus on workforce skills fits with calls by Mr John Smith, Labour
leader, for the party to put an increasing emphasis on fostering the
aspirations of individuals.
Mr Brown's paper, presented as a fundamental assesment of Britain's economic
prospects into the next century, argues for a system of managed exchange
rates, perhaps based on a reformed European exchange rate mechanism.
It calls for a greater emphasis on measures aimed at tackling unemployment.
The paper is expected to be discussed at Labour's annual conference in
October.

FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher ready for Iraq arms
inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS Thatcher has indicated to the Scott inquiry on arms sales to Iraq
that she will respond positively to the call for her to give evidence.
The former prime minister's appearance could prove the most dramatic part
the hearings planned by Lord Justice Scott. The date on which she will give
evidence - almost certain to be in public - has yet to be finalised but it
is unlikely to be until later this summer.
Much of the inquiry, set up last year, relates to the time when Baroness
Thatcher was in office. The investigation centres on Matrix Churchill, the
Coventry-based machine-tool company alleged to have supplied parts for
Iraq's so-called supergun.
When Lord Justice Scott announced earlier this month that he was calling the
prime minister and his predecessor, Mr John Major was quick to indicate that
he would give evidence
Many Tory MPs believe the inquiry will vindicate present ministers. Some go
further, arguing privately that, with Mr Major increasingly distancing
himself from his predecessor, he may benefit if the previous administration
is discredited. A date has not been set for Mr Major to appear.
If Baroness Thatcher had refused to appear the inquiry team may have asked
the government for powers to force witnesses to attend.
Lord Justice Scott has been in informal contact with Baroness Thatcher's
office and she has indicated to him her willingness to co-operate. But she
has not formally been invited to give evidence and will not respond
officially until she is.
Interrogation of witnesses starts on Tuesday with Sir Richard Luce, the
former Foreign Office minister. Lord Justice Scott hopes to publish his
report before the end of the year.

FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Agents offer broad support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS and managing agents reacted positively yesterday as they digested
the significance of the 70-page Lloyd's business plan.
Mr George Stephens, group managing director of Hayter Brockbank, said: 'I
took the morning off to read it. I felt I ought to know the details.'
;
He ended up extremely optimistic. 'It's the best plan we've got at the
moment and it's probably the right one,' he said. 'Really and truly I think
Lloyd's should support it.' However, he admitted: 'It will chip our income a
bit.'
Most market participants particularly welcomed Lloyd's recommendation to
ring-fence losses from the insurance market made in past years.
Several also said it was good news for encouraging corporate capital into
the market, while at the very worst doing nothing to harm further the
position of existing Names.
Mr Stephens said he had been talking to four or five parties about new
capital and said he was 'fairly confident' about how discussions were
progressing.
'It's got to be good for Names,' he said. ' At the very least it is neutral
and at best it means better profits and more control of the market to help
avoid the catastrophes of the past.'
Mr Terry Heyday, chief executive of the insurance division of Sturge, said:
'This is a workable, bold and fundamentally sound blueprint for the future.
We welcome it.'
He added: 'Generally it is extremely good news and a very professional
document, given that it was put together in a short time.'
Mr Heyday, who chaired the Lloyd's working party within the review of the
market on documentation and accounting, said: 'The move to electronic
trading is an opportunity to move forward and cut down on the paper that
bogs the market down. It will make transactions less costly to handle.' He
stressed that Sturge had already reduced its fee as managing agents. 'Some
others will find it difficult,' he said.
His criticisms were minor. 'There is still a lot of work to be done on
taxation and regulatory issues,' he said.
Mr John Robson, managing director of Anton members' agency, said: 'My
reaction is very positive. I'm delighted by the general thrust of the
report. My only criticisms would be on points of detail. Everything we had
hoped for has been addressed.'
He said his agency had never conducted tax advice and so would not be
affected by the reduction. One omission from the report, which he said he
welcomed, was the issue of 'divorcing' members and managing agents, to
prevent conflicts of interest. 'Names have the choice,' he said. 'Where we
see our role diminishing is in back-office administration. But there are
clear economies of scale.'
Mr Peter Aitchison, executive chairman of Cotesworth &amp; Co, a members'
agency, said: 'It required something of this magnitude. I feel the
declaration that we finally cast aside the way of ruling the business for
300 years was long overdue.'
He said he welcomed the impact that it would have on the professionals in
the insurance market. 'It has been very sad to see the good name of Lloyd's
undermined by those who should never had been there.'
He said the impact of the recommendations on managing and members' agents
would be 'to squeeze overheads. We are all going to have to tighten our
belts hard . . . but so what? So are Names. That is the nature of
capitalism.'

FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Scheme to woo corporate investors
outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S aims to attract corporate investors next year but has reduced its
expectations for the growth of its capital base. The plan expects a capital
base of between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 12bn by 1997, compared with a minimum
target of Pounds 13bn proposed by the Rowland task force in January last
year.
Corporate investors - 'incorporated Names' as they are called in the
business plan - will be structured as limited-liability companies dedicated
to underwriting at Lloyd's, with minimum paid-up capital of Pounds 1.5m.
They will be required to hold capital equal to 50 per cent of their
underwriting limits (the amount of premium they are able to receive). This
will usually be fully paid-up, although in some cases Lloyd's will accept
letters of credit. Incorporated Names will pay 1.5 per cent of their
underwriting limit to the central fund - which is used when Names are unable
to meet their obligations - compared with 0.6 per cent for individual Names.
Lloyd's will aim to provide incorporated Names with a pre-tax return on
capital of more than 25 per cent, made up of an average underwriting profit
of 10 per cent of underwriting limit - 20 per cent of paid-up capital - plus
income from investments. The plan warns: 'This is a demanding target for
Lloyd's. It is likely therefore that the admission of incorporated Names
will increase the pressure on underwriters to achieve higher returns than in
the past through a combination of better underwriting disciplines and
tighter control on costs.'
Rules governing participation of individual Names are also modified. Names
with assets of least Pounds 500,000 and income above a specified level will
have their 'funds at Lloyd's requirement' cut from 30 per cent to 20 per
cent of stamp capacity.
Members' Agents Pooling Arrangements (Mapas) are to be introduced - a unit
trust or pooling arrangement allowing investors to spread their
participations across a wider spread of syndicates. Participating Names will
also need to deposit fewer funds with Lloyd's (25 per cent of stamp
capacity).
The upper limit on underwriting - presently Pounds 3m - is to be removed and
for the first time Names will be able to place deposits in US dollars.
Lloyd's is also concerned to manage its capital base to avoid the oversupply
which depressed premium rates in the late 1980s.
Incorporated Names will be required to bid for the new capacity the council
makes available each year.
Lloyd's is also to introduce risk profiling, changing the deposit and
solvency ratios depending on the risks of the business in which syndicates
and Names specialise.

FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Middleton starts implementation
next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of the Lloyd's of London insurance market plan to implement
their new business strategy urgently. They recognise that time may be
running out.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said yesterday: 'This is not a
consultative paper, it is a plan. We will obviously listen to people's
reactions but we haven't got time. We must get on and make changes.'
A visibly tired Mr Middleton added: 'We'll have the weekend off and we'll
start implementation on Tuesday.'
The urgency is appropriate. The plan, prepared at speed over the past three
months, amounts to nothing less than a survival formula for a market which
has suffered losses of more than Pounds 5bn in the past five years. Its
central proposals - for modernising the market and modifying the principle
of unlimited liability - develop the conclusions of the task force report,
published less than 18 months ago. The task force was headed by Mr David
Rowland, who was then an adviser to Lloyd's and is now its chairman.
But the underlying tone is both more realistic and more radical than that of
the earlier blueprint, reflecting the sharp decline in confidence among both
Names - the individuals whose assets back the market - and businesses
trading there in the wake of record losses in 1989 and 1990.
The market's capital base has sunk by nearly Pounds 3bn - to about Pounds
8.5bn - in just two years. Whereas the task force report aimed for a capital
base of between Pounds 13bn and Pounds 17bn by 1997, the new business plan
is more modest, recognising that only a much lower level - of between Pounds
10bn and Pounds 12bn - is now possible. But even to maintain a Lloyd's of
that size will require the most radical upheaval ever witnessed at the
306-year-old market.
Costs are to be cut by a third and more than 2,000 jobs shed in the next two
years as the market seeks to improve efficiency and profitability to attract
corporate investors.
The market and regulatory boards, set up last year to administer and
regulate the market, will be more closely involved with the market's 200
syndicates and 100 agencies, which in practice will lose much of their
independence.
The syndicates and agencies will become more akin to franchises, whose
standards of performance and service will be determined centrally by
Lloyd's. Syndicates will be compelled to adapt to electronic trading.
Businesses that are not viable, and professionals who prove to be
incompetent, will be rooted out. Agents will be forced to supply better
quality and give up-to-the-minute data about their performance to the
Lloyd's corporation much more quickly.
Mr Middleton said: 'We do not think it is appropriate any longer for
individual businesses at Lloyd's to only look at their own individual
interests - they are deploying our brand name.'
Mr Rowland said: 'I do believe there should be a market of individual
competing units but if it is left, red in tooth and claw, to do whatever it
likes it can bring the whole market to the brink of destruction.'
The plan recognises that the interplay of market forces has already caused
some rationalisation. More than 150 syndicates and dozens of agencies have
disappeared in the last three years. But it says the cost has been too high,
adding: 'It can never again be left to market forces, which operate too late
to prevent serious loss.' That statement carries revolutionary implications
for a market which has been a bastion of laissez-faire economics.
Some progress appears to have been made with a set of past problems. Lloyd's
proposal to establish a new reinsurance company marks the first serious
effort to address the burden of US asbestosis and pollution-related
liability claims. The scheme - to compel syndicates to reinsure all policies
underwritten before 1986 with the new company - is hugely ambitious,
however, and technically and legally complex.
The plan says: 'No one should underestimate the difficulties associated with
this restructuring. The management challenge is very great and we will need
to be far more effective at managing these changes than we have in the
past.'
The biggest weakness perceived in the plan is the lack of any concrete
proposals for dealing with the litigation between Names and their agents
which is dogging the market. More than two dozen groups of Names are seeking
several billion pounds in compensation for their losses in more than two
dozen actual and potential legal actions.
Last November Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton opened the prospect of a
negotiated settlement, funded largely by the errors and omissions insurers
(which cover the cost of legal awards for negligence) of the agents involved
in the actions. These efforts have so far been unsuccessful. Mr Rowland
said, however, that Lloyd's centrally might even be prepared to contribute a
'modest sum' to allow a settlement, and negotiations could intensify over
the next few weeks.
Much will depend on their success. At best, in Mr Rowland's words, the
continuing litigation will be 'very unattractive and not at all helpful'. At
worst it could derail the whole process.

FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Record losses at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S EXPECTS to report record losses of between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds
2.8bn for 1990 when it reports results for the year in June.
The figure is artificially high because it counts some losses twice. When
syndicates that insure the legal liabilities of agents in the market (the
so-called errors and omissions insurers) and syndicates that provide
stop-loss insurance (personal reinsurance for Names) set aside sums for
possible future claims, the market as a whole provides for the same claim
twice. Without this, Lloyd's says, losses would be near the Pounds 2bn of
1989.

FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Line will be drawn between past
and future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LLOYD'S IS to create a new reinsurance company in an ambitious effort to
control a tide of claims from old US liability insurance policies.
NewCo, as it is referred to in the plan, will provide the 'strongest
practical ring fence' around billions of dollars in potential US asbestosis
and pollution-related claims, insulating new investors from these claims and
allowing Names trapped in 'open years' to leave the market.
If successful, the new company will allow Lloyd's to 'draw a line' between
the market's past and its future.
The plan warns, however, that 'no-one should underestimate the difficulties
associated with restructuring'.
Lloyd's hopes to reinsure all insurance policies underwritten before 1985
with the company, into which it will put more than Pounds 4bn of reserves
from its premium trust funds (into which syndicates pay premiums). Lloyd's
will generate capital for the vehicle by 'discounting' these reserves.
At present syndicates set aside the full value of each claim in the year it
is reported, though it may not be paid out for many years. If these reserves
were discounted to their present value - without taking into account the
value of future investment income - some of them would be freed to be used
as capital. The plan says Lloyd's could supplement this by transferring
funds from the central fund, which pays claims when Names are unable to meet
their obligations.
The new company, registered in the UK, should start business by the end of
1995. In time Lloyd's will consider distributing shares in it to the Names
who contribute their reserves to it at its formation.
Before Lloyd's transfers reserves and capital to the new company it will
need to make sure all syndicates trading on the market have put aside
reserves on the same basis - the syndicates currently apply different
reserving formulas.
Lloyd's will create a central database, define a common methodology for
setting aside reserves and carry out an 'independent scrutiny of syndicate
reserves'.
Some members of syndicates which have not reserved enough could be faced
with further cash calls. Lloyd's will 'set up flexible arrangements to help
them manage their payments. We will not insist on calling all of the payment
in cash immediately'.
The plan fixes on 1985 as a cut-off date because all material North American
asbestosis and long-term pollution exposures stem from 1985 and prior years.
It was also the last year in which liability policies were widely
underwritten on 'occurrence' wording, in which the relevant policy for a
claim is the one in force when the event occurred rather than when a claim
is made - as in the newer 'claims made' wording. Most asbestosis and
pollution claims were made on these older policies.
Syndicates would be able to close any years of account left open because of
uncertainty over these claims.

FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Suspicious Names detect errors
admission on losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE third time in little over a year, hopes of an out-of-court
settlement for loss-making Names have been disappointed, Richard Lapper
writes.
Yesterday's business plan offers Names the prospect of continued
negotiations and the possibility of a 'modest' contribution from the central
fund to any future settlement. Mr Robin Warrender, chairman of London Wall
Holdings, which manages a number of syndicates, said: 'There are nothing but
pious words.'
Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working
Party, which links groups of loss-making Names, criticised the failure to
achieve a settlement but was encouraged by what he described as the plan's
'clear acceptance that litigation must be brought to an end'. He added:
'What we have to do now is negotiate the price.'
Describing the plan as 'an incredible document', Mr Stockwell said: 'Lloyd's
are admitting that many of the problems of the past are of their own making.
They are saying that the spiral (the reinsurance of reinsurance) could have
been prevented. They are admitting that they didn't have the management
standards to regulate the market.'
Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents
about 9,000 Names, is also concerned about the lack of a settlement, and
concerned about worsened prospects for both the 1990 and 1991 underwriting
years.
He said: 'Further work on the litigation problem should be put in hand
without delay.' His association also welcomed the plan's proposals to 'ring
fence' past liabilities for old and open years. This would help 'the
recruitment of new Names by insulating them from the liabilities of the past
without selling-out the Names who underwrote the old years'.
Mr Tom Benyon, founder of the Society of Names, which campaigns on behalf of
loss-making Names, said the plan contained 'tea and sympathy' for
loss-making Names 'but not much more'. He predicted that threats by Names to
call an extraordinary general meeting, as a focus of opposition, would come
to nothing. 'An EGM will be quelled in its tracks.'
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, the biggest
group of litigating Lloyd's Names, said he 'is deeply suspicious' of the
plan. 'I suspect they are trying to manoeuvre a settlement on terms much
less favourable than those we could obtain in litigation.'
The plan's proposals to allow many badly-hit Names to continue trading were
of little help to Gooda Names, many of whom have already resigned.
Ms Marie-Louise Burrows, chairman of the Lime Street Action Group, which
represents about 500 Names, facing average losses of more than Pounds 2m per
head, is also critical.
Ms Burrows said: 'There are wonderful words about the future but there is
nothing in this plan which deals with Lloyd's. Nothing which deals with
conflicts of interest.'
Lime Street Names represent about 1.8 per cent of the total membership of
Lloyd's between 1988 and 1991, but are faced with losses equal to between 20
per cent and 25 per cent of those suffered by the market as a whole.
Ms Burrows said: 'This tidal wave of losses will have to be paid by the rest
of the membership. We can't pay them.'

FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Staffing and costs to fall
steeply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET'S costs are scheduled to fall 22 per cent from Pounds 885m in
1991 to Pounds 665m by 1995, and it is expected that 2,500 of the 12,000
currently employed in the market will lose their jobs over the next two to
three years, Richard Lapper writes.
Greater efficiency will be achieved by a new central management style and
tougher, more independent regulation of the market, and by action in four
specific areas - improving and streamlining business practices; reducing
agency and underwriting fees; changing the way members' agents operate; and
cutting the corporation's central costs.
The market is to move from an environment of 'consensus-based
decision-making by committees to one where the central management team will
take decisions after consultation, implement these decisions and be held
accountable to the market board for results', the plan says.
Significant improvements in central management information, including
looking at introducing a one-year or two-year accounting cycle - compared
with the current three-year system - are to be introduced.
Lloyd's regulators will in future work more independently from the market.
They will monitor the professionalism of underwriters and agents, and weed
out incompetence. The aim is create a regulatory structure 'that replicates
the operation of external regulation', the plan says.
Business processes are to be streamlined, with improvements in the way
policies are drafted and claims handled. Senior managers will have much
better information and the move to electronic trading will be speeded up,
generating estimated savings of Pounds 20m.
Although face-to-face trading (between underwriters and brokers) will be
kept 'where appropriate', all underwriters will be have to do much of their
business electronically by the end of 1995. All business placed at Lloyd's
must be 'supported by a full electronic version of the contract by 1 January
1996'.
Fees paid by Names to managing agents will be reduced from 0.5 per cent of
stamp capacity to 0.4 per cent, saving Names Pounds 15m, and new controls on
the management of run-off companies will shave a further Pounds 25m from the
market's costs. Syndicates and agencies face tough disclosure requirements.
Expenses will be rigorously monitored and a new unit set up to identify
businesses that are longer economically viable.
'As 'economic viability' is a condition of registration under current
regulation, agents that are no longer viable will be closed down or
encouraged to merge with stronger groups,' the plan says. Syndicate and
agent costs have risen by a compound 20 per cent a year for the past 10
years, and there has been no slowdown in their growth since 1990, with 1991
costs up 24 per cent.
Members' agents (which handle the affairs of Names) are to stripped of many
of their functions. Administrative tasks, such as handling Names' deposits
and tax affairs, will be transferred to a central services unit owned by
Lloyd's, yielding savings estimated at Pounds 20m. members' agents will in
future concentrate instead on advising Names and assessing the performance
of syndicates.
A reduction in costs of some Pounds 37m at the corporation was announced
earlier this year, with staffing cut from 2,200 to 1,600 by the end of the
year.

FT  30 APR 93 / Barclays to launch telephone banking trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS IS to launch a pilot telephone banking service for 10,000 personal
customers from July. It said yesterday this was one of a series of projects
which would revolutionise the way it provided services over the next decade.
The experimental Barclaycall service will operate from Coventry, offering
telephone banking to customers from 39 branches. The bank is also extending
its personal loans telephone sales operation across the country.
The moves represent an integrated effort to transform retail banking and are
likely to be examined by competitors trying to find ways of reducing costs
while improving service.
Mr Bill Gordon, managing director of the bank's UK branch network, said it
had decided to offer a telephone back-up to branch services rather than
establish a separate telephone bank on the model of Firstdirect, Midland's
subsidiary.
'The customer still values being able to deal face to face with staff in a
branch occasionally, and we want to maintain that at the same time as
offering a new service over the telephone,' said Mr Gordon.
Several large banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland are experimenting with
telephone services. Barclays emphasised that it hoped to extend the
telephone service to small business customers.
Mr Gordon said the bank, which last year made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m,
was trying to 'sharpen' its risk-management methods. Among initiatives
disclosed to staff at Barclays' 2,200 branches yesterday are:
Each cashier will have a terminal to authorise cash payment electronically
from any branch. The system, which will be fully implemented by next year,
will answer balance inquiries and be capable of transferring sums between
accounts. Storage and handling of securities such as debentures over company
assets and personal life assurance policies will be centralised. Data about
securities will be accessed by local branch managers using computers.
A personal computer-based risk assessment system for local managers to judge
loans for medium-sized and large companies will be piloted in two regions in
the second half of this year.
A central database holding all customer records and capable of updating
accounts immediately will be installed across branches by the end of next
year, allowing accounts to be opened by a single entry of data.
Staff in seven of the bank's 23 regions will work on a new risk-management
system for personal loans. The bank is likely to start testing new risk
management methods later this year before deciding on the changes to
implement.
Two branches in London will be test sites for the whole range of
initiatives.
Barclaycall will offer a series of services including bill payments, balance
inquiries and amendment of standing orders.
Barclays has established a new central sales and service unit in its banking
division to develop services. The Barclayloan Direct service offering loans
by telephone will start operating nationally later this year.
Meanwhile, Bifu, the bank staff union, issued a writ yesterday against
Barclays Bank claiming damages on behalf of 400 computer staff suspended
without pay in March 1991 for refusing to take a loyalty pledge during an
overtime ban.
Mr Rob MacGregor, Bifu's assistant general secretary, said: 'It has taken a
long time to collate all the evidence but we are now confident of success.'
Mr MacGregor added that the bank would be 'called to account' by the courts
for the 'disgraceful treatment' of its workforce.

FT  30 APR 93 / Veg stalls fail to see any green shoots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREEN shoots of recovery have yet to flourish on the fruit and vegetable
stalls.
Mr Philip Porter, of Porter's in Kingston upon Thames, London, said there
had been an upturn but it was brought about by another kind of green shoot -
the arrival of bedding plants. 'In general, it has been poor and there are
no signs of a real revival,' he said.
Mark, a stallholder in Lower Marsh market near London's Waterloo station,
said: 'Business is well down on last year, which was bad enough,' He blamed
lack of customers partly on empty office blocks.
Another stallholder, Mrs Vera Cooper, agreed. 'Business is worse than ever.
People are often just buying potatoes and nothing else, whereas they used to
buy fruit and vegetables as well.'
The only market stalls in London that appear to be doing well are those in
or near busy areas such as Oxford Street, with passing trade from office
workers and from tourists.
Mrs Joyce Lee, who is a trader in Market Street, near Manchester's Arndale
shopping centre, said: 'It's been terrible since Christmas. There's no sign
of it changing. Honest to God, it's got worse in the last few weeks.'
Mr Stephen Murphy, who runs a fruit and vegetable stall on Manchester's
Deansgate, said: 'People don't come out at lunchtime if it's raining. You
won't be able to tell if the economy has turned until the sun shines. If I'm
not doing well then, you'll know we're all still in trouble.'

FT  30 APR 93 / Flowers give slight cheer for the hard-pressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, CHRIS TIGHE, PAUL CHEESERIGHT and RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC indicators are levelling out or turning cautiously upwards, and
ministers and City economists talk about the recovery, but the small
businesses which rely on customers paying cash - especially for things they
can do without - are not convinced.
People selling taxi-rides, haircuts, flowers and takeaway food say there may
be a spring in people's step, but there is still a tight clamp on their
purses.
Mr Joe Cuddy, a taxi owner-driver, summed up the mood on Manchester's
city-centre taxi ranks: 'If there is a recovery it's not filtered down to
us. We need business travellers to and from and about the city and there
just aren't enough around.
'Things were busy for a couple of months after the last election, then
everything went flat again. The only bright thing is that when I talk to my
passengers they do seem a bit more confident.'
Mr Geoff Barlow, a few cabs down the queue, was glum. 'I'm going backwards
financially,' he said. 'Nobody is talking about recovery. If they've heard
about it, it isn't happening to them. The recession has certainly not
bottomed out as far as I am concerned. We talk among ourselves that it can't
get any worse, then it does.'
Lack of city-centre trade has also hit wine bars, those 1980s symbols of
optional spending. Many have gone out of business and the survivors do not
yet see the end of their troubles. Mr Rod Creswick, of Cellar Vie in
Manchester, said: 'Perhaps things are picking up a little, but the evidence
is not consistent. I think they are not getting worse.'
Suburban wine bars have been hit less than city-centre sites. Mrs Ruth
Fletcher, co-owner of Jasper's Wine Bar in Altrincham, Greater Manchester,
said: 'We have had seasonal dips but our evening trade has held up well.
People think twice about going into the city and we have benefitted.'
For even cheaper ways of eating, such as Chinese takeaways, trading
conditions continue to be difficult.
Mr Shi Leung, proprietor of The Farmhouse Chinese Takeaway in Darlington,
County Durham, said: 'People who used to buy meals are now buying chips, and
people who used to buy chips don't buy anything.'
He hears from others in his field that business is quiet.
At the family-run Ming Dynasty Takeaway in Kenton, a residential area of
Newcastle upon Tyne, Mr Marcus Ling believes the recession is still hitting
spending. He does not believe it will end yet. 'Maybe in three to four
years. Confidence isn't easy to build up.'
One unexpected glimmer of hope may be coming from sellers of the ultimate in
optional spending - flowers. According to Ms Diane Lawson, who has two shops
in Harborne and Moseley, Birmingham. customers are saying: 'Damn it, let's
go out and buy a few flowers to cheer ourselves up.'
She added: 'Christmas wasn't brilliant. Valentine's Day got better. Mother's
Day was very good. Since then it's been very steady.'
Since Mothering Sunday on March 21, stocks have been doubled at the
Birmingham city-centre stall owned by Sue and Bob Foster. Mrs Foster did not
attach too much importance to that. 'If you don't have a good show, people
won't look at it anyway.'
For her, recession and mooted recovery are seamless. 'I don't think it's
changed,' she said. 'You're up on one thing and down on another.'
Ms Patricia Page, owner of Hair By Patricia Page in Edgbaston, Birmingham,
sees her business in the same light. Nursing a 32.5 per cent rent increase
and not daring to put up prices by more than 5 per cent, she has seen no
sign of an upturn. 'You have three good days and then two bad ones and
you're back where you started.'
Ms Page added: 'People used to come every six weeks for a cut and blow.
They're letting it go now for eight weeks.'
But Mr Ray Seymour, general secretary of the National Hairdressing
Federation, was cautiously optimistic. 'No one is saying we are out of the
woods yet, but I am beginning to get reports from members pointing towards
recovery.'
Mr Seymour said that when economic circumstances started to improve people
tended to go to the hairdresser more often because it made them feel better.
But Mr Philip Rogers, managing director of Vidal Sassoon, which has 10
salons in the UK, was concerned that people might not 'return to their
previous cycle' of hairdressing when the recession ended.
Like a haircut, a coat of paint for the house is an expense that can be put
off. Mr Stanley Broughton, chief executive of the British Decorators
Association, said there seemed to be some slight improvement for his
members, but it was impossible to generalise.
Traditionally at this time of year painters would be planning the order in
which they would do jobs booked in for three to four months ahead. Mr George
Clasper, the association's northern region president, from Forest Hall,
North Tyneside, said: 'At the moment they have work to do, but not much
future work. You need the general public to have confidence before they're
prepared to decorate.'
Mr Grenville Weltch, director of of the National Federation of Painters and
Decorating Contractors, said: 'It is going to be a slow process of recovery.
Prices are still far too low and it will be some time before people have
enough confidence to spend much money.'
Even people who say they are doing well are cautious about the reasons. Mr
Leo Gillen, the largest independent newsagent in Hartlepool, Cleveland, said
takings were up but 'that doesn't mean things are getting better. If people
have less money they come and shop locally'.
Mr Mahbood Hussein, whose family runs two shops, in Stockton-on-Tees,
Cleveland, and in nearby Thornaby, said: 'People won't go without their
newspapers, though they might get one instead of two or three.'
Mr Gillen doubts an end to recession would much affect newsagents. 'When the
recession starts to move away our type of business doesn't benefit much.
People start to buy three-piece suites and houses. You don't buy 10 bars of
chocolate.' He believed people were still 'very wary' about their prospects.
After the usual quiet January, business has picked up in recent weeks, but
he believes spring and a mood of greater optimism may be responsible, not an
end to recession.

BRITISH RAIL has been told to set up three companies to take over ownership
of its Pounds 2bn fleet of passenger trains by next April as part of the
government's plans for rail privatisation.
The Department of Transport's intention is that the three companies will
lease the trains to the private-sector operators that win the franchises to
operate BR's passenger services.

FT  30 APR 93 / Daf truck plant attracts rival bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 40M-PLUS management buy-out of Leyland Daf's truck assembly plant
in Lancashire was agreed in outline early yesterday, Ian Hamilton Fazey
writes. Within hours, however, a new bidder had opened talks with the
company's administrative receiver to try to thwart the deal.
Mr Ian McKinnon, who led the successful management buy-out of Leyland Bus in
1985, saw Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, the joint receiver, late
yesterday afternoon. He wants to buy the assembly plant in Leyland, the axle
plant at Albion in Glasgow and the spare parts business in Chorley,
Lancashire.
Leyland Bus was sold to Volvo in 1987. Mr McKinnon is now a senior executive
with Alcan, the aluminium company, which is not connected with his bid.
He is offering to better the truck assembly buy-out. With the parts business
valued at more than Pounds 100m, industry estimates suggest he would need
more than Pounds 200m to succeed in buying everything.
Mr Talbot said the outline agreement with the management team covered price
and 'other critical factors', but was subject to contract. Both sides aim to
finalise the deal in the latter half of May. Mr Talbot said in the meanwhile
he would 'continue to talk to other interested parties'.
The management buy-out team believes other bidders are now out of the
running. Its case is that the factory depends on being able to sell trucks
throughout the whole of Europe and it has negotiated an agreement with Daf's
European dealer network to achieve this.
It has a supply agreement with the spare parts business and another to take
65 per cent of the Albion axle output. The Glasgow plant also supplies
Leyland Daf vans in Birmingham, which was bought separately by its
management last week. This interdependent circle of demand and supply is
understood to guarantee the future - and eventual saleability - of all parts
of the former Daf business.

FT  30 APR 93 / More pilots urged for ships
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL PRESSURE to take the most direct route between Norway and North
America forced the master of the oil tanker Braer to risk polluting the
Shetland coastline, professional pilots told the Donaldson public inquiry
yesterday.
Captain Phillip Grey, in a joint submission for the Deep Sea and North Sea
Pilots' Associations, said the safer - but longer - route to the Atlantic
was through the North Sea and the English Channel.
Captain Grey said: 'He (the master) would have been safe, but probably soon
out of work. His charterer could claim the extra distance and time
involved.'
Pilot organisations urged the inquiry, which is considering the wider
implications of the oil spill in January, to recommend greater use of
pilotage to take vessels along vulnerable coasts.
The Department of Transport has refused to support calls for mandatory
pilotage for such routes as the Minches and the Pentland Firth. In a
memorandum to the inquiry the government said it would be unnecessary and
might be prohibitively expensive. 'The department is not aware of any water
around the UK, outside harbours and regularly used by shipping, where the
risk of collision or grounding is high and where the compulsory requirement
for a pilot would be likely to reduce that risk.'
The hearing resumes on May 11.

A Pounds 40M-PLUS management buy-out of Leyland Daf's truck assembly plant
in Lancashire was agreed in outline early yesterday. Within hours, however,
a new bidder had opened talks with the company's administrative receiver to

and 'other critical factors', but was subject to contract. Both sides aim to
finalise the deal in the latter half of May. Mr Talbot said in the meanwhile
he would 'continue to talk to other interested parties'.
Mr McKinnon declined to name two City financial institutions he said were
behind him. They still have to carry out their own investigations after
obtaining more information from the receiver, and senior debt has still to
be negotiated with clearing banks.
His advisers include Dickson Minto, a firm of London corporate lawyers
specialising in acquisitions and buy-outs. Mr McKinnon was operating from
the firm's offices yesterday.
The management buy-out team believes other bidders are now out of the
running. Its case is that the factory depends on being able to sell trucks
throughout the whole of Europe and it has negotiated an agreement with Daf's
European dealer network to achieve this.
It has a supply agreement with the spare parts business and another to take

understood to guarantee the future - and eventual saleability - of all parts
of the former Daf business.
Mr McKinnon wants to offer the receiver a less complicated deal, taking the
whole business and running his own sales and marketing operation.
Under the management buy-out deal Lancashire Enterprises, the privatised
economic development arm of Lancashire County Council, would buy the entire
230-acre Leyland Daf site and its 1.8m sq ft of factory, and lease 800,000
sq ft for truck assembly to the management buy-out team. Lancashire
Enterprises would develop the rest as a technology park.
The deal was negotiated by Mr Paul Southern, northern corporate finance
partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Leeds.

FT  30 APR 93 / Pounds 30m of dole overpaid, says NAO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ESTIMATED Pounds 30m of unemployment benefit was paid in 1991-92 to
claimants who were not entitled to it, the National Audit Office, says.
The public expenditure watchdog has qualified the accounts of the National
Insurance Fund as a result - the fifth year in succession that the accounts
have been qualified for this reason.
Errors also led to underpayment of Pounds 12m of benefit. The majority of
the mistakes arose because the Employment Service, which pays out the
benefit, misinterpreted claimants' national insurance contribution records.
Measures to strengthen procedures for paying benefits have been introduced
since the errors were first identified in 1987-88. But according to the NAO
the 1991-92 errors amounted to 5.5 per cent of the benefit paid, the same
level as in 1987-88.
In response to the criticisms the Employment Service said that it worked
towards accuracy targets negotiated by its chief executive with the social
security secretary. Its target for 1992-93 was that errors should not exceed
4 per cent of the value of unemployment benefit paid. The NAO has also
qualified the fund's accounts for two other reasons:
Uncertainty about the accuracy of national insurance contributions paid by
employers - many of the checks carried out on these contributions can
operate only when employers' returns are received after the end of the
financial year, and there is a large backlog of inquiries.
Doubts about estimates of the amount of statutory sick pay and statutory
maternity pay which employers are entitled to deduct from national insurance
contributions. The NAO says that the Social Security department controls
over these deductions are inadequate.

Sir Roy, 67, - who is married with a son and two daughters, is understood to
suffer from Parkinson's disease.
Scotland Yard said officers had found his wallet, with cash and credit
cards, medication, and a pair of glasses in his Battersea flat in south
London, but they did not know if they were his only pair. He did not appear
to have extra clothes with him.
Thames Water said Sir Roy had been at work as normal on Tuesday at Thames's
central London headquarters.
His driver took him home at 2pm, since when he had had no contact with the
company or with his family in Oxford-shire.

FT  30 APR 93 / Nursing home staff to take Ernst &amp; Young to tribunal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE NURSING home employees are taking receivers Ernst &amp; Young to an
industrial tribunal in a dispute over 'laying on' money - the first week's
wages which are withheld as a week in hand and paid to workers when their
employment ceases.
The employees of a nursing home near Darlington, Co Durham, claim the
receivers should have paid them their laying on money when the home was
sold.
Ernst &amp; Young, which ran the home in receivership for more than 18 months
after Stainford, the previous owner, went under, is contesting the claim.
'We've taken legal advice and our view is Ernst &amp; Young was never their
employer,' said the firm, which is being advised by Newcastle-based
solicitors Dickinson Dees.
Originally, 19 employees at the 58-bed Greenacres nursing home, formerly
called the Gainford nursing home, applied for a tribunal hearing, but 10
pulled out after a pre-hearing assessment.
The application is scheduled to be heard on Tuesday in Middlesbrough.

FT  30 APR 93 / Ministers rapped over union policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspodent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has been criticised by the International Labour Organisation
in Geneva for its lack of consultation with trade unions over employment
policy.
In a report which will be submitted to the organisation's annual conference
in June, its committee of experts says it 'remains deeply concerned at the
serious difficulties in establishing the tripartite consultations on
employment policy measures' required by the ILO convention ratified by
Britain in 1966.
The claims are contained in a report which will be submitted to the annual
ILO conference in June.
The committee insists that although 'the results of the consultations are
not binding on the government', it is 'obliged to ensure that tripartite
consultations are effective'.
The report also requests the government to consider amending the 1988
Employment Act that prevents unions from disciplining members who refuse to
take part in lawful strikes and other industrial action, or who seek to
persuade fellow members to refuse such action.
The committee says it considers that these provisions remove the right of
unions to express their dissatisfaction with such members.
On the contentious issue of the banning of unions at the government's GCHQ
communications centre in 1984, the report says it 'firmly hopes high-level
talks will lead to a positive outcome'.
So far, meetings have been held between the government and civil service
union leaders in October last year and in January.

FT  30 APR 93 / Office building cheaper in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of developing a large office block is almost a third cheaper in the
US than in the UK, according to a study commissioned by BAA, the airports
company.
BAA spends about Pounds 250m a year on large construction projects and is
proposing to build a Pounds 900m fifth terminal at Heathrow Airport.
It said yesterday that, as a test, it asked contractors in North Carolina to
tender for a 200,000 sq ft office block identical to a Pounds 17.1m
development by British Airways at Heathrow which is due to be completed this
year.
Lynton, BAA's property subsidiary, commissioned Bovis Construction, the UK
contractor, and Davis Langdon &amp; Everest, quantity surveyors, to tender for a
similar project at an airport in Charlotte, North Carolina, where labour and
material costs are similar to those in Britain.
It was found that the offices built to US designs and specifications were 32
per cent cheaper at Pounds 11.65m than in the UK. Construction costs were
marginally higher in the US at Pounds 17.14m if identical designs and
specifications were used.
Mr Gordon Edington, Lynton's chairman and BAA's property director, said that
the main reasons for differences in costs were that US developers used more
standard designs and common components.
Developers also spent longer preparing detailed designs and organising a job
before starting building work, saving valuable time during construction.
Mr Edington said: 'US architects and engineers spend less time re-inventing
solution wheels and are more ready to incorporate standard technical
solutions into their designs.'
The flood of construction companies which have gone into receivership is
likely to increase as the UK economy recovers and building costs rise, the
EC Harris construction cost consultancy warned yesterday.
Mr Christopher Vickers, chairman, said: 'Pressures on contractors are
increasing from a number of directors and not just from rises in input
costs.'
The failure of customers meant large losses on jobs while contractors were
receiving less interest on progress payment money held on deposit for
sub-contractors, so cashflow was likely to fall.
EC Harris said in its quarterly economic survey that contractors bidding
fixed prices on projects unlikely to be completed for up to two years could
run into serious difficulties due to rises in building material prices.
Producers of steel, glass, plasterboard, cement and aggregates have
announced price rises this year. EC Harris said: 'The latest increases in
material prices look set to stick because the costs of alternative cheap
imports have now increased 15 per cent due to sterling's devaluation.'
It said that defaults by customers were adding to the pressures on
contractors.

FT  30 APR 93 / Bishopsgate looks to Belfast: Businesses with 23 years of
dealing with terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the City of London, still trying to come to terms with the massive
Bishopsgate bombing, Belfast's well-developed anti-terrorist procedures may
provide some valuable lessons.
After 23 years of 'the troubles', the businessmen and women of Belfast are
used to coping with terrorism.
At the heart of Belfast's robust defences lies an ability to cope and a
systematic awareness of the dangers of terrorism reflected in everything
from building design to working practices.
Mr Alasdair MacLaughlin, secretary of the Northern Ireland Banker's
Association and a former head of the CBI in the province, said: 'There is a
systemic awareness here which goes from the architects and engineers who
design the buildings through to the staff and security personnel who are
trained and experienced in dealing with emergencies and disruptions.
'Structurally, the more modern buildings are better able to withstand the
effects of bomb damage, while the people have developed a resilience and
determination to carry on regardless. This has all developed into an ability
to cope.'
Underpinning Belfast's stoic attitude to the IRA bombers is a general
acceptance that even with a major security operation the bombers still find
a way of getting through. (In Belfast the police and army numbers at around
4,000 - one for every 125 inhabitants - double that of London).
The emphasis is on good contingency planning, well-oiled evacuation
procedures and meticulous attention to good office-keeping.
Mr Walter Jess, a senior manager at Northern Bank, said: 'If a bomb goes off
near one of our buildings, within minutes the contingency plan goes into
effect.
'We have contractors on standby at all times to carry out emergency repairs,
and all our staff know exactly where they must go if they have to be
temporarily relocated and what they have to do.'
One senior bank executive based in the city said: 'We would always expect to
be up and working the next day - with or without a desk.'
In 1992 two big bombs struck Belfast's business district, ripping out the
windows from a dozen office blocks, but many businesses were functioning
again within hours.
One Belfast banker said that his 500 headquarters staff can be evacuated to
a safe collection point in under three minutes. Once the alarm goes the
priority is to get out. 'Staff are not even allowed to take their coats with
them. Nobody ignores a bomb warning here' he said.
Mr Ivan Carruthers, a Belfast-based partner of the UK accounting firm Ernst
and Young, said a 'clean-desks' policy and the backing-up and storing of
computer files off-site had minimised information loss in 1992.
Bomb blast on tall buildings in confined areas can suck paper out to be
scattered far and wide. Significantly, Ernst &amp; Young says that it did not
lose 'a single piece of paper' in the two large car bombs of 1992.
Most Belfast office buildings are built to minimise the effects of blast
damage. According to Mr MacLaughlin, 'there are few of the glass palaces
here that you see in London'. Most office block windows also have a thin
plastic adhesive covering on the inside.
This has the effect of making the pane fall as a sheet when the blast
shatters it, rather than flying into thousands of pieces and particles of
glass dust. Dust covers are also placed over computers and other equipment
at the end of the day.
Most Belfast businessmen are ambivalent about tight security checks on
vehicles entering the city. They are quick to complain when traffic hold-ups
caused by the checkpoints disrupt their business. But Mr MacLaughlin said:
'It is rare that the city is paralysed.'
Mr Jess summed up Belfast's experience saying: 'I would doubt that the
additional precautions have resulted in any significant cost to doing
business here. The bombs have done no more damage than, say, the higher
levels of strikes on the mainland. There is a limit to what you can do. You
must still have a congenial working environment without creating fortresses.
Economic life and business has gone on regardless. What we cannot calculate
is the cost on the province of those companies that have simply not
considered coming here because of the image.'

FT  30 APR 93 / Most of London bomb area opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 90 per cent of the area in the City closed because of the IRA bomb at
the weekend has been opened to building keyholders to allow repairs to go
ahead.
Much of the remaining 21-acre area will be opened progressively during the
next few days, but Mr Colin Snowden, the City engineer, said yesterday that
it would take some weeks to open the streets close to the site of the
explosion. The area of Bishopsgate from Wormwood Street to St Helen's Place
is likely to remain closed for two months.
Mr Snowden said: 'We have made good progress in the five days since the
explosion. We have succeeded in getting things virtually back to normal
thanks to the heroic efforts of the police and all other services.'
Buildings near the heart of the blast are being cleared of glass and debris,
and considerable rebuilding needs to be done on a wrecked sewer beneath the
bomb crater.
Mr Snowden confirmed that 25 buildings had been badly damaged and 30 had
sustained moderate damage. Decisions on whether to demolish or refurbish
will be taken by the owners, their technical advisers, and insurers.
He said the clearing-up process, involving nearly 500 tonnes of broken glass
and debris, had cost the City Corporation about Pounds 300,000. Some of this
will be recovered from property owners.
Buildings that suffered most damage were those made of reinforced concrete.

FT  30 APR 93 / Engineering companies freeze pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of pay deals reported so far this year by large engineering
companies in the Sheffield area have involved a wage freeze. In addition,
only one fifth of agreements involve increases above 3 per cent.
The figures, collected by the Sheffield association of the Engineering
Employers Federation, cover 50 deals. One company negotiated a 10 per cent
pay cut in order to survive, 27 agreed a standstill and three settled for
under 2 per cent.
Another 10 deals resulted in rises of between 2 and 3 per cent, six between
3 and 4 per cent and the remainder between 4 and 5 per cent.
Even though an upturn is being more widely reported by companies, most
capacity is under-used and some companies are on short-time working.
Smaller businesses are also showing pay restraint. Haines Watts, an
accountancy firm specialising in small and medium-sized businesses in the
Leeds-Bradford area, yesterday said a survey of its clients showed that half
of them were either freezing pay or settling below 2 per cent.
None of the small and medium-sized businesses expects pay to rise above 5
per cent this year, although 59 per cent expect turnover increases above
this level and 73 per cent forecast higher profits. Most anticipate using
the extra resources generated for investment.
The government has been criticised by the International Labour Organisation
in Geneva for its lack of consultation with trade unions over employment
policy.
In a report which will be submitted to the organisation's annual conference
in June, its Committee of Experts says it 'remains deeply concerned at the
serious difficulties in establishing the tripartite consultations on
employment policy measures' required by the ILO convention ratified by
Britain in 1966.
The committee insists that although 'the results of the consultations are

The report also requests the government to consider amending the 1988
Employment Act that prevents unions from disciplining members who refuse to
take part in lawful strikes and other industrial action, or who seek to
persuade fellow members to refuse to participate in such action.
The committee says it considers that these provisions remove the right of
unions to express their dissatisfaction with such members.
On the contentious issue of the banning of unions at the government's GCHQ
communications centre in Cheltenham in 1984, the report says it 'firmly
hopes high-level talks will lead to a positive outcome'.
The government has told the ILO that it is ready to consider any proposal
compatible with the safeguarding of security at GCHQ that would not risk
disruption through 'conflicts of interest' among the staff.

FT  30 APR 93 / Council isolated on school test plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Borough of Wandsworth's plan to pay supply teachers to administer
national curriculum tests, which face the threat of boycotts by teachers,
seemed unlikely to be followed by other education authorities yesterday.
Wandsworth is paying Pounds 20,000 out of its education budget to employ
teams of supply teachers to invigilate and mark tests for 14-year-olds.
Local education authorities in England and Wales have a legal duty to
implement the tests for their schools, as do the heads and governors of
grant-maintained schools which have opted out of education authority
control.
Wandsworth intends to pass the results of its tests to the review of the
national curriculum being conducted by Sir Ron Dearing. He has said that he
needs completed tests to improve them for next year.
Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth, said it would be possible for other
authorities to do the same. 'Ours is a local initiative, but obviously other
authorities are in exactly the same position as we are and they've got to
steer through this problem. There are probably enough supply teachers
around,' he said.
According to the Department for Education, there are about 300,000 inactive
teachers in England and Wales, compared with about 400,000 working teachers.
However, the National Association of Governors and Managers cast doubt on
whether enough teachers with adequate specialist qualifications were
available to allow all schools to take the same route. It said the
Wandsworth plan was impracticable.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'It's a total misreading of the statutory assessment and
testing arrangements to believe that you can pull in outsiders and expect
them to undertake that job with the knowledge and the skill which would be
brought to that task by the teachers in the schools themselves.'
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, welcomed Wandsworth's move but
stopped short of urging other councils to follow its lead. 'I applaud what
Wandsworth has done. They are using their own resources. They're using their
own school inspectors to go into the schools and make sure that the tests
are taken,' he said, adding that it was up to individual councils to take
similar decisions.
Wandsworth only has four secondary schools, and larger education authorities
might not have the resources.
The Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the Association of County
Councils, which represent local education authorities, said none of their
members planned to follow Wandsworth's lead.

FT  30 APR 93 / Shell attacks relief plans for PRT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL, THE largest oil and gas producer in the North Sea, yesterday
condemned proposals for transitional relief to help those companies which
are most affected by any changes to petroleum revenue taxes.
Shell's strong defence of the proposed PRT changes and its resistance to
transitional help has enraged many of the smaller North Sea explorers which
are lobbying hard for some assistance. Many oil companies say exploration
activity in the North Sea will be halved if the changes are adopted, with
the loss of up to 40,000 jobs.
In a confidential survey of the industry by the UK Offshore Operators'
Association, the trade group, companies said they would cut their drilling
programmes by sinking 206 fewer wells between now and 1997 if the PRT
changes are adopted.
Shell said that drilling levels had been falling anyway because of a lack of
attractive drilling prospects and this would continue even without the tax
changes.
The company which, as a joint venture with Esso, produces about 30 per cent
of the UK's oil and 20 per cent of its gas, said the estimates for job
losses resulting from the PRT changes were 'broadly overblown'.
Shell said a period of transition for the changes would introduce an element
of uncertainty into the North Sea tax regime for the first time.
Mr John Butterfill, the Conservative MP Bournemouth West, tabled an
amendment on Tuesday to the Finance Bill that would extend tax relief to
wells the industry had already commited itself to drill as a transitional
arrangement.
This would be paid for by keeping PRT at 55 per cent until the end of 1996.
The original Budget proposals would cut PRT from 75 per cent to 50 per cent
and abolish tax relief on exploration and appraisal wells.

FT  30 APR 93 / Four BZW traders suspended: Liffe to hold disciplinary
hearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BZW FUTURES, the futures broking arm of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has
suspended four of its floor traders on full pay pending disciplinary
hearings by the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange
(Liffe).
They are alleged to have violated Liffe's rules on the priority given to
customer orders in the exchange's futures trading pits.
The rules are designed to prevent the practice of 'front-running', which
involves changing the order of trades to take advantage of price movements
caused by the execution of large orders. Front-running, once a frequent
problem in futures markets, has become less common in recent years as a
result of stricter surveillance.
The four traders involved are not alleged to have benefited personally from
any of the near-100 trades in question, conducted in the Italian bond
futures pit of Liffe in May 1992. It is understood that the 'profits' on the
trades, amounting to less than Pounds 5,000, would have been credited to
BZW. BZW futures traders cannot hold personal accounts. The trades were
executed through BZW Futures' 'error account', which is designed to handle
failed trades.
It is understood that the alleged rule violations would not form the basis
of any criminal charges.
The suspensions are an embarrassment for Liffe chairman Mr Nick Durlacher,
who is also the chairman of BZW Futures. He said yesterday that it was in
the best interests of Liffe and BZW to clear the matter up as quickly as
possible.
The suspension came within 48 hours of Liffe's report on the allegations of
trading malpractice. The formal hearings by Liffe's disciplinary committee
are expected to take place in the next month.
BZW has 37 traders and support staff on the floor of Liffe. In 1991, BZW
Futures contributed Pounds 3.3m to BZW's Pounds 60m profits. BZW's Pounds
243m profits in 1992 will not be broken down until October, but the futures
unit's contribution is expected to have fallen as a proportion of the total,
though not as a net amount.
Although dubious practices in the futures markets have become less common,
such cases do not help improve the image of the futures business, which is
still seeking to recover from a case of illegal trading in the US which
culminated in a Federal Bureau of Investigation sting operation at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1989.
Federal indictments were brought against 48 traders, alleged to have
illegally benefited from trades done on their personal accounts.
As a result, 46 have been convicted at trial or through plea agreements.
They had illegally benefitted from these trades done on their personal
accounts. The last 12 were sentenced on Wednesday, with sentences ranging
from small fines to short prison sentences.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's President Itamar Franco is facing a central bank rebellion over his
plan to reduce interest rates, the main feature of his economic package
announced last weekend.
Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes, the bank's governor, is said by associates to be
considering resigning in protest at Mr Franco's announcement, made with no
prior consultation, of an interest rate cut to stimulate growth.
Cancelling a planned visit to Washington where he was due to participate in
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, Mr Ximenes and his team
have spent all week fending off presidential pressure for a cut in interest
rates, up till now the government's principal weapon against inflation.
Central bank officials argue that real interest rates have already fallen
from last year's average 35 per cent to 27 per cent this year.
Mr Franco has sought to cast the financial sector as the main villains in
the fight against inflation and is accusing the central bank of
collaborating with the traders.
The uncertainty caused by the conflicting statements emerging from different
parts of the government is provoking enormous volatility on financial
markets, with interest rates fluctuating wildly and a flight to gold and
dollars.

FT  30 APR 93 / Argentina 'richest in Latin America'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA is the wealthiest country in Latin America, with per capita income
of Dollars 6,867 (Pounds 4,352), according to the latest figures from the
central bank. Gross domestic product in 1992 rose 8.7 per cent in real terms
to Dollars 226.64bn.
The figures confirm Argentina's strong growth record since it adopted strict
stabilisation policies in 1991. The economy has grown 18.4 per cent in the
last two years, with a further 3-5 per cent increase in output forecast for
this year.
The data was produced according to new statistical methods which re-estimate
the economy's structure for the first time since 1970. The figures also
include a partial estimate of the black economy.
The GDP figures are boosted by a government crackdown on tax evasion, which
has forced large parts of the black economy into the open.
The new statistics show Argentina's GDP has been grossly underestimated. In
1989, when hyperinflation depressed the value of Argentina's currency, the
World Bank said Argentina's GNP was equivalent to only Dollars 53bn,
recovering to Dollars 129.6bn in 1991. However, the new data is distorted by
a heavily overvalued currency.
Argentina remains Latin America's third largest economy, although the
difference with its giant neighbour Brazil has narrowed considerably.

FT  30 APR 93 / Tenfold interest rate rise urged on Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN central bank should raise interest rates tenfold to more than
1,000 per cent to reduce inflation and remove economic instability, a top
official from the International Monetary Fund said yesterday.
Mr Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, deputy director of the IMF's division dealing
with the former Soviet Union, said too soft a monetary policy had allowed a
surge in credit in Russia. This was 'clearly excessive' and underlined
efforts to transform the country into a market economy.
Mr Hernandez-Cata's strong words underline concern by many western observers
that Russia should be stepping up its own efforts towards economic reform as
a condition for receiving large financial assistance from the industrial
world.
He said there was a clear need to increase Russian interest rates, now at
about 100 per cent, to more than the annual rate of inflation, now running
above 1,000 per cent.
Such high rates of interest would 'hopefully' be needed only for a short
time to check over-loose monetary conditions, Mr Hernandez-Cata said.
He said that the surge in borrowing - much of which has gone to struggling
industrial enterprises - had both led to rapidly rising prices and a
depreciation of the rouble.
Because of the unstable economic conditions it had also contributed to large
amounts of money being transferred out of Russia.
'We have advised the Russian central bank at all levels to make price
stability its fundamental priority,' said Mr Hernandez-Cata. 'Industrial
policy and selective resource allocation should not be the preserve of the
central bank.'
A problem identified by the IMF is that the Russian central bank is
answerable to parliament rather than President Boris Yeltsin's government.
As a result, it has frequently not acted in concert with Mr Yeltsin over
plans for economic reform.
Mr Hernandez-Cata said he was encouraged by the results of the Russian
referendum which he hoped would strengthen Mr Yeltsin's hand in pushing for
change.
He contrasted Russia's handling of monetary policy with the actions of
Estonia and Latvia which he said had both made considerable efforts to bring
down inflation by tough monetary policies presided over by their central
banks.

FT  30 APR 93 / G7 pledges closer policy co-ordination
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Group of Seven leading industrial countries yesterday broadened the
scope of international economic co-operation with the aim of creating
sustained non-inflationary growth in the world economy.
In a communique notable for its plain language, they agreed that they should
work together to resolve long-term structural issues as well as short-term
problems.
At the end of the meeting of the finance ministers and central bank
governors of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada,
participants agreed that the gathering had been harmonious and constructive
 -in contrast to some recent meetings. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, Japanese finance
minister, said the countries 'reached a common understanding' about a range
of issues.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said the meeting helped 'lay the
basis for further actions to meet the challenges ahead. We can do more and
we should, and I am optimistic that we will.'
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
said the G7 nations had agreed a 'global strategy for growth' and a
'mutually reinforcing effort for recovery.' He hailed a significant change
in attitude compared with a G7 meeting last September when, he said, all
countries blamed each other for the world's economic problems.
The communique commited the G7 countries to implementing already announced
policies to promote growth and deal with problems such as excessive fiscal
deficits.
The ministers agreed that by the time of the World Economic summit in Tokyo
in July they would produce a report discussing structural measures to be
taken in their countries. These would include: the reform of labour markets;
ways to increase savings and investment; better focused spending on
infrastructure and education; action to cut spiralling health care costs and
ways of coping with the economic problems of ageing populations.
They said that co-operative action and sound economic policies at home,
together with such structural reform and further efforts to liberalise trade
would help create conditions in foreign exchange markets that were in line
with the economic fundamentals of the main industrial countries.
They agreed exchange rate volatility was 'undesirable', although
participants said relatively little time was spent on the exchange rate
issue. In a passage designed to assuage Japanese concerns about the recent
sharp rise of the yen against the dollar, they restated their continued
commitment to close co-operation in foreign exchange markets.
Mr Bentsen said he was optimistic that there would be further interest rate
reductions in Europe and that Japan's fiscal stimulus package would help
reduce its trade imbalance.
Both Mr Hayashi and Mr Bentsen said the prospects were good for further
lowering of European interest rates, but refused to comment on the need for
early cuts in German rates.
'That is a matter for the German authorities,' he said.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, said there was plenty
of room for lower German interest rates but said France would not seek to
drive rates down and would follow the market.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the German Bundesbank president, said there was no
demand that it give up its cautious easing of interest rates.
The ministers welcomed the results of the Russian referendum. Mr Horst
Kohler, state secretary in the German finance ministry, said that IMF
support under the new systemic transformation facility could flow to Russia
as soon as next month.
The atmosphere of the gathering was improved by Germany's decision this week
to lower its market interest rates, a step that may ease the way to lower
interest rates across Europe.
The intervention by the US Federal Reserve to curb the rapid rise of the yen
on foreign exchange markets also drew the teeth from potential controversy
by easing Japan's worries about the threat to its export competitiveness.

FT  30 APR 93 / Corruption trial for Collor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's disgraced former President Fernando Collor is to undergo a criminal
trial for corruption which could lead to eight years in prison.
The Supreme Court voted unanimously on Wednesday night to admit the charges
recommended by the Attorney General against Mr Collor and eight of his
associates.
Mr Collor, who was suspended from office last September and impeached in
December on accusations of benefiting from a massive kickback scheme, will
be the first major Brazilian politician to undergo trial for corruption. Mr
Collor will be tried for 'passive' corruption.
The Supreme Court decision is regarded as an important landmark towards
breaking the country's notorious reluctance to pursue high-level corruption.
But Mr Sydney Sanches, President of the Supreme Court, warned that it would
take more than a year.
The others facing trial include Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's former
campaign treasurer and alleged frontman, and Mr Claudio Vieira, Mr Collor's
former private secretary.
The main evidence in the case consists of the so-called corruptogram files
stored in Mr Farias's computer, now in police custody. These contain
detailed lists of kickbacks for government contracts.

FT  30 APR 93 / G7 Communique: Agreed approach to restoring growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOLLOWING is the communique issued by the Group of Seven finance
ministers and central bank governors:
The restoration of sustained non-inflationary growth is critical to our
efforts to deal with domestic and international challenges. It will help put
more of our citizens to work and off the unemployment lines; generate the
resources to meet pressing social needs; and reduce growing trade imbalances
and protectionist pressures. It will help provide the increased investment
opportunities to enhance our future growth.
Our policies to strengthen growth must reflect our differing economic
conditions. However, national objectives of increased, sustainable
non-inflationary growth converge with our international interests. We will
co-operate in the economic policy co-ordination process in pursuit of these
objectives. To that end, we have consulted closely and have agreed on the
following approach which is now being implemented
In North America, economic recovery has begun, and inflation remains under
control. The US and Canada are implementing measures to improve domestic
savings and investment, primarily through substantial reductions in fiscal
deficits. The positive effects are already visible in a substantial
reduction in long-term interest rates.
In Europe, where private demand is weak and unemployment rising in some
countries and recovery in its early stages in others, the European growth
initiative agreed in Edinburgh is now being implemented. Interest rates in
most countries have declined from high levels. The implementation of
medium-term budget consolidation plans and containment of labour costs and
inflationary pressures will create room for a further decline in interest
rates that should make a substantial contribution to growth.
In Japan, where domestic demand has been weak, substantial economic measures
have been announced. These measures represent a welcome contribution towards
the important goal of sustained non-inflationary growth based on increased
domestic demand, which will contribute to reducing the large external
imbalance.
The further opening of the international trading system is indispensable for
maximising world growth. A successful growth strategy requires prompt and
appropriate conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Protectionism retards growth
and must be resisted.
Strengthening the long-term growth potential of our economies and bringing
down unemployment require a broad range of structural reforms, reflecting
the different circumstances in each country. These include: labour market
reforms and greater flexibility in markets; measures to increase savings and
investment; the redirection of government spending towards investment in
physical and human capital; curbing the burgeoning cost of health care; and
addressing the economic effects of ageing populations. A report on these
issues will be submitted by the G7 finance ministers to the heads of state
and government at the Tokyo summit.
A co-operation strategy for non-inflationary growth based on sound
macro-economic policies, structural reforms and an open international
trading system, will help to create and maintain conditions in currency
markets that reflect economic fundamentals. Structural reforms that increase
the flexibility of our economies, will promote rapid domestic adjustment to
international developments and thus reduce the exchange rate changes that
are required to restore external balance.
We agreed that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals and that
excessive volatility is undesirable. We reviewed recent developments in
foreign exchange markets and affirmed our continued commitment to close
co-operation in exchange markets.
We welcome the results of the Russian referendum. They represent a major
endorsement of President Yeltsin and his government's commitment to
democracy and economic reform, as well as a mandate for change. It is our
strong hope that Russia will now implement far-reaching measures to
stabilise prices and promote private enterprise. Such steps would allow
Russia to fully utilise the multilateral support package. . . . announced by
the G7 in Tokyo this month. In this connection, we welcome successful
negotiation of the World Bank's Oil Rehabilitation Loan and the IMF's prompt
action in establishing the new Systemic Transformation Facility.

FT  30 APR 93 / Dirty, mean and a touch larger than life in Texas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY one thing is reasonably certain about the special election tomorrow to
fill the Senate seat from Texas vacated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen when he became
treasury secretary: nobody will get the necessary 50 per cent and there will
be a run-off between the top two, probably in early June.
This will not stop much sonorous comment about how the election is the first
state-wide referendum on the Clinton presidency, on its 101st day. But the
validity of much of this may be questioned for the very simple reason that
this is a Texas shoot-out in which, true to tradition, everybody, regardless
of race, creed and party, is running against Washington and its president.
The national implications will not be apparent until the predicted run-off,
when it would be bad news for Clinton if the Bentsen seat went Republican.
He has had trouble enough with 43 Senate Republicans and hardly needs more.
But the Saturday race has been pure Texas politics - which means that it has
been unscrupulous, dirty, mean and a touch larger than life.
The frontrunner is Mr Bob Krueger, the former Democratic congressman and
current interim Senator, appointed by Governor Anne Richards to fill Mr
Bentsen's shoes after she had taken herself out of consideration. In
Washington, but sensing the Texas wind, Mr Krueger has frequently voted
reflexively against his president.
Running second to fourth in most local polls are three Republicans, Ms Kay
Bailey Hutchison, the state treasurer, and two congressmen, Mr Jack Fields
and Mr Joe Barton.
Ms Hutchison, a moderate unpopular with the local pro-life movement because
of her tolerance for abortion, was considered the strongest candidate until
former Governor John Connally, who is advising Mr Fields, spread the nasty
little story that she had slapped around his own daughter, then an employee
of Ms Hutchison.
This is par for the Texas political course (Lyndon Johnson routinely spread
dirty rumours).
But Ms Hutchison is also on the receiving end of some rude out-of-state
comment.
The National Review, Mr William F Buckley's conservative magazine, dismissed
her as 'George Bush in drag' and urged its readers to support Mr Fields.
Still, Senator Phil Gramm, the other Senator and a Republican, is in her
corner.
Mr Barton is a ferocious conservative, highly regarded by the National Rifle
Association, Mr Fields a little less so and more of the populist. It is an
open question to what extent, in the event of a run-off, the two Republican
losers could back the winner.
Also on the ballot is Mr Richard Fisher, nominally a Democrat but in reality
a Perotista. He advised, to the extent anybody did, Texas billionaire Mr
Ross Perot in his presidential run last year and is blatantly mimicking that
campaign, including spending an estimated Dollars 4m of his own money to
finance it. However, all local polls show him running fifth.
Mr Krueger is expected to finish first on Saturday mostly because of the
Republican split. But local surveys also show him quite vulnerable in a
run-off. This contest would feature some seriously dirty pool.

FT  30 APR 93 / Yen dispute gone but not forgotten: Tension over currency,
soothed for now, is likely to resurface in the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE, GEORGE GRAHAM and CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY condemning in forthright terms 'attempts to artificially influence or
manipulate exchange rates' and by sanctioning intervention by the Federal
Reserve to stem the dollar's slide against the yen, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
treasury secretary, managed to reduce tension between the US and Japan just
in time for yesterday's Group of Seven meeting in Washington.
It was a typically adroit gesture from a politician with long experience of
deal-making on Capitol Hill.
Yet the dispute between Tokyo and Washington over the appropriate value of
the yen cannot now be dismissed as ancient history.
In coming years the Clinton administration is likely again to find itself
unhappy with the existing structure of exchange rates. The question is
whether its tactics will be any different in future disputes.
Mr Bentsen came into office promising to revive the G7 consultative process.
He said economic co-operation would become a two-way street, with the US
listening and responding to the views of other countries rather than
publicly bullying them, as had allegedly been the case in the past. He also
promised to put an emphasis on discreet private communications.
Recent US policy towards Japan hardly conforms to these ideals. 'I'd like to
see a stronger yen,' Mr Bentsen said on February 19 at the National Press
Club in Washington. The dollar immediately dived, falling to its then lowest
level in four decades of Y118.20.
On April 16, following a sticky session with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's
prime minister, President Bill Clinton was asked how the US Dollars 49bn
(Pounds 31bn) trade deficit with Japan could be reduced. His answer was
'number one, the appreciation of the Japanese yen.' The dollar then
plummeted to Y112.15, another low.
The remarks on exchange rates were replies to reporters' questions, not
formal policy declarations. Yet both Mr Bentsen and Mr Clinton are fully
aware of the extreme sensitivity of foreign exchange markets to public
remarks by senior politicians.
Mr Larry Summers, the treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
said this week that Mr Clinton's remark was 'descriptive not prescriptive.'
Even if this were true, it is too fine a distinction for markets to
appreciate.
If the remarks by Mr Bentsen and Mr Clinton were genuine slips of the tongue
they could easily have been corrected later by a categorical official
statement to the effect that the US did not want to see any further
appreciation of the yen. No such strong statement was forthcoming.
Moreover, when Mr Bentsen was in Tokyo two weeks ago for a meeting of G7
finance ministers, he declined to issue a joint statement with Mr Hayashi,
stating that rapid movements in exchange rates were unwelcome.
Undeterred, Japanese finance ministry officials briefed reporters that,
during the bilateral meeting, Mr Bentsen had agreed with the Japanese line
that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals.
The US treasury was so irritated it called for a public retraction, even
though this week Mr Bentsen echoed Mr Hayashi's line.
It is hard not to conclude that, at the beginning of the year, Mr Bentsen
believed the yen was too weak, that he decided to encourage a substantial
appreciation and that he felt the appreciation had gone far enough only when
the dollar dived below Y110 in recent days.
Indeed, in a briefing with reporters this Wednesday an unrepentant Mr
Bentsen came close to admitting that he had deliberately talked the yen up.
Referring to his February remarks at the National Press Club, he smiled and
said: 'It looks like those remarks turned out to be very timely.'
The US treasury claims that the sharp appreciation of the yen is a market
reaction to changing economic fundamentals. The argument is that the big
fiscal stimulus package recently unveiled in Tokyo will boost the Japanese
growth rate substantially, putting upward pressure on the currency. Some
impact is likely although a fiscal stimulus usually influences exchange
rates mainly through the expectation of higher interest rates, which are not
presently expected.
A stronger yen offers mixed blessings for the Japanese. In the short run it
will hurt export industries such as electronics and cars which already face
overcapacity.
But that could be offset by the help it will give to Japanese banks. Their
weakened balance sheets have raised doubts about their ability to finance
recovery through higher lending. A stronger yen increases the value of their
Japanese capital relative to their international borrowing and so should
create more room for higher lending in Japan.
In private Japanese officials concede that several factors justify a
stronger yen: the gap between US and Japanese long-term interest rates; the
size of the Japanese trade surplus, which has reached 3.3 per cent of gross
national product; the need to encourage an outflow of long-term capital from
Japan to offset the trade surplus; and the possibility that the US recovery
may turn out to be weaker than initially thought.
In the long run, a higher yen will hasten corporate restructuring amd make
manufacturing companies yet more competitive.
Does it matter, therefore, that the US treasury appears to have accelerated
this process? From Japan's point of view, probably not. The US, after all,
has never in the past achieved any long-run gains from dollar devaluation:
look at the condition of its balance of payments compared with that of
Japan.
But the way the yen appreciation was brought about arguably does matter,
given Mr Bentsen's commitment to economic co-operation.
Tokyo did not agree to the scale and speed of the yen's climb; indeed
officials were extremely annoyed.
As so often in the past, the US imposed its view of desirable exchange rate
patterns.
In future currency disputes the US's partners will be looking for a genuine
two-way street in talks with Washington.

FT  30 APR 93 / Positive thinking pervades G7 gathering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Group of Seven leading industrial countries yesterday met to intensify
their international economic co-operation against a background of increased
optimism that the process is producing results.
As they gathered in Washington, the finance ministers and central bank
governors from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada
could look back on several months of significant policy change in their
countries as well agreement on new aid for Russia.
The objective of yesterday's meeting was to review progress achieved and
consider medium-term policy targets such as the reduction of large fiscal
deficits in the industrial countries with the objective of fostering
prolonged and stable non-inflationary growth.
In contrast to some previous G7 meetings, the talks began in harmony. In
part, this reflected the determination of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury
secretary, to avoid putting the main trade partners of the US under visible
pressure.
The atmosphere was improved by Germany's decision this week to lower its
market interest rates, a step that may ease the way to lower interest rates
across Europe.
The intervention by the US Federal Reserve to curb the rapid rise of the yen
on foreign exchange markets also drew the teeth from potential controversy
by reducing Japanese worries about the threat to export competitiveness. Mr
Bentsen indicated that he did not expect much time to be spent on exchange
rate issues in the talks.
It was expected that recession in Europe's would prompt the US and other G7
countries to seek assurances from Germany that it would lower interest rates
further when appropriate. 'We are particularly looking at Europe where
growth is dismal,' Mr Bentsen said before the meeting. 'We hope that overall
the rates in Europe can be reduced some more.'
However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, made clear
yesterday that Germany still faced difficulties in getting inflation down so
there could be no question of aggressive rate cutting by the bank.
On the other hand, ministers referred to recent Bundesbank rate reductions,
the US programme to shrink its budget deficit and Japan's package of fiscal
measures to boost its economy as evidence of how the G7 countries are now
able to take each others' interests into account when formulating policies.
'In a way it looks like a revitalisation of the G7,' Mr Bentsen said.
He said the US was now 'in a position to restore some leadership' as a
result of its efforts to tackle its persistent budget deficit - a problem
which has made it the butt of criticism from other G7 countries in the past.
All participants appeared determined to develop the G7 as a forum for policy
co-ordination. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said he would
propose that the countries come together more frequently when necessary,
perhaps for shorter meetings and that they should expend less energy than in
the past on drafting communiques.
This pattern is already being established. A G7 meeting in February ended
without a formal statement, while yesterday's meeting was scheduled to run
for half a day only.

FT  30 APR 93 / Clinton celebrates 100th day with his new star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton chose to spend a good public part of his 100th day in
office with the new star of his administration, Ms Janet Reno, the attorney
general.
Washington was still buzzing yesterday over her defence to Congress of her
handling of the Waco siege, especially her breath-taking confrontation with
Congressman John Conyers of Michigan. Mr Clinton's trip to the justice
department, to attend the announcement of new nominations to senior
positions and for some remarks, was only arranged late on Wednesday.
The 100 days was predictably marked by many polls and much media and
political commentary seeking to assess Mr Clinton's record in office and
prospects for the future.
Unsurprisingly the results were mixed. The Washington Post/ABC poll found
approval for the way the president was handling his job by a 59-39 per cent
margin, higher than most other surveys but down from the 63-30 peak of late
February.
But only 37 per cent thought he had accomplished much in his first 100 days.
Of those who were disappointed, 40 per cent blamed Mr Clinton, 40 per cent
the Republican party and 17 per cent both equally.
Another national survey, conducted jointly by a prominent Democratic and
Republican pollsters, gave him a 55 per cent approval rating, which it said
was the lowest at this point of any presidency in the last 40 years. Some 57
per cent thought he had lost his focus as president and less than half (49
per cent) backed his economic plans, down from 58 per cent in February .
But this poll also found much greater public confidence in Mr Clinton's
ability to effect the right sort of change in the country than in the
Republican alternative. On healthcare alone, 72 per cent believed he could
come up with necessary reforms, versus a mere 19 per cent support for what
the Republicans might propose.
On the comment side, a Los Angeles Times editorial, while dismissing 100
days as 'an artificial benchmark,' said the president was 'terrific in two
areas but weak in a third. He is great with an audience and at policy
analysis. Less impressive is his ability to get things done.'
The Wall Street Journal, not a fan of Mr Clinton, said his first 100 days
showed him to be 'a president of the congressional agenda and special
interests.' The New York Times leader column, frequently critical, spoke of
'large accomplishments' (the budget bill) and 'many missteps' (the stimulus
package). It urged Mr Clinton 'not to confuse motion with progress.'

FT  30 APR 93 / Brazil bank in revolt over rate cut

<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's President Itamar Franco is facing a central bank rebellion over his
plan to reduce interest rates, the main feature of his economic package
announced last weekend.
Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes, the bank's governor, is said by associates to be
considering resigning in protest at Mr Franco's announcement, made with no
prior consultation, of an interest rate cut to stimulate growth.
Cancelling a planned visit to Washington where he was due to participate in
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, Mr Ximenes and his team
have spent all week fending off presidential pressure for a cut in interest
rates, up till now the government's principal weapon against inflation.
Central bank officials argue that real interest rates have already fallen
from last year's average 35 per cent to 27 per cent this year.
Mr Francisco Amadeu, director of monetary policy, insists that rates must
remain positive.
However, Mr Franco has sought to cast the financial sector as the main
villains in the fight against inflation and is accusing the central bank of
collaborating with the traders.
The uncertainty caused by the conflicting statements emerging from different
parts of the government is provoking enormous volatility on financial
markets, with interest rates fluctuating wildly and a flight to gold and
dollars.
Through the Brazilian press Mr Franco yesterday issued a stern warning to
the central bank board to co-operate.
'A high interest rate policy will not survive in my government,' the Jornal
do Brasil reported him as saying, adding that he said he would dismiss the
directors unless they obeyed. 'These people think I'm stupid but I'm
watching them and I know that the rates are not coming down,' he said.
Ironically on Monday Mr Franco said he favoured an independent central bank.

SUSPECTED Maoist guerrillas dynamited seven banks in the Peruvian capital,
then exploded bombs at the education ministry and a technological institute
overnight, police said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lima.
Three pedestrians were wounded in one of the attacks. Guerrillas, presumed
from the Shining Path group, later exploded car bombs at the ministry in the
San Borja district and the San Ignacio de Loyola Institute in Miraflores,
damaging both buildings and surrounding homes, police said.
Hours earlier, guerrillas exploded bombs at the seven banks around the
capital, damaging doors and windows, police said.
Shining Path has waged a 13-year civil war costing more than 26,000 lives in
its campaign to turn Peru into a Cambodian-style co-operative farming
economy.

FT  30 APR 93 / Collor to face corruption trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's disgraced former President Fernando Collor is to undergo a criminal
trial for corruption which could lead to eight years in prison.
The Supreme Court voted unanimously on Wednesday night to admit the charges
recommended by the Attorney General against Mr Collor and eight of his
associates.
Mr Collor, who was suspended from office last September and impeached in
December on accusations of benefiting from a massive kickback scheme, will
be the first major Brazilian politician to undergo trial for corruption.
The Supreme Court decision is regarded as an important landmark towards
breaking the country's notorious reluctance to pursue high-level corruption.
But Mr Sydney Sanches, President of the Supreme Court, warned that it would
be a long trial. 'I think it will take more than a year because there are
many accused and lots of witnesses to hear,' he said.
Mr Collor will be tried for 'passive' corruption. The others facing trial
include Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's former campaign treasurer and
alleged frontman, and Mr Claudio Vieira, Mr Collor's former private
secretary, both accused of passive and active corruption, and suppression of
evidence.
The police chief heading investigations on the 'Collorgate' case has also
recommended charges against Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello, the first economy
minister of the Collor government.
The main evidence in the case consists of the so-called corruptogram files
stored in Mr Farias's computer, now in police custody. These contain
detailed lists of kickbacks for government contracts.

FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton in drive to prove Nafta free trade
deal is still alive
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is making a concerted drive to prove that the
North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada is not dead.
Mr Leon Panetta, the White House budget director, threw the administration
and the Democratic congressional leadership into turmoil earlier this week
with the warning that Nafta simply could not pass Congress.
The loud criticisms of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas populist, were making the
task much more difficult, he said.
Since then, administration officials have gone out of their way to reaffirm
their commitment to the treaty.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, insisted that the
administration intended to complete this summer the side agreements on the
environment, labour standards and import surges which President Bill Clinton
has asked for.
'We intend to take Nafta to the Congress and we intend to meet the January
1, 1994 deadline for the implementation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement,' Mr Kantor said.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, acknowledged that winning
congressional approval would be difficult, but said Nafta's passage was
important for US relations with the whole of Latin America, and not just
Mexico.
'It's going to be a tough time passing it. It will not be easy, but I am
optimistic that we will get there, and this year,' he said.
Congressional leaders acknowledge that Mr Panetta's vote count is correct,
but say that, with the side agreements still to be negotiated, it is
scarcely surprising that Nafta does not yet have the necessary support.
Foreign governments and Washington trade analysts have at times been
perplexed over who in fact controls US trade policy, and there have been
reports of rifts between Mr Bentsen, with a broadly free trade approach, and
Mr Kantor, whose style has been more confrontational.
Mr Bentsen, however, insisted that trade policy was Mr Kantor's
responsibility.

<TEXT>
LOANS exceeding Dollars 700m (Pounds 444m) have been pledged by a group of
international financial institutions to equip a 700MW coal-fired power
station in the Philippines.
Hopewell Power (Philippines) Corporation, a subsidiary of Hopewell Holdings
of Hong Kong, will construct the plant under a build-operate-transfer (BOT)
arrangement with the government.
The Dollars 700m will be used to buy equipment, mainly from Mitsubishi of
Japan and Westinghouse of the US.
Costing an estimated Dollars 933m, the plant is described as the biggest
single foreign investment ever in the Philippines.
The financing deal was arranged by the International Finance Corporation,
the World Bank arm concerned with private sector projects. The other main
sources of finance are the Japanese and US export-import banks. It is the
first time the latter have provided limited recourse co-financing without
government guarantees for a large power project in the developing world.
The IFC will provide Dollars 10m in equity and lend Dollars 60m on its own
account, with up to Dollars 40m more to be syndicated with commercial banks.
Financing is also being provided by Britain's Commonwealth Development
Corporation and the Asian Development Bank.
The financing deal is expected to become a model for infrastructure projects
elsewhere in the developing world.

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA and the EC yesterday agreed further steps to expand trade and economic
relations, with a senior Beijing official outlining an ambitious programme
to liberalise the Chinese economy to prepare for membership of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner responsible for external economic
relations, said the talks had been 'frank but fruitful'. He stressed that
the pace of normalisation of EC-China relations would depend on Beijing
improving its record on human rights, and expressed concern about Chinese
violations of the 1987 international convention on torture.
Sir Leon was speaking at the end of two days of talks in Brussels between
senior EC officials and a Chinese delegation led by Mrs Wu Yi, Chinese
minister for foreign trade - the first official visit by a Chinese trade
minister in four years.
The Chinese offered a polite rebuff to Sir Leon's pressure on human rights
on the grounds that these matters were not part of the trade agenda. Sir
Leon said this was expected, adding later: 'I don't expect the process (of
normalisation) to be slowed down or stopped.'
The most concrete result of the talks is the establishment of a permanent
bilateral trade and economic working group which is likely to meet before
the end of July. Tasks will include resolving differences over trade
statistics, pinning down Chinese plans for liberalisation, and how they link
with future relations with Taiwan and Hong Kong.
The talks also produced an agreement to upgrade the current EC-China
management development programme into a business school, to be based in
Shanghai.
During the talks, Sir Leon pressed China to open its market to EC imports
and end discrimination against European car-parts, intellectual property,
veterinary standards and joint vehicle production.
He urged China to overhaul its restrictive regime on imports and help cut
China's Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.9bn) trade surplus which is likely to rise this
year. This was necessary for the EC to go beyond support 'in principle' for
China's request to join Gatt, Sir Leon suggested.
In response, Mrs Yi said China was willing to negotiate on vehicle joint
ventures and offered a 'promising' answer on intellectual property.
Last month, the EC took action to protect Community bicycle makers from
alleged 'dumping' by Chinese producers.

FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland likely to head Gatt - Search
for Dunkel's successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER EC competition commissioner Peter Sutherland is now the clear
favourite to succeed Mr Arthur Dunkel this summer as director-general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Sutherland, an Irishman and currently chairman of Allied Irish Banks, has
apparently changed his mind about not wanting to be considered for the job,
following strong pressure from Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission.
Trade officials in Geneva said they thought Mr Sutherland, who has US as
well as European Community support, would succeed in securing the necessary
consensus of Gatt's 110 members.
However, names of three or four developing country candidates, from Latin
America and south-east Asia, may also be put forward for consultation among
Gatt members. This will be conducted next week by Mr Balkrishan Zutshi,
India's Gatt ambassador and current chairman of the contracting parties
(members).
One of those mentioned is Mr Julio Lacarte Muro, Uruguay's well-respected
veteran Gatt ambassador, who helped found the Gatt in 1947.
Mr Sutherland, regarded as an able and astute EC commissioner, is reckoned
to have the two essential qualities for the job, apart from a commitment to
open trade: the ability to master technical, often highly complex, trade
issues, and the political authority required to deal on equal terms with
government leaders.
Whoever gets the job will need both qualities in good measure. The most
urgent task will be to try to conclude the long-delayed Uruguay Round of
trade liberalisation talks by the end of the year. This will mean knocking
powerful heads together to secure the necessary compromises, notably among
the leading traders, the US, the EC and Japan.
Mr Sutherland's earlier reported rejection of the job, for family reasons,
led to gloom and despondency among Gatt staff who feared a long period of
uncertainty and lack of direction at this crucial stage in the round.
Gatt's top post has traditionally gone to a European; Mr Dunkel is Swiss and
his two predecessors were Swiss and British.
A number of developing countries, which play an increasingly active role in
Gatt, would like a third world national in the job, but this is opposed by
the US and may not be pressed too far.
'It would be great to have a Latin American but the main thing is to have
someone with the political stature and familiarity with trade matters,' said
one Latin American diplomat. 'Mr Sutherland is that kind of person.'
Some countries would still prefer to ask Mr Dunkel to stay on until the
Uruguay Round is completed. Only then will Gatt members know for sure
whether they are seeking a political heavyweight to run a powerful world
trade organisation, or a technocrat who will oil the wheels of the present
system.
But Mr Dunkel, who was appointed in 1980, says he does not want another
extension of his mandate when the first expires at the end of June. In any
event, most Gatt members appear to see new blood as preferable to
continuity. Among the leading traders, many of the key negotiating posts
have already changed hands. The Gatt itself needs an invigorating force at
the helm.
In particular, Gatt members are keen to see the important deputy posts
filled. Mr Charles Carlisle, Mr Dunkel's American deputy, wants to step down
this summer.
A second deputy job, traditionally held by an Indian, has been vacant for
nearly two years. The Latin Americans have their eye on a proposed third
deputy post, who might have responsibility for Gatt's economic analysis and
research.
Final decisions on all these jobs await the naming of Mr Dunkel's successor.

FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Philippine financing breaks new ground

<TEXT>
LOANS exceeding Dollars 700m (Pounds 444m) have been pledged by a group of
international financial institutions to equip a 700MW coal-fired power
station in the Philippines.
Hopewell Power (Philippines) Corporation, a subsidiary of Hopewell Holdings
of Hong Kong, will construct the plant under a build-operate-transfer (BOT)
arrangement with the government.
The Dollars 700m will be used to buy equipment, mainly from Mitsubishi of
Japan and Westinghouse of the US.
Costing an estimated Dollars 933m, the plant is described as the biggest
single foreign investment ever in the Philippines.
The financing deal was arranged by the International Finance Corporation,
the World Bank arm concerned with private sector projects. The other main
sources of finance are the Japanese and US export-import banks. It is the
first time the latter have provided limited recourse co-financing without
government guarantees for a large power project in the developing world.
The IFC will provide Dollars 10m in equity and lend Dollars 60m on its own
account, with up to Dollars 40m more to be syndicated with commercial banks.
Financing is also being provided by Britain's Commonwealth Development
Corporation and the Asian Development Bank.
The financing arrangement is expected to become a model for similar
infrastructure projects elsewhere in the developing world.
'The availability of export credits without guarantees from host country
governments will be critical in expanding the private sector's role in the
power sector,' Mr Vijay Chaudhry, IFC power division manager, said in
Washington.
The loan from Japan's Eximbank, which accounts for nearly Dollars 370m of
the financing package, is also its first for a BOT project.
Hopewell Power will build the plant and operate it for 25 years, during
which the state-owned National Power Corporation (Napocor) will buy the
electricity it produces. The plant will then be handed over to Napocor.
The plant, located in Pagbilao town in Quezon province some 125km southeast
of Manila, is scheduled for completion in 1995, to serve as a baseload plant
to service consumers in Luzon, the country's main island and is part of
government efforts to ease the serious power shortages that can last 8-10
daily in Manila and the rest of Luzon.

FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Gatt acts on duties row
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The subsidies committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has
agreed to an EC request for conciliation in its row over anti-subsidy duties
imposed by the US on some EC steel imports.
The committee has 30 days from April 28, when the decision was made, to
resolve the dispute after which the EC can ask for an independent panel to
rule on the issue. The EC and US have already held unsuccessful bilateral
consultations over the duties.
The EC argues that the US has used a 'flawed methodology' for calculating
subsidies which breaches Gatt's subsidies code. This is denied by the US,
which has stressed the duties remain preliminary.
Seven EC members are among 19 countries hit by US anti-dumping and
anti-subsidy duties on their steel exports.

Mexican trade minister Jaime Serra Puche said this week it was 'highly
probable' that Nafta would go into effect on January 1, 1994 as scheduled
despite rising criticism in the US, Reuter reports from Mexico City.
He also said that discussions on parallel accords to the still unratified
trade pact are going well and the negotiators should have 'important bases'
for preparing a final text of the agreement These are aimed at strengthening
Nafta's environmental and labour provisions.
The trade agreement would phase out most trade barriers between the US,
Canada and Mexico.
Mr Serra warned that opposition to Nafta should be expected to grow as it
gets nearer to becoming reality. The pact was signed last year but still has
to be approved by the legislatures of the three countries.

A HIGH-LEVEL Israeli business delegation on a visit to Bombay and New Delhi
has identified half a dozen possible joint ventures in India with Israeli
technology and, probably, equity.
Business relations between the two countries have blossomed since the
opening of full diplomatic relations last year after four decades of cold,
if not hostile, relations.
Mr Itzak Gerberg, Israeli consul-general in Bombay, expects two-way trade to
double to Dollars 500m (Pounds 317m) this year.
The two countries see joint production openings in textiles, clothes and
chemicals for export from Israel to Europe and the US duty-free and
quota-free. Israel has agreements with the US and EC to allow free access
for goods with a minimum 35 per cent Israeli content (Indian content could
make up the rest). A similar agreement was reached with the European Free
Trade Association last year.
Israel considers this a way to boost its exports, worth Dollars 13.2bn last
year.
Israel companies also plan to collaborate with their Indian counterparts in
bidding for computer software contracts.

FT  30 APR 93 / Iraq nerve agent evidence found
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE that Iraq used lethal nerve agent weapons as well as mustard gas
against its own Kurdish citizens in 1988 has been found by scientists at the
UK's Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment.
Soil samples from the village of Birjinni in northern Iraq have shown traces
of the nerve agent sarin. Iraq is also alleged to have used nerve agents in
the attack on Halabja near the Iraq-Iran border earlier in 1988, but this
has not been proven.
Although nerve agents have existed since the 1930s, when sarin and other
substances were developed by Nazi Germany, this is the first ever documented
evidence of use.
A British official said Iraq was probably the first country to have employed
nerve gas, which affects the central nervous system, causing breathing
difficulties, involuntary movements and death.
Scientists of the US organisation Physicians for Human Rights collected the
samples in 1992 from the craters left by one of three bomb clusters.
Dr Graham Pearson, the CBDE's director general, said one set of samples
provided traces of mustard gas, which damages the skin, respiratory tract
and eyes. The other set, including metal fragments, contained an acid that
Dr Pearson said could only have come from sarin.
Four people are known to have died after the attack. But samples from the
graves of two victims showed no traces of chemical weapons.
The attack took place in August 25, shortly after the ceasefire between Iran
and Iraq. It is believed to have been the last time Iraqi forces made use of
their nerve weapons.
Dr Pearson said he hoped the findings would deter states from thinking they
could get away with chemical warfare without leaving evidence. They would
help to underpin the Chemical Weapons Convention which, since it was opened
for signature in January, has been signed by 145 countries and will come
into force at the earliest in January 1995.
Iraq's stockpile of chemical arms is in the process of being destroyed under
UN auspices. But a British official admitted; 'You can never be absolutely
certain that you have detected all the weapons.'

FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: UK machine tool maker wins Pounds  1/2 m
China order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British machine tool company FMT has won a Pounds 500,000 order from
China 18 months after losing a much bigger one because of changes in the
UK's Aid and Trade Provision (ATP).
The Brighton-based company will supply its latest horizontal spindle
machining centre to Linyi, a manufacturer of heavy earthmoving equipment
based in Shandong province.
The deal is a consolation for Mr Mike Bright, FMT's chairman, following the
loss of a Pounds 3.5m contract with Linyi.
In a series of exchanges in 1991 with the department of trade and industry,
Mr Bright had protested about ATP funds being disallowed for the contract.
It fell foul of the department's decision to concentrate scarce ATP
resources on basic infrastructural projects in developing countries rather
than those designed to increase manufacturing capacity.
An Austrian company eventually won that contract.
The latest order is self-financed by Linyi, said Mr Bright, and continues
FMT's long-standing co-operation with China, one of the few machine tool
markets to grow strongly last year.
Mr Bright, known for his robust views, said he was 'extremely concerned' by
the level of funding being made available to German machine tool makers for
contracts in China, to compensate them for the domestic recession.
FMT's contract comes as Birmingham-based Cincinnati Milacron announced a
Pounds 3m co-production and technology transfer deal with the China National
Machining Import and Export Corporation and the Beijing Machinery &amp;
Electricity Institute. It involves the Sabre 750 machining centre, which the
US-owned company developed and produces in Britain.
Cincinnati will be supplying a complete model and a number of kits and will
transfer manufacturing technology for the Sabre 750 and a larger Sabre
machine. The company said the deal was a significant step in its far eastern
marketing activity. It hopes for further agreements as other Sabre models
are produced.

FT  30 APR 93 / Hussein tries to cope with Islamic surge / Assessing the
king's 40 years in power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN King Hussein surveys the ever-expanding white city of Amman from his
hill-top palace on Sunday, he may have difficulty in recalling the small
dusty outpost to the east of the Jordan River which became his capital on
the May 2, 1953, the day he formally assumed constitutional powers.
Thrust into a turbulent Middle East as an 18-year-old Sandhurst graduate 40
years ago, the king is now the longest reigning monarch in the world. Having
survived two Arab-Israeli wars, numerous coup and assassination attempts,
international alienation over the Gulf war, and now, apparently, a cancer
operation, he can afford a little self-indulgent pride as Jordanians take to
the streets this weekend to celebrate his accession.
The kingdom is stable, its economy is growing under the watchful eye of the
International Monetary Fund, and with the country's first multi-party
elections since 1956 planned for later this year, Jordan is projecting
itself as a model democracy in the region.
'The king's past 40 years have been vindicated,' says Mr Mustapha Harameneh,
a local historian. 'His brand of nationalism with its human rights and
democracy has put the Hashemites in a position of leadership in the Arab
world.'
But Jordan has yet to be reconciled with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait after the
king refused to join the coalition forces to oust Iraq from Kuwait in 1991.
The Middle East peace talks, to which the king is so firmly committed,
continue to disillusion Palestinians and Moslem fundamentalists in the
country. And the king's democratic vision for the future will face its most
crucial test yet at the forthcoming parliamentary elections.
Political parties, banned in Jordan since 1957, were legalised last year. A
total of 16 parties has so far registered to vie for seats in the 80-member
parliament elected nearly four years ago. But by far the strongest and most
well-organised is the Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the Moslem
Brotherhood, which aims to create an Islamic state.
Many Jordanians fear that they will achieve a landslide victory. They point
out that the splintering effect of the other 15 parties, whose manifestos
are largely indistinguishable, cannot possibly create an effective
opposition to the Brotherhood. The Islamists command a great deal of popular
support. They hold the largest bloc, of 30 seats, in the outgoing parliament
and have made significant gains in local council and student elections.
They are especially effective in mobilising support from the
underprivileged. Despite a real growth in gross domestic product of 11 per
cent last year, a recent government survey showed that one fifth of Jordan's
population of 4m fall below the poverty line.
Anxiety over an Islamist-dominated government is played down by government
and palace officials. 'I don't think one can say publicly that one is
worried. Obviously democracy is not for the faint hearted,' says Crown
Prince Hassan.
But privately there is talk of changing the 1986 electoral law to a one
person, one vote system which will drastically cut the number of people
voting for Islamist candidates. There also remains the possibility that the
elections will be postponed to allow the new non-religious parties to
develop.
'If there is a breakthrough on the peace process in the next few weeks I
don't think there will be elections because the government can't risk a
parliament where the majority will vote against them,' predicts one MP.
Although press reports have suggested that 500 Islamist candidates are to
stand for election, Brotherhood officials say that rather than confront the
government over the peace process they might simply retain their position as
the opposition for the time being.
Such a conciliatory approach would be typical of the co-existence between
the fundamentalists and government over the years. Unlike Algeria and Egypt
there is little evidence of Islamic militancy in Jordan and they insist that
they are 100 per cent loyal to the king. But their ultimate aim is clear.
'We will influence the Islamisation of this country calmly and slowly,' says
Mr Abdullah al-Akayleh, a leader of the Islamic National Front.
The king established a close relationship with the Brotherhood early in his
reign in order to counteract the growing threat of the leftist Nasserist and
Ba'athist parties, banned in 1957 following a coup attempt. Ironically he
now needs the support of such secular parties to fend off the
fundamentalists' progressive bid for power. But most of all he needs the
support of his people. Less than 40 per cent of the population voted in the
last election in 1989 and there remains an acute sense of apathy that while
the king is around everything will be all right.
The danger is that without a strong anti-Islamist secular vote the elections
may be yet another crisis the king has to navigate to retain maintain the
status quo.

FT  30 APR 93 / Boycott threat follows Yemen poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANAA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most successful parties in early returns for Yemen's elections
yesterday accused the two government parties of 'interfering grossly and
flagrantly' to influence voters and threatened to boycott parliament if such
'abuses' continued.
The statement from the Islah party, an alliance of Islamists and one of the
country's biggest tribal groups, came as international observers monitoring
unfied Yemen's first election praised the enthusiasm and commitment of
officials and voters, but said they had witnessed 'numerous' and
'significant' irregularities.
Nevertheless, the 20-strong group of observers, led by the International
Republican Institute, an affiliate of the US Republican party, said problems
during Tuesday's vote 'do not seem to have significantly affected' the
outcome.
Islah has already secured 40 seats with two thirds of the 301 electoral
districts declared, making it by far the most successful non-government
party. But it accused the General People's Congress (GPC) and Yemen
Socialist party (YSP), which together form the present ruling coalition, of
using security forces to 'terrorise' and 'threaten' its candidates.
'If these abuses continue, we will not participate in the forthcoming
parliament,' said Mr Abdullah al-Akwa, a member of Islah's political office.
The GPC has won 95 of the 199 early results, with the YSP winning 24.
Independent candidates won 31 seats. With counting still continuing late
yesterday in several far-flung districts, full results are unlikely before
the weekend.
Unofficial indications suggest the GPC and YSP will form a sufficient bloc
in the new parliament to form a coalition government. Mr Ali Salem al-Beid,
vice president and YSP secretary-general, said before the vote that 'even if
either party wins the majority, the circumstances of the country require the
coalition' - a sentiment aired before the poll by President Ali Abdullah
Saleh.
While it has been widely assumed Islah would form part of such a coalition,
its attack on the two ruling parties throws considerable doubts on its
desire to join the government. It also suggests that a period of fierce
bargaining over an eventual cabinet will follow the final results.
In their preliminary report on the elections, the international observers
criticised the requirement that illiterate voters have their ballot
witnessed, which they said compromised the secrecy of the vote. They also
criticised the government's control of the media during the campaign and
said allegations of organised registration of voters outside their
appropriate districts were 'too consistent and widespread to be
disregarded.'
But observers were at pains to point out the ballots had been a considerable
experiment. A separate report by the British Electoral Reform Society said
electors 'with only a few exceptions were able to express their choice of
parliamentary representatives freely and without duress.' The report adds
that 'despite individual flaws, we believe that this election was a
success'.

FT  30 APR 93 / Pakistan seeks to refute terror label: A thankless task for
the authorities in Peshawar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gulzar Khan, the home secretary of Pakistan's North West Frontier
Province, which lies on the mountainous border with Afghanistan, is in the
front-line of his country's efforts to refute international charges that
Pakistan has become a hotbed of terrorism.
His province is home to thousands of veterans of the fighting in
Afghanistan, many of the men possessing no skills except the ability to fire
a gun.
The dusty provincial capital of Peshawar is an arms bazaar, where a pistol
costs PRs1,000 (Pounds 24), a Kalashnikov PRs10,000 and a Stinger missile
can be bought for about PRs50,000.
Mr Khan has the thankless job of trying to keep tabs on this flow of men and
munitions.
When intelligence officers from the US and other countries call on his
office and demand information about suspected terrorists, Mr Khan answers
that he has little to give. 'If only they could give us some specific
information. But they don't. Sometimes they will not even say who they are
looking for. Perhaps they don't know themselves.'
Nevertheless, Mr Khan and other Pakistani officials are hoping that they
have done enough to convince the US of their anti-terrorist credentials.
Today the US is due to publish its annual report on terrorism. Washington
has warned that it might brand Pakistan a terrorist nation and add its name
to a list of pariah states comprising Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
and Syria.
A poor country in need of foreign aid and investment, Pakistan could ill
afford such a punishment. Pakistani officials are busy trying to improve
their country's anti-terrorist credentials. This weekend Mr Balakh Sher
Mazari, the newly-appointed prime minister, told a conference of foreign
ministers from Islamic countries: 'Pakistan is committed to combating
international terrorism whenever and wherever it occurs.'
However, Pakistan has enormous difficulties putting Mr Mazari's words into
practice. The country is still struggling with the aftermath of the
decade-long war in which Afghanistan's communist government backed by Soviet
troops battled against guerrillas funded and supplied principally by the US.
Washington then ignored the fact that arms were often diverted into the
wrong hands. So did Saudia Arabia and other Arab countries which, as well as
cash, send hundreds of young volunteers to join the war.
But following the Soviet withdrawal, the US abruptly changed tack. Suddenly
Pakistan was no longer a favoured ally in the global struggle against
communism, but an Islamic country with too many guns and armed men for its
own good, not to mention an active nuclear weapons programme. American
military aid was cut off, followed by a rapid reduction in economic aid.
Pakistani officials believe they have been treated unfairly. They argue that
they have been left to cope alone with the aftermath of the anti-communist
war and of the continuing fighting in Afghanistan between rival guerilla
groups. 'We have been left to clear up the flotsam and jetsam,' says Mr Gul
Haneef, a senior foreign ministry official.
US diplomats accept the war has imposed a huge burden on Pakistan. But they
argue Pakistan has done too little to prevent terrorists from exploiting the
general chaos and that some Pakistani organisations may also have aided and
abetted terrorism.
The US expressed particular concern about Arab militants who came to fight
in Afghanistan. Egypt and other conservative Arab states have accused
Pakistan of harbouring suspected terrorists from their countries. To show
good faith, Mr Khan in Peshawar has in the past month held about 160 Arabs
to check their documents. Pakistan will expel about 50 because their visas
have expired or are otherise invalid; others are being encouraged to leave.
But none has been identified as a terrorist suspect, says Mr Khan.
The most extensive charges levelled against Pakistan come from India, which
has much to gain from having the US label its arch-rival as a terrorist
state. India has alleged that Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence agency
trains terrorists and supplies arms to insurgents in the troubled northern
Indian states of Kashmir and the Punjab. Some Indian politicians have also
accused Pakistan of having aided the terrorists who bombed Bombay last
month.
Pakistanis are mostly horrified at the possibility that these charges may
culminate in their country being labelled terrorist. They warn that such a
move could undermine pro-western opinion and and reinforce the cause of
Islamic militancy. As Mr Qaisar Butt, chief reporter on Peshawar's local
newspaper, says: 'If you want to call us terrorists, we'll start behaving
like terrorists.'

FT  30 APR 93 / Britain keeps its counsel after HK talks

BRITAIN will wait until after the third round of Anglo-Chinese talks on Hong
Kong political development in three weeks' time to make its assessment of
whether negotiations are worth pursuing.
The second round of talks in Beijing yesterday failed to produce any
proposals from China about the colony's 1994 and 1995 electoral
arrangements. Britain had hoped that Beijing would have moved on from
talking about 'principles' to the substance of the negotiation.
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, last October put forward a
seven-point plan for broadening democratic participation in the colony's
future elections. China condemned the governor for deviating from past
agreements and understandings and refused to talk to the UK for six months.
It was understood last night that in the second round of talks, which
started on Wednesday and finished yesterday, the Chinese side was still
talking about 'principles' as they had done in talks a week ago.
British officials believe after the third round, which will be held on May
21-23, they will be in a better position to assess whether China is sincere
in its desire to reach agreement, or if it is just simply filibustering.
In the event of the latter, they believe that they have the necessary time
to present Mr Patten's proposals to the Legislative Council, the colony's
law-making body, and have the requisite laws on the statute books by the end
of July.
Some observers suspect that Beijing is using the Sino-British talks to slow
moves towards arrangements for elections in 1994 and 1995. They also believe
that China may seek to use the Beijing discussions to marginalise Mr Patten.
The joint statement gave no indication of progress or otherwise in
discussions conducted in a secluded diplomatic compound in the western
suburbs of the Chinese capital.
Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador to Beijing and head of its
negotiating team, said he hoped the talks would help to 'restore
co-operation' between the two sides. These remarks mirrored those of his
counterpart, vice foreign minister Mr Jiang Enzhu who said the talks were
aimed at restoring good working relations.

FT  30 APR 93 / 'Bridge built' between Taiwan and China

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA and Taiwan, bitter enemies for more than 40 years, yesterday signed
agreements in Singapore which could mark the first tentative steps towards
the resolution of one of the world's more intractable conflicts.
The agreements themselves were limited in nature. The talks were described
as unofficial and were not supposed to involve any discussion of political
matters. But, as the two delegations posed for the world's media, clinked
champagne glasses and repeatedly shook hands, it was hard to escape the
feeling that something important had been set in train.
The delegates seemed to agree. Mr Koo Chen Fu, a multi-millionaire
businessman and leader of Taiwan's delegation, said the meeting had been
historic. Mr Wang Daohan, a former mayor of Shanghai and leader of the China
side, said the discussions had been momentous.
'We have built a bridge between us,' said Mr Koo. 'No one can say we have
not achieved results . . . both sides have won.' The agreements covered
mostly technical matters. These included joint efforts to combat crime, the
resolution of fishing disputes, judicial co-operation and cultural and
scientific exchanges.
Most importantly a formal structure for future exchanges between the two
sides was also established. With the opening up of China's economy and
growing business and social ties between Taiwan and the mainland such lines
of communication are urgently needed.
Both sides also talked of the deep differences between them. Taiwan
businesses now have an estimated Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn) of investments
in China.
Taiwan had come to the Singapore meeting wanting assurances from China that
it would develop a legal framework for the protection of these investments.
The Chinese side refused, saying existing laws were adequate. Disagreements
on this issue, still unresolved, forced the meeting into a third unscheduled
day.
Taiwan also became angry when China raised the question of direct shipping
and air links. All contact between China and Taiwan, politically separated
since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, is indirect.
The word reunification was hardly mentioned. One delegate said that Taiwan
and China had developed different systems and different ways of life.
It's not like in Europe,' he said. 'Don't think there is going to be unity
overnight. If it ever happens it will take years.'
But at least now the two sides are not, as they were not so long ago,
lobbing artillery shells at each other.

FT  30 APR 93 / WHO vote unlikely to end blizzard of criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT WEEK the 184 members of the World Health Organisation are expected to
confirm by a big majority the reappointment of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima for a
second five-year term as director-general of the United Nations agency.
The decision, however overwhelming, is unlikely to calm the blizzard of
criticism levelled at Dr Nakajima, a Japanese pharmacologist, whose reign at
WHO since 1988 has been dogged by scandal, mounting opposition of leading
western donors, and disaffection to the point of open revolt by many WHO
staff.
Dr Nakajima's critics say his re-election will seriously weaken the ability
of the Geneva-based agency, which has an annual budget of Dollars 850m and
employs 4,700 people worldwide, to tackle global health challenges including
Aids, child health and the spread of infectious disease. They draw parallels
with the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in the
mid-1980s under Mr Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, a Senegalese, who was finally forced
out after rampant waste and mismanagement had destroyed Unesco's
credibility.
In February, a senior Japanese staff member in WHO's regional office in
Manila, where Dr Nakajima was previously director, wrote to a top foreign
ministry official in Tokyo that 'another five years of Nakajima will be a
nightmare for the Japanese government and a catastrophe for the WHO'.
Dr Nakajima had barely arrived in Geneva before the rumblings of discontent
began. Staff were upset by his autocratic management style, the appointment
of Manila cronies to key positions, and the demotion or transfer of staff
who had close links with his Danish predecessor, Dr Halfdan Mahler. US and
European donors say Dr Nakajima, has failed to give the organisation vision
and leadership.
WHO staff also question the role of Mr Ryoichi Sasakawa, the controversial
Japanese billionaire philanthropist and rumoured aspirant for the Nobel
Peace Prize, who is a generous contributor to WHO. Dr Yugi Kawaguchi, who
acted as the WHO's linkman with Mr Sasakawa in the mid-1980s, was promoted
by Dr Nakajima to the important post of director of planning, co-ordination
and co-operation.
More recently, US officials have accused Japan of buying the votes of
developing country members of the 31-strong executive board, which in
January voted 18 to 13 to renominate the incumbent. The US, the EC and the
Arab League backed Dr Mohammed Abdelmoumene, an Algerian neurologist, who
was Dr Nakajima's deputy until suspended last year after declaring his
candidacy. Dr Abdelmoumene remains on special leave with full pay.
A special audit conducted by Sir John Bourn, Britain's comptroller and
auditor general, found that the value of WHO contracts to executive board
members had more than doubled in the second half of 1992 compared with a
year earlier, and identified five contracts involving financial
irregularities.
While Dr Nakajima was not personally involved, all five contracts were
signed by Dr Kawaguchi using Japanese funds. By far the biggest, a research
contract of Dollars 150,000 given to a foundation run by the Philippines
executive board member, Dr Alfredo Bengzon, was paid for by the Sasakawa
Health Trust Fund.
Even without the various threats or inducements allegedly made by the
Japanese government (charges which it strongly denies), many poor countries
see Japan as a more promising potential donor, bilaterally and through WHO,
than the US or Europe which have other preoccupations and more severe budget
constraints.
Dr Nakajima has made some attempt to defuse the row before the ballot. Last
week it was disclosed that Dr Kawaguchi would be shunted aside to handle
'inter-agency affairs'. Dr Nakajima plans to announce next week a more
radical reorganisation which will include creation of two new divisions for
nutrition and vaccines and effectively curb the powers of two Manila
buddies, Dr Edward Uhde, the budget and finance director, and Dr H S
Dhillan, director of health education, who were implicitly criticised by the
special audit.

FT  30 APR 93 / Liberation Army dons a business suit: The PLA's corporate
moves prompt western worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE early 1980s Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, sent shivers down
Hong Kong's collective spine with his comment that Beijing would station
units of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Hong Kong after 1997.
Four years away from Britain's handover of the colony to China, the PLA is
already in the colony and in force. However, the uniform it wears is the
business suit.
In the past week, China's military-industrial complex has taken majority
interests in two Hong Kong listed companies, raising concerns among military
analysts and Hong Kong government officials about the intentions of the PLA
in the colony.
Last Wednesday Mr Wang Jun, son of the late Wang Zhen, one of China's
leading 'long march' revolutionaries, was in town to tell investors and the
press of his plans for Continental Mariner, an investment company. Mr Wang
is Continental's chairman, a position he holds by virtue of his chairmanship
of China Poly Group Corporation, the controlling shareholder of a syndicate
which in turn controls Continental.
China Poly is the vehicle used by the equipment procurement department of
the PLA's general staff to sell Chinese-made arms abroad, and to acquire
technology useful to China's weapons development. The president of China
Poly and deputy chairman of Continental is Maj Gen He Ping, director of the
procurement department and a son-in-law of Mr Deng.
On Wednesday night this week, China Aerospace Industrial Corporation (CAIC),
China's manufacturer of military and civilian rockets, bought 51 per cent of
Conic Investment, which produces liquid crystal displays, televisions and
telecommunications equipment on the mainland. The interest was previously
owned by Bank of China and China Resources, two of the mainland's leading
corporate groups in Hong Kong.
Until March, CAIC was part of the aerospace ministry. At the National
People's Congress in March the ministry was dissolved and its aviation and
astronautics arms hived off into two separate corporations responsible to
the State Council, China's highest governmental body, or cabinet.
CAIC manufacturers China's 'Great Wall' rocket which is used to launch
commercial satellites. But according to military analysts in Hong Kong, CAIC
is also closely connected with the PLA's 2nd Artillery which controls
China's nuclear capability: it manufactures the delivery vehicle for China's
intercontinental ballistic nuclear missiles.
According to Stockholm's Peace Research Institute, China sold weapons with a
value of Dollars 7.8bn (Pounds 5.1bn) in the five years to the end of 1991.
Analysts in Hong Kong say that sales have fallen sharply since the Gulf War
of 1991 because of the poor performance of Chinese military hardware,
especially tanks, under Iraqi command.
As export revenues have come under pressure the PLA has had to look at more
creative ways of making money. Under China's foreign investment rules a Hong
Kong company, no matter what its ownership, is classed as a foreign
investor. It is able to go into partnership with its mainland parent and
receive large tax breaks in addition to operating outside the rigid rules
applied to Chinese state industries, including welfare subsidies and
permanent employment.
Both Continental and Conic said they would focus on business on the
mainland. Analysts also expect the parents of the two to inject mainland
assets into the two companies in due course, a transaction which would lead
to a flow of hard currency to the parent.
Although analysts see the reason for the acquisitions as primarily
financial, many believe there may be security issues involved as well.
Under rules devised by Cocom, the Paris-based organisation that vets the
west's sales of high technology, it is illegal to sell 'dual use'
technologies to China. However, last May the US lifted restrictions on such
exports to Hong Kong, with the exception of night vision technology, super
computers and cryptography equipment.
A Hong Kong government official, noting CAIC's purchase of Conic, said: 'We
hope their interest is purely financial. We won't let this (acquisition)
escape our attention.' As one military analyst pointed out, the PLA has
acquired, through perfectly legal means, Hong Kong registered entities. They
could act as conduits for technology transfer to the mainland.

FT  30 APR 93 / Beijing to rival Tokyo steel making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is likely to outstrip Japan in steel production by the end of the
decade and has the 'real potential' to become a major market for western
steel producers and iron ore miners, according to a study by a Sydney-based
consultancy, writes Andrew Baxter.
The report by AME Mineral Economics says Chinese steel production has
increased steadily since the early 1980s, reaching 78m tonnes of crude steel
last year.
But production is expected to grow rapidly over the current decade, to reach
between 100m and 120m tonnes per year by 2000. Planned capacity expansions
at existing steel mills already total some 16.8m tonnes and possible
greenfield developments might add a further 40m tonnes, says the report. If
these ambitious targets are met, China will be rivalling the steel
capacities of Japan and the US by the end of the decade.
The report notes that China's importance to world steel trade was emphasised
in 1992 by heavy Chinese buying in the second half of the year.
In spite of last year's 10 per cent increase in Chinese crude steel
production, even stronger domestic demand caused internal free market prices
to jump by up to 80 per cent, diverting production away from the export
sector.
With China's imminent entry into the Gatt, says the study, import duties
should fall, stimulating imports into the country.

FT  30 APR 93 / A ray of colour beams down on drab Albania: Europe's poorest
economy is emerging from the dark days of Stalinism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST factories are still closed, but the ubiquitous stalls selling
cigarettes, soap and Pepsi Cola, adding a splash of colour to Tirana's drab
streets, indicate that Albania's transition to a market economy is under
way.
With about 310,000 unemployed and another 200,000 Albanians working
illegally in Greece, people in Europe's poorest country have been forced to
make radical adjustments in the year since the election of a democratic
government ended a half-century of Stalinist self-sufficiency.
Out-of-work diplomats and engineers trade lek for dollars and drachmas in
the foreign exchange market, held in the street outside the central bank.
While banking reform is painfully slow, the lek has stabilised since the
government adopted a harsh reform package last August in return for an
Dollars 18m stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund.
Food prices have been liberalised, with the exception of bread. Rents were
raised sharply, while petrol for a burgeoning fleet of secondhand trucks and
battered cars is sold at international prices.
Nevertheless, the monthly inflation rate has fallen steadily after a 47 per
cent jump in response to price liberalisation last August, dropping to 6.8
per cent in January and just 0.9 per cent in March. The finance ministry
forecasts that year-on-year inflation will be held at 45 per cent in 1993.
'I think we've done better than other ex-communist countries in stabilising
the economy, even though we'd no experience at all of a free market,' says
Mr Genc Ruli, finance minister.
However, with real wages and unemployment benefits both showing a sharp
decline, remittances from Albanians working abroad, estimated at more than
Dollars 300m in the past year, have been crucial in cushioning the impact of
market reforms.
In addition, the Group of 24 wealthy nations provided another Ecu850m
(Pounds 671.5m) in aid in 1991-92, much of it contributed as emergency food
supplies following a disastrous fall in agricultural output, the result of
privatisation of collective farms.
Moreover, the government has had to postpone plans to earmark revenues from
selling food aid to domestic consumers as the Albanian contribution to
foreign-funded development projects.
Instead, much of this income went towards covering a budget deficit saddled
with huge losses at state enterprises, amounting to some 22 per cent of GDP
in 1992.
With farm production forecast to rise by at least 20 per cent this year,
food aid will be gradually phased out. Mr Ruli must now persuade donor
countries that Albania is firmly committed to structural reforms that would
justify international funding for infrastructure projects.
The government's medium-term reform plan, to be supported with another
Dollars 20m loan from the IMF, calls for reducing public spending by
speeding up privatisation, confined so far to selling off about 20,000
state-owned shops, and cutting public sector jobs.
However, plans for improving the foreign investment law to provide better
protection for investors and for permitting land to be sold rather than
leased to foreigners, meet with fierce political opposition. A new law that
provides for restitution of property to pre-communist period owners will
only add to the confusion.
Potential investors also appear discouraged by the slow pace of
decision-making on specific projects, and a rising level of corruption ,
which Mr Ruli dismisses as 'unavoidable when salaries are so low,'
equivalent to Dollars 30 a month for most civil servants.
Despite the advantages of an undeveloped coastline, cheap labour, and easy
access to European markets, Albania has so far managed to attract only
Dollars 20m in foreign investment and none at all in the tourist sector.

FT  30 APR 93 / Lessons of the currency turmoil: What can be learned from
Black Wednesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government officials and central bankers have emerged wiser, and
above all humbler, from a series of investigations into last autumn's
European currency crises.
Since September, sterling and the Italian lira have left the exchange rate
mechanism, while the Spanish, Portuguese and Irish currencies have been
devalued.
'We should have had the foresight to encapsulate all the five months of
realignments into one weekend.
'We must never let this happen again,' says Mr Wim Duisenberg, president of
the Netherlands central bank.
Despite the pressures on the peseta before Spain's June 6 election, the ERM
has now entered a calmer phase - thanks principally to France's success in
maintaining the franc's D-Mark parity.
Yet Europe is also now much more sober in assessing the chances of progress
towards the Maastricht goal of economic and monetary union.
'The events of September 1992 brought the ERM on to a more realistic basis,'
says a senior German central banker.
And Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's directorate member responsible for
economics, believes economic divergences within the EC have made it 'hardly
conceivable' that Emu could take place by 1997, the earliest date laid down
by the Maastricht treaty.
A landmark in the post mortem comes today when monetary experts from the G10
largest industrial countries hand to finance ministers in Washington a
report into the crisis.
The study group comprises a team from the Group of 10 countries (the US,
Japan, Canada and the larger EC members). The report concludes - as did two
separate but related inquiries already mounted by the EC - that no
significant ERM reforms are needed.
Underlining the general mood, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian
National Bank, says: 'We can stick with the existing rules.'
The report shows why central banks last autumn were unable to withstand
large currency shifts set off by investors' belief that ERM parities had
become un - realistic.
Huge amounts of worldwide savings are traded on the Dollars 880bn (Pounds
507bn) a day international foreign exchange market.
One central banker says an estimated Dollars 200bn to Dollars 300bn in
international investments last autumn were held in higher-yielding weaker
currencies which came under attack.
This led to 'gigantic shifts' as the likelihood of ERM devaluations grew, he
says.
The report's analysis of the volume of funds on the move provides one reason
for Bundesbank calls for curbs on obligatory ERM intervention to support
weak ERM currencies.
The report does not, however, go into detail into a series of additional
problems in running the ERM which contributed to last autumn's upsets.
Among the factors behind the exchange rate upheavals, the Bundesbank's high
interest rate policies have attracted a large portion of blame. One of the
more outspoken critics is Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Bank of Spain governor. He
says: 'What is unstable is not the system itself but the economic conditions
surrounding the system, as shown by the conjunction of high German interest
rates and recessionary conditions in much of Europe.'
In a bid to deflect such charges, the Bundesbank has been pointing towards
other ERM countries' failure to make timely ERM currency adjustments before
last September. Lack of realignments after January 1987, it says, led to
currency rates becoming out of line with realities - building up pressures
which overwhelmed the system.
The misunderstandings between ERM members in September 1992 have already
been well documented. What has not, however, come to the surface is that the
Bundesbank tried, in a series of confidential discussions in spring 1990, to
launch a broad ERM realignment - but received a general rebuff.
High level talks were held with the Bank of Italy as well as with the French
and Netherlands authorities. The Bundesbank again made informal soundings
about a realignment in 1991, although it never sought a formal application
through the German government, to change parities.
The Bundesbank's lack of persistence partly reflected the D-Mark's sporadic
weakness in 1990 and 1991. But it also highlighted the German authorities'
desire to avoid a confrontation with France, which opposed a franc
devaluation.
One Bank of Italy official comments that Germany acted as if it was still 'a
political dwarf.' He adds: 'If France says 'No' (to a realignment), there is
no way that the Germans are going to make their voice heard.'
In exploring the lessons of last September's unrest, some officials'
attention has turned to the abstruse subject of Article 109j in the
Maastricht treaty. As a precondition for membership of Emu, this lays down
that ERM members should keep their parities unchanged for two years before
irrevocable fixing of exchange rates.
The 'two-year rule' would not start to apply until 1995 - at the earliest
two years ahead of the earliest date for Emu of January 1997. But Italy, in
particular, blames the rule for creating an extra hurdle hindering countries
from making timely adjust ments.
Prof Luigi Spaventa, a former adviser to the Italian treasury, who was named
on Wednesday as budget minister in the new interim Rome government, says the
'no-realignment' rule is 'dangerous.'
Mr Cees Maas, former treasurer-general at the Netherlands finance ministry,
who played an important role in the negotiation of the Maastricht treaty,
says now that if he had to renegotiate the treaty, he would prefer not to
have the non-realignment rule.
Mr Maas, now a board member of the Dutch ING financial services group, says
he did not realise that the clause would lead to undue 'politicisation' of
the question of realignments.
Mr Maas' views are not shared by present Dutch finance ministry officials in
charge of international monetary affairs. But his point is nonetheless a
telling one. Unless the 'no realignment' rule is changed, Mr Maas says, the
ERM is again likely to enter a phase of excessive rigidity from 1995 onwards
 -and the mistakes of the last few years could be repeated.

BELGIUM will restrict televised sessions of EC ministers when it starts its
six-month presidency of the European Community on July 1, Mr Willie Claes,
foreign minister, said yesterday.
Mr Claes made clear that Belgium had no desire to emulate the Danish
presidency which has so far this year won reluctant agreement to allow
television cameras into eight ministerial debates.
At the Edinburgh summit in December, the Twelve decided unanimously that
important policy debates and new legislative proposals should be televised.
Mr Claes said Belgium would be sticking 'strictly' to the Edinburgh terms.
Mr Claes also unveiled the new Belgian logo for its Presidency - a tricolour
'B' inside a blue circle of 12 stars representing the 12 EC members. The
early launch raised eyebrows among Brussels diplomats, though they conceded
that the UK presidency was also fast off the mark last year.
Federalist-minded Belgian officials have scarcely hidden their frustration
with Danish and British delays in ratifying the Maastricht treaty and are
pressing for a return to orthodoxy. Mr Claes said yesterday he was
unconvinced that greater transparency through five-minute ministerial
sound-bites was the best formula for restoring EC credibility.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bettino Craxi, a former Italian prime minister, yesterday conducted a
lengthy self-defence of his role as ex-Socialist party chief during a
parliamentary debate over whether to waive hisimmunity to face corruption
charges.
The eventual vote to reject most of the requests by Milan magistrates to
waive Mr Craxi's immunity prompted a decision by the Party of the Democratic
Left, the former communists, to withdraw backing from the new government of
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
Mr Craxi, who has vigorously maintained his innocence, claimed there was a
plot to discredit him.
He is the first major political figure for whom magistrates have asked
parliament to waive immunity. The request was submitted on January 12,
subsequently forcing him to quit as party leader.
The requests yesterday concerned the least significant allegations of
corruption in Rome and for violating laws on the financing of political
parties. On the more serious allegations of corruption and receiving illicit
funds in his political base of Milan, a majority of the Chamber of Deputies
backed his immunity - effectively snubbing the main line of inquiry pursued
by the most industrious investigative magistrates in the Italian corruption
scandals.
He still faces the prospect of magistrates submitting further requests
relating to other allegations of corruption.

FT  30 APR 93 / French rates cut as franc strengthens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday took advantage of the latest easing in German
monetary policy by again cutting its two key interest rates.
The French authorities cut their intervention rate, which sets the effective
floor for money market rates, by 25 basis points to 8.25 per cent. They also
cut the 5-10 day lending rate, the effective rate floor ceiling, by the same
amount to 9.25 per cent.
The cut in French rates came in the wake of Wednesday's larger-than-expected
cut in the cost of lending short term funds to German commercial banks. The
Bundesbank cut its repo rate to 7.75 per cent from a previous 8.09 per cent.
Yesterday's easing in French monetary policy came amid signs of increasing
confidence in the French franc among foreign exchange and money market
dealers.
The currency yesterday strengthened in the wake of the rate cut, closing in
London at FFr3.369 against the D-Mark from a previous close of FFr3.374.
This was the first time the French currency had closed stronger than FFr3.37
to the D-Mark this year.
At the same time, French money market rates continued their recent fall.
Three-month French franc interest rates yesterday closed about 20 basis
points lower on the day at 7.90 per cent. This means that 3-month French
franc rates are now only 18 basis points above 3 month D-Marks.
The narrowness of that spread is seen by dealers as an important sign of the
French franc's intrinsic strength. At the height of the recent currency
crises, French franc rates have had as much as a 4 percentage point premium
over those of the D-Mark, reflecting fears that the franc might have to be
devalued in the exchange rate mechanism.
However, there is no sign so far that lower rates have bolstered confidence
among French business. The latest INSEE monthly survey published yesterday
showed that business confidence in France had deteriorated since the start
of the year, particularly in the motor and construction industries.
According to INSEE, the level of orders remains at an unusually low level
and most businessmen do not expect to increase output in the short term.
Hopes of recovery were damped by yesterday's announcement that unemployment
rose sharply by 1.4 per cent in March, taking the jobless total to a record
3.06m, or 10.7 per cent of the work-force.
Hugh Carnegy adds from Stockholm: In the wake of the Bundesbank rate cuts,
Sweden's central bank, yesterday cut its key marginal interest rate by 0.25
points to 9.25 per cent.

FT  30 APR 93 / Ciampi changes the rules of the game: Italy's 52nd post-war
government marks the switch to a new kind of politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S new prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, has proved age is no
barrier to innovation.
The 72-year-old former governor of the Bank of Italy has ventured on to
ground where no government has dared tread since 1947. He has persuaded
three members of Party of the Democratic Left, the heirs of the once-feared
Communist party, to enter the cabinet.
This puts a formal end to the cold war divisions that have conditioned
Italian politics for four decades. The era of Christian Democrat-controlled
coalition governments and a communist-dominated opposition is over and this,
the 52nd post-war government, is a transition towards a different political
environment determined by fresh electoral laws and new alliances.
Appropriately, one of the PDS cabinet members, Mr Luigi Berlinguer, the
science minister, is a cousin of Mr Enrico Berlinguer, the communist leader
who championed the idea of the historic compromise - a government of
Christian Democrats and communists.
The PDS has entered the cabinet only after months of agonised internal
debate. Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, has brought his party round by
pointing out that Mr Ciampi is a non-partisan figure heading a government of
limited duration, untainted by corruption and containing 11 first-time
ministers. The three members were chosen by Mr Ciampi not by the party.
Even with some PDS dissidence, the government's majority in parliament
should go well beyond the slim 16-seat margin of Mr Giuliano Amato's
four-party coalition. These parties remain represented in the cabinet but
now, in addition to the PDS, Mr Ciampi can count on the Republicans and the
Greens, who have the environment portfolio.
The government can probably rely on the support of Mr Mario Segni, the
leader of the referendum movement. Although he declined to join the
government, Mr Augusto Barbera, the PDS minister in the new portfolio of
parliamentary affairs, was a key figure in the referendum movement, which
last week triumphed with an overwhelming vote for electoral reform.
Five parties and groupings are absent from what is otherwise a government of
national unity, mixing politicians with technocrats. These are the populist
Lombard League, the neo-fascist MSI, the Radicals, the hardline communists,
Reconstructed Communism, and The Network (La Rete), the Sicily-based clean
government movement. Between them they account for just over 20 per cent of
the seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
Despite much talk of Mr Ciampi having established a precedent by choosing
his cabinet over the heads of the party bosses, the Christian Democrats had
a considerably say. Eight of the 24 are Christian Democrat politicians or
allied to the party, and they still hold the key interior ministry,
retaining the outgoing minister, Mr Nicola Mancino.
In contrast the Socialists, heavily bruised by corruption scandals, have a
diminished presence with only three members as ministers and one big
portfolio - defence, held by Mr Fabio Fabbri. Mr Amato, the outgoing
Socialist premier, declined to take the foreign affairs portfolio having
announced last month he wished to step out of the political spotlight. The
job has gone to Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the most distinguished economist in
the Christian Democrat camp and a forceful figure, much needed in a ministry
demoralised by scandal over the misuse of foreign aid funds and the
patronage politics of former Socialist minister Gianni de Michelis.
Besides balancing political sensibilities, Mr Ciampi's choice of ministers
reflects the two main priorities of his administration - electoral reform
and economic management. Electoral reform will be handled at the
parliamentary level by Mr Barbera, and at the legislative level by Mr
Leopoldo Elia, the former Christian Democrat head of the constitutional
court.
Economic management will enjoy the continuity of Mr Piero Barucci. He will
be joined at the budget ministry by Prof Lugi Spaventa, a fellow of All
Soul's Oxford who knows Mr Ciampi well and who since last year has been
chief adviser at the treasury. At the finance ministry, the fifth minister
in a year, is Mr Vincenzo Visco, the PDS shadow economy minister and a
fiscal expert trained at Berkeley and York University.
Their job will be to prepare immediately a mini-budget to balance the
L15,000bn (Pounds 6.3bn) overshoot in 1993 spending.
Another prong to economic policy will be to speed up privatisation, working
in tandem with Mr Ciampi's former Bank of Italy colleague, Mr Paolo Savona,
in the industry portfolio. Mr Savona, who has also been a director general
of Confindustria, the industrialists association, is a firm proponent of
privatisation.
Although one of the referendums approved the abolition of the ministry of
agriculture, Mr Alfredo Diana, the outgoing minister, has been retained.
This underlines the impossibility of abolishing the ministry without some
structural replacement.

FT  30 APR 93 / Morale suffers in the old east: The consensus is it has not
been a good week for east Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME east Germans might believe in the conspiracy view of history. Others
might put it down to a string of unfortunate coincidences. Either way, the
consensus is that this has not been a good week for eastern Germany.
First there was a fire - allegedly arson - at the central land registry at
Barby, near Magdeburg, in eastern Germany. This is usually the place where
anyone seeking restitution or compensation for property confiscated either
by the Nazis or the communists comes to identify what happened to their land
over the past 50 years.
In an old castle which has become a huge storeroom, shelves stretching for
some 15 km hold large, bound books. Little is on computer. The authorities
reckon that thousands of pre-war records were destroyed in the fire. The
point is that, despite priority given to investors over restitution, sorting
out who owns what before final investment decisions are made might well be
further delayed. Then there was the decision by the European Commission
against recommending public subsidies by the German government to modernise
Ekostahl, the largest steel producer in eastern Germany. Located near the
Polish border, Ekostahl, which in its heyday employed more than 11,000
people, sustains the town and environs of Eisenhuttenstadt, with a
population of 50,000.
The Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising eastern German industry
and which owns Ekostahl, has thrown its weight behind turning the plant into
a mini-mill: equipped with a highly-skilled work force of about 1,000,
producing over 1m tons of high-quality steel a year and capable of competing
with the best of west German steel manufacturers.
The problem is that a hot-rolling mill and, at a later stage, a mini-mill
providing steel to the Opel car plant in eastern Germany, would require
subsidies of well over DM1.1bn (Pounds 440m). The western German steel
federation has opposed the idea - not just because it would re-open the
question about over-capacity in Germany; but, as Treuhand officials admit,
the west Germans do not want competitive steel from eastern Germany.
To damp morale even further, IG Metall, (western) Germany's powerful
engineering union, obtained, what it believed was a resounding vote of
confidence by eastern German steel, and engineering workers to stage an
all-out strike in eastern Germany, beginning next week. The irony is that
workers at Ekostahl openly say they would prefer to work and not strike.
IG Metall wants to use the strike to force employers to rescind a contract,
signed in March 1991, between employers, the unions, and eastern German
managers. That contract would have equalised eastern and western German
wages by April 1994.
The employers pulled out of the contract, invoking a revision clause
allowing them to do so if economic conditions had changed radically for the
worse. IG Metall has persistently argued that the employers wanted to get
rid of the traditional system of collective wage bargaining.
Ambiguity towards a strike among eastern Germans was tapped by IG Metall,
whose message to the region's workers was blunt. 'Since the easterners are
going to be unemployed sooner or later, they might as well vote for a strike
in support of higher wages so that they can obtain higher unemployment
benefit,' one union official explained. IG Metall, which also wanted to
prove that it could reawaken 'working-class consciousness', suffocated by
the Nazis and the communists, and display its own power.
But if strikes do take place, and if investors pull out, IG Metall through
further job losses in eastern Germany will lose more members. In 1991, it
had more than 750,000 in the region. Today, it has less than 400,000.
Moreover, strikes would weaken further eastern Germany's attempts at
becoming competitive through low labour costs. It is precisely the
difficulty in making eastern industry competitive, and the persistent lack
of confidence, which links this week's incidents.
Employers' associations and unions admit that decisions over the east's wage
dispute are made at the 'centre', where they are based. 'The eastern German
states have no power whatsoever. In some ways, the wage dispute is about a
power struggle between Cologne and Frankfurt,' an official from
Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' association said.

FT  30 APR 93 / Milosevic turns on Bosnia allies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN diplomats this week had the unusual task of interpreting what
appeared to be the first public dispute between President Slobodan Milosevic
of Serbia and Serb leaders in Bosnia.
In a letter on Monday to the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament, Mr
Milosevic criticised their refusal to endorse the Vance-Owen peace plan. He
accused the Bosnian Serb leadership of making 10m citizens of Serbia and
Montenegro bear the burden of tighter United Nations sanctions.
The Bosnian Serbs had rejected the plan because it left Serbs in Bosnia
surrounded by the enemy.
'Milosevic's letter was part of a political move to get a signature on the
agreement,' says a western diplomat, who believes that the Serbian president
is prepared to turn on his allies to win the favour of the international
community.
Mr Milosevic's conversion may have stemmed in part from the fact that
Russian voters endorsed President Yeltsin's policies in a referendum on
Sunday. The outcome of the vote was a shock to Serbian leaders, who had
assumed that Mr Yeltsin would be defeated and that a more supportive
government would come to power in Moscow.
Mr Milosevic in the past has excelled at changing positions to suit the
crisis of the moment. In January 1992, he suddenly became a man of peace
after six months of war and destruction in Croatia. He engineered the
ousting of Serb leaders from the rebel state of Krajina, in Croatia, who
opposed the plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance, the international mediator.
He also played a conciliating role in Geneva at the beginning of this year
when he twisted the arm of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to
make him endorse the constitutional principles section of the Vance-Owen
peace plan.
Part of his tactics in the past included a vicious smear campaign against
the Krajina Serb leadership in the Serbian media. Such a campaign has so far
not materialised against Bosnian Serb leaders, but this week state-run
Television Serbia, which has spewed out anti-western propaganda for months,
toned down its coverage and came out in support of the Vance-Owen plan. It
even cast Lord Owen, previously vilified for saying that it might be
necessary to bomb Serb targets in Bosnia, in a favourable light and
presented him as fighting to defend Serbian interests.
In the first sign that Bosnian Serb deputies were ready to heed the most
powerful man in Serbia, yesterday their self-styled assembly agreed to meet
on May 5 to reconsider the Vance-Owen maps which would split Bosnia into 10
semi-autonomous regions divided on ethnic lines.
Diplomats believe the Serbian president will also succeed in persuading Mr
Karadzic to approve the Vance-Owen maps.
But the question remains whether any Serbian leader is prepared to implement
the plan. The proposal calls for Serb forces to give up between one third
and one-half of the territory they have conquered over the past year.
'If Serbia and Montenegro want to re-enter the family of nations, the
signatures must be followed up by implementation of the plan,' said the
diplomat. 'Bosnian Serb forces must be ready to stop the violence. They are
not responsible for all the killing, but they have the preponderance of
force,' he added.
But despite his readiness to exert pressure on Bosnian Serb leaders, Mr
Milosevic has so far not indicated that he is prepared to follow up on the
peace plan.

THE Czech and Slovak prime ministers will hold an emergency meeting today
following yesterday's unexpected cancellation of talks between finance
ministers aimed at settling financial issues emerging from the two
countries' recent division.
A spokesman for Mr Julius Toth, the Slovak finance minister, said
yesterday's talks were called off as neither side was ready for further
discussions.
But now Mr Vaclav Klaus and Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Czech and Slovak prime
ministers, will meet in an effort to defuse the increasingly bitter dispute
between the two countries over dividing the assets of the former
Czechoslovak state.
Mr Klaus yesterday called for the direct talks to resolve 'the current
crisis between the two republics.'
The dispute over who is owed what from the former Czechoslovak state has
escalated since the two countries went their separate ways on January 1.
Prague says it is owed CzK 24.7bn (Dollars 882m), a claim rejected by
Bratislava which has made its own claim for compensation.

FT  30 APR 93 / Norway's PM in warning on EC entry: David Gardner interviews
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland on the fishing demand Brussels may not grant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S determination to retain exclusive right to its rich fishery
resources could prevent it from joining the European Community, Mrs Gro
Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, warned yesterday. This
confirmed fears that Norway's application for membership will be the
toughest to negotiate in the current talks on enlarging the EC.
'On the issue of fish we are talking about a vital issue, something which
left Norway outside European co-operation in 1972 and could so so again,'
Mrs Brundtland said in an interview.
Norwegian voters rejected EC membership in 1972, when the UK, Denmark and
Ireland joined the Community. Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway are all
negotiating to join the EC. Polls this month show Norwegian opinion running
53 per cent against EC membership, with 36 per cent for and 11 per cent
undecided.
Mrs Brundtland's minority Labour government is plummeting in the polls ahead
of a general election in September which will be dominated by the EC
membership debate. The right-of-centre coalition she replaced in November
1990 was brought down by internal differences over Europe.
Mr Jan Henry Olsen, Norway's fisheries minister, said in a separate
interview that Norwegians 'have no fish to give away'. He said Oslo had
already given away too much through restricted fishing rights in Norwegian
waters conceded to EC countries when Norway joined the European Economic
Area (EEA), set up between the EC and European Free Trade Association
countries. Norway's Storting (parliament) was expected to ratify the EEA
treaty last night. 'If the EC asks for more quotas it could stop Norway
joining the Community,' Mr Olsen said bluntly. The 200-mile limit around
Norway's coast is 'our arable land', he added.
Mrs Brundtland supported Mr Olsen's hard line, saying: 'Norway was squeezed
sufficiently over the EEA treaty and you cannot repeat that. He is not alone
in his evaluation.'
The fisheries issue alone is certain to spark hostility from fishing nations
like Spain, which wants access to Norwegian waters in compensation for
unimpeded access for Norway's fish products in the EC single market.
But Norway's insistence on reserving half of all exploration rights to its
rich oil and gas reserves for its state oil company Statoil, is another
point of friction. Draft legislation being prepared by Brussels would outlaw
this preference as discriminatory. Oslo will insist the draft directive is
shelved until Norway enters the EC, senior officials say.
Unlike its fellow applicants which hoped to conclude entry negotiations this
year, hold referendums next year, and accede to the EC in 1995, Norway is
resigned to a long haul, probably extending well into next year.
Although Norway's hardline negotiating tactics have caused dismay in
Brussels and provoked the hostility of member states like Spain and the
Benelux countries, Mrs Brundtland feels it is better to get the difficulties
of Norwegian membership out in the open from the start. For the government
to have any chance of winning over the electorate requires 'clear answers
around the negotiating questions which have been raised,' she added.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE, the first European Community country to ratify the Schengen free
travel agreement, yesterday forecast that the conditions for lifting border
checks on travellers would not be met 'before the end of this year, or even
for quite a long period'.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's new EC affairs minister, told parliament
France would be 'intransigent' in maintaining police controls on its borders
with other signatories of the 1990 Schengen pact until a variety of
political and technical problems were solved. Such problems included, he
said, Germany's difficulty in ratifying Schengen until it changed its asylum
law, and Italy's 'inability to reinforce its external border controls' and
its recent referendum decision to de-penalise drugs, as the Dutch have done.
But France's tougher stance towards Schengen also reflects the new
centre-right government's intention to crack down on crime and illegal
immigration. An opinion poll released yesterday showed that four out of five
French people want illegal immigrants systematically expelled from the
country.
An adviser to Mr Charles Pasqua, the hardline interior minister, recently
claimed that while French tribunals regularly order the deportation of some
25,000 people each year, only about 10,000 actually leave the country.

FT  30 APR 93 / Yeltsin gives reform team power to act

RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday began to fulfil his long-delayed
pledge to reconstruct the Russian state and its economy.
Claiming victory in Sunday's referendum gave him - and no other - the moral
right to act in the peoples' name, he started the process of adopting a new
constitution and gave licence to his most radical ministers to initiate
financial stabilisation.
'These reforms now have popular protection,' he told a meeting of the
representatives of the 89 regions, cities and republics of the Russian
Federation - a line repeated by his ministers at a later cabinet meeting. Mr
Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister in charge of regional policy,
said after the cabinet met that 'the presidency is the first institution of
the new Russian state to be legitimised'.
Mr Yeltsin invited regional leaders to send two delegates each to what
amounts to a constituent assembly at the end of May or beginning of June to
adopt a constitution - the draft of which he presented to them at
yesterday's meeting. It proposes a presidential republic in which the
regions and autonomous republics enjoy wide independence and to which,
according to Mr Shakhrai, none of the leaders gathered in the Kremlin
offered any principled objection.
This method of bringing in a constitution to replace the old, amended,
Soviet era law bypasses the existing parliament which was warned yesterday
by the president to 'submit to the people's will or to confront the people
head on'.
In a sign that some of the anti-Yeltsin deputies have taken just such a
lesson, Mr Andrei Golovin, head of the centrist Smena (Change) faction said
yesterday: 'We are legislators and cannot ignore the obvious fact that the
people supported these reforms and expressed confidence in the parliament.'
This followed a statement on Wednesday from Mr Nikolai Travkin, a deputy and
leader of the Democratic party, to the effect that he would resign because
his electors had called for the re-election of parliament - and called for
others to do likewise.
The cabinet discussion of the first quarter's economic results was an
occasion for the reformist ministers - a besieged group before the
referendum - to reassert their authority. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy
premier in charge of finance, asserted he would not pay for any new social
programmes.
According to Mr Andrei Illiaronov - the former deputy head of the reformist
Centre for Economic Reform, just named as chief adviser to Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister - Mr Fyodorov clashed with Mr Victor
Gerashchenko the central bank chairman as the latter refused to accept that
the issue of credits caused the high monthly inflation rate, currently
between 15-20 per cent.
Mr Anders Aslund, the Swedish scholar who is one of the senior foreign
advisers to the government, said that, with these views so much at variance
with the government 'it would be very strange of (Mr Gerashchenko) were to
stay in such an important post'.
Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the Economic Reform Centre, confirmed that Mr
Georgy Khizha, the conservative deputy premier, would be sacked soon and
that there would be other changes in the cabinet to favour the reformists.

IG METALL, Germany's most powerful union, yesterday announced it would begin
indefinite strikes in selected enterprises throughout eastern Germany in
support of higher pay.
The strikes, which will involve over 28,400 workers at 50 steel and
engineering enterprises, will mark a watershed in eastern Germany's
turbulent history: it is the first time for more than 60 years that the
region's workers have officially called a strike.
The strikes, scheduled to start on Monday, will affect the steel industry
throughout eastern Germany, and the metal and electrical sectors in the
northern shipbuilding state of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, and the heavy
industry eastern state of Saxony. They are aimed at putting pressure on the
employers to uphold a contract signed between the employers, east German
managers, and IG Metall in March 1991. The contract was designed to equalise
eastern and western German wages from April of next year.
Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, and
Arbeitgeberverband, the steel employers' association, pulled out of the
contract for economic reasons. Officials said they could not pay wage
increases of over 20 per cent for both sectors because of the recession in
western and eastern Germany. Instead, they recommended pay increases of 9
per cent. Wages in eastern Germany are about 70 per cent of western German
levels. The cancelled pay increases would have brought them up to about 80
per cent of their western counterparts.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, IG Metall's president, said if the employers continued
to refuse to reinstate the contract, additional ballots would be held among
the metal and electrical sectors in the three remaining states of
Berlin-Brandenburg, Thuringia, and Saxony-Anhalt.
Employers are still hoping that talks today with IG Metall in the metal and
electrical sector in Thuringia might break the deadlock.
Meanwhile, in west Germany, the fate of the Krupp steel plant at
Duisburg-Rheinhausen was sealed when the supervisory board of Krupp Stahl
gave the go-ahead for the closure of the plant that will see some 2,100
workers lose their jobs.
At the same time, some 100,000 miners demonstrated in nearby Bochum for the
maintenance of state subsidies for the industry.
They heckled and whistled at Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, when
he promised state support for continuing coal production of at least 50m
tonnes for both steel and electricity generation.
There were indications yesterday, however, that the Klockner-Hutte
steelworks in Bremen, the main plant in the Klockner-Werke group, may be
reprieved with a substantial debt-relief package agreed with creditors.

FT  30 APR 93 / Guardian likely to take over Observer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the Observer, Britain's oldest Sunday newspaper, looked secure
last night after an agreement in principle to sell it to the Guardian.
Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, said it had received an
'acceptable' offer from the Guardian and Manchester Evening News for the
paper which was founded on December 4 1791.
The offer will be put to the Observer board on Tuesday. The board is likely
to accept the deal, believed to be worth around Pounds 25m. It will then be
put to Lonrho's board.
Newspaper Publishing, which publishes the rival Independent and its Sunday
stablemate, was informed that its attempts to buy the paper had failed.
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, chief executive, said that negotiations between
the two companies broke down on Wednesday.
Mr Donald Trelford said yesterday that he would continue as editor and chief
executive of the Observer until the transfer to new ownership had been
completed. Last night, Mr Jonathan Fenby, deputy editor of the Guardian, was
being tipped as a strong candidate to succeed him.
Mr Peter Preston, editor of the Guardian, said the paper would take over the
Observer fully at the end of August.
The deal represents a compromise between Lonrho's two joint chief
executives, Mr Dieter Bock, who was determined to sell the Observer, and Mr
Tiny Rowland, who has twice blocked attempts to sell it in the past year.
Lonrho's share price yesterday rose by 5 1/2 p to 93 1/2 p, reflecting the
fact that the group's biggest lossmaking asset is to be sold. Last year, the
Observer made a loss of Pounds 14.9m and was expected to lose at least
Pounds 9m this year.
The Guardian's business plan envisages that the Observer could break even in
the first year because of the savings involved in the operation. It is
expected to take on between 60 and 65 of the Observer's 80 journalists.
Asked whether it would be a seven-day operation, Mr Preston said: 'It will
have a more distinct voice than that.'
Mr Preston, quoted in today's Guardian, said: 'Our overriding aim is clear:
to help publish an editorially-independent and vibrant Observer.'
Mr Whittam Smith said: 'A false impression of the nature of discussions
between Newspaper Publishing and Lonrho has been allowed to develop
unchallenged.' He said his intention never was to close the Observer.

FT  30 APR 93 / US growth falls sharply as exports weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US ECONOMIC growth fell sharply in the first quarter to an annual rate of
1.8 per cent as consumer spending slowed and exports weakened, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the figures showed the economy was
growing, but at 'an unacceptably low rate'. He said the Clinton
administration would work with its trading partners - particularly Japan -
to expand exports.
The figures were worse than widely expected on Wall Street, which had
forecast growth at an annual rate of 2-2.5 per cent in the quarter. Share
prices declined modestly in early trading but late buying helped to lift
them back in to positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average
closing 11.62 higher at 3,425.12.
Most economists, however, continue to expect an acceleration of growth later
this year to an underlying rate of close to 3 per cent. The sluggish
expansion in the first quarter followed growth at an annual rate of 3.4 per
cent and 4.7 per cent respectively in the third and fourth quarters of last
year.
Referring to the Republicans' successful filibuster of the administration's
economic stimulus, Mr Brown said 'a modest and focused jobs package'
remained essential to shore up confidence and boost the growth of incomes
and employment.
The first-quarter figures showed across-the-board weakness compared with
late last year. In real terms, consumption grew at an annual rate of only
1.2 per cent against 5.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Fixed investment by
business grew at 5.6 per cent against 9.7 per cent. Exports contracted at an
annual rate of 7.1 per cent against growth of 8.9 per cent.
The figures also confirmed a standstill in the housing sector, despite the
lowest mortgage rates in 20 years. Residential investment grew at an annual
rate of only 0.2 per cent against 25.1 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Inflation figures also deteriorated, with a broad index rising at an annual
rate of 3.3 per cent in the first quarter against 2.3 per cent at the end of
last year.
Early data for April, however, are more encouraging, indicating that some of
the weakness reflected severe winter weather. Retail sales and vehicle sales
have risen in recent weeks; consumer confidence also rebounded this month,
although not to the levels of last December.
'We expect growth to bounce back to 3 per cent at an annual rate in the
second quarter,' said Mr Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at New York bank J. P.
Morgan. He noted several special factors that had pulled down first-quarter
growth, including an erratic fall in defence spending at an annual rate of
25 per cent.
The weak first quarter was probably also a reaction to unsustainably fast
growth in the fourth quarter. Over both quarters, growth averaged 3.3 per
cent at an annual rate, in line with last year's third quarter and close to
most estimates of the likely growth for this year as a whole.

FT  30 APR 93 / OFT may refer compact disc industry for inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK music industry was taken aback yesterday by hints that the Office of
Fair Trading may soon refer the compact disc industry to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The strong indications came from Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of
fair trading, during an ill-tempered House of Commons hearing into the high
price of compact discs.
Sir Bryan told the national heritage committee that he still had an open
mind on whether the UK music industry operated a complex monopoly on CDs. He
added, however: 'What I can say is there is enough information there to make
me concerned about the situation.'
Last July Sir Bryan announced that he was reopening the inquiry into CD
prices only three months after Sir Gordon Borrie, his predecessor, said
there were no grounds for an MMC inquiry.
Sir Bryan said yesterday that the lower price of CDs in the US had persuaded
him the issue needed to be examined again: 'One has to accept that sometimes
different directors-general, while applying the same policy, will reach
different conclusions.'
Matters that needed to be explored, he said, included restrictions on the CD
imports from the US and whether contracts between artists and music
companies created 'a limited monopoly situation'. Sir Bryan said he would
announce his decision in two to three weeks.
His evidence to the committee was preceded by sharp and occasionally raucous
exchanges between MPs and music company officials. Statements by Mr Gerald
Kaufman, the committee's Labour chairman, that the industry was engaged in a
'rip-off' were greeted with shouts of 'disgusting' by music executives in
the audience.
The attack on the industry was an all-party affair, with Conservative MPs Mr
Toby Jessel and Mr John Gorst adding their criticism of CD prices.
Mr Kaufman's previous elaborate courtesy wore thin as Mr Rupert Perry, UK
chief executive of EMI Records, and Mr Maurice Oberstein, executive
vice-president of PolyGram and chairman of the British Phonographic
Industry, said lower prices would jepordise investment in new talent and the
health of the UK music industry.
Mr Kaufman regaled his audience with accounts of his CD buying in both the
UK and the US. When Mr Oberstein, the New Yorker who has become the UK
industry's most senior and colourful figure, said: 'I don't think making
profits is a dirty word,' Mr Kaufman retorted: 'I spend a disproportionate
part of my parliamentary salary contributing to your profits.'
As the two repeatedly interrupted one another, Mr Kaufman said it would be
preferable if each spoke in turn rather than conducting a 'kind of duet'. Mr
Kaufman added they sounded 'rather like one of Sondheim's more complex
works'.
A music executive complained to a neighbour that addressing the committee
was like 'talking to nursery school children'.

FT  30 APR 93 / Buckingham Palace to open doors to paying visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKINGHAM Palace is to be opened to the public for the first time this
summer, prompted by royal glasnost and financial prudence. Fees paid by
visitors will help to pay for the restoration of Windsor Castle after the
fire last November.
The palace will open from the second week of August for about two months,
with an adult entrance fee of Pounds 8, Pounds 5.50 for people over 60 and
Pounds 4 for those under 17.
Over the next five years, the revenues, plus a new Pounds 3 entrance charge
for Windsor, will pay for 70 per cent of the estimated Pounds 30m to Pounds
40m repair bill for fire damage at Windsor, Mr Peter Brooke, national
heritage secretary, said yesterday. The rest will be paid by the state.
Visitors to Buckingham Palace will be able to see 17 state rooms, gardens
and the west elevation. They will not be allowed into the private quarters
of the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh or Prince Edward, or into working
offices.
The palace would not speculate on how many visitors it expected. Some 40,000
people already visit the palace each year by personal invitation of the
Queen. But if the final bill for the restoration of Windsor totals Pounds
40m, the equivalent of 3.5m adult visitors will be required to cover the
monarchy's 70 per cent share.
The public opening of the palace - first built in 1677 - will be a
short-lived affair. The gates will probably be closed again by the end of
1997, when the restoration of Windsor should be complete.
A palace spokesman said the entrance fees were arrived at after considering
charges at 'similar types of attraction'.
Two of the Queen's private residences - Buckingham Palace is owned by the
nation - are already open for limited periods of the year. Sandringham
charges Pounds 3 for adults, Pounds 2 for children; Balmoral is cheaper, at
Pounds 1.75 for adults and free for children.
The palace, however, is priced above competing London attractions, which
admittedly lack its exclusiveness.
Adults pay Pounds 7.40 at Madame Tussaud's waxwork museum (owned, like the
Financial Times, by Pearson), Pounds 6 for the London Dungeon, and Pounds
4.50 for the Natural History Museum.
But the White House is open year round at no charge, and imperial residences
in Japan, such as Kyoto Imperial Palace and three other imperial villas, are
open year round (except weekends and public holidays). They make no charge,
but visitors must carry their passports.
Around Europe several other official royal residences are already open. In
Madrid, the Palacio Real - about Pta600 (Pounds 3) - is open all year, as is
the Netherlands' Royal Palace in Amsterdam, and the small Palais du Prince -
about FFr50 (Pounds 6) - in Monaco.

FT  30 APR 93 / Radical plan for Lloyd's to attract fresh capital: Shake-up
aims to cut costs and offers glimmer of hope to Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday unveiled a radical plan to restructure the
insurance market, reduce costs and attract corporate capital for the first
time.
Lloyd's also confirmed that its losses for the 1990 year, which will be
reported in June, will amount to between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 2.8bn, a
record deficit. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said: 'In a competitive world we
have performed very poorly.'
The market's first 'business plan' offered a glimmer of hope for lossmaking
Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting - but no specific
proposals to end legal actions between Names and their agents.
Introducing a report highly critical of Lloyd's in the past, Mr Rowland
said: 'It contains measures which overturn some of our traditions but those
are traditions that no longer serve us well . . . Should membership and
market not unite behind this plan, then Lloyd's may have no future.'
The report calls for a 30 per cent cut in costs at the market over the next
two years, which will require the loss of 2,500 of the market's 12,000 jobs
by 1995.
The proposals were widely welcomed by market professionals and received more
muted support from Names' organisations.
'The plan is not a solution to the very serious problems at Lloyd's. But it
is a well thought out strategy. There is much work to be done . . . Time
will be needed,' said Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's
Members, which represents 9,000 Lloyd's Names. Mr Shaw is chairman of Tate &amp;
Lyle, the sweeteners group.
The proposals detail an ambitious and complex plan to isolate billions of
pounds in old asbestosis, pollution and other US liability claims from
policies written before 1985 which overhang the market.
'Ring fencing' past liabilities through a new reinsurance company is
designed to make the market more attractive for corporate capital, which
will be invited to participate in underwriting next year. 'New capital is
expressing serious interest in joining us,' Mr Rowland said.
The report says the market should aim to achieve a return on capital of 27
per cent for corporate capital and of 40 per cent for individual Names.
The plan will also usher in radical changes in management style. 'We're
bringing into Lloyd's simple practices of good management that have been
absent for too long,' said Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive. New
standards for competence and professionalism are to be introduced.
A moratorium on legal action against lossmaking Names unable to meet their
obligations, announced late last year, will be lifted at the end of this
month. But Lloyd's will not issue new writs on a blanket basis and will take
a commercial approach to its debtors, negotiating individual deals in some
cases.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names' Association Working
Party, which links groups of lossmaking Names, said: 'The plan is a welcome
step into turning Lloyd's into a well-regulated and managed business. We
welcome the admission that Lloyd's present problems are of its making.'
Mr Rowland said Lloyd's was prepared to contribute a 'modest' amount to
achieve a settlement and said negotiations would continue. Mr Gil
Strathalmond, chairman of RW Sturge members' agency, said: 'This is a very
pragmatic approach to the reality of the problems.'

FT  30 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook was clearly trying to contain scepticism about the company's trading
prospects with its profits warning. But the wholesale dumping of bad news
has done little to reassure the market - as yesterday's 22 per cent fall in
the share price demonstrates. While the sale of 9,500 trailers reduces the
fleet during the continental recession, the management has simultaneously
committed itself to a Pounds 378m order for 11,000 trailers over the next
five years. It will be vindicated if markets turn up in 1980s-style. If not,
Tiphook is avoiding pain today by buying more expensive pain tomorrow. With
its largest competitor TIP Europe being acquired by General Electric Capital
Corporation, it will face opposition from a company backed by a
deep-pocketed parent.
Tiphook has high operational and financial gearing, while its interest cover
is likely to fall to 1.6 times by the year end. Most of its banking
covenants become operable at a cover of 1.25 times, but there are a few set
at 1.5 times. The company can repay its more stringent borrowings from other
cash reserves if necessary, and is increasing the proportion of unsecured
loans in its debt portfolio. Yet gearing of over 300 per cent with such low
cover does increase the financial risks. Investors might be more reassured
if the mangement's sunny disposition had not proved over-optimistic in the
past. By the conventional yardsticks of multiple and yield, the shares are
cheap. With the market nervous about trading prospects, they are likely to
remain so.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Sweden to retain 25% of Celsius
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish government will retain a minority stake of 25 per cent in
Celsius Industries after this summer's privatisation of the country's
leading defence group.
A further 21 per cent of shares are to be taken up by four Swedish financial
institutions, while 43 per cent will be offered to domestic and foreign
investors, Celsius employees and the general public, according to the
government.
The remaining 11 per cent will be owned by Nobel Industries, which sold its
defence electronics activities to Celsius for SKr1.55bn (Dollars 209m) in
February. The shares have not been priced, but the group's value is
estimated at SKr3bn. The new structure ensures Celsius remains in Swedish
hands. There are no formal restrictions on foreign ownership but the state
retains the right to block hostile foreign bids.

It was daughters' day-out yesterday. Ms Foundation, a women's rights group

day'. So in the spirit of the times, Geoffrey Dennis, New York head of
research for London brokers James Capel, took 10-year-old Katie first as a
fellow-traveller on his commuter train and then to watch him at work.
The idea was to give the girls greater confidence in pursuing a career, but,
lest general ennui should be the result, many companies laid on
presentations for the 9-15 year-old schoolgirls: at IBM, a panel discussion;
at Newsweek, lessons in magazine production; and at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, a pizza futures trading session. Let's hope the dough was for
physical delivery.

FT  29 APR 93 / House of Fraser nears bank deal on restructuring: Fayeds'
debt plan cuts number of creditors and simplifies corporate structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE of Fraser Holdings, the stores group controlled by the Fayed brothers,
is close to agreement with its bank creditors on a financial restructuring
package which involves the renewal of some borrowing facilities for five
years and a reduction in the number of its bank creditors from around 20 to
seven.
One of the group's bankers said yesterday that they had also secured
agreement from the company, which owns Harrods department store, to a
simplification of its corporate structure. House of Fraser Holdings owns a
string of subsidiary companies. The group's bankers want some of these to be
merged, so that it is easier for bankers to assess the group's financial
performance.
Bankers have also asked the Fayeds to appoint independent non-executive
directors to the board of their UK holding company. However, they are unsure
whether the brothers will agree.
The group has been in talks with its banks for weeks about how to repay a
Pounds 190m term loan, due for repayment this year. A banker said yesterday
that all the bank creditors had given 'oral agreement' to a deal which has
three main elements:
Around Pounds 60m of the loan will be repaid with part of the Pounds 156m
proceeds of the group's sale of its 10.6 per cent holding in Sears, owner of
Selfridges.
A group of seven banks is renewing its part of the Pounds 190m loan and
providing an additional Pounds 40m for five years.
Around 13 banks, owed around Pounds 100m, are being repaid in full.
A banker said the group of seven core banks was in effect putting up the
Pounds 40m to buy out the loans provided by the other 13. All seven are
participating in this new loan.
The seven banks, which will continue to have an exposure to House of Fraser,
are Midland, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and National Westminster of
the UK, Deutsche and Dresdner of Germany, and Credit Suisse of Switzerland.
Those not renewing their lines are believed to include six Japanese banks,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Sumitomo, Industrial Bank of Japan and Tokai.
The original Pounds 190m facility was arranged in 1988 by Midland's merchant
banking arm, Samuel Montagu, and had a five-year maturity. House of Fraser's
complicated corporate structure is illustrated by the way in which these
funds were divided between two parts of the group.
The facility was available for use by two companies, House of Fraser plc and
House of Fraser Property Investment plc. The banks which are being bought
out had provided loans to House of Fraser plc alone. The other banks, those
that will remain as lenders, provided loans to both House of Fraser plc and
House of Fraser Property Investment.
Both are subsidiaries of House of Fraser Holdings plc, which is in turn
owned by Alfayed Investment and Trust SA, a company incorporated in
Liechtenstein. The registered and beneficial owners of the whole of the
issued share capital of the Liechtenstein company are Mr Mohamed al Fayed,
Mr Ali Fayed and Mr Salah Fayed.
House of Fraser plc owns the group's department stores and other retailing
interests, which include Harrods, Dickens &amp; Jones, Kurt Geiger, the shoe
retailer, and Turnbull &amp; Asser, the shirtmaker.
In the year to January 25 1992, House of Fraser plc, which has many
subsidiaries, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 26m, down from Pounds 41m in
the previous year.
Yet House of Fraser Property Investment incurred a Pounds 3.3m loss,
principally because of Pounds 21m in interest payments. It owns the group's
properties, which had a book value at the end of January 1992 of Pounds
338m. It has only one subsidiary, House of Fraser (Eleven), which had 'no
activity' in the year, according to the accounts.
A banker said the total bank debt of all the UK companies after the
restructuring would be around Pounds 500m - the bulk of it provided by the
seven core banks - down from a peak of Pounds 800m a year and a half ago.
Another banker said the group had never missed an interest payment. The
remaining debt comes up for repayment in tranches during 1994, 1995 and
1996.
Mr Michael Cole, a director of House of Fraser Holdings, said performance of
the stores in the year to January had been significantly better than last
time. He described the figures as 'bullish'. Bankers are hopeful that there
should not be a problem in repaying or refinancing future principal payments
in the coming three years.
A banker said: 'What is taking place is an orderly restructuring of House of
Fraser's debt. This is not a financial crisis.' The deadline for signing the
loan renewal is the end of the month. 'To all intents and purposes, the deal
is done', a banker said.
The Fayed brothers acquired House of Fraser for Pounds 615m in 1985. A 1991
Department of Trade report on the takeover said the Fayeds 'dishonestly
misrepresented their origins, their wealth, their business interests and
their resources'. The Fayeds are challenging the report at the European
Court of Human Rights.

BIC, the French consumer products company best-known for its ballpoint pens
and disposable razors, yesterday announced that its US subsidiary fell into
the red in the first quarter of this year with a loss of Dollars 700,000
against a Dollars 7.9m net profit a year ago.
The US company has been hit by the exceptional cost of adapting to the new
regulations on accounting for pension and medical insurance contributions
for its employees. This change, all of which was absorbed in the
first-quarter figures, cost the company Dollars 9.8m, thereby pulling it
into deficit during the first three months of the year.
Without the change in accounting regulations Bic's US subsidiary would have
been in the black during the first quarter. Its turnover rose by 15 per cent
to Dollars 101.2m in the first three months of 1993 from Dollars 88.1m in
1992. Net profits rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 9.1m from Dollars 7.9m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish government will retain a minority stake of 25 per cent in
Celsius Industries after this summer's privatisation of the country's
leading defence group.
A further 21 per cent of shares are to be taken up by four Swedish financial
institutions, while 43 per cent will be offered to domestic and foreign
investors, Celsius employees and the general public, according to the
government.
The remaining 11 per cent will be held by Nobel Industries, which sold its
defence electronics activities to Celsius for SKr1.55bn (Dollars 215m) in
February.
The shares have not been priced, but the group's value is estimated at
SKr3bn.
The new ownership structure ensures Celsius remains in Swedish hands. There
are no formal restrictions on foreign ownership, but the state retains the
right to block hostile foreign bids.
The government said Celsius would be able to take a more active part in the
broader restructuring of the European defence industry if it is was in
private hands and had access to external risk capital. It is was hoping a
number of new industrial owners would subscribe to the share offer.
Celsius shares are to be listed on the Stockholm stock exchange with effect
from June 23. The privatisation prospectus will be published on May 10, and
the offer period runs from May 17 to June 4.
The Celsius privatisationis part of the government's privatisation programme
embracing 35 state-owned groups.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COSTA RICAN police were poised yesterday to end a hostage crisis by force if
a kidnap gang refused to hand over 18 Supreme Court justices and five others
held for two days, a senior police chief said, Reuter reports from San Jose.
Dozens of Costa Rican police with M-16 assault rifles have sealed off access
to the Supreme Court, where four gunmen took the hostages after breaking in
through the basement on Monday.
The gang, which calls itself the Death Command, lowered its ransom demand on
Tuesday from Dollars 20m to Dollars 8m but said it would blow up the Supreme
Court building if its demands were not met. They have also demanded safe
passage to a South American country.
The Costa Rican government has been strongly criticised for its moderate
approach to resolving two recent hostage crises. Police sources said its
position had hardened since late on Tuesday, when it ruled out earlier fears
that Colombian drug traffickers were behind this week's kidnapping.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is to end its ban on female pilots being assigned to combat units,
defence officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, will issue the order this week, they
said, and will also ask Congress to drop a long-standing prohibition on
women serving in warships and tell the navy to study the issue.
Women in the US military are currently allowed to fly helicopters and
fighter jets, including training male combat pilots, but cannot serve in
combat units.
Mr Aspin's moves, expected today, are in keeping with President Bill
Clinton's campaign promise last year to drop barriers against expanded roles
for women in the army, navy, air force and marine corps.
But Mr Aspin is expected to move more carefully toward possible service of
women in army ground combat.
The navy's leadership has in the past year openly supported admitting female
pilots to combat roles, such as the hazardous job of flying jet fighters
from aircraft carriers.
Some senior air force officers, however, have spoken out against the move
despite tests that show women in some cases might be better fighter pilots
than men.

FT  29 APR 93 / Billionaire imposes capitalist rule: President of Volga
republic makes even Yeltsin seem timid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the line that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has perhaps always
dreamt of delivering.
With a dead-pan face Mr Kursan Khalmg-Tangch, the newly elected president of
the Russian republic of Kalmykia, yesterday announced that he had sacked the
government.
'We have offered them opportunities to become private farmers. They can do
some useful business then,' he told a stunned press conference in Moscow. He
calmly added that he would impose presidential rule, abolish most
ministries, outlaw the KGB, cut subsidies, slash taxes - and dole out
Dollars 100 (Pounds 65) to every citizen of the Kalmyk republic to let them
join in a programme of radical economic reform.
Tucked on the mouth of the Volga river, the Kalmyk republic, which is
blessed with oil, sheep and caviar, first shot to political fame earlier
this month when it elected Mr Khalmg-Tangch, a 30-year-old local businessman
and rouble billionaire
Running on a political platform that promised 'economic shock reforms' for
the republic, Mr Khalmg-Tangch announced that he was 'neither a communist
nor a democrat but a capitalist'.
In practice, this translates into a vision that takes as its inspiration the
rapid economic growth of South East Asia. Under the plans unveiled
yesterday, the president will assume direct control of all economic
enterprises. Local elected bodies will be abolished, political opposition
discouraged, and foreign investors given free rein to engage in virtually
tax-free business.
Meanwhile, mindful of his Kalmyk Buddhist Mongol heritage, Mr Khalmg-Tangch
will personally finance the construction of a Buddhist temple. He is also
inviting the Dalai Lama to take up residence. A specialist in Japanese
history, Mr Khalmg-Tangch has built a successful business career by
specialising in joint ventures with South Korean and Japanese partners.
With his own large financial resources and links with South East Asian
businesses, Mr Khalmg-Tangch says he is so confident that he can finance
reform that the republic will no longer accept subsidies from Moscow. But
whether the 350,000-strong population of Kalmykia will be able to tolerate
these radical changes remains more dubious.
It also remains to be seen whether the Russian parliament will return the
compliment and let Kalmykia's challenge pass unheeded. 'What Russia needs
now is a strong leader,' said Mr Khalmg-Tangch, yesterday. He added that
after lengthy talks with Mr Yeltsin, the Russian president had expressed an
interest in Kalmykia's programme as a 'mini-model' for Russia.

FT  29 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: MTM sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation that MTM would announce the denouement of its long-running
crisis proved well founded. The troubled chemicals group declared yesterday
that it was selling most of its assets to rival BTP.
Nevertheless, the shadow of Serious Fraud Office investigation still hangs
over MTM and the shares were off 2 1/2 after the news. They rallied to close
a penny down at 10 1/2 p on balance. On the other hand, the fire sale was
seen as a good deal for the buyer and BTP added 11 at 250p. Mr Martin Evans
of Hoare Govett called it: 'The best deal in the chemicals sector for
donkeys' years.'
Textile group Coats Viyella was steady in a nervous market as it featured as
the principal recommendation in an extensive sector review by Smith New
Court.
The house maintains its top of the range 1993 profits forecast of Pounds
147m. It argues that in spite of recent strong performance, the shares
should see further upside because of less serious losses than anticipated
from Brazil, recovery in the UK and US, and the benefits of the recent share
dividend option. Coats shares were 4 higher in early trading and closed a
net penny easier at 237p.
Food retailing was the worst performing sector in the market as a
combination of profit-taking and the well publicised worries over the
industry came to the fore.
Asda dipped 3 to 69 1/2 p, Argyll Group, over which a large line of stock
hung all day, fell 12 to 326p and J. Sainsbury declined 10 to 456p.
TSB was the second most heavily traded stock in the market amid continued
speculation that a substantial disposal could be imminent, and following
persistent talk of a takeover bid for the group.
The bid stories were largely dismissed by banking specialists, although
dealers pointed to the exceptionally heavy turnover in the stock. Some 16m
shares changed hands, the highest activity in a single day since the
preliminary figures were announced in January. At the close TSB shares were
2 easier at 185p.
TI Group was firmer in an overall weaker market, with sentiment buoyed after
several recent presentations by the company. The stock closed 6 up at 306p.
International news and information organisation Reuters Holdings was firmer
in early trading after the chairman said that at current exchange rates he
expected a double-digit revenue increase. However, the shares were unable to
hold out against the weaker market and closed 10 lower at 1256p.
Buying ahead of today's first-quarter results helped ICI shares to end the
session a net 13 higher at 1247p.
Leading pharmaceuticals shares continued their US-prompted rise yesterday,
although Glaxo suffered from competition worries in spite of some late good
news.
Glaxo shares were lifted 6 at best but reports that Merck, the world's
biggest pharmaceuticals group, is working on a new asthma drug and a
migraine treatment dented sentiment. Later news that the pill version of
Glaxo's Zofran treatment was now available in the US failed to help the
recovery as it merely confirmed an announcement made in the new year. The
shares closed 7 down at 587p.
However, Wellcome appreciated 12 to 735p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' ended
the day 7 1/2 higher at 468p.
Epwin Group, the replacement windows and doors manufacturer, raced up to
238p before settling a net 14 ahead at 225p, as the market continued to
rerate the shares. The company announced good figures two weeks ago and
spiced the results with news that turnover during the first quarter of the
current year was up around 10 per cent.
Jupiter Tyndall, the financial services group, held at 158p as Smith New
Court, the integrated securities house, placed a 24 per cent stake in the
company - some 8.3m shares - with a number of institutions at 156p.
The stake was sold by Mercury Asset Management, which inherited the shares
as a result of the merger of Jupiter and Tyndall in October 1991. Mercury
was prevented from selling the shares in a single block because of Bank of
England regulations. Jupiter Tyndall was among the market's most active
stocks, with turnover, boosted by double counting of the Mercury placing,
reaching 17m shares.
A bearish note on the power generators issued by Credit Lyonnais Laing, plus
a number of switch stories, notably from James Capel, who was said to have
told clients to shift from PowerGen to National Power, put substantial
pressure on the sector. The latter declined 6 to 327p on 4.1m traded and
PowerGen lost 9 to 335p on 1.7m.
Credit Lyonnais's utilities team said the prospect of two to three years of
fast dividend growth after a good outcome to the deal with British Coal had
pushed the shares up too sharply. 'The yield is now demanding in relation to
the market and the electricity stocks and we think the good news is now all
in the price,' said the CLL team.
Textile spinner Shiloh rose 9 to 103p on higher full year profits and an
improved dividend.
Share buying by directors was said to be behind a 10 per cent rise for
Hopkinsons, the industrial valve and hydraulic equipment maker, which was 4
ahead at 44p.

FT  29 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: UB doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong rumours that United Biscuits had lost its bid for Royal Brands, the
Spanish food group put up for sale by the state-owned Tabaclera, weakened
the shares, already suffering from the fading bid talk.
Nabisco was the company said to have been successful in its bid. The US
group had already lodged an offer, said to be in the region of Pta17bn, for
a 50 per cent stake in January. While this was being considered by the
Spanish authorities, a consortium led by United Biscuits also tabled an
offer. A counter-offer from Nabisco was then made and talk in the London
market yesterday suggested it had been successful.
UB wanted Royal Brands' biscuit division, which represented around 40 per
cent of sales, and which would have cost the company in the region of Pounds
70m. Its unnamed European partners would have taken the other parts of the
business.
A UB spokesman said the company had also heard the story but had no
confirmation. One analyst suggested that a UB failure would not be seen too
negatively in the market, given the increase in gearing and the worrying
state of the Spanish economy. UB shares weakened 7 to 411p.

FT  29 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms sector weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO companies representing the UK's telecoms duopoly, BT and Cable and
Wireless, sharply underperformed the market. They suffered from increasing
worries of competition in the UK and overseas from AT&amp;T, the biggest of the
US telecoms groups. Earlier this month, AT&amp;T applied for a UK telecoms
operator licence.
BT was additionally weakened by news that Mr Barry Romeril, its highly
regarded finance director, is leaving the company to join Xerox Corporation
in the US so close to the sell-off of the government's remaining 21.8 per
cent stake in BT. The share sale is expected in July.
Telecoms analysts were largely unmoved by the AT&amp;T move. 'It is merely part
of the ritual mud-slinging which should continue until AT&amp;T gets reciprocal
access,' said an analyst, who nevertheless expressed surprise and
disappointment at Mr Romeril's departure. 'He always had a high profile in
the City and is seen as largely responsible for the cost-cutting that has
transformed BT,' he added.
BT shares dropped 9 1/2 , or 2.3 per cent, to 406 1/2 p on turnover of 15m,
the highest for more than three months. Cable and Wireless, whose Mercury
telecoms division is thought to be especially vulnerable to the threat of
increased US competition, fell 18 to 684p.

FT  29 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed futures pressure hits shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPTIMISTS in the UK stock market were undone yesterday by heavy selling
of the stock index futures by US brokers. Futures selling quickly spilled
over into underlying equities and the setback took the FT-SE 100 Index down
by 35.4 points to below the 2,800 mark for its lowest closing level since
the end of January. This was all the more of a shock for a trading session
which opened with a gain of 11 points on the Footsie following a sharp fall
in the German repurchase rate and a further modest decline in sterling.
Optimism ahead of the Pounds 3bn auction of UK government bonds also proved
overdone, and equities were discouraged by a downward reversal in bond
prices after the auction result appeared on trading screens across the City
of London.
Early firmness in equities soon melted away in the face of at least three
determined sellers of the Footsie future. Inevitably, London was alarmed
that the US futures sales might imply renewed activity by George Soros, the
commodity and currency expert whose Dollars 400m investment in a US gold
mining group upset equities in London at the end of last week.
Equity dealers claimed to have identified several large US sellers of the
Footsie futures, including Paul Tudor Jones, Cargill and Goldman Sachs, but
if this was so, the list was quickly joined by most of the big London firms.
At the close the FT-SE 100 was 35.4 down at 2,797.3, having been at 2,787.1
at the day's lowest point. Dealers were distinctly alarmed by the fall in
the Footsie which, some feared, could leave it vulnerable all the way down
to the 2,700 area.
Oil exploration shares, encouraged by rights issue news from Total
Petroleum, provided one of the few firm exceptions. Pharmaceutical stocks
lost early gains.
London's fall well outpaced the setback in other European markets but Seaq
volume of 699.1m shares, against Tuesday's 596.5m, did not suggest massive
selling in the equity market.
The pressure from the stock index futures market saw the June contract on
the Footsie trade at a discount for much of the session. This caused
repeated sell-offs in the Footsie's 100 stocks, which distorted the overall
performance of the market. Business in the non-Footsie shares fell away to
around 58 per cent of the day's Seaq total, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed
only 12.6 to 3,121.7.
By the end of the session, traders sounded very unsure of the near-term
outlook for the stock market. Fresh pressure from the US would undoubtedly
bring further losses in London, but strategists remained hopeful that, with
the Footsie at the lower end of a perceived trading range, some recovery
could not be far away.
They pointed to technical positions in the futures market which had spilled
over into equities yesterday, leaving the big marketmaking houses facing
significant losses as well as difficult trading positions.
Uncertainty over the prospects for a sustained economic recovery in the UK
were revived by severe criticism from British business leaders of government
policies. Delegates to the convention of the Institute of Directors heard
calls for a fundamental rethink of UK economic strategy.

FT  29 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILD rumours and technical position-taking combined to ensure an exciting
day in the futures with one of the busiest sessions of late, writes
Christopher Price.
Trading started quietly enough with the June contract opening slightly
firmer at 2,844 and being bought up gently to 2,850 in the first half-hour
of trading. Then, in a mid-morning lull, a very heavy bout of selling began.
This dominated the day's trading in the cash market and sent June sharply
lower.
The instigator of the selling, which was spread across the whole market, was
rumoured to be Mr George Soros, the US trader who controls the influential
Quantum Fund. It was said that the billionaire dealer was selling futures to
pay for his large part-purchase of a gold manufacturer. Other rumours
abounded and with them a variety of other names.
Also, many traders have continued bearish on the short-term outlook for the
FT-SE 100, believing the recovery story to be overdone and the market to
have run ahead of itself. Whatever the reasons, June continued its slide to
reach its low of 2,776 shortly before 2pm. At this time, June was running at
a 15-point discount to the cash market.
A modest rally took June forward to close at 2,792, a slight discount to its
fair value premium of around 6. Volume was a hefty 19,529 lots. Options
trade was also active.

FT  29 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Resignation at Kodak puts
pressure on Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets ended flat to firmer yesterday, although blue chip issues
failed to sustain early gains because of a sharp fall in Eastman Kodak
shares, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.43 at 3,413.50, but
well above the day's low of 3,395.40. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 finished 0.01 up at 438.02, while the Nasdaq composite gained
5.64 at 658.16. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 268m shares.
The markets opened in an uncertain mood, with sentiment boosted by Tuesday's
gains (the first in six trading days) but undermined by further increases in
bond yields, which have climbed to 6.9 per cent barely a week after falling
to 6.7 per cent.
In spite of higher bond rates, equity prices opened firmer, thanks partly to
improved earnings from Ford Motor and a strong showing from oil shares. The
early gains, however, were something of an illusion because trading had not
yet opened in Eastman Kodak shares due to an order imbalance on the sell
side.
When Kodak finally opened, the Dow quickly dropped along with Kodak shares,
which were hit by the news that Mr Christopher Steffen, the company's chief
financial officer and the man investors had hoped would lead a revival in
Kodak's fortunes, had suddenly resigned over differences with other senior
managers.
By the close, Kodak had recovered a little but was still down Dollars 4 7/8
at Dollars 47 1/2 following volume of 11.6m shares. The news of Mr Steffen's
resignation completely overshadowed the announcement of Kodak's
first-quarter earnings, which came in at 46 cents a share of net income, up
slightly from the year-ago figure.
Ford advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54 1/4 in volume of 2.7m shares after
the car maker reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 1.02 a share,
well up from the 36 cents a share earned a year ago and well ahead of
analysts' expectations. The news from Ford lifted the rest of the motor
sector, with General Motors adding Dollars 2 at Dollars 42 3/8 and Chrysler
Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 41.
Some leading oil issues were in demand following positive comments on
Chevron from Wall Street analysts. Chevron rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 85,
Texaco Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 and Mobil Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69
1/8 .
Nasdaq stocks were led higher by the technology sector, where Intel firmed
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 94 1/2 and Microsoft added Dollars 3 1/2 at Dollars
86.
Canada
TORONTO ended higher after further active trading, boosted by a surge in
gold shares. The TSE 300 index was up 19 points at 3,710.2 and rises
outscored declines by 360 to 318. Volume amounted to 60.4m shares.
The golds index rose 3.27 per cent as the New York spot bullion price firmed
USDollars 2.10 an ounce. Consumer products gained 1.07 per cent.

FT  29 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Total falls by 1.6% on capital
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's cut in the repo rate, followed by the Netherlands, Belgium
and Norway, had minimal effect on yesterday's activity on the Continent,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was busy digesting the elements of Total's FFr4bn reserved capital
increase and while the shares fell to a day's low of FFr262 in early
trading, they recovered a little, closing down FFr4.20 or 1.6 per cent at
FFr265.10. The CAC-40 index gained 15.10 to 1,942.51 in turnover of some
FFr2.7bn.
Mr Michael Drozd, oil analyst at UBS in London, commented that Total's
announcement appeared 'quite clever' in that it did not bring new equity
onto the market and was unlikely to be earnings dilutive in 1993. However,
he added, it remained to be seen if the capital increase, under which
Lyonnaise-Dumez, SocGen and Cogema, the nuclear fuels group, will jointly
own 7 per cent of Total, will be enough to compensate for the cash drain
arising from its development projects.
Lyonnaise-Dumez rose FFr3.70 to FFr455.80 and SocGen improved FFr5 to
FFr617. Elf also benefited, up FFr5.20 at FFr379.20.
Accor fell FFr18 or 2.8 per cent to FFr646 after an analysts meeting at
which it said that it was unable to make an earnings forecast for 1993;
while Euro Disney, off FFr4.35 or 5.7 per cent at FFr71.65, continued to be
effected by Tuesday's earnings news.
FRANKFURT fell for the seventh straight session as the market continued to
be dominated by futures trading. One analyst noted that the repo rate cut
had had no impact on activity since it had been anticipated. The mood had
turned negative over the last week or so, he said, after the DAX index had
failed to break through and hold the 1,700 level. The index closed 11.91
lower at 1,628.87.
Bayer went against the trend on better than expected first quarter results,
closing up DM2.10 at DM271.40, while Basf, due to report today, edged 90 pfg
ahead at DM235.30 but Hoechst, which has already released its figures, lost
DM8.60 to DM232.90. 1
MILAN played a waiting game, anxious for details of prime minister designate
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's new cabinet, but many shares picked up as the day
progressed from lows seen after an early round of profit-taking.
The Comit index eased 3.32 to 543.93, although analysts noted a continuing
firm undertone to the market. Turnover was estimated at below Tuesday's
record L656bn.
Fiat again saw profit-taking, falling L160 to fix at L6,875 before edging
back up to L6,930 after-hours.
Other blue chips showing a recovery in late business included Mediobanca,
the merchant bank, which settled down L60 at L15,590, but then rebounded to
L15,850 on the kerb. Against the trend, Benetton showed gains throughout the
session, firming L264 to settle at L18,354 and then rising to L18,409
after-hours.
ZURICH put in a firmer performance after the weaker trend seen earlier in
the week but trading remained slow. The SMI index added 13.6 to 2,138.3.
Ascom bearers continued under pressure, giving up another SFr115 or 8.3 per

FT  29 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Spirits industry hopes for more of a
future sparkle - Long-term trends in the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International spirits companies have lost their investor appeal in the past
year as profits growth has slowed in the worldwide recession.
In London, shares in Guinness, Grand Metropolitan and Allied-Lyons lag
behind the FT-Actuaries All-Share index; in Toronto, Seagram barely keeps
pace with the market; in Paris, LVMH trails the field while Remy Cointreau
and Pernod-Ricard run marginally ahead.
Short-term performance is likely to remain pedestrian compared with the
sprightly progress of the late 1980s. Market conditions continue to be
difficult in Japan, and are deteriorating in continental Europe. Recovery in
the UK is still fragile, and in the US it is threatened by increases in
federal excise tax.
Though the international spirits companies have shown some stout resistance
to recession - GrandMet's IDV increased trading profits by 12 per cent last
year, and Guinness's United Distillers achieved organic growth of 6 per cent
 -investors cannot expect significant market outperformance before 1994.
The difficulties of the past year have led some observers to question
whether the industry can regain any of its past sparkle. There is little
prospect of further market growth, they argue. The profitable process of
building brand portfolios and global distribution networks is nearing its
end. Increased prices and profit margins will be more difficult to achieve
as worldwide inflation rates fall.
A rudimentary analysis of the market should be enough to dispel such gloom
about the industry's long-term prospects. 'The real bull case for
international spirits stems from the fact that their share of the overall
world market is just 7 per cent,' says Mr John Spicer, analyst at SG
Warburg, the London securities house.
There is clearly considerable scope for international brands to increase
their share of markets dominated by local, unbranded products. The process
is well under way in the Far East - Thailand, in which United Distillers
sold virtually nothing 10 years ago, is now among its top 10 profit centres
 -and in central and south America.
Further ahead, eastern Europe promises substantial opportunities; and beyond
lie the as yet protected markets of India and China where a thirst for
scotch whisky and cognac waits to be assuaged.
Mr Colin Davies, analyst at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, believes
that continued brand concentration will also lead to further profits growth
for the leading companies, even in mature markets.
'There is still an opportunity to take over smaller brands and distributors
and so leverage up profitability by lower cost production and distribution,
improved marketing and increased sales,' he says.
On this longer term view, the industry's top four companies - GrandMet,
Guinness, Allied-Lyons and Seagram - offer good fundamental value at present
levels. They command the biggest brand portfolios, the widest distribution
networks, and the resources to build on those strengths.
GrandMet will be the first of the UK-based companies to benefit from
sterling devaluation and recovery in the US, and its IDV spirits operations
are expected to increase profits by 16 per cent this year.
Devaluation benefits will come later for Guinness and Allied-Lyons. With
conditions in some key markets remaining difficult, Guinness's spirits
trading profits are unlikely to be more than 3 per cent ahead this year -
but growth should begin to accelerate in 1994. It may take longer for its
French ally, LVMH, to recover. The decline in Japanese demand for cognac may
continue. There are risks of the slowdown spreading to the south-east Asia
duty-free market and of pressure on prices.
Allied-Lyons' links with Suntory may enable it to buck the trend in Japan
but only a modest increase in profits is expected this year from its spirits
business. Longer term prospects look sound: the partnership with Pedro
Domecq could be as successful in central America as it has been in Spain.
Seagram, now tightly focused on core brands, is positioned to share in
growth markets in south-east Asia and south America. It has also been
investing for the more distant future in eastern Europe and China. The
fortunes of Pernod-Ricard and Bols-Wessanen are largely tied to Europe, but
Remy has the brands and distribution network to play a larger role on the
global stage.

FT  29 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong returns to
record-breaking ways
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXTENDED buying prompted by a depreciation of the yen against the dollar
lifted the Nikkei average, but light profit-taking before today's national
holiday left equity prices off their intraday peaks, writes Wayne Aponte in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 247.86, or 1.2 per cent, higher at 20,454.57,
after a day's best of 20,716.39 and low of 20,268.65. The Topix index of all
first section stocks added 20.08 at 1,592,76, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index gained 5.88 at 1,266.08.
Volume was estimated at 800m shares, compared with Tuesday's 608m. Advances
led declines by 861 to 195, with 117 issues unchanged.
Brokers said investors continued their buying spree in response to the yen's
sharp decline against the dollar following intervention by the US Federal
Reserve in overnight trading; and after remarks by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
Treasury secretary, about possible plans among G7 nations to stabilise the
international exchange rate markets. The yen ended at Y111.88 to the dollar
in Tokyo trading.
Market participants also reacted favourably to the official index of leading
economic indicators for February, released on Tuesday afternoon and
indicating a possible bottoming out of the economy.
Mr Yuichi Matsushita, senior market strategist at Nikko Securities, expects
the Nikkei to trade above the 22,000 level in May, as institutional
investors shift some assets from short-term money market instruments to
equities.
He added that confirmation of a new bottom in the stock market and the
economy are necessary before a sustained Nikkei advance will happen.
Consumer electronic issues moved higher, Sony appreciating Y90 to Y4,990,
Pioneer Electronic Y90 to Y2,540 and TDK Y50 to Y3,940.
Investors continued to target brokerage concerns, Daiwa rising Y90 to
Y1,370, Nomura Y80 to Y2,190 and Nikko Y50 to Y1,090.
Companies that have recently announced restructuring plans moved ahead, with
Japan Airlines advancing Y80 to Y830 and Alps Electric Y80 to Y1,120.
Profit-taking, however, pressured Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which
retreated Y13,000 to Y960,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 361.09 stronger at 22,284.23 in volume of
32m shares.
Roundup
THERE WERE strong performances from both Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur among
the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG returned to its record-breaking ways as the market demonstrated
its satisfaction with the latest round of Sino-British talks and on hopes
that the proposed airport project would be discussed.
The Hang Seng index climbed 58.02 to an all-time closing high of 6,894.90,
having topped the 6,900 mark earlier in the day. Turnover totalled HKDollars
4.88bn, against HKDollars 5.36bn on Tuesday.
Cathay Pacific moved forward 30 cents to HKDollars 11 on strong demand from
foreign institutions, while properties, which have lagged behind the market,
also gained ground. Cheung Kong put on 40 cents at HKDollars 26.30 and Sun
Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 36.75.
KUALA LUMPUR saw good gains in some index stocks, which left the composite
index up 2.86 at a record 695.43. But the broader market was mixed as
further speculative buying alternated with bouts of profit-taking.
NEW ZEALAND made headway in high turnover of forestry sector stocks and the
NZSE-40 index rose 18.91 to 1,622.58 in a strong business of NZDollars 43m.
Fletcher Challenge added 8 cents at NZDollars 2.85 and Carter Holt Harvey
firmed 5 cents to NZDollars 3.10.
TAIWAN finished mostly firmer although trade was sluggish. The weighted
index moved ahead 20.96 to 4,527.07 in thin turnover of TDollars 25.86bn.
MANILA made progress after a weak start as bullish investors stepped up
buying of blue chips. The composite index gained 15.28 at 1,564.67.
SEOUL picked up after four consecutive sessions of declines and the
composite index rose 5.45 to 728.41. JAKARTA edged ahead in moderate trade
and the official index firmed 0.92 points to 312.19.
AUSTRALIA recouped most of an early loss during a day of lacklustre trading.
The All Ordinaries index was finally just 1.2 easier at 1,703.5. Turnover
was boosted by large trading in Poseidon Gold September 1994 options, which
fell 10 cents to ADollars 1.45 with 24.4m options changing hands.
SINGAPORE was subjected to profit-taking as investors turned cautious, the
Straits Times Industrial index slipping 6.71 to 1,779.92 after Tuesday's
record close.
BANGKOK fell across a broad front for the third day as investors continued
to worry about an investigation of alleged share manipulation. The SET index
closed 13.13 weaker at 856.85.

FT  29 APR 93 / Money Markets: Large repo rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a strong rise in D-Mark and French franc futures yesterday after
the Bundesbank reduced its repo rate by more than the market had expected,
writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank cut the repo rate - which sets the cost of lending
short-dated funds to commercial banks - from 8.09 per cent to 7.75 per cent.
Some dealers were impressed that the repo rate cut was greater than last
week's 25 basis points lowering of the discount rate to 7.25 per cent.
The repo reduction forced the June contract up to a high of 92.80 from a
previous 92.70. The September contract was up on even heavier volume, from a
previous close of 93.55 to a high of 93.65.
However, the contracts later fell back as the German bund market declined on
fears that easier monetary policy would lead to higher inflation.
A dealer recalled that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, had
said that the central bank would look at the long end of the market when
planning its rate-cutting strategy.
The June contract receded to finish at 92.74 and the September contract at
93.60. German call money closed rather firmer, at around 7.72 per cent,
following a net drain of funds in the Bundesbank's weekly operation.
The repo cut had a more lasting impact on the French franc market, raising
speculation of another easing in France's officially posted interest rates
today.
One-month French francs dropped from about 9.25 per cent to below 8.00 per
cent. Three-month French francs were about 100 basis points lower at one
stage, falling to about 7.80 per cent. The June French franc contract surged
to a close of 92.23 from a previous 91.98.
Sterling futures rose in tandem with Euromarks, with the June contract
peaking 7 basis points higher at 93.97. However, it slipped back to end more
or less unchanged on the day as sterling lost ground against the D-Mark on
the foreign exchanges.
Three-month money closed little changed at 6 1/16 per cent, having been as
low as 6 per cent at one stage. The one-year rate finished slightly higher
at 6 1/4 per cent.
The small shortage of Pounds 600m was partly the cause of the easier cash
situation, pushing the overnight lending rate down to 2 per cent at around
lunchtime.

FT  29 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar unmoved by repo cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK remained comparatively strong against the dollar and European
currencies yesterday in spite of a larger than expected cut in one of the
Bundesbank's key interest rates, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank surprised many dealers by reducing its repo rate - the rate
at which it lends short-term money to commercial banks - from 8.09 per cent
to 7.75 per cent. Market expectations had been for a cut to about 7.90 per
cent.
The size of the easing underlined recent comments from Bundesbank officials
that inflation is no longer as big a problem as had been perceived, and that
the central bank is trying to test how far it can ease monetary policy.
Mr Gerald Holtham, chief economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said the
cut in the repo rate had brought the cost of money market funds in line with
the new discount rate level. He believes there will be speculation of
another easing in the Bundesbank's rate floor before its next council
meeting in a week's time.
However, the repo rate cut failed to give the dollar much relief after its
recent fall against the D-Mark. After closing at DM1.5847 at the end of
trading in New York on Tuesday, the US currency peaked at DM1.5930 in
Europe. But it later fell back to end at DM1.5860. In New York yesterday it
finished at DM1.5799.
The dollar's performance seems rather lame, considering that it has been
supported in the last two days by a generous cut in German rates and by
Federal Reserve intervention to support the US currency against the yen.
The dollar closed stronger against the yen in London at Y112.5, up from
Y111.2, and in New York ended at Y112.1. But there are signs the currency
remains hampered by uncertainty over US growth prospects and the direction
of President Clinton's administration.
Mr Mark Austin, an economist at Midland Global Markets in London, believes
that a worse than expected figure for first-quarter GDP in the US today
might also provide a setback for the dollar.
Most European currencies were stronger against the D-Mark in the European
morning but later fell back. Sterling again broke the DM2.50 level, but
subsequently declined to close unchanged at DM2.4925.
At least one dealer said the Bank of England was in the market, selling the
pound in order to replenish its foreign reserves.
The French franc was firmer amid speculation that the Bundesbank cut had
made an easing in French official rates more likely. The franc ended
fractionally up at FFr3.374 to the D-Mark.
The one currency to strengthen markedly in the last two days has been the
Spanish peseta, helped by more Bank of Spain intervention. The peseta closed
at Pta73.07 per D-Mark from a previous Pta73.68. It also moved up from
bottom place in the exchange rate mechanism's grid to third from bottom.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (9): Crossroads to everywhere -
Mannheim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANS usually describe their extensive motorways and railways with a touch
of national pride.
In Mannheim, they praise them as the key to the city's success, writes
ARIANE GENILLARD.
Every day 140 inter-city expresses go through its main railway station; it
is 40 minutes from Frankfurt airport, and the trains go on to Munich,
Stuttgart or Nuremberg. And, say local officials, its rents are 30 per cent
cheaper than in Frankfurt.
The local economic development office wants to promote Mannheim as an
attractive location for foreign and domestic businessmen. It hopes that it
will soon rival Frankfurt as a leading business and financial centre.
Located where three Lander meet, Mannheim is the second largest city in
Baden-Wurttemberg.
It has 300,000 inhabitants and there are another 1.5m people in the
surrounding conurbations.
It is traditionally an industrial area but now it is trying to develop
services. In the early 1970s, two-third of its workers were employed by
industry.
Today, industry employs only a third and the others are in services, mostly
banking and insurances.
The city, located on the confluence of the Rhine and the Neckar, has also
become an attractive location for freight business, with nearly 200
transport companies based there. The city also enjoys direct rail services
to Strasbourg, Luxembourg and Switzerland.
Officials hope that the expansion of the services sector, in which 10,000
jobs were created last year, will partially offset the city's 7 per cent
unemployment rate which compares with the average rate in the country.
One of the new arrivals is Quick Controls, a British company selling
computer technology in banking. Mr Ron Jones, chief executive of the UK
parent company, says: 'We chose Mannheim because our operational costs were
significantly cheaper than in Frankfurt. We decided to run our distribution
from Germany rather than England and finally chose Mannheim because it is so
close to Frankfurt.'
On the city outskirts, a huge business centre is under construction. Its
rectilinear lay-out, with lettered and numbered streets crossing each other,
is reminiscent of Manhattan.
Whether the resemblance will grow, remains to be seen.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (8): Civic pride that survived
the devastation of war - Stuttgart and Karlsruhe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BADEN-WUERTTEMBERG did not come into existence until 1952, created by the
merger of three smaller states occupied after the war by French and US
forces, writes DAVID WALLER.
The state's three largest cities - Stuttgart, Mannheim and Karlsruhe - all
have the distinction of once having been state capitals (of Wurttemberg, the
Palatinate and Baden respectively.) The three towns were bombed heavily
during the war, with the result that little of the historical city-centres
remain. But regional pride - and regional rivalries - are still sharply
defined.
STUTTGART, state capital of Baden-Wurttemberg, is at the heart of what the
locals call Swabia, a region which is more than just the geographical area
of Wurttemberg in the eastern part of the state - or indeed of the ancient
Duchy of Swabia. It also describes a state of mind - one which has helped
Baden-Wurttemberg develop into the prosperous region that it is today.
The Swabians are the Scots of Germany - invariably Protestant, they are
frugal, work hard and like accumulating capital. Gifted engineers and
mechanics, 'they believe that if they should do something they should do it
right,' says Mr Manfred Rommel, Mayor of Stuttgart.
He says that it is no accident that Hegel, the inventor of dialectical
philosophy, was born in the city: 'Swabians have their heads filled with all
sorts of incompatible ideas which they struggle to reconcile with one
another.'
Passionately independent, they also love red-tape which creates a race of
what Rommel calls 'frustrated bureaucrats'.
Today's Swabians may still combine a job in one of the Mercedes factories
with a little vineyard in the hills surrounding Stuttgart. When they have
tired of work they can take advantage of the city's rich cultural life:
Stuttgart's theatres, concert-halls and especially its world-famous ballet
under Marcia Haydee and Richard Cragun are booked out for months in advance.
KARLSRUHE, the former capital of Baden, was founded only in 1715 when a
certain Margrave Charles of Baden-Durlach built a palace there to escape his
wife and entertain his mistresses.
It still retains a relaxed atmosphere, which owes as much to its historical
origins as to its proximity to the French border. After the war it was made
home to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, but this has not dispelled
resentment toward the state government in Stuttgart.
Karlsruhe likes to see itself as Baden-Wurttemberg's technological centre.
It benefited from the activist investment policies promoted by Mr Lothar
Spath, Baden-Wurttemberg's prime minister until January last year, which
helped to endow it with a wealth of scientific bodies.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (7): Family factories are the
economy's backbone - The central role of the 'Mittelstand'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NESTLING in a wooded valley near Karlsruhe is the main production plant of
Jung Gmbh, a family-owned manufacturer of metal components used primarily by
the German car industry.
The company, founded in 1880, is a classic example of the 'Mittelstand'
business on which the economic success not just of Baden-Wurttemberg but
also of western Germany as a whole is founded.
Employing fewer than 300 people, the company has been through several
revolutions in the 113 years of its existence, and is on the verge of yet
another transformation amid a serious downturn in the car industry where its
main customers are to be found.
It started life as a manufacturer of champagne producing machines. In the
1920s it underwent its first major transformation and was turned into a
manufacturer of thread-cutting calipers and wash presses.
After the war it began producing parts - components used not only by the car
industry but by the building machine, hydraulics, machine-tool, aircraft,
power-plant and other industries.
This - subject to technological modifications to bring the company up to
'world-class' standards in terms of computer-aided manufacturing and
just-in-time deliveries - has been the mainstay of the business until the
present day.
Turnover last year was DM60m. Like much of German industry, Jung thrived on
the boom induced by reunification of the country - and like many much larger
companies it failed to see the signs of impending downturn.
Confidently expecting turnover to climb to DM90m this year, Jung was
planning to double its manufacturing capacity at its main site at
Neuenbuburg. Sheer luck meant that the downturn last autumn arrived before
it started to build the factory. The project was shelved and according to
Ludwig Andra, head of information technology at the factory, turnover is
likely to stay at DM60m again this year.
The company stands on the verge of another major strategic change of
direction. For some years 40 per cent of sales have gone to just one car
manufacturer - and this manufacturer is pressing all its components
suppliers for major cost reduction.
In order to reduce its vulnerability to the cost squeeze, Jung has decided
that in future it will specialise in the assembly of sophisticated products
rather than the simple production of components. For example, it has moved
beyond drilling and milling the case in which a gear box is housed to
producing the entire gear box.
At the same time, Jung has started to pay much more careful attention to its
own costs - something that Andra concedes was never a priority during more
prosperous times.
Jung's experiences reflect a pattern repeated, in one way or another, at
thousands of other companies across Baden-Wurttemberg.
Although Baden-Wurttemberg is known as home to Daimler-Benz, Germany's
largest industrial company, and many other large industrial groups, the
backbone of the local economy is formed by small businesses.
Nearly 60 per cent of all companies in the Land employ fewer than 200 people
and 99.8 per cent employ fewer than 500. Small to medium-sized companies
account for half the state's economic output.
There are around 14,000 small manufacturing companies, and many of these,
like Jung, are exposed to a double burden. They are suffering the brunt of a
domestic and international recession at the same time as facing major
structural change.
Those industrial sectors which face the biggest problems - car component
manufacturers, machine tools - are also those with the biggest concentration
of Mittelstand companies.
Economics suggest many smaller companies will be forced to abandon their
cherished independence as the price of survival under present conditions.
There have already been a large number of mergers and unprecedented
cooperation agreements in, for example, the machine-tool sector suggesting
that this process is already well underway.
Dire prognostications of crisis in the Mittelstand ignore some of the
advantages enjoyed by Germany's medium-sized businesses.
While many of Germany's larger companies have lost touch with their
entrepreneurial roots and acquired a bureaucratic culture, the Mittelstand
is highly entrepreneurial and imaginative. Notwithstanding developments in
the world economy over which managers have no control, the smaller companies
have the flexibility to adapt to changed circumstances - as Jung is hoping
to do with its move towards higher value-added components assembly.
Another point is that many of Baden-Wurttemberg's smaller companies occupy
unusual market niches which leave them relatively immune to the downturn in
so many industrial sectors.
The business owned by Hans-Peter Stihl and his family is a classic example
of this. The Andreas Stihl group, based at Waiblingen near Stuttgart, is one
of the world's leading manufacturers of chain- and other forms of
motor-powered saws. The business, founded in 1926 and with nearly 5,500
employees worldwide, has a 30 per cent share of the world market in such
saws. Turnover last year was DM1.2bn.
Mr Stihl, who is head of the pan-German chamber of commerce (IHK), says that
the biggest problem facing Mittelstand companies in Baden-Wurttemberg, as
elsewhere in Germany, is the level of costs, particularly wage-costs. He
voices the familiar complaint that wages climbed at a far higher rate than
productivity in recent years.
While Stihl's earnings are under pressure because of wage costs, the impact
is mitigated because a considerable proportion of the group's manufacturing
is done outside Germany. 'We had the foresight to set up manufacturing plant
abroad as long ago as 1976,' says Stihl. Some 2,500 of the group's employees
work outside Germany.
Stihl's company has grown beyond the scope of the typical Schwabisch small
family business. He is confident that the bulk of smaller Baden-Wurttemberg
businesses 'are able to make the necessary adjustment' to present
conditions, mainly by lopping costs. He believes that the Mittelstand will
emerge on the other side of recession and structural change leaner and
fitter than it was before.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (4): Plenty of scientists but
no monkeys - Public spending on research and development is the most
generous in Germany. Ariane Genillard visits one of the state's 36 science
parks
</HEADLINE>

THE NEW GLASS buildings glitter in the snow on Monkey Hill. 'It's the
historical name. There are no monkeys here, just scientists,' explains Mr
Johannes Stolz, the director of the Ulm Science Park.
Opened 18 months ago, it is the largest of the 36 science parks in
Baden-Wurttemberg, which collectively give the state the the highest ratio
of scientists per head in Europe.
With 75 patent applications per 100,000 inhabitants, Baden-Wurttemberg also
prides itself on producing more innovations than any other state in Germany.
Public funding for research is generous: in 1992, the state spent 3.5 per
cent of its gdp on research and development, compared with 2.8 per cent
nationally.
The local tradition for inventiveness even has its own name - Tuftlertum -
an untranslatable word meaning roughly a dogged determination to solve any
technical problem. In 1900, near Lake Constance, Count Zeppelin made the
airship that took his name.
The region's technological eminence flourishes in a carefully planned
research environment which fosters interaction between research conducted in
the public sector and the needs of private industry.
An institutional web now links centres of higher education, research
laboratories and state-funded institutes with the important local car and
chemical industries.
Like other large enterprises in Germany, the leading companies in
Baden-Wurttemberg all have extensive research facilities.
The state also houses Germany's most famous research centres, the Max Planck
Institute and the Fraunhofer Society.
There are also numerous small and medium-sized enterprises, often
family-owned, which excel in precision engineering, machine-tools and
electronics.
Under the aegis of Mr Lothar Spath, prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg in
the 1980s, a research sector was developed to meet the needs of these
enterprises.
Today, officials hope that the links between research and industry will
continue to foster innovation, and fend off the challenge from other
countries, particularly Japan.
Those links emerged amid a public debate on the role of scientific research.
It had become apparent that research needed to be brought closer to
industrial applications if enterprises were to compete more effectively in
global markets.
'What the Japanese were doing made everybody think. The question became how
to make scientists work on concrete projects and not on Byzantine text
interpretation,' explains Mr Oliver Gunther, from FAW, a foundation in Ulm
science park geared to finding commercial applications for research
projects.
Public funding moved from large research projects to more basic research
which could benefit small and medium-sized enterprises. Priority was given
to areas of perceived German weakness, where tangible commercial benefits
could be gained, such as information technology, laser and materials
research, and the growing field of so-called preventive technologies,
including medical and environment research.
Institutions such as the Steinbeis foundation in charge of technology
transfer and the Baden Wurttemberg Agency for International Co-operation
became increasingly important in promoting dialogue between the small and
medium-sized enterprises and research facilities.
The Steinbeis foundation, created in 1971, operates 158 regional branches,
mostly in centres of higher education, which offer consultancy services
technology and management to small and medium-sized businesses.
Originally financed by the state, 95 per cent of its DM80m budget is now
covered by fees from its industrial clients - embodying the mixture of
public and private money common in Baden-Wurttemberg's research activities.
Today, officials continue to believe that technological transfer is the
recipe for the survival and long-term prosperity of the state's small and
medium-sized enterprises.
Mr Dieter Spori, state economics minister, sees technological investment as
the best weapon against international competition.
'We must concentrate on specific technologies, such as microsystems, laser
technology and environmental research, and on gearing research towards
commercial application,' he said recently.
But for Mr Johann Lohn, chairman of the Steinbeis Foundation and state
commissioner for technology transfer, the problem is multifold.
'We have to devise additional strategies to keep our industry competitive,'
he explains.
'One of them is focusing on the technological servicing of existing products
rather than on innovations.'
Mr Lohn says enterprises are increasingly have to integrate old and new
technologies - a new challenge for the Swabian Tuftlertum. They will also
have to cope with an expected fall in public funding of research projects as
the country continues to pay the heavy cost of cost of German reunification.
Researchers in Germany's publicly-funded universities are therefore more
reliant on more private finance. 'The percentage of research which is
sponsored by the private sector in the US and Japan is much greater than
here.
'We must put out the message that non-governmental means are needed to
finance research in public institutions,' explains Mr Wolfgang Pechhold,
rector of Ulm university. 'We realise that this will only be achieved if
universities conduct projects which can be used by industry,' he adds.
Opposite the university stands the three year old research centre of
Daimler-Benz, the car maker which has diverted a substantial proportion of
its research activities to the science park.
Scientists from the university and Daimler-Benz are currently working on six
projects together.
'Our survival will depends on how well we apply our motto: innovation
against recession,' says Mr Pechhold.

slowly - Ulm

<TEXT>
STANDING on the main square of Ulm, Mr Ivo Gonner, the mayor, points to the
medieval clock on the town hall with its revolving statuettes and 12
mechanical dials, writes ARIANE GENILLARD.
'This is the most complex clock ever made in medieval Europe,' he boasts,
unwittingly echoing the claims one also hears in old Prague about a
venerable timepiece in the Czech capital.
Ulm is a small medieval town on the Danube 100 km south of Stuttgart.
Besides the clock, it also claims the highest church spire in Europe. And on
the hill, it has built the largest modern science park in Baden-Wurttemberg.
Like Baden-Wurttemberg as a whole, it offers a spicy blend of history and
technological progress.
It is the birth place of Albert Einstein, (though, as a victim of Hitler's
racism he spent most of his life far from his native land).
Now the city is wallowing in the recession felt in most of Germany. It once
housed subsidiaries of large industrial companies such as Volkswagen, AEG
and Iveco. But job cuts and relocations have caused unemployment, now
standing at 6 per cent and rising.
Admittedly, Ulm earns money from tourists, attracted to its ancient twisting
streets.
But Mr Gonner, a former lawyer who became mayor two years ago, worries about
the future.
He hopes that the new science park on the edge of the town will generate new
jobs. 'But it is a little like a fantasy,' he admits.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (6): Scenery soaked in history
in the shadow of the Alps - Tourist facilities are on the increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RUDOLF Forcher, mayor of Waldsee, likes to quiz his visitors about the
origin of his medieval town's name. Most think it stands for 'the lake near
the forest', the literal translation of Waldsee.
Historically minded visitors link it with Valdes, reputed founder of a 12th
century heretical movement who was in these parts before settling in the
Swiss canton of Vaud.
Mr Forcher has a more startling explanation - that the name actually derives
from the monks of Wales who travelled throughout Europe in the Dark Ages,
including Baden-Wurttemberg from where they passed on to Switzerland.
'Those who guess it get burned at the stake because we believe they know too
much,' the mayor jokes, referring to the witchcraft trials for which the
place is famous.
Behind him, large iron hooks are anchored in the solid walls of the medieval
town house. Standing up to look on a stone column where dates are inscribed,
Mr Forcher proudly points to 1530, the year 55 witches were enchained there,
interrogated and burned.
'Don't worry, we like tourists here,' he says smiling. 'We like diversity,'
he adds, grabbing a catalogue listing the various pedigrees of local
livestock. 'You see, our best ruminants come from Swiss cows and American
bulls.'
Mr Forcher can go on hours telling historical anecdotes and praising the
beauty of his region.
Together with other local personalities, he is a walking brochure listing
all the tourist attractions Baden-Wurttemberg can offer.
With 11m visitors and 38m accommodation bookings per year, Baden-Wurttemberg
rivals Bavaria as the most popular tourist area in Germany.
One of the best-known areas is the Black Forest with its romantic valleys
and narrow gorges. Lake Constance, with its panoramic views of the Swiss
Alps, is another perpetual favourite. Other attractions include numerous
spas such as Baden-Baden.
Baden-Wurttemberg offers, together with Bavaria, some of the best baroque
architecture in Germany. From a distance, the onion roof of Steinhausen
church could belong to an Austrian or Bohemian landscape. (The Austrians
controlled the area until Napoleon's conquest in 1806.)
Tourism, which earns some DM15bn a year for 200,000 businesses, rivals
agriculture as an important source of revenue, accounting for 4-5 per cent
of the state's gdp.
Unlike manufacturing, tourism has not yet been hit by the recession. The
number of tourists rose by 3.9 per cent in 1991.
But while most tourists are German, more foreigners are also arriving.
Between 1985 and 1989, foreign tourists increased by 12.5 per cent and
tourists from other EC countries rose by 20 per cent. The average stay is
four days.
To maintain this rising trend, Mr Dieter Spori, economics minister, is
anxious Spoto to improve facilities for youngsters and for the elderly.
Because of the recession, fewer Germans can afford the luxury of a fortnight
in the mud baths of the area's spas.
But, with Germans enjoying the longest vacations in Europe, it will remain
popular as a place for a second holiday. It offers Germans many of the
attractions of neighbouring French Alsace and German Switzerland but without
the anti-German sentiments evident in some of those areas.
'I finally put my finger on it and devised my moto,' says Mr Ulrich Ehrhardt
who oversees tourism around Lake Constance: 'If you want a holiday from your
last holiday, Baden-Wurttemberg is the place.'

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (3): Heavyweight feels the pain
of recession - The problems of Germany's leading industrial company / The
importance of being Daimler-Ben
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF the company's own forecasts are realised, Daimler-Benz this year will
generate around DM1bn profit - almost exactly the same as it did a decade
ago when it was a simple automotive company, with sales of DM44bn. Now it is
a 'technology group', turning over almost DM100bn.
Since 1984 the pride of Baden-Wurttemberg has ballooned into Germany's
biggest industrial company. As well as Mercedes-Benz it has grown to embrace
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the AEG electrical and electronic engineering
business and Debis, a software and financial services business.
From a peak of DM1.9bn in the boom year of 1991, net earnings fell 25 per
cent last year and are sliding towards DM1bn in 1993. The faithful milch cow
Mercedes, which usually accounts for two-thirds of group profits, will this
year produce around 85 per cent of the total.
The failure of Daimler's management to generate consistent and worthwhile
profit gains from its expensive and showy expansion programme has brought it
under persistent and increasingly critical fire from media and city critics.
Chairman Edzard Reuter, who has borne the brunt of most of the criticism,
bristles visibly every time the subject comes up. 'We never said the
importance of the automotive business would decline in the context of the
group before the end of the century,' he says.
And he rattles off the special circumstances which have come to haunt
Daimler - and much of the rest of German industry - since the easy days of
the 1980s. Global recession, monetary upheavals and the economic disorder
following the dismantling of the Iron Curtain and the Soviet empire were not
allowed for in Daimler's grand strategy.
'I must confess that we did not foresee the collapse of communism,' he says,
with more than a tinge of irony. The end of the cold war severely buckled
one of Daimler's new legs, the defence business of Deutsche Aerospace. This
year alone, German government spending cuts will cost Dasa around DM1bn in
lost sales.
'If the defence cuts had not happened Deutsche Aerospace (which lost DM340m
on DM17bn sales last year) would be highly profitable by now,' Reuter
claims.
Even so, he is convinced he has built up a potential-packed aircraft and
space technology business. 'Just look back at the state of aerospace in
Germany when we started ..it was fragmented, non-existent as a force in
world markets. We have reorganised it and it is now respected worldwide,' he
says. Dasa includes Dornier, the MTU engines business, Germany's European
Airbus stake and now Fokker of the Netherlands.
Putting on a brave face, Reuter points out that military work accounts for
only around 8 per cent of Daimler's group business. But defence spending
cuts have not just affected Dasa's sales and profits, the marked reduction
in government and corporate involvement in military research has blunted the
leading-edge of the group's technological and materials R&amp;D crucial to civil
aerospace activities and important to other group activities in vehicles and
engineering.
Meanwhile, AEG, which encompasses washing machines, automation technology
and railways, continues to stumble. After a DM624m loss in 1991, it squeezed
a DM10m profit out of DM11bn sales last year, and is now on the way back
into the red, according to chairman Georg Stockl.
Edzard Reuter is prepared now to concede that AEG may have waited too long
before last year's decision to cast out the prime loss-maker, the historic
Olympia office equipment subsidiary which was simply smothered by
competition from the far east.
Originally a typewriter manufacturer, Olympia is a classic case of a
traditional German company which failed to make the grade in high-tech
global markets. As such it is seen by Daimler's bitterest critics as a model
for the whole group.
Daimler based its entire diversification strategy on the need to break out
of the relatively narrow and crowded confines of the automotive business.
Now it has fallen to the car makers at Mercedes to show the way ahead for
the rest of the business and at the same time generate the cash needed to
support structural change elsewhere.
Driven out of its ivory tower by keen competition, the company has
undertaken an extraordinary reversal of its most ingrained traditions. Gone
is the notion that Mercedes keeps strictly to the market for sedate,
heavyweight executive saloons. Gone too is the idea that the company's cars
can only be manufactured in Germany. A family-style van is to be built in
Barcelona; a 'fun car' will be made in the US, and a pocket-sized city
vehicle will follow, also likely to be built outside Germany.
The engineering elite, who once dominated the business, have been integrated
as members of countless management, design and manufacturing teams. Price,
once discussed as an afterthought after the engineers had dictated the form
and content of each model, is now the starting point of all development
plans.
Product prices are established according to what the market will bear, what
the competition is offering in a comparable market sector, and what the
company can accept as a reasonable profit. Then project teams are required
to deliver components, processes - and finished vehicle - according to fixed
targets.
This programme has led to the greater use of bought-in parts, while speedier
and therefore cheaper production methods have reduced the time taken to
build a car from 45 man-hours to 35. So far, the Japanese competition's cost
advantages have been cut from 35 per cent to 15 per cent, production
executives claim.
The first fruits of this revolutionary change of attitude and methods will
be yielded this summer when Mercedes launches a replacement for its 10
year-old compact 190 series.
To judge by outward appearances the new C-class is a classic, traditional
Mercedes car. But the bodywork conceals radical differences. The company
claims the new vehicle is packed with 20 per cent more customer value than
the old model, while the price will be basically unchanged.
At the bottom-line, lean production on this scale means ever-leaner
payrolls. Although the effects of recession have blurred the picture, many
of the cost-savings made to improve the company's competitiveness have been
made at the expense of the workforce. Almost 15,000 of the 18,000 group jobs
which went last year were lost at Mercedes. The automotive business will
cast off at least another 7,000 this year, while other divisions shed 8,000.
Meanwhile, most new jobs, which in the past would have been filled by German
workers, are being created overseas. Those involved in the manufacture of
Mercedes' planned new models will benefit Spain and the US in the first
instance.
The company is also discussing assembly in Mexico, South Korea and the
Philippines, and is in the early planning stages of a projected car assembly
factory in India.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (2): Coalition against racists
 -Democrats rally to reassure immigrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRUISING election campaign in Baden-Wurttemberg last April had two
unforeseen consequences.
First, the far right captured 11 per cent of the vote, enough to send 15
representatives to the state parliament in Stuttgart.
Second, for the first time in 20 years, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
 -the party of federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl - lost its absolute majority
in the state .
As a result the CDU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) had to bury their
differences and form a coalition government across the ideological divide.
'This is the only way we could have formed a stable government,' says Mr
Erwin Teufel, the earnest career politician who took over as
Baden-Wurttemberg premier in January last year after his CDU colleague Mr
Lothar Spath was obliged to quit office on suspicion of corrupt dealings
with a local businessman.
'It was not what you might call a marriage of love,' concedes Mr Dieter
Spori, the state's SPD minister of economics and deputy prime-minster. 'But
we had to bury our differences and get on with with the tasks in hand. We
have managed to get a lot done.'
Teufel agrees: he says the coalition has worked 'almost without any
problems'.
The evidence of this is a thick document spelling out a 50 point plan
designed to secure Baden-Wurttemberg's attractions as an investment location
as Germany faces what Mr Spori calls 'the biggest challenge since the
Wiederaufbau (economic reconstruction after the second world war).'
The plan, says Spori, has encouraged companies, unions and government to
cooperate with one another. This unusual willingness to talk will help the
process of reconstruction necessary if Baden-Wurttemberg's economy is to
emerge stronger after the current recession has run its course, Mr Spori
believes.
As the chairman of the committee of economics ministers from all German
Lander, Spori played an important role in the negotiations which led to the
'solidarity pact' to finance German reunification, in mid-March.
The experience of co-operation between rival parties amid an economic
downturn makes Baden-Wurttemberg an 'impulse-giver' for developments in
national politics, says Mr Spori.
'If we manage to work something out here then they know in Bonn that it must
be sensible,' he argues, pointing not only to the solidarity pact but also
to the compromise agreement on a change to the law on asylum-seekers reached
in Bonn earlier this year. He adds: '95 per cent of the compromise (on
asylum) can be traced to back to what we were forced to develop here in
Baden-Wurttemberg.'
It was the inflow of asylum seekers - which rose from 256,000 in 1991 to
438,000 last year for the whole of Germany - which was the central issue in
last April's elections in Baden-Wurttemberg and in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, as in the elections in the state of Hesse this March.
In all three regional elections, the establishment parties suffered at the
expense of the Republicans and other right wing extremists, an expression of
what Germans call 'politische Verdrossenheit ' - disillusion with mainstream
politics. This could have ugly consequences for the crop of federal,
regional and European elections which take place in Germany next year.
Mr Teufel says that the swing to the right in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg
reflected this disillusion with politicians, rather than any more sinister
upsurge in racist sentiment.
'I have no doubt that the outcome was a protest vote,' he says. 'People in
Baden-Wurttemberg are willing to welcome genuine war refugees and victims of
political repression. But many of the 61,000 who came into Baden-Wurttemberg
last year are economic refugees. We sympathise with their plight but the
others must take priority.'
Local authorities are obliged to house the asylum seekers while their
applications to stay in the country are dealt with - a process which can
take years.
At a time of acute housing shortage for native Germans, the influx of
undeserving asylum-seeker unleashes 'extraordinary protest' from voters, Mr
Teufel says.
He is confident that the new law on asylum seekers, which seeks to stop
those refugees, who merely want better living standards, from crossing the
German border, will reduce the number coming to Germany to a third or a
quarter of the current figure.
Had the law been in place a year earlier, Mr Teufel says, the voters would
not have voted as they did last April: 'The undercurrent of support for far
right parties is only 2 to 3 per cent in Baden-Wurttemberg. If the asylum
problem is solved, the Republicans will disappear out of the state
parliament altogether.'
Mr Manfred Rommel, longstanding mayor of Stuttgart and son of Field Marshal
Erwin Rommel, of second world war fame, believes that the Republicans are an
ineffectual force in regional politics. But he says that the compromise on
asylum law has not addressed the fundamental problem of citizenship rights
for non-Germans living in Germany.
Stuttgart is an example of an international 'melting pot' where 23 per cent
of the 584,000 people living there are non-German, many drawn to the city
decades ago by the prospect of jobs in the nearby car plants and their
suppliers. The percentage of younger people who are technically foreign is
higher - but 70 per cent of non-Germans under the age of 17 were born in
Germany. They are prevented from acquiring German citizenship by archaic
laws which date back to before the first world war.
This anomaly, which serves to preserve racial demarcation lines, is not
being tackled by the compromise on asylum law.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (1): Anxiety for the affluent -
Baden-Wurttemberg, home of the Mercedes-Benz motor company, has long been
Germany's wealthiest state. But the very factors behind its post-war success
mean the present recession has hit it with particular severity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FORTUNE has smiled on the state of Baden-Wurttemberg in the south-west of
Germany - although the smile is looking a little forced as Germany slides
deeper into recession.
It is a land of beautiful and varied scenery, stretching from Heidelberg in
the north to the Black Forest and Lake Constance in the south. Endowed with
only limited natural resources, it is home to thousands of proudly
independent family businesses - the backbone of Germany's fabled Mittelstand
 -and scores of large industrial concerns, including Daimler-Benz, Germany's
biggest industrial company.
Germany's third biggest state in terms of population, Baden-Wurttemberg has
for decades been the wealthiest of the Lander (states), with the lowest rate
of unemployment, the highest exports, the most universities and technical
schools and the biggest expenditure on research and development. The state's
hard-working people have earned for Baden-Wurttemberg the epithet
Musterlandle - roughly translated from the local dialect as 'model little
country'.
Although Baden-Wurttemberg has not lost its economic pre-eminence within
Germany, it has become something of a role model for a number of economic
problems which afflict Germany as a whole.
Big companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, IBM Germany and the Robert
Bosch car components companies are cutting back staff and reporting
substantial profits falls. To take the most prominent example, profits at
the Daimler group dropped from DM1.94bn to DM1.45bn last year, and the group
is planning to shed 20,000 jobs in its Mercedes-Benz subsidiary this year.
Many of these job cuts will fall in Baden-Wurttemberg.
Amid dire market conditions, Mittelstand companies are failing or rushing
into cooperation agreements - such as the collaboration recently announced
by two Baden-Wurttemberg companies, Berthold Hermle, a milling and drilling
machine specialist, and Traub, Germany's second biggest lathe maker.
In February, unemployment in Baden-Wurttemberg climbed to 6 per cent; lower
than the national average but a record for a state which had only 3.7 per
cent unemployment in 1991. Moreover, there are more than 200,000 workers on
short-time work. In the first six months of last year, GDP growth slightly
outpaced that of Germany as a whole, but since the recession began in
earnest in the second half of 1992, the provisional figures for the whole of
1992 show that GDP growth fell from 2.9 per cent in 1991 to 1.5 per cent
last year.
The very factors which contributed to the state's post-war success now
ensure that it feels the effects of the current recession especially
sharply.
The regional economy is heavily dependent on manufacturing - especially on
the automobile sector and on other forms of mechanical and electrical
engineering such as machine-tool building. It has the highest density of
engineers anywhere in Germany, reflecting in part the perfectionist and
practical mentality of the Swabian people. In 1991, before the downturn took
hold, the state accounted for about a quarter of Germany's total exports of
electrical equipment, 22 per cent of Germany's automotive exports and 17 per
cent of all machinery exports.
Like other German companies, those in Baden-Wurttemberg benefited from a two
year surge in demand caused by German reunification. But this has petered
out and the traditional export markets have failed to take up the slack. It
is exactly the manufacturing sector - the source of Baden-Wurttemberg's
strength in the past - which is worst hit during Germany's current
recession.
Car production in Germany is likely to fall back by 25 per cent this year,
hitting not only car manufacturing companies such as Mercedes-Benz but also
their suppliers in the small company sector.
Demand for machines and other capital goods is stagnant in the absence of
recovery in the rest of the world. The recent appreciation of the D-Mark
against a number of currencies has made it that much more difficult for
German companies to sell their products abroad. Meanwhile, cost structures
reflect generous pay-rises awarded amid the euphoria of the
post-reunification boom.
'As far as the technical quality of what we make is concerned,' says Mr
Erwin Teufel, Baden-Wurttemberg's prime minister, 'we can hold our own with
anybody in the world. But as for Germany as a whole costs have become too
high and we have the lowest working hours of any of our major competitors.
Industry has become inflexible.'
Mr Teufel, a Christian Democrat who took over as prime minister of
Baden-Wurttemberg in January last year, cautions against exaggerating the
state's economic woes.
Unemployment is still lower than elsewhere in Germany, he says, and the
decline in sectors such as the automobile industry is from a very high
level. He argues that, at the core, the regional economy is extremely sound,
supported by excellent educational infrastructure (there are 48 universities
and technical schools, more than in any other German Land) and a research
and development expenditure amounting to 3.9 per cent of the state's GNP, a
higher percentage than in Germany as a whole - or in Japan.
Mr Dieter Spori, the Social Democrat (SPD) economics minister who is deputy
to Mr Teufel in the state's coalition government, agrees. Casting an eye
towards Germany's more northerly Lander, where industry evolved earlier than
in the south-west and, as a result, there is a greater dependence on
'smokestack' heavy industry, he says: 'Quite frankly I think we are lucky
that Baden-Wurttemberg's economy is dependent on the automobile sector. It's
better than being dependent on coal and steel.'
Although Mr Teufel believes that '80 per cent' of the state's economic
problems will be cleared up once the German economy participates in an
economic upswing, both the prime minister and his deputy believe that
Baden-Wurttemberg has to engage in some painful restructuring before it will
emerge leaner, fitter and more competitive than before.
That two such men, from opposite sides of Germany's political spectrum, can
agree on anything at all, let alone function together in a ruling coalition,
points to another way in which the state of Baden-Wurttemberg may prove to
be a model for the rest of Germany.
The coalition dates back to state elections in April last year, when the far
right captured 11 per cent of the votes and 15 seats in the state
parliament. As a result of the election the Christian Democratic Union
(CDU), the party of Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, lost its traditional
absolute majority in the last western state where it enjoyed a monopoly of
power.
The swing to the right, reflecting public dissatisfaction with the inflow of
asylum-seeking refugees into Germany, presaged a similar, if not quite so
pronounced swing to the right in the state of Hessen this year.
The alliance between the CDU and SPD just may make Baden-Wurttemberg a role
model for a 'grand coalition' of the main parties in Germany as a whole in
the aftermath of next's year's federal elections.

FT  29 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fear of LME scuppered US merger
 -The abandonment of a planned market marriage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of surging volume growth at the London Metals Exchange, and the
perception that the UK's commodities trading regulations are less
restrictive than those in the US, were the primary reasons why the Chicago
Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, decided against
acquiring New York's Commodity Exchange (Comex), the LME's chief rival, says
Mr Patrick Arbor, the CBoT chairman.
'The UK regulatory environment is more conducive to growth,' said Mr Arbor.
'Take a look at the growth of the LME and the International Petroleum
Exchange, relative to the Comex and the New York Mercantile Exchange. We
think that has something to do with the regulatory operating environment.'
Mr Arbor complains that compared to London, the paperwork required for
opening customer accounts in the US is prohibitive, that more compliance
people are required, and that in general 'the London regulatory environment
is a lot more liberal, less constrictive, and less costly'.
The LME's market share and its comparative regulatory advantage raised
questions about the cost-savings expected from the CBoT/Comex merger, Mr
Arbor said. A CBoT committee last week recommended that the merger, which
had been unpopular with Comex members, be abandoned. The Comex is currently
considering a takeover plan from its neighbour the Nymex.
LME volume grew by 46 per cent last year to 24.7m contracts. Comex, in
contrast, saw a 16 per cent drop in volume last year, to 12.7m contracts. In
the energy sector, Nymex had volume of 47.2m contracts, a 16 per cent gain
over 1991, while London's IPE saw growth of 26 per cent, to 10.7m contracts.
The Comex trades primarily precious metals, while the LME specialises in
base metals. Their two product lines overlap, however, with high grade
copper. In copper, the LME has by far the dominant market share.
Mr Arbor said the regulatory discrepancies and their impact on the Comex's
world competitiveness were brought home when a committee of CBoT accountants
and attorneys reviewed the Comex's books after he and Ms Donna Redel, Comex
chairwoman, signed the merger proposal January 25.
In fact, the relative volume growth at the LME could hardly have been a
surprise to Mr Arbor, since his exchange is keenly conscious of market share
lost overseas. Mr Arbor and other CBoT officials have been vocal critics of
US futures regulation for years, and have frequently led the US futures
industry in drives to defeat legislation it thought would constrain
competition.
In this case Mr Arbor may be using the LME as an example against a Clinton
administration proposal to tax futures transactions. 'If we continue to have
a harsher regulatory environment, and if the 14-cent (per contract)
transaction tax is approved, we risk seeing more and more US business going
overseas,' he said.
The Comex review did expose CBoT management more directly to world
competition that it rarely sees in its own operations. The CBoT's biggest
business is futures and options trading in grain and in US government bonds
and notes. None of those products have serious global competition.
While some small grain contracts, most notably in Tokyo and Paris, have
sprung up in recent years, none can compare with the size of the US market,
either in futures volume or in grain production. Gold and silver, the
Comex's major products, are more generic and thus more vulnerable to
competing interests, Mr Arbor says.
In fact, data provided by the US Futures Industry Association show that in
pure volume terms, Comex gold futures volume took a back seat to the upstart
BM &amp; F exchange in Brazil last year. Brazilian gold options jumped to second
place in world metals contract rankings in 1992, with volume at 8m
contracts, while Comex gold futures fell from second to fourth, at 6m.
The LME took first and third place in the rankings, with its aluminium and
copper futures. The volume rankings are deceptive because contract size
varies, and a single Comex gold future represents almost ten times as much
gold as a Brazilian gold option. Still, competitive pressures remain as
trading interest grows outside the US.
US futures industry officials have said that the rational response to those
pressures is to cut costs. After significant consolidation of futures
brokerage firms in the 1980s, they expected to see similar rationalisation
among US exchanges in this decade. The Comex's quest for an operating
partner is just the beginning of that movement, they say.

FT  29 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia halts sales from wool
stockpile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government yesterday announced a 12-month moratorium on sales
from the wool industry's 3.9bn-bale stockpile in an attempt to end a slide
in prices, which have already fallen to historic lows.
Mr Simon Crean, primary industries minister, also announced a ADollars 50m
(Pounds 23m) assistance package designed to subsidise debt interest payments
by about 6,500 farmers hit by falling prices and severe drought.
The minister said the postponement of sales from the wool stockpile would
remove the speculative pressure that had contributed a fall in the national
wool indicator from ADollars 5.50 a kilogram in November to ADollars 3.96 on
Friday. The market indicator, a weighted average of auction prices for 15
grades of wool, stood at ADollars 7.29 before the abolition of the wool
industry's ADollars 7 floor price two years ago.
The government's seven-year debt guarantee to the Australian Wool
Realisation Commission, the statutory authority which markets the stockpile,
would be extended by a year, Mr Crean said, and there would be a three-month
review of the wool industry's organisation and structure, to be chaired by
Mr Ross Garnaut, professor of economics at the Australian National
University.
Mr Crean rejected a call by the Australian Wool Council, the main growers'
body, for a cut in the 8.5 per cent wool tax, which finances the stockpile
and the industry's marketing efforts.
'What we are not going to do is to allow the growers. . . to get out of the
obligation they have to meet the debt,' he said. 'We are prepared to support
them in meeting it in a managed way, but they can't have the luxury of
finding some new crisis (each year) and in the end saying to the government:
'you have got to pay the bill'.'
The series of announcements was welcomed by some farmers' associations; the
Queensland Graingrowers Association said the drought package would help
farmers to stay on the land until the rains came. But Mr Alan Bowman,
president of the Wool Council, said the government's decision not to reduce
the wool tax was 'bloody hopeless'. He said the cut 'would have allowed the
industry to help itself.' The Wool Council was also disappointed that the
seven-year disposal schedule for the stockpile had not been extended
indefinitely.
The minister said that Mr Garnaut's review of the industry would consider
fresh marketing initiatives to divert the stockpile sales to non-traditional
buyers of wool, which could help to ease pressure on auction prices.
One of the ideas being considered by officials is the use of wool as an
insulation material in the construction industry. The government is also
considering proposals to exchange wool for equity in Russian textile mills.

ban

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission is expected to lift its ban on imports of meat and
dairy products from Central and East Europe today, but controls are likely
to remain on livestock from Poland and Croatia.
The European Community has been negotiating with 18 eastern European states
to produce tighter controls on export certificates following a
foot-and-mouth scare in Italy.
Most have responded with new controls, but Poland is understood to have
voiced reservations about the EC's request to impose a 14-day quarantine on
live animals.
EC officials said yesterday that restrictions on Polish dairy imports would
be lifted, while the ban on Croatian imports would continue because of
concern about the effectiveness of local controls. EC farm ministers have
failed to agree farm prices and milk quotas for 1993-94 despite a strong
effort by the Danish presidency to reach agreement in Luxembourg. Mr Rene
Steichen, EC farm commissioner, criticising the Danish package as too
generous, urged a more modest settlement.

News that the Australian government was taking measures to alleviate the
impact of the wool crisis on growers, by helping those in debt with an
interest rate subsidy and by lessening pressures on those disposing of the
wool stockpile had no obvious immediate market impact. Wool prices yesterday
were easier at auction again, though not by much and with some possible
signs of firming at the close. The market indicator fell by 5 cents, which
added to Tuesday's 10 cents established yet another new low point of 381
cents a Kg.

COPPER'S renewed fall early yesterday on the LME destroyed the confidence
which had been seeping into other base metals after copper's relative
stability over the past few days. Three-month copper fell nearly Dollars 30
in morning pre-market trading to around Dollars 1,885 a tonne as
option-related selling, liquidation and Chinese sales touched off sell
stops. For the rest of the day the price held in a narrow range, closing at
Dollars 1,891. But the damage had already been done to other metals where
long positions taken on recent strength were quickly disposed of. London's
robusta COFFEE futures closed lower as New York ran into a bout of profit
taking after the May contract's advance of more than 6 cents a lb over the
previous two days. Dealers said a modest setback was to be expected given
the magnitude of the preceding gains. Constructive short-term charts
remained the main supportive influence, with fundamentals still considered
fairly bearish. GOLD closed higher on the London bullion market after fixing
below Dollars 350 a troy ounce.

FT  29 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brighter prospects seen for
silver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILVER SHOULD benefit from the present positive sentiment in the gold
market, according to the American Precious Metals Advisors consultancy
organisation. It suggests silver's price this year should average more than
USDollars 4 a troy ounce and reach Dollars 4.40 to Dollars 4.60 by the
year-end compared with Dollars 3.95 in 1992.
'Psychology is particularly important for silver because of the large stocks
of this metal that overhang the market and the readiness of holders to part
with silver,' says Mr Jeffrey Nichols, president of APMA, in his latest
MetalsFax publication.
He suggests that liquid silver stocks may amount to 2bn ounces in North
America and western Europe - enough to satisfy demand for more than three
years - and many investors, particularly those in the US, bought their metal
at prices well above the present levels.
'Years of persistently declining prices have made it especially difficult
for silver to manage a sustainable recovery because many holders at first
will use any rally as an opportunity to unload,' he adds.
APMA believes the silver market will see its fourth annual supply deficit in
1993 with demand outpacing production by nearly 81m ounces. This compares
with a 1992 deficit of 46m ounces.
Fabrication demand is forecast to rise from 574m to 580m ounces mainly
because of record usage by the photographic industry, already the biggest
user of silver. APMA forecasts the photographic industry, spurred on by the
lowest real silver prices since the early 1970s and growth in picture-taking
in the emerging industrial countries, will use 210m ounces in 1993, up from
207m in each of the past two years.
APMA predicts a recovery in Indian imports following liberalisation of
government regulations so that non-residents can take 3,200 ounces of silver
into the country,subject to a 50 cents-an-ounce duty.
Mr Nichols points out that between 75 and 80 per cent of silver is mined as
a by-product of other metal mining. He predicts mine production this year
outside the former eastern bloc countries is likely to fall by 8m ounces
from the 1992 level to 352m ounces. Supplies of secondary or scrap silver
are also expected to fall, from 196m to 194m ounces.

'hostility'

<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL leaders of Caribbean banana producing countries are to meet US
trade officials next month in an attempt to dispel what the leaders say is
Washington's 'hostility' to the new European Community regime for importing
the fruit.
Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, said he and his colleagues
from St Vincent, Dominica and Grenada, will meet the US trade representative
to discuss the US attitude, which he said threatened the economic foundation
of the four islands.
The four, which make up the Windward group, and other producers of the
African, Caribbean and Pacific group, are seeking protection for their
market share in Europe, and fear competition from cheaper Latin American
fruit.
The EC's agriculture ministers have proposed that from July there will be a
2m tonnes-a-year quota for Latin American fruit and that this will attract
duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 78) a tonne. Imports of Latin American fruit above
this level will attract a duty of Ecu850 a tonne. Caribbean and other
traditional suppliers, such as those in Africa, will have access for the
remainder of the EC's needs, which traders say is about 1.5m tonnes a year.
This fruit will pay no tariff.
The new regime has been criticised by the US and by the Latin American
countries.
In a statement to St Lucia's parliament, Mr Compton said that the US
position on the issue showed that the Clinton administration was 'even more
unsympathetic' to the EC's proposed regime than was the Bush administration.

FT  29 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western countries seen
importing 70% of oil needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN industrialised countries could import 70 per cent of their oil in
the next 10 to 15 years - more than double the present rate, according to a
report entitled World Energy Outlook by the International Energy Agency, the
West's monitoring body.
Ms Helga Steeg, executive director of the IEA suggested that the West should
increase its oil emergency stocks as its dependence on imports rises. IEA
countries hold stocks of 90 days oil consumption.
The IEA said oil consumption by OECD countries could increase to more than
45m barrels a day from the 1990 level of under 38m b/d. That would mean
importing 9m b/d more oil at 31.4m b/d.
Increased levels of imports were expected to come from the Middle East and
Venezuela, which could account for 50 per cent of OECD oil imports.
The IEA said Russian oil output could reach 10m b/d by 2010 from its current
average of 9m b/d, but the body stressed that that was its best guess for
the country and that more accurate forecasts were impossible because of
political and economic uncertainties.
The IEA assumed as part of its scenario that oil prices would rise gradually
to Dollars 30 a barrel by 2005 (in 1993 money) and then flatten out. If
crude prices remained flat in real terms the West would become even more
dependent on imports as its own relatively high-cost oil output would
decline even further.
While overall consumption of oil was expected to increase, the IEA expected
oil's share of total world energy requirements to continue to decline from
39 per cent to 37 per cent. Gas on the other hand, was seen increasing its
market share by 3 percentage points to just over 24 per cent.
World electricity demand was expected to grow fastest largely because prices
were not expected to rise as quickly as for other fuels. Electricity's share
of global energy demand was expected to rise to 21.8 per cent by 2010 from
18.8 per cent.
Mr Lakis Vouyoukas, IEA's senior economist, forecast 'phenomenal' growth in
gas use for power generation in the next 10 years, particularly in Europe,
where its use was expected to rise by 6 per cent.
The agency saw coal demand growth continuing, but forecast further slowing
in the growth rate for nuclear power because of increased costs and safety
concerns. Coal usage was expected to meet 29 per cent of energy needs by
2010 and nuclear power 6 per cent.
The introduction of carbon taxes and other measures to curb emissions could
have a big effect on the energy markets in the next 17 years. The IEA's
analysis showed that a tax of Dollars 100 per tonne of carbon (Dollars 12 a
barrel for oil) would partly stem the rise of emissions, but not reduce
them.
Without a tax, OECD carbon emissions were expected to rise by 28 per cent by
2010. With Dollars 100 tax per tonne of carbon, emmission growth would be 9
per cent lower.

FT  29 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Disappointing result to Bank of England
Pounds 3bn auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government bond market tumbled on disappointment over the results of
the Bank of England's Pounds 3bn gilt auction.
The auction of 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998 was covered only 1.77 times by
bids totalling Pounds 5.3bn, with foreign demand failing to reach the levels
expected.
The average yield was 6.98 per cent with a tail - the difference between the
average and maximum yield - of 1 basis point.
Optimism ahead of the auction had been such that forecasts of cover had
ranged as high as three times, although the low end of the range was 1.5
times.
With overseas investors building up exposure to the strengthening pound
ahead of the auction, some economists believed the optimism on demand
overdone, particularly in view of the cash-flow squeeze on institutions.
The yield curve steepened as prices fell by more than a point on gilts with
maturities over 15 years.
The June gilt future fell through a key support level of 104.31 to touch a
low of 104.20. Rising concern about inflation was one of the factors making
the long end vulnerable.
THE German government bond market opened at a high level in anticipation of
the Bundesbank cutting the repo rate. It rose a little more when the cut
surpassed expectations, but profit-taking led the market down thereafter.
The repo was cut from 8.09 per cent to 7.75 per cent, 10 to 15 basis points
less than typical forecasts.
The June bund contract opened at 95.52 and hit 95.60 after the repo news
came through.
It ended at 95.07 after falling through the 95 barrier. Volume was heavy
with 100,000 contracts traded.
As the cost of funding comes down at the short end of the market, the yield
curve is normalising.
One of the factors turning it more positive is a looming supply of 10-year
bonds as public sector debt levels grow.
FRANCE also took further steps towards a positively sloping yield curve.
Yields on two-year stock have fallen below those on five years as investor
interest concentrates on the short end of the market.
Conditions seemed favourable for further cuts in French interest rates with
overnight money quoted at 8.70 per cent, 30 basis points below the middle
level between the two official rates.
THE dollar's rally against the yen helped push the Japanese government bond
market down further.
The June futures contract opened a point lower in Tokyo, at 107.90, in
response to the weakening of the yen against the dollar and to the fall in
US Treasury prices.
By the close in Tokyo, another 30 basis points had been shed from the
futures contract to give 107.60 and the low of 107.48 breached the 107.50
support level.
The No 145 cash bond due 2002 opened at a higher yield of 4.335 per cent and
weakened to 4.42 per cent at the close.
The yen's decline joined the buoyant Nikkei stock market index, which again
closed above 20,000, in removing last week's twin drivers of the bond
market.
Concern about economic recovery was stirred up by Tuesday's sharp
improvement in the index of leading economic indicators.
Nervousness was amplified, however, by the onset of the Golden Week
holidays, which start today and will create a bit of a vacuum until the end
of next week.
US TREASURY prices were mixed in light trading yesterday after a successful
auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 102
19/32 , yielding 6.915 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was slightly firmer, up  1/32 at 100, to yield 3.859 per cent.
Although prices firmed overnight after Tokyo funds bought Treasuries with
the dollars they had acquired from the Japanese central bank, which had
intervened in the foreign exchange markets to help buoy the US currency
against the soaring yen, there was no follow-through when trading opened in
New York.
Following Tuesday's disappointing two-year auction, which left dealers
holding much of the new inventory, the market was apprehensive ahead of the
Dollars 11bn five-year sale.
Dealers feared that the lack of demand which sunk the two-year auction would
do the same for the five-year.
Some analysts noted, however, that the decline in prices that followed
Tuesday's auction could help spur demand for the five-year sale. This
analysis subsequently proved right. Demand for the issue was strong,
although the success of the auction failed to lift longer-dated prices.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: South Korean securities firms
return to profit

<TEXT>
COMBINED net profits of South Korea's 32 securities firms jumped to
Won451.7bn (Dollars 570m) in the year to March from Won15.8bn in the
previous year as the Seoul bourse posted its first sustained recovery in
three years, the Securities Supervisory Board said.
All the firms reported profits during the year. In contrast, 10 of them,
including six of the seven leaders, had losses in fiscal 1991.
The general index of the Seoul bourse rose by almost 10 per cent during
1992-93, while trading volume rose by 50 per cent. Increased bond
transactions also contributed to higher profits.
Daewoo Securities was the most profitable with a Won57.1bn surplus, against
Won10bn the year before.
It was followed by Lucky Securities with Won44.1bn against a loss of
Won2.5bn and Dongsuh Securities with Won40.1bn against a loss of Won5.8bn.
Jardine Fleming has opened its first office in Pakistan, AP-DJ reports. The
merchant banking arm of Jardine Matheson group said the office, based in
Lahore, would provide fundamental research on companies listed on the stock
exchanges of Karachi and Lahore. Jardine Fleming hopes to expand to other
securities-related activities in Pakistan in due course.
Alan Smith, managing director of Jardine Fleming in Hong Kong, is confident
of Pakistan's long-term outlook for international investors, citing the
country's potential for widespread privatisation of nationalised
enterprises.
The new establishment brings the number of Jardine Fleming offices
throughout the Asia-Pacific region to 16.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Bonds: Kingdom of Sweden back with FFr3bn
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Sweden returned to the Eurobond market yesterday with a
FFr3bn seven-year issue, the latest borrower to tap the popular French franc
sector.
Borrowers have flocked to the Euro-French franc sector since the
centre-right parties swept to victory at last month's general election. The
result lent support to the French currency, enabling the Bank of France to
lower interest rates - helped by the Bundesbank's recent easing of German
key interest rates.
Although there has already been a lot of new supply in the French franc
sector, the Swedish National Debt Office pointed out that the seven-year
area has been left alone. 'We saw that there was good investor demand in the
seven-year area, and that suited us from our portfolio perspective,' said Ms
Christine Holm, a director of the office.
BNP, the lead manager, added that the seven-year maturity also provided one
of the best maturities for swapping. Part of the proceeds will be swapped,
probably into floating-rate francs.
The bond, which has a coupon of 7.25 per cent, was launched with a spread of
35 basis points over the relevant US Treasury bond, but widened to 36.5
basis points. So far this year, Sweden has borrowed the equivalent of
SKr65bn in the Eurobond market.
Rumours circulated that the Kingdom of Spain may also tap the French franc
sector when it makes the second of its proposed three or four Eurobond
offerings this year. However, an official at the Spanish Treasury said a
firm decision has not yet been taken on the currency front, and that both
Euro-sterling and Euro-French francs are under consideration.
In the dollar sector, the Republic of Colombia launched its much-marketed
Dollars 125m five-year deal at a spread of 215 basis points over the
five-year US Treasury bond. The spread tightened to 205 basis points,
reflecting good demand for the issue.
The proceeds from the bond, which carries a 7 1/8 per cent coupon, will be
used to repay more expensive debt. Colombia lacks a credit rating at the
moment, but Bankers Trust, the lead manager for the deal, said discussions
with Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency are due to take place next week and
they are predicting that a BBB rating will be assigned to the borrower.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: SEC in plan to relax rules on
capital adequacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exchange Commission is planning to publish draft
regulations shortly which could ease the capital burden on US securities
firms, making them more competitive with those based in countries such as
the UK which require firms to hold less capital for regulatory purposes.
The so-called 'concept release,' due next month, will propose minimum
capital levels to cover credit risks which will be less stringent than the
current rules.
'Our rules never envisaged brokers being in the long-term lending business,'
said Mr Carter Beese, an SEC commissioner.
The concept release will contain 'a rationalisation of the process,' he
added. 'At the moment, the capital charge is 100 per cent (of the credit
risk): it should be something less than this.'
The SEC will also propose a portfolio approach to assessing market risks,
reducing the capital required by firms which hold wide portfolios of
securities.
The proposals are part of an attempt by the SEC to bring its capital rules
more into line with current thinking on the management of risk in the
financial markets. 'Some ways of reducing risk actually have the affect of
increasing regulatory capital,' said Mr Beese.
The SEC's tough stance on capital adequacy for securities firms was one of
the reasons why plans to develop international minimum standards were
abandoned this year.
The latest proposals indicate that the commission is moving further towards
the position of centres such as the UK, which claim that by using
sophisticated measurements of risk it is possible to cut down on capital
without increasing the dangers should a securities firm collapse.

return to profit

<TEXT>
OMV, the troubled Austrian integrated oil and chemical group, reports a 1992
net loss of Sch264.5m (Dollars 23.8m), somewhat less than the Sch300m
forecast in January. In 1991, the group made a net profit of Sch1.72bn.
The recovery trend has continued into the first quarter of 1993, with a loss
of Sch125m comparing with a Sch247m deficit in the same 1992 period.
Mr Richard Schenz, who became president last summer following the sudden
resignation of Mr Siegfried Meysel, said there was evidence of some
improvement in the group's markets, and he hoped for a return to modest
profits for the year as a whole.
The directors were meanwhile concentrating on cutting costs. The dividend
for 1992 would be cut from Sch20 per share to Sch15 and capital spending
this year would be reduced from Sch6bn last year to Sch4bn.
Group sales last year were flat at just under Sch83bn, with sales in the
integrated oil and gas businesses up 2.7 per cent to Sch67.1bn, while
chemical sales were down 7.7 per cent to Sch8.37bn and plastics revenues
plunged 14.1 per cent to Sch7.37bn.
A divisional breakdown of after-tax results showed the exploration and
production division moved from a Sch390m loss to a Sch310m profit, while the
gas division raised its profit from Sch1.34bn to Sch1.53bn.
OMV said its selling memorandum for prospective strategic shareholders would
be ready by mid-May. The Austrian state industrial holding company, OIAG,
intends to sell part of its 72 per cent stake, and OMV has said it would
like to have two or three strategic shareholders with 10 to 20 per cent
stakes.
Potential candidates include governments of oil and gas-producing countries
and international oil companies. Mr Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer, finance
director, said he hoped the selection process, in which OMV is being advised
by Lehman Brothers, could be completed by year-end.

deficit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, reported a reduction in
first-quarter net losses to NKr33m (Dollars 4.94m) from NKr115m a year
earlier.
The result, which follows Elkem's warning that prospects remained uncertain,
was far better than forecast. The A shares jumped 20 per cent to NKr29.50 on
the Oslo bourse and the free shares advanced NKr5.50 to NKr33.50.
Elkem attributed the lower loss to cost reductions, tax cuts, a fall in net
interest expenses, and favourable exchange rates. Turnover dipped to
NKr1.9bn from NKr1.988bn. Operating costs were cut by NKr152m to NKr1.741bn
and net interest by NKr24m to NKr85m.
The company reversed last year's first-quarter operating loss of NKr7m with
an operating profit of NKr64m, the best operating result in four consecutive
quarters.
Last autumn, Elkem strengthened its financial base through a NKr580m share
issue and established a NKr550m credit facility.
The group pledged to continue to reduce costs and increase productivity and
said that measures already implemented had made a substantial contribution.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Rivals join Packer in TV licence
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KERRY PACKER appeared likely to win a dominant role in Australian
subscription television yesterday after rival commercial channels joined a
consortium led by his Channel Nine network.
The consortium, which includes Telecom Australia and News Corporation, Mr
Rupert Murdoch's US-based media group, looks set to win one of two
four-channel subscription television licences being offered by the
government.
The inclusion of the smaller Network Seven and Network Ten organisations was
announced shortly before the deadline for bids expired at 4pm yesterday.
Analysts said neither company had sufficient financial strength to bid
alone.
Mr David Beddall, communications minister, refused to say whether any other
bids had been received for the so-called B licence, which is open to both
domestic and foreign companies.
However, two other potential bidders, Mr Steve Cosser's Australis Media and
Mr Tony O'Reilly's Australian Provincial Newspapers, said they had not
submitted bids.
Several US companies have expressed interest in bidding for the A licence,
which is restricted to companies which are not already active in the
Australian media.
Bids here are believed to have been received from Continental Cablevision
and Time Warner, although it was unclear whether the US groups were
co-operating or competing.
The government is expected to announce the highest bidders for the two
licences on Friday. However, the winners will require approval from the
Trade Practices Commission, the competition regulator, to proceed.
A successful bid by the Channel Nine consortium would establish Mr Packer,
proprietor of the privately owned Consolidated Press Holdings media group,
as the dominant force in Aus-tralian broadcasting.
It would also mark a return to Australian broadcasting for News Corp, which
would be restricted to a 20 per cent shareholding in the consortium under
foreign investment regulations.
News Corp controls 70 per cent of daily newspaper circulation. The group
operated a national commercial television channel before being forced to
divest by cross-media ownership rules.
Analysts said the consortium's access to programming from Channel Nine and
News Corp's growing Fox network in the US, would make it a strong competitor
in the potentially crowded subscription television market.
In addition to the winner of the A licence, the consortium would be in
competition with the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation,
which has been granted a separate two-channel subscription licence.
The inclusion of Telecom gives the consortium significant technical
flexibility if problems emerge in the development of the unproven digital
transmission system which will be a condition of both licences.
Telecom is developing a cable transmission system using telephone lines
which it believes will be commercially and technically viable within two
years, posing a potentially serious challenge to satellite transmission.

A RESURGENT PanCanadian Petroleum is providing strong underpinning for
hard-pressed Canadian Pacific, the transport, resource and property group.
PanCanadian, owned 87 per cent by CP, has reported first-quarter profit of
CDollars 61.3m (USDollars 48.6m), or 49 cents a share, treble the
year-earlier profit of CDollars 20.5m, or 16 cents. Revenues were CDollars
266m, up 33 per cent.
Based on the improved results, the company is hoisting its quarterly
dividend by 5 cents to 20 cents a share.
Oil prices rose 8 per cent and conventional production was up 27 per cent to
84,258 barrels daily. Synthetic crude also fetched higher prices.
PanCanadian is a leading natural gas producer in Alberta and British
Columbia, and shipments and prices were also up sharply.
Demand in Canada and the US, with the long, severe winter, has left some
producers short of contracted volumes, sending them to the spot market for
supplies.
For the whole of 1992, oil production rose 23 per cent and gas sales 29 per
cent. Mr David O'Brien, chairman, says PanCanadian can maintain the momentum
over the next two years because of heavy investment in production and
development.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Two Japanese banks warn of
losses
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of Japan's sickest regional banks, Hyogo and Taiheiyo, yesterday warned
of losses for the year to March.
Hyogo Bank, which earlier this week announced the resignations of five
executives, expects a loss of Y31.7bn (Dollars 285m) for the year, up from
an earlier estimated loss of Y9bn, due to write-offs of bad loans and a
Y10.8bn appraisal loss on securities holdings.
A former director-general of the finance ministry's banking bureau, Mr
Masateru Yoshida, has just been appointed president of the bank, one of the
most prominent victims of the late-1980s, when it and several affiliates
were big lenders to the property market.
Hyogo is attempting to support 10 finance affiliates with Y1,600bn in
outstanding loans, of which an increasing percentage are bad. The bank will
take a special charge of Y29.6bn to assist in the rehabilitation of those
affiliates.
Taiheiyo Bank, based in Tokyo, is being restructured by four commercial
banks which have pumped in about Y60bn in loans. However, the bank is still
expecting a loss of Y1.96bn for the year, as the continuing fall in property
prices has slowed the recovery of debts.
Like Hyogo, Taiheiyo has apparently boosted profits by selling branches, but
the success of the restructuring, scheduled to last for 10 years, will
depend on a recovery in the property market.
The full extent of the non-performing loan burden at the two banks remains
unclear, as they have been forced to slash interest rates charged to ailing
customers, though these reductions do not show up in the official
calculations of non-performing assets.
In contrast, Sumitomo Bank, one of the biggest City banks, signalled that it
believes the banking industry is heading into better times by announcing
that its net profit for 1992-1993 will be Y14bn, up from a
previously-forecast Y12bn.
Sumitomo reported appraisal losses on securities of Y36.8bn, though the loss
would have been larger but for a surge in Tokyo stock prices during March.
The bank also announced that Mr Toshio Morikawa, its vice-president, will be
promoted to president, succeeding Mr Sotoo Tatsumi, who will become
chairman.

mid-year advance

<TEXT>
FIRST National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third-largest bank, has reported a
22.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to R421.5m (Dollars 84.55m) for the
six months to March 1993. It is stepping up its dividend.
Mr Barry Swart, managing director, said he was pleased with the results,
given the difficult operating environment. He cautioned, however, that the
level of economic activity continued to slow.
Mr Swart said it was difficult to generate lending volumes, and he doubted
whether even a 5 per cent drop in interest rates would generate much
activity, given low levels of confidence and consumers finding themselves
over-borrowed.
Net interest income rose by 17.4 per cent to R1.08bn in the half-year as
declining interest expenditure offset a sluggish income performance.
The bad debt charge rose by 15.1 per cent to R184.8m, with most of the
growth coming from Henry Ansbacher, the UK merchant bank purchased in
October and included in the results for the first time. Other operating
income rose by 17 per cent to R755.4m
Mr Swart said the Ansbacher acquisition was bedding down well and benefits
should accrue in the next six months. He said FNB's plans for Ansbacher
included increasing the focus on international trade finance, resurrecting
the money market operations, streamlining the trust operations, and becoming
more active in the corporate finance/merchant banking market.
Earnings per share rose by 20.3 per cent to 310.1 cents before taking into
account a deferred taxation rate adjustment, and net of a tax equalisation
provision. The dividend is increased to 55 cents a share from 50 cents.
Total assets grew by 21.7 per cent to R48.1bn at the end of March. Advances
increased by 18.6 per cent to R38bn.

DENTSU, the world's largest advertising agency, is creating the post of
executive chairman and reshuffling top management, the company said.
Mr Yutaka Narita, executive director, is being promoted to president while
Mr Gohei Kogure, president, will assume the newly created post of executive
chairman.
The move is aimed at creating a management structure that better reflects
the company's size and responsibilities as a leading corporation, a Dentsu
representative said.
The announcement came as Dentsu was named by Advertising Age, a trade
magazine, as the world's largest advertising agency by gross income for the
20th consecutive year.
This was despite Japan experiencing the first negative growth in advertising
expenditure since 1965.
Last year Japan saw a 4.6 per cent fall in advertising expenditure to
Y5,461bn (Dollars 49bn), which took it back to the level of expenditure in
1990.
The country saw the first recorded decrease in television advertising
revenue while newspaper advertising fell by 9.5 per cent.
Dentsu last year reported a slight fall in sales to Y1,362bn and a 1 per
cent decline in gross profit to Y197bn.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Age of automation reaches New
York bond auctions - From today, dealers will bid by computer on the world's
largest securities market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST before 1pm today, bond traders at 39 big banks and securities houses in
the US will enter their bids for a new issue of Treasury bills into a
computer, and the world's largest securities market will move one step
closer to coming of age in the electronic era.
Until today, the method the 39 primary dealers in government securities  -
those banks and Wall Street firms allowed to bid directly with the Federal
Reserve of New York for Treasury securities on behalf of customers -
employed to place their bids for new bills notes and bonds was
embarrassingly antiquated.
In a ground-floor corridor at the New York Fed's Manhattan headquarters,
messengers would crowd around telephones anxiously waiting for instructions
from their firms' bond traders. Moments before 1pm, the messengers would
rush from their phones to stuff pieces of paper into an old brown box.
On the paper would be written details of each primary dealer's bid - how
much of a new government issue it wanted and the yield it was willing to
accept.
After 1pm, the Fed would sort the tenders and begin awarding dealers their
allocation of the new issue. Final details of the completed auction would
not be released until about an hour after the bidding closed.
Now that primary dealers can bid via an on-line computer link to the New
York Fed, the whole cumbersome process will be simplified and speeded up.
The dealers are not the first to use computers in the auctions. In the past
year, some 600 smaller bidders in the market have been submitting their
tenders by computer, but only for non-competitive bids - where the bidder
agrees in advance to buy the securities at the average yield determined by
the auction.
Automation of primary dealer bidding is part of the overhaul of the
government securities market that was triggered by the Salomon Brothers
scandal of August 1991, when the Wall Street firm's bond desk was discovered
to have submitted false bids for new government secur-ities in several
Treasury auctions.
Primary dealers will find it easier to submit their tenders for auctions at
the last moment and to keep records of bids.
The smaller bidders will no longer have to go through either the dealers or
their local Federal Reserve banks to bid for a new issue - they can do it on
their own computer.
Equally important, the compilation of all information on computer will
improve the New York Fed's supervision of auctions. The absence of an
electronic auction record was seen as one of the reasons why the Salomon
bond desk was able to break Treasury rules on bidding limits without being
caught in several 1990 and 1991 auctions.
It is uncertain whether automation will have any effect on the pricing of
auctions.
Mr Lee Olesky, assistant general counsel at the Public Securities
Association, the industry body that has liaised with the Treasury on
automation, believes the rapid release of computerised auction results may
mean dealers will have to worry less about hedging the positions they hold
in the hour or so between the end of the auction and the publication of the
final results.
Mr Olesky says: 'The only real dollar impact in terms of pricing is a
reduction in that window when you are waiting to get the results back -
that's an exposure that dealers may have had to hedge in the past.'
As part of its reforms, the authorities decided to widen the pool of firms
allowed to bid directly in the auctions. This measure was designed to ensure
that it would no longer be possible for the primary dealers to control the
auctions. Regulators and legislators believed it was the concentration of
too much power in too few hands that encouraged the Salomon bond desk to
break the rules.
The Treasury, however, is not stopping at automation and primary dealer
reform. It is also considering changing the system it uses to sell
government debt.
Since September, the Treasury has been experimenting with a single-price
auction, using it for every sale of two-year and five-year notes.
The old system, used for decades, involves selling securities to dealers at
different prices. Dealers willing to pay the highest price were awarded
their bids first. Dealers willing to pay the next highest price were then
awarded their bids, and so on, until each issue was fully subscribed.
In the single-price auctions being tried by the Treasury, dealers and others
bid openly at ever-increasing prices. The price of the issue rises until it
is no longer over-subscribed, at which point everyone still in the bidding
is awarded their securities at the last fully-subscribed price.
Any securities left over are awarded on a pro-rata basis and at the same
fully-subscribed price to those who dropped earlier in the bidding.
So far, Wall Street has taken to the new system quite well. One of the
reasons for introducing the single-price auction was that it made it much
harder for one, or a few, bidders to manipulate the auction by bidding
extremely high and cornering the market in the new issue. It is an
improvement that the market welcomes.
The Treasury hopes that, by allowing many more financial institutions to bid
competitively in auctions (in multiple-price auctions only the primary
dealers tender competitive bids), the government will be able to sell its
securities at a higher price, and at a lower cost to the taxpayer.
Yet, as bond traders point out, everything depends on market conditions. If
the market is buoyant, bidding will be aggressive. If it is weak, bidding
will be more cautious.
As one trader put it yesterday: 'So far, about 75 per cent of the new
auctions have saved the Treasury money, because were are in a market where
rates are trending down and a lot of people are bidding aggressively.
'I think in a bull market the single-price auction is a big winner for the
Treasury. But in a bear market, it's a big loser.'

KVERNELAND, the Norwegian producer of farming equipment, has bought Taarup
of Denmark in a strategically important move to expand its range of grass
machines and related products.
Terms were not disclosed, but the deal boosts Kverneland's consolidated
turnover by about 30 per cent to NKr1.3bn (Dollars 196m).
To strengthen its capital base after the takeover, Kverneland proposes a
one-for-three rights issue to raise about NKr78m.
The group is best known for its soil preparation equipment and potato
machinery. In grass machines, it had previously been represented only
through its niche bale-wrapping product Silawrap.

<TEXT>
TELEFONOS de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's largest private company and monopoly
telephone utility, disappointed the market by announcing net profits of
2.02bn new pesos (Dollars 651m) for the first quarter, 4.3 per cent less
than in the same period of 1992.
Telmex's revenue growth was 3.5 per cent compared to the fourth quarter of
last year and was lower than expected.
Tariffs increased in real terms by 3.5 per cent, compared with the fourth
quarter, and line growth was 2.2 per cent. But a marked slowdown in
long-distance and international traffic had helped depress sales.
Mr Mickey Schleien of Morgan Stanley commented: 'The real problem is the
above-the-line figures. We were hoping for sequential revenue growth of 6.9
per cent.'
Mr Schleien said the reduction in net profits was expected mainly because
Telmex had reported a foreign exchange loss of 52m pesos in the first
quarter, compared with a foreign exchange gain in the first quarter of 1992
totalling 161m pesos.
A Telmex official blamed the reduction in traffic on the low growth in the
Mexican economy in the first quarter.
Telmex installed 145,000 new lines in the first quarter, pushing the total
number of lines up to 6.889m, 11.8 per cent up on March 1992.

<TEXT>
PAINEWEBBER, the Wall Street securities firm, will file a lawsuit against
Kleinwort Benson today, five days after three senior managers of a
PaineWebber asset management unit defected to the UK investment bank,
allegedly with confidential information.
The suit, to be filed in New York by PaineWebber unit Mitchell Hutchins
Institutional Investors, alleges that three former MHII executives conspired
to misappropriate proprietary and confidential information belonging to
MHII, and wrongly provided Kleinwort's US affiliate with that information.
Among other allegations outlined in the suit, PaineWebber charges that the
three executives - former MHII president and chief executive Mr Stephen
Canter, former chief investment officer Mr Emad Zikry, and former
vice-president Mr Thomas Goepfert - solicited MHII clients, disparaged MHII,
and solicited MHII employees to join them at Kleinwort Benson International
Investment, the London bank's US subsidiary. Ultimately, seven other MHII
employees left to join Kleinwort.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from Kleinwort, and an injunction from
the court barring the defendants from soliciting or accepting asset
management business from MHII clients, from using MHII information, from
soliciting MHII employees and disparaging the company.
PaineWebber will also ask the court to set up a trust to hold any fees
earned by the defendants from their activities related to MHII.
Today's actions follow last Friday's defection by the three MHII executives,
who helped manage Dollars 4bn of clients fixed-income investments.
PaineWebber says that by Saturday the three had already begun contacting
MHII clients, writing to them on Kleinwort letter-headed paper.
Officers at Kleinwort Benson's New York office were unavailable for comment
last night.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Air Canada alliance 'may boost
revenues by Dollars 400m'

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, and Air Canada yesterday
predicted that the alliance between them could generate an additional
Dollars 400m of revenues annually, once a US-Canada 'open skies' deal is
agreed.
The forecast was made by Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada's chairman, at a joint
press conference in New York called to herald Continental's re-emergence
from bankruptcy on Tuesday night. The last step in Continental's
reorganisation was completed then, when the carrier closed an investment
agreement with Air Canada and Air Partners, a Texan investment group. This
deal gives the investors a 55 per cent stake in Continental.
It is two-and-a-half years since Houston-based Continental sought protection
from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. Continental
went in and out of bankruptcy once before, during the early-1980s.
The increase in revenue, Mr Harris suggested, could translate into a Dollars
25m earnings rise for Air Canada, and something similar for Continental -
but he did not elaborate.
The carriers stressed yesterday that, while they do not anticipate any
'common branding' at this stage (flying under common colours, for example),
they are seeking cost savings through shared maintainence services and
similar moves.
Air Canada has relocated gates at La Guardia airport in New York, to be
nearer Continental, and plans to move to the Continental terminal at Newark.
Air Canada is also launching two daily Toronto-Houston flights next month.
Houston is Continental's chief hub, and this is designed to improve customer
feed.
Meanwhile, Mr Harris said the company had made 'no final recommendation' to
directors on whether its 9 per cent stake in Ireland's GPA group should be
written down. However, it will do so ahead of the board meeting on May 6.
USAir, the airline in which British Airways invested Dollars 300m earlier
this year for a 19.9 per cent voting interest, last night priced its stock
offering at Dollars 20.75. USAir plans to issue 10m new shares at this price
or 11.5m if underwriters' over-allotment options are exercised.
At this price, therefore, the issue raises a maximum of Dollars 239m before
expenses.

Yesterday, the company also announced it had cut its annual dividend from 10

Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 239.7m, or Dollars 2.12 a share,
after a Dollars 243m pre-tax restructuring charge. In 1992, first-quarter
income was Dollars 4.4m, or 4 cents. Revenues declined to Dollars 380.7m
from Dollars 498m.
The company said savings from cutbacks would be substantial and the
streamlining of operations would enable it to eliminate some excess
production capacity within the mainframe computer industry. This should
stabilise prices and profit margins.
Amdahl warned last month that first-quarter losses would be larger than
analysts had expected and revenues would be below expectations.
The company said soft economic conditions have produced erratic demand and
intense competitive pressure on prices.
The first quarter is also generally the weakest in the mainframe computer
market. This one was unusually difficult because of announcements of new
mainframe computers made in February by both Amdahl and IBM. Customers
typically await such announcements before making purchase decisions.
'We remain committed to the IBM-compatible mainframe market,' said Mr Joseph
Zemke, president and chief executive officer. 'But we also recognise that
growth has slowed down as customers investigate smaller systems that appear
to offer lower computing costs.'
But he remained convinced that customers would ultimately recognise the need
for mainframe computers.

<TEXT>
BORLAND International, the US personal computer software company, reported
much higher than expected earnings for its fourth quarter as sales of new
programs for use with Microsoft's Windows operating system took off.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 5.1m, or 19 cents a share, compared
with a net loss of Dollars 26.9m, or Dollars 1.05, in the fourth quarter of
1992.
Revenues were Dollars 117.1m, down slightly from Dollars 116.8m.
'These results reflect the introduction during the quarter of Paradox for
Windows and dBASE IV version 2.0,' said Mr Philippe Kahn, chairman,
president and chief executive.
'Sales of Borland products for the growing Windows marketplace accounted for
more than half of the company's fourth-quarter revenues.'
Net loss for the year was Dollars 49.2m, or Dollars 1.87 a share, against a
net loss of Dollars 110.4m, or Dollars 4.29, previously. Revenues for the
year fell to Dollars 464m from Dollars 482.5m.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Kuehler sets date to leave IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jack Kuehler, vice-chairman and former president of International
Business Machines, is to retire at the end of August after 35 years with the
company.
Mr Kuehler's retirement follows the appointment of Mr Louis Gerstner as IBM
chairman and chief executive on April 1, and is another step in IBM
'changing of the guard'.
But unlike former IBM chairman and chief executive Mr John Akers, who
resigned in the face of mounting pressure from shareholders and board
members, Mr Kuehler is leaving IBM after having postponed his long-planned
retirement at the request of Mr Akers.
'Jack agreed last year to stay beyond his planned retirement date, and I'm
pleased that he will stay through August to continue his work on key
alliances and to advise me on technology issues,' said Mr Gerstner.
One of the most widely respected executives in the computer industry, Mr
Kuehler was the first technologist to reach the top ranks of IBM's
executives. He is said to have long urged changes that are now under way
within the company.
In particular, Mr Kuehler was instrumental in the formation of IBM's
technology alliance with Apple Computer and Motorola to develop
microprocessors and software for a new generation of high performance,
low-cost computers.
He was also the architect of IBM's partnerships with Siemens and Japan's
Toshiba in semiconductor memory chips, and with Toshiba in flat panel
displays for laptop computers.
'Jack Kuehler is one of the princes of the computer industry,' said Mr
Andrew Grove, chief executive of Intel. 'He understood the critical role of
semiconductor manufacturers long before it was generally recognised in the
computer industry.'
In what may turn out to be his most lasting contribution to IBM's technology
direction, Mr Kuehler was responsible for bringing to market the technology
that is used in its workstation products and ultimately is expected to be
the foundation for a broad new generation of computers.

ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the largest brewer in the US, yesterday reported a fall in
operating profits to Dollars 348.5m in the first three months of 1993, from

changes, dipped to Dollars 194.1m from Dollars 215.1m.
Anheuser said that economic weakness in certain areas such as California and

GENERAL MOTORS Acceptance Corporation saw first-quarter earnings decline to
Dollars 284.1m from Dollars 349.1m in the same period last year, excluding a
Dollars 282.6m charge from an accounting change for post-retirement benefits
for employees, Reuter reports.
First-quarter results 'reflected actions previously taken to maintain a
strong liquidity posture,' Mr Robert O'Connell, GMAC chairman, said.
Profits from financing operations, including mortgage results, totalled
Dollars 250.3m, compared with Dollars 289.2m in 1992, excluding a Dollars
232.8m accounting charge.
Lower earnings were due to reduced interest rate margins, lower asset levels
and reduced gains from receivable sales, partially offset by improved loss
trends and strong earnings from GMAC's international operations, GMAC said.
Insurance operations contributed Dollars 33.8m to 1993 earnings, down from
Dollars 59.9m, excluding a Dollars 49.8m accounting charge. The decrease was
due to unfavourable commercial lines underwriting results.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORANDA, the resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, was
pushed into a first-quarter loss by lower metal prices and a CDollars 30m
(USDollars 23.8m) loss from the recent sale of its stake in MacMillan
Bloedel, the west coast forestry company.
The net loss was CDollars 31m, or 25 cents a share, compared with earnings
of CDollars 17m, or 1 cent a share, a year earlier. Sales dipped to CDollars
1.29bn from CDollars 1.33bn.
Mr David Kerr, chief executive, painted a cautiously optimistic picture for
the rest of the year. Noranda will benefit from a recent surge in timber and
natural gas prices, and expects improved prices for paper. Mr Kerr said he
was also encouraged by the growing strength of the US recovery.
The mining and metals division turned from a CDollars 31m profit to a
CDollars 3m loss as a result of low zinc and nickel prices, and production
cutbacks to meet over-supplied markets.
Forest products recovered to a CDollars 16m profit from a loss of CDollars
7m, due to record lumber prices and improving newsprint markets. Pulp prices
remain in the doldrums, however, and are not expected to improve until 1994.
Noranda has disposed of several businesses in recent months to improve its
balance sheet and protect itself from the troubles in the rest of the
Bronfman group. The sale of the MacMillan Bloedel stake last February has
sliced long-term debt to CDollars 3bn from CDollars 4.9bn.
The sale of a Canadian oil and gas exploration company and a Texas vinyl
products plant raised another CDollars 119m in the first quarter.

IMASCO, the financial services, tobacco products and retailing group in
which BAT of the UK is the major shareholder, posted a 5 per cent gain in
first-quarter profit to CDollars 66.5m (USDollars 52.7m), or 50 cents a
share, although revenues eased 3 per cent to CDollars 2.3bn.
The biggest contribution came from Imperial Tobacco, with operating earnings
up 7 per cent to CDollars 99m from a year earlier. But tobacco products
revenues were off because of lower domestic cigarette sales.
Canada Trust, the financial services arm, recorded operating profit of
CDollars 59.2m, down 30 per cent because of the slack economy and the weak
property market.
Drug store retailing made an operating profit of CDollars 19.1m, up 2 per
cent.
Dofasco, Canada's biggest steel maker, lost CDollars 12.5m, or 24 cents a
share, in the first quarter, against a loss of CDollars 17.6m, or 31 cents,
a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 520m, compared with CDollars 461m,
with a 14 per cent gain in shipments to 852,000 tonnes.
However, Prices continued to be weak but Dofasco said they had strengthened
in April on sheet and galvanised products.

revenues by Dollars 400m'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, and Air Canada yesterday
predicted that the alliance between them could generate an additional
Dollars 400m of revenues annually, once a US-Canada 'open skies' deal is
agreed.
The forecast was made by Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada's chairman, at a joint
press conference in New York called to herald Continental's re-emergence
from bankruptcy on Tuesday night.
The last step in Continental's reorganisation was completed then, when the
carrier closed an investment agreement with Air Canada and Air Partners, a
Texan investment group. This deal gives the investors a 55 per cent stake in
Continental.
It is two-and-a-half years since Houston-based Continental sought protection
from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. Continental
went in and out of bankruptcy once before, during the early-1980s.
The increase in revenue, Mr Harris suggested, could translate into a Dollars
25m increase in earnings for Air Canada, and something similar for
Continental - although he did not elaborate.
The carriers stressed yesterday that, while they do not anticipate any
'common branding' at this stage (flying under common colours, for example),
they are seeking cost savings through shared maintainence services and
similar moves.
Air Canada has relocated gates at La Guardia airport in New York, to be
nearer Continental, and plans to move to the Continental terminal at Newark.
Air Canada is also launching two daily Toronto-Houston flights next month.
Houston is Continental's chief hub, and this is designed to improve customer
feed.
Meanwhile, Mr Harris said the company had made 'no final recommendation' to
directors on whether its 9 per cent stake in Ireland's GPA group should be
written down. However, it will do so ahead of the board meeting on May 6.
The larger US carriers have complained bitterly about 'unfair' competition
from bankrupt airlines, who get relief from debt payments and some other
operating advantages. Continental's emergence leaves America West and TWA as
two remaining US carriers operating under Chapter 11 protection.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Carbide, the US chemicals group, yesterday said it was more than a
year ahead of schedule in its efforts to cut annual costs by Dollars 400m.
Mr Robert Kennedy, Carbide's chairman, said: 'Our workforce is slashing
costs and improving operations so dramatically that we now expect to achieve
our goal during 1993.'
The company also posted essentially flat first-quarter 1993 earnings from
continuing operations of Dollars 42m, or 28 cents a share, on sales of
Dollars 1.19bn.
Although the results were in line with the company's forecasts, released
last week, shares in Union Carbide slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 19 1/2 at
mid-day in New York.
Analysts had predicted underlying profits of about 19 cents a share for the
group before Union Carbide said its earnings would exceed most estimates.
During the latest quarter, pre-tax earnings from continuing operations
slipped to Dollars 60m from Dollars 69m a year earlier.
In the first three months of 1992, the company had after-tax earnings of
Dollars 42m, or 27 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.19bn, excluding charges for
accounting changes.
Including the income from discontinued operations and after-tax charges for
accounting changes, Union Carbide posted a net loss of Dollars 286m, or
Dollars 2.28, a year ago.
Mr Kennedy said earnings were helped by improving volumes and cost
containment measures, which helped offset lower variable margins for many
products.
The company expects continued pressure on margins and general economic
weakness, especially in overseas markets.

period

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAYER yesterday became the second of Germany's 'big three' chemicals
companies to report a sharp downturn in profits for the first three months
of the year.
Bayer reported group pre-tax profits down by 21.2 per cent to DM640m
(Dollars 400m). It blamed a host of problems, including dire conditions in
industrial chemicals markets and the adverse effect of currency movements.
The results came a day after Hoechst reported a 28 per cent drop in
first-quarter profits. BASF reports today and is likely to show a similarly
depressed picture.
The fall in profits reflected difficult conditions in the domestic German
market and in Europe as a whole, in the chemicals business and the
pharmaceuticals sector which accounts for a larger proportion of profits
than at its big German competitors. Bayer's group turnover fell by 8 per
cent to DM10.3bn over the three-month period. It said half the decline was
due to lower volume sales, while the other half reflected pricing
difficulties and currency movements.
Turnover in the polymers business fell 12 per cent, in industrial chemicals
it fell by 11 per cent, and by 5 per cent in the organic chemicals sector.
Sales of agricultural products were 9 per cent down. In the pharmaceuticals
sector, which accounts for 22 per cent of total turnover but more than half
total profits in recent years, sales dropped 3 per cent in the quarter.
'Weak demand lead to an unsatisfactory level of capacity utilisation,' Bayer
said of the main chemicals business. Overcapacity in world markets combined
with fierce competition to make it impossible to implement price increases.
In Germany, group sales dropped by 15 per cent, to DM3.85bn from DM4.53bn.
Outside Germany, sales fell 2.6 per cent to DM6.49bn. The biggest fall in
turnover came in Italy, where sales dropped 22 per cent.
The results come after a year in which the group's total profits fell 16 per
cent to DM2.7bn. Looking ahead for the current year, Bayer said there were
no signs of any improvement in the economic situation in the second quarter,
concluding surprisingly that full-year profits would be down on 1992.
Bayer blamed the drop in pharmaceutical sales - which comes after several
years of unbroken growth in the sector - on the German government's
healthcare reforms which set price cuts and controls on prescriptions.
Separately yesterday, Federal Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry
(BPI) said that half the companies questioned in a recent poll had seen
sales fall by 30 to 50 per cent in the first quarter of the year.

However, unlike former IBM chairman and chief executive Mr John Akers, who

'Jack agreed last year to stay beyond his planned retirement date, and I'm

CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products narrowed its losses in the first quarter

The net loss was CDollars 64.8m (USDollars 51.8m), or Dollars 1.23 a share,
against a loss of Dollars 71.1m, or Dollars 1.47, a year earlier.
Sales were Dollars 450m, against Dollars 430m.
US newsprint prices east of the Rockies have gone up 10 per cent, but a

White paper prices are strengthening again in the second quarter but pulp

FORD MOTOR, the US automobile manufacturer, yesterday reported more than
doubled first-quarter earnings of Dollars 572m, due to improving results
from its North American vehicle operations and a strong performance by its
financial services business.
The company sounded a cautiously optimistic note for the year as whole,
saying that its new products and cost-reduction efforts should lead to
better operating results than in 1992, despite the slow US recovery from
recession and global economic weakness.
Ford's earnings of Dollars 572m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, compared with a
profit of Dollars 223m, or 36 cents a share, in the same period of last
year, excluding special accounting adjustments. Sales rose from Dollars
24.6bn to Dollars 26.8bn.
The company's automotive operations made Dollars 176m, compared with a
Dollars 26m loss a year ago. In the US, it earned Dollars 113m, compared
with a loss of Dollars 59m, which the company attributed to increased unit
volume.
Outside the US, its vehicle operations earned Dollars 63m, up from Dollars
33m a year ago, despite lower sales volume in Europe, which Ford said had
been more than offset by cost-cutting initiatives and improvements in other
foreign markets.
In the US, the company has been helped by a 1.6 percentage point gain in car
and light truck market share over the past year, to 25.7 per cent, at a time
when Japanese rivals have been losing share.
Profits have also been boosted by the fact that lower rebates are needed to
sell vehicles in the recovering US market. Ford spent an average of Dollars
875 on sales incentives in the first quarter, down from Dollars 1,000 a year
earlier.
The results received a strong boost from the financial services side, which
earned record profits of Dollars 396m, compared with Dollars 249m a year
ago, due mainly to reduced credit losses, increased volume and a gain on a
sale of receivables.
Mr Harold Poling, chairman, warned that for the US economic recovery to be
sustained, job creation and consumer confidence needed to improve.
Around the world, the company was still grappling with 'weak economies,
intense competition and excess industrial capacity, all of which make
improvement of financial results more difficult'.

SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, sank deeper into the
red in the first quarter due to weak demand from the European car industry
and further heavy losses from Ovako Steel.
The group's deficit after financial items rose to SKr355m (Dollars 48m) from
SKr34m, with sales rising marginally to SKr7.20bn from SKr7.16bn. However,
stripping out the effects of disposals and currency movements, sales were 9
per cent lower.
The group said its problems centred on the European market, which accounted
for 60 per cent of sales. The car market had been particularly difficult,
with a number of manufacturers reducing production or closing their
facilities. It noted that demand remained low in its two other main customer
segments, machinery industry and after-market.
A brighter picture emerged from North America and the Asia-Pacific region as
sales rose in all three customer areas in both markets.
The group noted it was continuing to cut staff, with 1,150 people losing
their jobs during the quarter. It was scaling back inventories with
production running at 5 per cent below sales levels.
Sales of rolling bearings and seals rose to SKr6.68bn from SKr5.95bn, but
the sector produced a loss of SKr250m, after a profit of SKr90m last year.
The group's other main operation, Ovako Steel, posted a SKr109m loss,
virtually unchanged on last year's SKr110m deficit, although sales slumped
in the face of weak demand to SKr724m from SKr954m.
Net financial expense rose sharply to SKr274m from SKr16m after being
aggravated by a SKr105m exchange loss on the parent company's convertible
ECU bonds.
The group is not giving a forecast for 1993, although it has indicated that
it expects to make another loss, following last year's SKr1.8bn deficit.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Handelsbanken on road to
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SVENSKA Handelsbanken yesterday showed strong evidence that it was on the
road to recovery when it announced a preliminary first-quarter profit of
more than SKr350m (Dollars 47.3m).
There were indications that Gota Bank, another Swedish bank, is past the
worst, although it reported a SKr1.4bn loss before state guarantees for the
period.
Handelsbanken said its result before credit losses rose 30 per cent to
SKr2.2bn, while credit losses fell 10 per cent to SKr1.8bn. It did not
provide comparative figures because it now reports on a quarterly basis,
rather than every four months. Further details will be provided when the
bank's interim report is published on May 11.
The figures confirmed the optimistic forecast which the bank gave in
February and suggested that, unlike its rivals, it will not need state
support to weather Sweden's banking crisis. Its A free shares rose SKr5.5 to
SKr89 yesterday, more than five times their SKr17 level last November.
Last year, the bank posted a SKr840m operating loss and suspended the
dividend on its ordinary shares after lending losses rose 150 per cent to
SKr8bn.
Gota Bank said its operating loss fell to SKr215m in the latest quarter from
SKr425m in the same 1992 period. Although the latest figure took into
account SKr1.17bn in state guarantees and SKr26m in financial insurance, it
was better than the SKr2.91bn loss in the first quarter of 1992.
The bank was taken over by the state last December, and in January received
a SKr10bn guarantee to ensure it continued to meet international capital
adequacy requirements.
Gota said credit losses in the first three months shrank to SKr1.22bn from
SKr3.13bn in the same 1992 period. It also predicted that credit losses for
the whole year would amount to SKr4.9bn, which is substantially lower than
last year's SKr12.5bn.
However, the volume of non-performing loans, before provisions, amounted to
SKr24.68bn at the end of March, which is SKr2.25bn higher than the year-end
total. Operating revenue fell in the quarter to SKr707m from SKr1.19bn.
The bank's capital ratio at the end of March had fallen to 8.1 per cent,
just clearing the 8 per cent minimum level, although SKr2.75bn of the state
guarantee remained unutilised.
Mr Anders Klien, banking analyst at Enskilda Securities in Stockholm, said:
'Handelsbanken is a special case and it will make a profit this year. The
banking sector as a whole will still make a loss although its position will
improve from last year.'

FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: European operations fall into
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FORD'S European automotive operations, including Jaguar, the UK luxury car
maker, registered a net loss of Dollars 82m in the first quarter of 1993
compared with a net profit of Dollars 84m in the corresponding period a year
ago.
Excluding Jaguar, Ford of Europe net profits plunged by 92.3 per cent to
only Dollars 19m in the first quarter from Dollars 246m a year earlier,
chiefly under the the impact of a precipitous fall in new car sales in west
Europe.
New car demand in west Europe in the first three months fell by around 17
per cent to 3.06m, according to industry estimates. Ford forecast yesterday
a fall of 12 per cent for the full year.
Ford vehicle sales in Europe, at 436,122 in the first quarter, were 13 per
cent lower than a year ago.
Ford said that its European financial performance had also been hit by
unfavourable exchange rate movements - in particular between the lira and
the D-Mark - which had reduced pre-tax profits by around Dollars 100m, and
by heavy product launch costs for the new Mondeo family car, which has
replaced the Sierra.
The US carmaker said that Jaguar had reduced its losses in the first quarter
by 40 per cent to Dollars 56m from Dollars 93m a year ago due to increased
sales volumes, in particular in the US.
Jaguar sales rose by 16 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter to 6,374,
helped by a 29 per cent rise in the US to 2,561, and increases in Germany,
Switzerland, the UK and Belgium.
Ford's European automotive operations also took a charge in the first
quarter of Dollars 45m for interest and goodwill write-offs arising from its
1989 takeover of Jaguar.
Ford, which suffered a record loss last year of Dollars 1.3bn on its
European automotive operations, said that its objective was to break even
this year, excluding Jaguar. This target would be difficult to achieve,
however, if sales continued to fall steeply.

FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Taskforce may be Hoover's last
stand - A look at Maytag's emergency review of the UK group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY three months ago, the British government was trumpeting the decision by
Hoover to close a factory in Dijon, France, and switch production to
Scotland as proof of the UK's international competitiveness and its
attractions as a manufacturing base.
Today, that crowing looks decidedly premature. Not only are there doubts
about whether the production shift from France will take place, but
according to Hoover's top management, the survival of the entire business is
at stake - largely because of the poor performance of its UK operations.
Mr Gerald Kamman, president of Hoover Europe and UK managing director, said
yesterday that a special taskforce dispatched by Maytag, Hoover's US parent,
was conducting an emergency review of the business in an effort to cut costs
and restore profitability.
Though the review will take three weeks to complete, Mr Kamman said
redundancies were unavoidable and plant closures possible. He said he did
not feel bound by Hoover's earlier commitment to move production to
Scotland, for which the UK government has pledged Pounds 2.5m (Dollars
3.85m) in assistance.
When Mr Kamman arrived in Britain a month ago, it was widely assumed that
his appointment was prompted by Hoover's free flights promotional fiasco.
That incident led to the dismissal of Mr William Foust, Mr Kamman's
predecessor, the departure of two other senior executives and a Dollars 30m
charge against Maytag's first-quarter earnings.
It is now clear that an even more pressing reason was the steep
deterioration in the performance of Hoover Europe, which last year lost
Dollars 67.1m after a Dollars 55m restructuring charge on sales of Dollars
501.9m. Mr Kamman said there had been little improvement in operating
results this year, and that a continuing loss in the UK had been forecast in
the budget drawn up by Hoover's previous management.
Tackling Hoover's problems has become increasingly urgent for Maytag, the
fourth-largest US domestic appliance manufacturer, which plunged into a
Dollars 315m loss last year on sales of Dollars 3bn. Largely because of the
special Hoover provision, Maytag lost a further Dollars 10.5m in the first
quarter of this year.
For most of its 86-year history, the Iowa-based company has been renowned
for cautious management and home-spun values. But in the mid-1980s it was
bitten by the takeover bug and spent Dollars 1.8bn to acquire Magic Chef, a
US kitchen appliance company, and Chicago Pacific, which had owned Hoover
since 1985.
However, the moves - which took Maytag out of the US for the first time -
proved over ambitious. Beset by management problems in its acquisitions,
saddled with heavy debt and smitten by recession, the company has spent much
of the 1990s struggling to keep its head above water.
Turning Hoover around is crucial to Maytag's future. But on past form, it
will not be easy. Hoover's UK operations, which date back to 1932, have a
chequered history.
The company got into difficulties in the 1970s, but returned to profit in
the early 1980s after cutting costs, shedding staff, modernising production
and launching products. But by 1989, soon after it was bought by Maytag, it
was in trouble again and had to dismiss almost 1,000 staff.
The following year, Maytag dispatched Mr Foust and a special taskforce to
Britain with a remit to bring about its 'rebirth, rejuvenation, stability
and return to profitability'.
Two years later, investments of Pounds 20m were announced in Hoover's two UK
plants, at Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, and Cambuslang, Scotland, in an
effort to make it a pan-European producer. Last January, the company decided
to transfer vacuum cleaner production from Dijon to Cambuslang.
However, Mr Kamman believes further painful surgery is needed. Though some
parts of Hoover Europe are operating satisfactorily, others are afflicted by
serious and widespread problems.
Mr Kamman said two of Hoover's three European plants, in Dijon and
Cambuslang, were close to profitability. However, there had been a
substantial fall in French sales since the political controversy over the
production transfer erupted.
In the UK, sales had held up quite well, after receiving a lift from the
free flights promotion. However, the company was losing money on some
product lines while overheads in several areas were too high.
Mr Kamman said that some 'pieces of the company' might have to be closed
down completely. He said that job cuts were likely to fall more heavily on
indirect employees than on those on the factory floor.
It will probably take until the end of the year to draw up a complete
recovery plan - and longer before it is clear whether it is working. But
judging by Hoover's troubled past, and Mr Kamman's grim analysis of its
present problems, this could be the company's last chance.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Trinity Holdings makes Pounds 7.07m -
Maiden full-year performance slightly above flotation forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRINITY HOLDINGS, the specialist vehicle manufacturer which came to the
market last October, produced maiden pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.07m for the
year to end-January.
The outcome - slightly higher than the flotation forecast - compared with
Pounds 3.39m last time.
Earnings per share of 10.7p, against 5.2p, provided ample cover for the
dividend which, as promised, is 1.5p.
Turnover rose 34 per cent to Pounds 109.9m and is expected to rise again in
the current year on the back of, as Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman, said, 'a
record order book and with increased registrations in our major markets.'
Although the devaluation of sterling has made Trinity more competitive
overseas - over a third of its output is exported - the rise in turnover
this year will be less marked than during the previous 12 months.
The turnover total included a first-time contribution of Pounds 12.6m from
the acquisitions of Reliance Mercury Vehicles and Carmichael International,
respectively producers of specialist tractors for use in docks and airports
and specialist fire fighting vehicles.
Mr Hollyhead said that Dennis Specialist Vehicles, which is both the largest
division in the group and the leader of the UK bus market, is budgeting for
further growth but not at the same rate as in 1992-93 when sales climbed to
Pounds 48.7m against Pounds 36.9m.
Trinity had cash of Pounds 5.1m at the year-end, the flotation having
cleared borrowings and redeemed the group's preference shares. Of the Pounds
1.42m interest charges, Pounds 1.3m was incurred before flotation.
With this background, the group is looking both to finance organic growth
and to expand through further acquisition.
Noting that opportunities had been examined in both the UK and abroad, Mr
Hollyhead said: 'We are not averse to an overseas manufacturing base,' but
added that Trinity is not prepared to push gearing above 30 per cent.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Stanhope Properties Pounds 15.4m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANHOPE Properties, the joint owner of the Broadgate complex in the City of
London, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 15.4m for the first
half of 1992, marginally up on the comparative Pounds 15.3m which included
Pounds 1.19m abortive merger costs.
The company also announced that Mr Paul Reichmann, head of Olympia &amp; York,
the crippled property developer that owned a third of Stanhope, had resigned
from the board.
Stanhope said its recovery was largely dependent upon increasing values at
Broadgate, which were likely to benefit from the rising demand from tenants
and investors that stemmed from the fall in interest rates and sterling. 'If
the estimates of future growth projected by leading surveyors are met, the
Broadgate assets will be among the first to benefit,' it said.
However, its optimism was tempered by the difficulties in letting its
unoccupied buildings, including Ludgate, the office complex on the western
edge of the City. 'It would be prudent at this stage to envisage a further
net reduction in the value of the group's property assets,' it said.
Stanhope, which is part of the London regeneration Consortium redeveloping
land around King's Cross, said it would receive compensation if the
government chose to make St Pancras, rather than Kings Cross, the terminus
for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. The compensation could be worth several
million pounds, it said.
Turnover rose from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 27.5m. Net interest payable surged
from Pounds 7.85m to Pounds 11.6m, partly as a result of higher average
borrowings and partly of a changed accounting policy. Losses per share
increased from 9.21p to 9.26p.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Administrators find buyer for Platt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATT SACO Lowell, the Accrington-based textile machinery company which was
put into administration in February, has been sold as a going concern to a
consortium led by Mr James Eke, its chairman.
Platt makes spinning and fibre preparation equipment and is one of the
world's biggest textile machine producers. Its turnover has dropped from
Pounds 16.6m in 1988 to Pounds 10m last year following a worldwide slump in
orders.
The company has been run by a team of administrators from KPMG Peat Marwick
for the past two months. In March, 120 people were sacked as part of a
survival plan, leaving a workforce of just over 70.
Mr Eke's consortium has bought for undisclosed terms the business, plant,
machines and stocks, together with a licence which will allow it to continue
operating on its present 750,000 sq ft Globe Works site in Accrington for
the next six months.
However, KPMG said negotiations for the sale of the building were
continuing, and it understood that a deal was imminent.
A meeting of some of Platt's 1,000 creditors on April 1 had given the joint
administrators, Mr Mike Seery and Mr Peter Terry, four weeks to attempt to
sell the business and assets of the company, which has debts estimated at
Pounds 5m.
Mr Seery said: 'It is difficult to sell even businesses with international
reputations as is currently evidenced by a number of well-publicised cases
in Lancashire alone.
'Therefore we are delighted in this particular climate to have been able to
sell Platts as a going concern in a relatively short time and in a way which
will realise a significant dividend for the company's creditors.'
For the past 11 years Platt was owned by the South Carolina company John D
Hollingsworth on Wheels, which bought it from the receivers of Stone-Platt
Industries.

bid

<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the tour operator, is keen to embark on another hostile bid after
its failure to acquire its rival, Owners Abroad, earlier this year, Mr David
Crossland, Airtours chairman, said yesterday.
Speaking to the Association of British Travel Agents' convention in Majorca,
he said that when Owners Abroad published its next full-year results its
shareholders would be better able to judge whether or not Airtours had
offered a fair price.
Mr Crossland said he had learned from the Owners Abroad bid: 'The one thing
I did learn about the City is that there are some people there who are like
rhinoceroses. They are thick-skinned and they charge a lot.' He added,
however: 'I'd love to do it again.'
He said the bid for Owners Abroad had failed for three reasons. The first
was the success of Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, in persuading
LTU, the German company which owns Thomas Cook, to make a financial
commitment to ensuring that Airtours was defeated.
The second was that the Takeover Panel had applied the rules relating to
concert parties more vigorously to Airtours than to Owners Abroad.
The third was the defection of a previously-supportive institutional
investor to Owners Abroad. This is believed to have been a reference to
Gartmore, the investment manager.
Mr Crossland said that if Airtours looked outside the UK for future
acquisitions, Germany would be his favoured market.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Haemocell loss deepens to Pounds 0.87m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Expenditure related to international product approval and launch programmes
resulted in increased pre-tax losses at Haemocell in the first six months,
but the USM-quoted company said 'meaningful progress' was expected in the
second half.
On sales of Pounds 542,000 (Pounds 305,000) the pre-tax deficit rose 11 per
cent to Pounds 868,000 (Pounds 783,000). Losses per share were unchanged at
4.3p.
At the end of last year a Pounds 6.1m rights issue was launched following US
approval of the S350 autotransfusion system.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHILOH, the spinning group which also makes health care products and
protective clothing, reported a 50 per cent jump in pre-tax profits for the
year to March 27.
Profit increased to Pounds 757,000, against Pounds 503,000, on turnover
ahead at Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 23.5m). Earnings per share worked through to
8.74p (5.82p) and the final dividend is 2.025p for a total of 2.9p (2.75p).
Directors said a strong performance from medical healthcare in the second
half and the benefits of cost reduction in the spinning side contributed to
the improved outcome.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Eadie recovery and purchase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A RETURN to trading profits and the dividend list in 1992, improved
prospects for the current year and expansion of its wheelchair business for
Pounds 1.12m cash were announced yesterday by Eadie Holdings, the specialist
engineer.
It is buying the business and certain assets of the mobility products
division, trading as Vessa, from BTR Industries. Some Pounds 600,000 of the
consideration will be raised by the placing of 2.54m shares at 24 1/2 p
each, underwritten by Allied Provincial Securities.
Group turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 20.1m), operating
profit was up 69 per cent at Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 720,000), and the pre-tax
balance worked through at Pounds 806,000, compared with Pounds 1.24m in 1991
which included gains on disposals and reorganisation of Pounds 1.3m.
The acquisitions - MCM in January and Cargo Controls in June - performed up
to expectations.
Earnings per share were 1.42p (losses 0.22p pre-exceptionals). The dividend
is 0.5p and is the first since 1989.
The improved trading of the latter part of the year has continued into 1993
and orders in most businesses were at higher levels.
Improved performance from existing divisions was expected.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MERLIN International Properties made further progress in eliminating trading
losses in the six months to December 31.
At the pre-tax level losses fell to Pounds 652,000, against Pounds 2.69m.
The outcome was achieved on turnover of Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 1.58m). Net
exceptional costs increased from Pounds 61,000 to Pounds 390,000 - which
represented the full cost of defending the compulsory purchase order on the
group's Manchester project.
Mr Peter Jevans, chairman, said there was evidence that market conditions
had ceased to worsen.
The company's attempts to achieve a financial restructuring and a relisting
had, as yet, borne no fruit, Mr Jevans said, but the directors were
confident of achieving a satisfactory end to this stalemate.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Improvement in property values seen by
Brixton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIXTON Estate, the seventh largest property company in the UK, produced a 4
per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 28.5m for 1992.
Its net asset value per share fell by 19 per cent, from 226p to 183p.
Mr Harry Axton, the chairman who will retire this summer, was encouraged by
the number of inquiries from potential tenants. 'I think that by the end of
the year we will start to see an improvement in values,' he said.
Value of the portfolio at the year-end dropped from Pounds 724m to Pounds
679m. The portfolio is split between the UK, which accounts for 83 per cent
of the total, and Belgium, Germany and Australia, representing the
remainder.
The UK portfolio, half of which is industrial property, is concentrated on
the western half of the home counties and, in London, at Holborn and in the
City.
Net rental income rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 55.2m (Pounds 50.7m).
Interest costs increased to Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 20.8m); another Pounds
11.6m of interest was capitalised.
The proportion of empty property in the portfolio increased marginally to
7.5 per cent, reflecting the rising number of UK tenants experiencing
financial difficulties. In the year the company leased 486,000 sq ft of
space, of which over 200,000 sq ft came from the development programme. A
further 140,000 sq ft was under offer.
A provision of Pounds 16.5m was made against the value of the development
properties this time.
The company has sites with planning permission for 600,000 sq ft of space.
'As soon as there is a clear trend in the right direction we shall restart
our development programme,' said Mr Axton.
Earnings per share increased from 12.64p to 13.86p. A final dividend of
5.35p makes 8.35p for the year (8.1p).
COMMENT
Brixton Estate is one of few property companies to survive the crash with
its reputation intact. Its prudent management and successful development
programme has given it a loyal following in the City, which in recent months
has placed the shares on a premium to net asset value. But yesterday's
results, with their larger-than-expected fall in property values,
disappointed investors, and the shares were marked down 8p to 177p. With
gearing of 114 per cent the company has little room to exploit opportunities
in the market, unless it sells property, raises new money or benefits from a
recovery in values. The potential for dividend growth is limited; if
capitalised interest is stripped out, the dividend would not currently be
covered. Assuming a net asset value of 170p for 1993, the shares are on a
narrow discount of 4 per cent. They are probably fully priced until the
company gets more fire-power or the recovery in the property market becomes
more convincing.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fasteners side puts Reece in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED demand in its fasteners division left Reece, the cycles group which
also makes door panels and machinery for the ceramic industry, with pre-tax
losses of Pounds 662,000 for 1992 compared with restated pre-tax profits of
Pounds 373,000.
Operating losses from fasteners were Pounds 691,000 (Pounds 215,000
profits). Door panels suffered a Pounds 12,000 loss (Pounds 127,000 profits)
while profits in the cycle division fell by Pounds 78,000 to Pounds 258,000.
However, the company said that because of the continued growth of Probike
cycle sales, new warehousing facilities had been required and part of the
Solihull fastener depot had been released for that purpose.
Reece added that it had responded to the harsher economic environment by
cutting costs, rationalising operations and reducing working capital and
capital expenditure. Stock levels in fasteners had been reviewed and
additional provisions made where necessary.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 14.2m). Losses per share worked
through at 0.52p (0.43p earnings) and there is no dividend.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Trimmed CSI Pounds 115m in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANNON STREET Investments, the struggling mini-conglomerate, yesterday
reported a jump in pre-tax losses from Pounds 34.3m to Pounds 115.5m for the
year to January 2, reflecting trading losses coupled with substantial
goodwill write-offs and losses on the sale and closure of businesses.
However, the group's new management, which has been struggling to preserve
operating cash flows through the sale and closure of a string of
subsidiaries, said 'the cash drain has been stopped and the group's
indebtedness and interest charge reduced significantly.'
Although shareholders' funds fell by more than a third to Pounds 17.8m, Mr
Tom Long, chairman, said the group's principal banker, the Bank of Scotland,
remained supportive. He expressed confidence that 1992 marked a turning
point and that Cannon Street would return to profit this year, helped by the
installation of 'proper financial controls.'
Mr Long expressed satisfaction that the immediate task of stabilising the
group had been achieved and that borrowings had been brought down to
'manageble levels,' although they still represented gearing of more than 100
per cent. He said management attention was now focused on 'improving
profitability and increasing the return to shareholders.'
The hotel and leisure assets and the electronics distribution businesses,
which together have sales of about Pounds 135m, are seen as the main
opportunities for the slimmed down group.
Trading losses increased to Pounds 8.44m (Pounds 1.57m) on turnover which
fell to Pounds 240m (Pounds 295m). Mr David Smith, Cannon Street's new chief
executive who had headed the troubled buy-out of Isosceles, the retailer,
blamed the higher losses on the depressed economic conditions and the poor
performance of several subsidiaries, some of which had been closed or sold.
He said the remaining subsidiaries, loosely grouped together in three main
divisions, were now trading profitably.
The group has adopted new accounting standards including FRS 2 and FRS 3
resulting in a number of changes including the restatement of some 1991
figures.
Following a 'comprehensive appraisal of all investments', Pounds 57.4m of
goodwill was written off against the profit and loss account last year.
There was also a Pounds 42.5m loss on the sale and closure of operations,
because proceeds from disposals were below historic carrying values. These
charges compare with a Pounds 20m fixed asset write-down recorded in the
restated 1991 results.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 7.04m (Pounds 12.4m) reflecting a reduction
in bank borrowings from Pounds 75.6m to Pounds 29.6m achieved through
disposals, including flotation of the Avonside housebuilding group, and more
effective cash management. Mr Long said borrowings stood at well under
Pounds 20m.
After a tax credit of Pounds 755,000 (Pounds 155,000 charge) and payment of
Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 4.16m) in convertible preference share dividends, losses
per share were 114.11p (37.68p). No ordinary dividend is being paid compared
with 3.3p in 1991.
Cannon Street sold PM Tamson, a Dutch subsidiary, for Fl 17m (Pounds 6.07m).
The incorrect currency was reported yesterday.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: MAM disposes of Jupiter stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY Asset Management has disposed of its controversial 8m share stake in
fund manager Jupiter Tyndall, Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman, said yesterday.
MAM wrote off nearly Pounds 3m in its 1992 accounts for the stake, which
represents just under 25 per cent of Jupiter Tyndall's total share capital.
'The Jupiter results have come out, the share price has risen and we felt we
could dispose of the stake profitably,' Mr Stevenson said.
The current year's accounts will include a gain of more than Pounds 1m,
reflecting the profit.
The stake was placed with several clients of MAM's brokers, Smith NewCourt.
Last year, Jupiter Tyndall recruited MAM's star fund manager, Mr Leonard
Licht, as its deputy chairman and chief investment officer.
His recruitment package included a signing on fee and other costs totalling
Pounds 1.8m. Mr Licht will receive an annual salary of Pounds 600,000 and
stock options said to be linked to the amount of business he brings in.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark dissenters reveal plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of shareholders in C&amp;J Clark, opposed to the Pounds 184m bid from
Berisford International recommended by a majority of the private shoe
group's board, yesterday outlined its alternative to the takeover. The plan
was sent to shareholders in a letter.
The dissident group, which has adopted the acronym Shoes, said its plan was
for a shareholder council and a flotation of the company. This would lead to
'future stability', Mr Hugh Pym of Shoes said, advising shareholders to turn
down the offer.
Terms from Berisford, the property and trading group, comprise 213p in cash
or securities plus 26p of deferred cash from the planned sale of properties.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, this week completed the twice yearly
valuation of Clark shares putting a price on them of 100p.
The next few days will be crucial in the Clark saga as the various factions
put their cases to meetings with shareholders and employees, culminating in
an extraordinary meeting on May 7 when Berisford's proposals will be put to
a vote.
Mr Alan Mackay, finance director of Clark, said the Shoes letter was 'not
helpful at all and I do not think it (the plan) is deliverable.'
A previous attempt to float Clark failed when insufficient shareholders
voted in favour of necessary changes to the company's pre-emptive rights
structure.
Mr Mackay said the seven directors who recommended the bid 'feel the offer
from Berisford has the merit of certainty and solves a number of problems
which have been bedevilling Clarks for years.'
Setting up a shareholder council, representing family members, would lead to
a two-tier board. Mr Mackay said this 'does not appear to represent a simple
solution'.
Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive of Berisford, said that a shareholder
council would tend to increase the conflict at Clark, not reduce it.
He said Shoes' commitment to a flotation was not something Shoes, none of
whose representatives are officers of the company, could deliver and it
revealed a lack of knowledge of the Stock Exchange rule book.
Shoes argued that the shares are worth 278p - the net asset value in the
latest balance sheet.
Mr Bowkett asked 'is Mr Pym making an offer of 278p? Is he promising 278p?
It is all rather misleading.'

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat directors invested in related
hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR DIRECTORS of Queens Moat Houses, the suspended hotel company, were
private investors in a project which was backed partly by Queens Moat.
The four are shareholders in Ashford International Hotel, a Business
Expansion Scheme set up in 1988 to develop a hotel of the same name in Kent.
Queens Moat provided management services and financial support to Ashford
and was expected to buy the company when the scheme expired.
Following mounting losses due to recession and other troubles, Queens Moat
decided not to buy the hotel when the scheme lapsed in March.
According to filings at Companies House, Mr Gerald Bell, group operations
director at Queens Moat, holds 40,000 shares in Ashford, equal to 0.5 per
cent. Mr Martin Marcus and Mr David Hersey, who were suspended from Queens
Moat when its financial problems appeared, hold 25,000 and 5,000 shares
respectively. Mr Robert Abson, director of UK operations, holds 5,000
shares.
These shareholdings were not revealed in Queens Moat's accounts.
In Ashford's accounts, Mr Marcus and Mr Hersey appear as directors and
shareholders of both companies, but neither Mr Bell nor Mr Abson is
identified as a Queens Moat director.
Mr Andrew Coppel, appointed earlier this month as a consultant to Queens
Moat, said the shareholdings were not disclosed publicly because they were
insubstantial. 'I have no reason to believe these shareholdings had any
influence on the decision to invest or manage the hotel,' he said.
The Ashford scheme was set up by Capital Ventures, which had earlier
introduced Queens Moat to two other BES hotels in Harrogate and Chester.
The Chester Hotel was bought by Queens Moat in April last year for Pounds
9.5m, allowing BES shareholders to at least double their money.
Six Queens Moat directors, including Mr John Bairstow, the chairman, held
shares in the Chester project.
According to one City analyst, 'eyebrows were raised' when these
shareholdings were revealed after the purchase was completed.
Queens Moat managed the Ashford hotel from its opening in 1990 and received
management fees from Ashford of nearly Pounds 82,000 in 1991.
Queens Moat owned Pounds 2.5m of Ashford's preference shares and extended an
unsecured loan of Pounds 1m to the company.
In Ashford's accounts, there was a statement of financial support from
Queens Moat, which expires at the end of June.
With Queens Moat facing a financial restructuring, Ashford's future is
unclear. However, Queens Moat's bankers are unlikely to withdraw support now
that the Government has approved construction of the Ashford international
station for the channel link.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Murray Split Capital shows total return of
32%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE SIX months ended February 28 assets of Murray Split Capital Trust
increased 28 per cent for a total return, including dividends, of 32 per
cent.
That compared with a return of 30 per cent from the FT-A All-Share Index.
At the end of February net asset value per zero dividend preference share
was 118.8p (112.6p), per income share 50.2p (51.2p) and per capital share
172.2p (94.6p).
The performance reflected the strength of the high yield shares since
interest rates began to fall last autumn.
Total revenue was Pounds 580,000 in the six months and earnings worked
through at 4.23p. The second quarterly dividend is 2.65p to make 5.3p to
date. It is intended to maintain the annualised rate at 10.6p.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Plateau gets holders' assurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATEAU MINING, a natural resources group which is now a shell, has been
assured by shareholders owning more than 47 per cent of the company that
they do not intend to accept the Pounds 1.2m hostile bid from Kingstream
Resources, a small Australian exploration company.
Mr Donald Driver, chairman of Plateau, said: 'It is most unusual for
shareholders to come out against a bid at such an early stage. Major
shareholders have made their view clear about the Kingstream offer and other
shareholders will no doubt take the same view. Accordingly, Kingstream
should now give up gracefully and save everybody further costs.'
Kingstream launched its bid on April 13. Its offer of one share for every
eight Plateau values the latter at 2.62p, compared with the recent
suspension price of 3p.
Kingstream is reconsidering the terms after Plateau this week announced the
sale of a royalty interest to Delta Gold, an Australian group, for shares
worth more than Pounds 1.5m.
Guinness Mahon, adviser to Plateau, said the shell company had more than
Pounds 1m of net cash, as well as the Delta holding.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Keswick set for Trafalgar chair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE is to hold a special board meeting next Tuesday which is
expected to ratify a number of changes, including the appointment of Mr
Simon Keswick as chairman.
The directors of the UK construction, engineering and property group decided
to delay a vote on the appointments until the day before the announcement of
its interim results on Wednesday.
Mr Keswick, who is to take over the helm from Mr Alan Clements, is also
chairman of Hongkong Land. The Jardine Matheson-controlled property company
has a 25.1 per cent stake.
Mr Clements is expected to stay on as a non-executive director, replacing
Sir Eric Parker as deputy chairman.
Sir Eric, the former chief executive, had agreed to retire in June when he
will be 60.
Trafalgar has also lined up a finance director to replace Mr John Ansdell.
There has been a question mark over Mr Ansdell since the Financial Review
Panel forced the group to take the 1991 property write-downs through the
profit and loss account and not through reserves.
Mr Allan Gormly, Trafalgar's chief executive, with the help of the recently
appointed independent non-executive director Sir Archibald Forster, former
chief executive of Esso UK, has been seeking non-executives to beef up the
board.
Mr Tony Ryan, chairman and founder of GPA, the aircraft leasing group which
is trying to restructure its debts, is expected to resign as a non-executive
director.
It is believed that Mr Keswick will decide to replace Kleinwort Benson with
Robert Fleming as the group's principal merchant bank adviser.
The changes are likely to be seen as Hongkong tightening its grip. Two of
its directors, Mr Rodney Leach and Sir Charles Powell, have already been
appointed non-executive directors of Trafalgar.
However, a financier close to the group said that Mr Gormly was fully behind
the proposed changes.

FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Cowie acquires Keep Trust - Pounds 39.5m
motor deal takes group to fifth position in UK league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T COWIE, the motor trading, leasing and bus and coach group, yesterday
announced an agreed Pounds 39.5m deal to buy Keep Trust, a motor dealer,
from Fitzwilton, the Irish group headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly.
Fitzwilton, which last October bought a stake in Wellworth, the Northern
Ireland food retail chain, said it wanted to refocus its business on to food
and to raise cash to give flexibility. It yesterday reported a pre-tax loss
of IPounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.62m) for 1992, compared with a profit of IPounds
231,000, after exceptional costs of IPounds 1.89m (IPounds 1.54m).
Below-the-line there was a IPounds 25.3m extraordinary loss on the sale of
Keep.
Cowie is raising the Pounds 28.6m purchase cost through a placing of shares
at 212p, with a 1-for-9.0948 clawback offer for shareholders, and taking on
Pounds 10.9m of Keep's debt. Cowie's shares were steady at 230p yesterday;
Fitzwilton's fell 2p to 48p.
The deal will give Cowie fifth position in the UK motor distribution league,
with Keep's 18 dealerships taking its total to 42.
However, it is unlikely to be satisfied with this number. Mr Gordon Hodgson,
chief executive, said 'we are still an acquisitive company', although
acquisitions could come in any of its activities.
Asked if Cowie might rebid for Henlys Group, after its Pounds 32m offer
failed last September, he said his company would 'keep all its options
open'. Cowie retains a 9.9 per cent stake in Henlys, whose shares have
doubled from the 60p they are valued at in Cowie's accounts.
Mr Hodgson said Cowie started talking to Fitzwilton within days of the bid
for Henlys failing.
He said the acquisition of Keep would bring benefits from putting the
networks together, such as introducing Cowie's management systems into the
Keep dealerships, selling more of its ex-hire cars through them and
introducing its instalment credit, service and warranty packages.
'We have the management skills to generate far better profitability out of
those dealerships', he said. Also, Keep has two Nissan franchises giving
Cowie access to the marque for its leasing business.
Keep's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 1.2m in 1992,
Fitzwilton said, but are expected to recover this year. Mr Hodgson said that
if Keep meets Fitzwilton's internal budgets in 1993, the deal would not
dilute Cowie's earnings.
Cowie will have nine Ford dealerships, one more than Ford usually allows
under its present agreements, which could eventually result in a disposal.
Fitzwilton's results showed a decline in turnover from IPounds 453.2m to
IPounds 444.2m, including Pounds 193m (Pounds 186m) from Keep, and trading
profits slightly down at IPounds 7.2m (IPounds 7.4m). Interest charges rose
to IPounds 7m (IPounds 5.6m).
Mr Patrick Dowling, finance director, said the exceptional charges related
to the loss of business and redundancy costs because of the turmoil in the
currency markets last autumn, which disrupted exports from Ireland to the
UK.
He said the 42 per cent Wellworth stake contributed IPounds 1.2m after
interest in the two months it was owned.
Losses per share were 1.87p (0.63p). The final dividend is held at 2p for an
unchanged total of 3.5p.
Henlys annual meeting heard that profits in the first quarter were
'significantly ahead' thanks in part to itscost reduction programmes. The
shares rose 2p to 125p.

FT  29 APR 93 / Eastman Kodak shares fall as new chief financial officer
quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Eastman Kodak, the US film products group, dropped 9 per cent
yesterday following the announcement that Mr Christopher Steffen, the
company's new chief financial officer, had resigned after only 11 weeks
because of a management disagreement.
Mr Steffen, formerly chief financial officer of Honeywell, came to Kodak
with a reputation for turning around poorly-performing businesses and the
company's shares had risen strongly following his appointment on hopes he
would improve its lacklustre earnings record.
Mr Kay Whitmore, Kodak's chairman, said Mr Steffen had been a 'positive and
provocative contributor to our thinking'. He had left the company 'not
because we disagreed on what needs to change, but because we could not agree
on the process for making that change happen'.
Mr Steffen, 51, said only that 'the company and I disagreed on the approach
to solving its problems'. Wall Street speculated that he might now be
approached by International Business Machines, whose new chief executive, Mr
Lou Gerstner, is looking for a new chief financial officer.
Mr Whitmore has a reputation for approaching change with great caution, and
with an intense dislike of redundancies, while Mr Steffen has a history of a
tough, rapid action to improve a company's performance.
There had been hints that Mr Steffen wished to play a more central role in
restructuring Kodak than Mr Whitmore was prepared to let him. The
resignation intensifies the pressure on Mr Whitmore to shake up the
conservative company.
Wall Street analysts expressed surprise and dismay at Mr Steffen's departure
and Kodak's shares dropped Dollars 4 7/8 to close on the New York Stock
Exchange at Dollars 47 1/2 .
The group said the resignation was unconnected with yesterday's announcement
by Kodak of first quarter earnings of Dollars 149m, or 46 cents a share,
before accounting changes, compared with the Dollars 145m, or 45 cents a
share, recorded in the same period of last year. Sales totalled Dollars
4.44bn, up from Dollars 4.41bn.
A change in methods of accounting for retirees health benefits turned the
profits for the latest quarter into a net loss of Dollars 1.88bn, or Dollars
5.75 a share.

FT  29 APR 93 / Eagle Star man joins Bermuda reinsurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL BUTT, former chief executive of Eagle Star, the UK insurer, is to
become vice-chairman of Mid-Ocean, the recently formed Bermuda-based
catastrophe reinsurer. His appointment marks a strengthening of management
resources at Mid-Ocean, which has grown rapidly since its formation late
last year and comes amid signs of increasing investor interest in the
high-risk catastrophe reinsurance market.
Shrinkage of capacity and rapidly increasing rates have increased prospects
for profitability in a market which has recently suffered heavy losses.
Earlier this week it emerged that Mr John Head, the Manhattan-based
financier, was aiming to raise Dollars 100m (Pounds 64m) to form a London
reinsurance company.
The brighter outlook for the reinsurance market will be an important selling
point for Lloyd's of London, which will announce today how it intends to
attract corporate investors to the market.
Mr Butt is the only insurance executive to have lost his job as a result of
the industry's exposure to mortgage indemnity insurances. He spent just over
a year with Phoenix Securities, the corporate finance boutique, advising on
mergers and acquisitions in the insurance industry. At Mid-Ocean he will
play a prominent executive role, alongside Mr Ian Heap, the group's
president. Based in Bermuda, he will have responsibility for administration
and worldwide marketing.
Launched with capital of Dollars 400m last October by Marsh McLennan, the
New York-based insurance broker, and JP Morgan, the merchant bank, Mid-Ocean
has already earned more than Dollars 50m in premium income and could exceed
the Dollars 200m target set for its first year.
Mr Butt says he believes the growth of the Bermudan market will help rather
than hinder recovery in the London market. 'The window of opportunity for
Mid-Ocean was widening as a result of continued withdrawals from the market
in recent months,' he said.
The company is one of a number of new insurance ventures formed in Bermuda
in the past few months. Earlier this year, Marsh and Morgan were also
involved in the launch of a Dollars 70m Bermuda-based venture, Underwriting
Capital (Merrett).
