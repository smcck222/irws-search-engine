FT  25 JUN 93 / Leading Article: The future of social security
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Lilley, the social security secretary, used this week's annual Mais
lecture to launch a public debate on the future of the UK welfare state. To
encourage informed debate, he promised to publish data on trends in social
security spending and projections of future growth. Mr Lilley's initiative
is commendable, and in marked contrast to the secretive approach so far
adopted in the government's public expenditure reviews.
In his lecture, Mr Lilley firmly focused on the growth in the social
security budget. Excluding the cost of unemployment, real growth in social
security spending has been 3 per cent a year for the last 14 years. The
biggest increases have been in housing benefit, spending on long-term sick
and disabled people and support for single-parent families. These have all
more or less trebled in real terms since 1979.
The increased cost of benefits for the elderly has been much more modest at
38 per cent over that period. However, the elderly consume nearly half the
social security budget and 14 per cent of public expenditure. And while the
growth of private pension provision lessens the demand for income-related
benefits, the cost of residential care for the most elderly increased from
Pounds 10m in 1979 to Pounds 2.5bn last year.
The growth in the social security bill looks unlikely to abate. The
government's forecast is a real increase in spending of 3.3 per cent a year
to the end of the decade (though reducing unemployment would produce more
manageable growth rates). A surprisingly small share of growth will come
from extra spending on the elderly; it is benefits for the long-term sick
and disabled and housing benefit that are the biggest factors.
As Mr Lilley pointed out, some steps have been taken to curb the growth. The
state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) was trimmed by the Fowler
review. The Child Support Agency now pursues absent parents for the
maintenance which only one in three single-parent families regularly
receive. Steps have been mooted to ensure that invalidity benefit goes only
to those who are genuinely unfit to work.
More may need to be done if social security is not to eat up an
unsustainable share of national income. Serps continues to increase by more
than the rate of inflation. Child benefit should be reviewed, since
government figures show that it is the least well-targeted benefit. Further
efforts are needed to ensure that benefits paid to the unemployed help them
return to work.
The opposition may disagree with the government over priorities and the size
of the social security budget. But they should resist easy party-political
points in the debate that Mr Lilley seeks to encourage. If they were in
power, the problems would be no different - as Labour recognised in setting
up its Commission for Social Justice.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Nigeria adrift
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL IBRAHIM Babangida's decision to nullify the outcome of Nigeria's
presidential election plunges the country into its most serious crisis since
the Biafran war in the 1960s. Africa's most populous nation is adrift,
bereft of leadership and gripped by a deepening economic malaise.
The country's transition from military to civilian rule has been flawed from
the start. Former politicians were banned, as were the 13 parties that
originally sought to contest elections. The soldiers then foisted on the
electorate two artificial parties, created by civil servants, with near
identical manifestos. It has been a travesty of the democratic tradition the
general promised to entrench.
Nothing, however, has undermined his credibility so much as the confusion
that followed the presidential election on June 12, and the diktat that
postpones the advent of civilian rule for the fourth time.
The poll was to have been the last step before a formal handover of power
next August. Instead, it turned into a farce. A group calling itself the
Association for a Better Nigeria, which seeks the extension of military rule
until 1997, won a court order that halted counting of a poll that was
generally agreed to have been largely free of the rigging which has
characterised past elections.
If leaked figures are correct, Mr Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic
Party (SDP) defeated Mr Bashir Tofa, leader of the National Republican
Convention (NRC), winning 58 per cent of the vote and taking 19 of Nigeria's
30 states.
Neither candidate inspired confidence in Nigeria's future, and far better
qualified aspirants had been disqualified in the course of the bizarre
electoral process. Nevertheless, most Nigerians chose civilian rule, however
flawed, as the lesser of two evils.
It now seems clear, however, that the general will not step down on August
27, the anniversary of the coup that brought him to power in 1985. He and
his supporters seem to have been seeking a pretext, however feeble, for
extending the life of a corrupt regime.
The prompt and forthright condemnation of the action by London and
Washington should leave General Babangida in no doubt that the best service
he can now perform for Nigeria would be to reverse his ruling. But the
measures that accompany their warning are symbolic rather than substantial.
Far more persuasive would be an imaginative approach to Nigeria's crippling
Dollars 30bn external debt.
There should be a clearer link between political and economic reform and the
debt relief that Nigeria desperately needs. Substantial concessions could be
delivered more quickly than current rescheduling terms allow, on condition
that General Babangida steps down and economic reforms are implemented.
As an African proverb might put it: small stick, big carrot.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Euro-mergers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KAREL Van Miert, the new EC competition commissioner, must shortly decide
whether to recommend an increase in Brussels' powers to vet large EC
mergers. The European Commission is under a legal obligation to carry out a
review, before the end of the year, of the EC Merger Regulation turnover
thresholds, above which the Commission has exclusive competence to
investigate mergers.
European industry is broadly in favour of giving Brussels greater powers
over cross-border deals. Business likes the advantages the regulation offers
of 'one-stop shop' merger control and rapid clearance. But there is little
enthusiasm for lowering the thresholds among the member states. Only Belgium
and the Netherlands are strongly in favour. Britain, France and Germany are
opposed. Britain believes that a shift in power to Brussels is premature and
runs counter to the new emphasis on subsidiarity. Germany resents the
Commission's consistent refusal to refer cases back to the Bundeskartellamt.
France, infuriated by the blocking of the Aerospatiale/Alenia bid for De
Havilland - the only deal to be blocked under the regulation so far - wants
higher thresholds to scale back the Commission's powers. Continued
opposition by these three would be sufficient to defeat any Commission
proposal for change.
That may be no bad thing. Before contemplating any increase in the
Commission's jurisdiction there is a need both for greater transparency in
the Brussels decision-making process and for an injection of some element of
independence into the system.
Analysis of the merger regulation for the Centre for Economic Policy
Research points to a number of weaknesses. The Commission is accused of
defining markets too narrowly. Procedures are excessively opaque and
unnec-essarily open to manipulation. Many of the conditions attached to the
clearance of deals are cosmetic and of doubtful effectiveness.
The transparency of merger control could be improved immediately by
requiring publication of proposed conditions of settlement before a final
decision on clearance is made. This would allow for proper evaluation and
for interested third parties to comment. It would also place a much-needed
onus on Brussels to justify competition decisions. But a reduction in the
scope for political manipulation will never be achieved while the Commission
remains investigator, prosecutor, judge and executioner. Responsibility for
the investigation of mergers should be hived-off to an independent body
leaving the powers of negotiation and decision-making with the Commission.
These proposals will not of themselves safeguard against all political
interference but they are likely to produce fairer, more open and more
consistent decision-making. Until they have been implemented Mr Van Miert
should leave the thresholds alone.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Orphans of the storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The run of ill-fortune continues. Mr John Major is heading the
one-damn-thing-after-another administration. No sooner does it pick itself
up than along comes a clearly malicious Fate to knock it down. Like the
flying Dutchman, Britain's ghostly ship of state, captained by a spectre, is
lost in a world of its own, wandering from storm to storm, forever trying to
make a connection with reality, forever failing.
The longest recent period of serious, purposeful, respected government that
I can recall lasted about four days. It happened last week. The prime
minister was the beneficiary of a run of favourable publicity for his new
chancellor of the exchequer, whose down-to-earth sentiments are reported on
the page opposite. A series of encouraging economic indicators helped. Mr
Major's spirits were further uplifted by an uncharacteristic aggressiveness
in his own performance at question time in the Commons. That seemed to put
paid to the Labour leader, Mr John Smith.
Perhaps it was a turning point. After all, the principal event of this week
was the meeting of heads of government of the European Community in
Copenhagen. Mr Major is at his best at summits, and by his own lights he had
a good one. He managed to sell out the Bosnian Muslims and slap the Germans
in the face simultaneously, by thwarting the plan of the latter to provide
the arms with which the ethnically-cleansed might defend themselves. His
stand against social Europe may or may not have struck a chord in Denmark,
but it seems to have done him some good with the anti-Maastricht wing of his
party back home.
Alas, the effect was ruined before the performance started. Mr Michael
Heseltine was struck by a heart attack while in Venice. We do not yet know
how soon, or whether, the president of the board of trade will return to his
duties, but his absence, even for a few mid-summer months, will be damaging
to the government. It will be worse still if his doctors advise him not to
return. Mr Heseltine has his imperfections, but he is an experienced,
grown-up politician in a cabinet of relative newcomers. When the news came
it seemed to his colleagues as if there was no end to the run of ill-luck
that has dogged Mr Major and his crew since Black Wednesday.
The Conservatives then became entangled in a web partly of their own making.
They were accused of accepting funds from people who wanted to influence
them, some of these being foreigners, some of them crooks. This was
hilarious coming from a Labour party that is governed by trade unions.
Brother does not give contributions unto brother without expecting a
dominant vote in return. Mr Smith was elected leader of his party by
professional influence-peddlers. The Maxwell money that went to Labour did
not come from an honest man. Yet the Tories would have done better if they
had agreed to publish the names of their wealthier benefactors. That they
will not indicates that they have something to hide.
I cannot get excited about this. British corruption, like British hypocrisy,
has always been conducted at a certain level, the equilibrium of which is
difficult to disturb. It is nothing like so gross as the Italian method, and
nowhere so public as in the United States. Of course you can buy a meeting
with a minister (or his opposition shadow). Invitations to Downing Street
are a little more expensive. Naturally there is a price for OBEs (Opposition
Buyers Excluded), MBEs (Many Buy Each), CBEs (Cash Before Everything),
Knighthoods and a seat in the old folks' home known as the House of Lords.
What you cannot do is make an open purchase, a stated deal, an explicit
bargain. The cheque goes to the Conservative party; the gong may or may not
be in the post. The pretence that no transaction ever takes place is an
integral part of this delicate traditional process.
The parliamentary row about these matters will have confirmed to those TV
viewers who did not switch channels that our politicians are an unseemly
lot. To that extent it will damage all parties, but the likelihood is that
it is the Conservatives who have lost the most. Greater buckets of sleaze
have been thrown at them by Labour than they have managed to throw in
return. The connection with the fugitive Mr Asil Nadir is not easily
defended.
It is here that Mr Michael Mates comes into the picture. If his resignation
yesterday had been the only event of an otherwise untroubled season it could
be written off as of no significance save to the hapless former minister of
state for Northern Ireland. But Mr Mates enjoyed too close a connection with
Mr Nadir, or the latter's public relations adviser, not to mention the
receipt of at least one favour. He travelled too near the line that divides
legitimate dealings with interested parties from the secret world of
influence-peddling. He is, I am sure, innocent of any impropriety, but that
is not how it looks.
He has therefore further damaged the Conservatives. Who, in this of all
weeks, will believe that his case was a one-off? Not those who remember Mr
David Mellor, another minister who was obliged to resign after benefiting
from the favours of others. In both cases, the downfall followed some weeks
during which the prime minister was supposed to be adamant that his
ministers would be defended, although he was less adamant about Mr Mates
than about Mr Mellor. As with Mr Norman Lamont the agony was unnecessarily
prolonged. It really is time that Mr Major learned his lesson. A ministerial
resignation is always painful, particularly when it appears to be the result
of a media vendetta. But Mr Lamont should have gone on Black Wednesday, Mr
Mellor when his acceptance of outsiders' hospitality was broadcast, Mr Mates
at least a week ago. The prime minister is the responsible party. In each
case he should have known that resignation was the inevitable outcome.
Everyone else did.
A few days ago, before Lady Thatcher called a halt, some Conservatives were
certain that Mr Major himself would be next for the chop. I have no more
idea than anyone else whether he will survive. What is clear is that he is
doomed to sail yet awhile in the nether-world of government without
authority. Only a series of events - good events, happy events, successful
events - can put him back in genuine control of the nation's affairs.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Strong-arm tactics: The managed trade camp in the US is
gaining revisionist adherents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It used to be said that nothing is certain except death and taxes. Japanese
bureaucrats would probably add a third certainty to the list: US demands for
a reduction of trade barriers. Whatever the character of the new Japanese
government, it can count on unrelenting pressure from the Clinton
administration, not just to respect the letter of trade agreements, but to
bring the share of Japanese imports in sensitive sectors into line with
global norms.
Washington's determination to make Japan change its ways is reflected not
just in the speeches of administration officials, but in revisionist
thinking on the part of its think-tanks. In a book * on US-Japan economic
relations published today, Fred Bergsten and Marcus Noland of the Institute
for International Economics join the managed trade camp, arguing that
traditional strong-arm tactics are essential if the US is to gain reasonable
access to many Japanese markets.
They claim that Japanese trade barriers are reducing US exports by up to
Dollars 18bn a year.
It is a volte face for Bergsten, the institute's director, who championed
liberal trade policies throughout the 1980s. A few years ago, for the sake
of intellectual balance, he invited Ms Laura Tyson, then a professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, to write a book on managed trade. Now
he is echoing her arguments, and Noland has left the institute to join her
staff at the Council of Economic Advisers.
Bergsten and Noland claim they remain free traders at heart. Their preferred
course is to identify specific trade barriers and demand their removal. But,
they say, restrictive practices are often so entrenched and opaque that this
is impracticable:
'In such cases the US has to choose. It can try to induce Japan (through
governmental action or changes in the behaviour of Japanese companies) to
accept one or two American firms into an existing cartel, (the 'co-optation
strategy'), or it can seek a voluntary import expansion that would benefit a
much larger number of outsiders', they write.
The co-opting of American companies into a cartel is tantamount to an
admission of defeat. It can be justified only on political grounds. As
Bergsten and Noland admit, it will often backfire because once US companies
begin to earn monopoly profits in Japanese markets, they lose interest in
trade liberalisation.
Voluntary import expansion orders (VIEs) are another name for the
quantitative market share targets that the Clinton administration has
already signalled it favours. As in the notorious 1986 semiconductor
agreement, Japanese bureaucrats, in effect, would be asked to reserve a
portion of the home market for foreign companies. There is no rational means
of determining what that share should be.
The authors say such deals are a 'second best' solution but proceed to
recommend them, for example in supercomputers and fibre optics. This
explicit stamp of approval for managed trade from a respected, centrist
research institute is quite a coup for the Clinton administration, which can
now claim that its policies reflect the 'mainstream' views of US academia.
Yet much of the Bergsten/Noland analysis hardly supports their own
conclusions. They start by pointing out that the US's bilateral trade
deficit with Japan has barely risen in recent years and is anyway 'not a
proper focus for policy'. The significant imbalance is Japan's Dollars 130bn
overall current account surplus, and this can best be influenced by
macroeconomic levers, such as fiscal policy and currency appreciation.
They argue, correctly, that the US and Japan are converging economically
(meaning they are becoming more, rather than less, alike) and that Japanese
trade barriers have fallen markedly in the past decade. They point out that
corporate America has begun to put its house in order and that loss of US
competitiveness largely reflects domestic failings such as low savings, and
poor education and training.
If Japan is changing anyway, why throw in the towel on free trade? With the
Clinton administration lurching towards bureaucratically managed trade with
Japan, should not the institute be emphasising the classic arguments for
multilateral, rule-based trade?
Bergsten is obviously sensitive to such arguments. Indeed, he says he was on
a knife edge when writing the book. He might easily have come down against
even limited forms of managed trade.
What caused him to change his mind, he says, was detailed analysis of
individual Japanese sectors. Bergsten and Noland looked at the whole gamut
of economic activity from agriculture to cars, computers and financial
services. In virtually every case they claim to find a profusion of
barriers, albeit often of subtle forms. The book, says Bergsten, 'is a
damning indictment of a closed, exclusionary system'.
Some of the evidence is summarised in the table. The import penetration
ratio in Japanese manufacturing is below 6 per cent compared with more than
15 per cent in both Germany and the US. The extraordinarily low level of
foreign direct investment in Japan is reflected in foreign companies'
minuscule 1 per cent share of all domestic sales; comparable figures are 10
per cent in the US and 18 per cent in Germany.
Nobody disputes that Japan should take steps to open domestic markets. The
argument is over the means to this end. Bergsten has joined the growing camp
that argues that Japanese restrictions are so egregious that unorthodox
methods must now be tried. He also believes that gaiatsu - strong pressure
from outsiders - is the only way to bring about changes that are ultimately
in Japan's own interests.
Like the Clinton administration, the book makes a strong case. Turning up
the heat on Japan may produce wonderful results. With luck, VIEs would lead
rapidly to genuinely liberal trade with gains for all concerned. But by
focusing on the short-run impact of policies on Japan, Bergsten and Noland
understate the longer-term risks inherent in government bargaining over
trade shares. VIEs could easily spread just as voluntary export restraints
did in the 1980s, in the process progressively undermining the global
trading system.
Since their own analysis suggests no vital American economic interest is at
stake, it is not clear this is a risk worth taking. Why not be more patient,
seek remedies through established multilateral channels, such as the Gatt,
and rely on the common sense of young Japanese consumers to force change at
home?

FT  25 JUN 93 / Letter: Recovery not a sign of net export-led growth in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The first quarter national accounts and balance-of-payments statistics
released by the Central Statistical Office ('No increase in current-account
deficit', June 23) show manufacturing output leading the gross domestic
product recovery and diminished net imports of goods and services (at
constant prices) accounting statistically for virtually all of the growth in
GDP, since total domestic spending increased only marginally.
But to assume the recovery can be characterised as manufactured net
export-led growth in the wake of sterling's exit from the ERM would be quite
erroneous. In fact, the improvement in net exports of goods and services is
not due to any improvement in export, relative to import, volumes in trade
in goods (excluding oil and erratics) relative to the position before exit
from the ERM but to a factor unrelated to devaluation; namely, a return of
insurance earnings to more normal levels following two quarters of unusually
high claims in the wake of Hurricane Andrew.
Moreover, within the roughly unchanged level of total domestic spending,
private consumption is rising slightly faster than GDP at the expense of
central government consumption which is falling - reflecting diminished
military spending. From the output statistics, while manufacturing is
leading recovery, distribution is not far behind. All of this is consistent
with a private consumption-led recovery benefiting manufacturing and
distribution - supported by an incidental one-off improvement in service
export earnings. A recovery, yes] But, not manufactured net export-led
growth.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Letter: Disadvantages of a Manchester games should also be
evaluated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof HOWARD L HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was pleased to note that Manchester's bid to stage the Olympics in
the year 2000 has received such extensive and serious coverage by your
paper. However, your survey (June 23), along with so much of the up-beat
media coverage, may be creating a climate of optimism about the games that
cannot be wholly justified.
The technique used for arriving at the estimates of expenditure, income and
employment is widely used but there can only be confidence in such estimates
under the most rigorous conditions. It is unwise to assume that anything
like the figures quoted will result. Most jobs will, of course, exist only
during the pre-Olympic period and the Olympics itself.
Of more significance is the long-term aspect of the games. Spending and jobs
in construction are costs and are only a benefit if there is a 'pay-off'. At
least two weeks of (hopefully) profitable activity will result from Olympic
construction activity. After that, experience elsewhere suggests little can
be guaranteed and indeed gives cause for pessimism.
If it proves impossible to operate the sporting facilities profitably after
the games then the operation will have been more cost than benefit,
regardless of any short-term generation of spending and job creation. If the
legacy is under-used, unprofitable facilities then the whole exercise will
have been no more than short-term opportunism.
The cost may, of course, be felt to be justified if there is significant
inward investment in other industries and a long-term increase in tourism,
though these are by no means certain and would be difficult to attribute
directly to the Olympics anyway.
Disadvantages of the games are rarely touched upon and need to be
incorporated into an evaluation of the net impact of the games. It is
incumbent upon the media to encourage moderation in expectations of the
benefits of the games otherwise the claims will ultimately serve to create
only disappointment among the people of Manchester and the north-west.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEN MACKENZIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Dunkley (Arts, June 23) does well to complain about the
compilation tape beginning Wimbledon on BBC. These people seem to think we
have time to waste.
In Paris we watch the BBC World Service. I was horrified the other day to
hear the man reading the news say: 'After the break, we will have. . .'
After the break] We suffer this continually on CNN, but it has the excuse of
having to fit in some advertisements. But does the BBC think we have a
limited attention span? Or does the news reader get tired?
We also suffer from endless compilations, complete with ineffable music,

<TEXT>
Your leader, 'Local counsel' (June 17), and the response from the director
of the Council for the Protection of Rural England (Letters, June 19/20)
fail to explain the one crucial need the government has for the review of
local government and why status quo is unacceptable to them.
Irrespective of what size the future unitary authorities are, their creation
gives the government the perfect excuse to screw down their Standard
Spending Assessment compared with their predecessor authorities. This way,
the hard-pressed government will save money and the resulting shortfall in
services will be blamed by both it and the new unitary authorities on the
incompetence of the predecessor authorities.
Neither district nor county will gain from the review. The government will
be the winner and the user of local authority services the losers.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Letter: New regime will not fill lorries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JAMES COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The removal of cabotage restrictions on international hauliers,
allowing them greater freedom to compete in European Community national
markets, is undoubtedly a welcome development ('EC agrees on road charges
for hauliers', June 21). Efficiency gains in the haulage sector will bring
both economic and environmental benefits.
Yet it would be unwise to count on the elimination of the one in three goods
vehicles which are quoted in your report as running empty. In the mid-1980s
I led a study co-sponsored by the Department of Transport and the Chartered
Institute of Transport, in which we concluded that the overwhelming reason
for empty running was the imbalance of trade flows, with cabotage
restrictions being a relatively minor factor. While trade imbalances endure,
then so will lorries on the road with nothing in them.

Sir, Your welcome leader supporting a change to the ITV ownership rules
('British TV thinks big', June 17) did not include what I believe is the
strongest argument for change. In a more commercial world, faced with
significant and growing commercial opposition, an ITV run by 15 separate
companies has virtually no chance of survival. In the new world ITV will
need to develop policy and make decisions at a speed that 15 companies
simply cannot move at.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: RSC lightweights come to London - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two 1992 stagings that the RSC has just brought to London - A Winter's
Tale in the main Barbican, The Odyssey in the Pit - are both lively and both
lightweight. One particular feature of the Winter's Tale production is that
too few of the actors know how to make minor syllables, minor words, rapid
and/or hushed utterance register to the sides and depths of the big theatre:
a flaw that has made too many RSC transfers lightweight in the big Barbican
Theatre.
This Winter's Tale, which won several golden opinions in Stratford, is
directed by Adrian Noble. It runs fluently, tells its story clearly, proves
a good show. The groundless jealousy that makes Leontes so problematic a
role becomes credible here; John Nettles's multi-faceted Leontes blows warm
and cold, is trusting and suspicious. Yet when I remember Peter Hall's (by
no means perfect) 1988 National Theatre Winter's Tale, I find that Noble's
staging misses the play's scale. There is a high-flown edge of heroic
melodrama to Leontes, making us stand apart from him even as he sucks us
into his violent inner whirlpool; and so Tim Pigott-Smith showed. Nettles is
sensitive, reasonable, but small-scale. He neither distances us nor draws us
in.
Paulina, by contrast, embodies good sense and moral outrage without ever
soaring into such heights: and Eileen Atkins's raging force vibrates in the
memory. Gemma Jones has both sense and sensibility, but her account of this
winning role is a tad too elegant and refined. Samantha Bond's charming
Hermione has more edge; and Andrew Jarvis's Antigonus is more directly
communicative. Phyllida Hancock's Perdita is a fake-radiant country-bumpkin
bore, and Richard McCabe's Autolycus is sour even when amusing. Anthony
Ward's designs (with costumes veering between Victorian gowns and blue denim
jeans) make a big gimmick out of balloons: entertaining, without
illuminating the play.
Derek Walcott's version of The Odyssey, as staged by Gregory Doran, is a
vivid little dollop of multiculturalism and transhistoricism, recommended
chiefly to politically-correct wet liberals. (Costumes range from Ancient
Greek to traditional Caribbean. Accents, even among the residents of Ithaca,
from Caribbean to south London. Parlance switches from 'My love is like a
little black lamb asleep on a hill' to 'Me lost a husband too.') All of
which, as applied here, shrinks Homer's world considerably. Walcott winds
the old story up as if it were The Wizard of Oz, with Odysseus suddenly
recognising the people of his 20-year absence in the faces of the folk back
home.
Walcott's revisionist account does nothing shocking, but it is soppy enough
to make Odysseus win over mean old Thersites. This is not - is not meant to
be - an epic. Just lots of poetry. Some of Walcott's lines are fine
(Odysseus says of Ajax: 'He always strode as if earth were dung to his
heels'), but there are over-many self-conscious purple patches in which one
metaphor is piled too rapidly on another.
And this Odyssey boils Homer's characters down into two-dimensional
stereotypes. Ron Cook is a natural Odysseus (wily, fallible, determined),
and perfectly judges this production's sub-heroic tone. Too many of the
supporting roles are cheaply conceived, but Peter de Jersey plays
Eurylochus, Achilles, and other roles with a kind of integrity that is
arresting.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: Two student Brittens - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So long as there is no indigenous opera company in Manchester, the Royal
Northern College of Music will be able to claim a very visible share of the
operatic scene. It has been particularly ambitious of late - Vaughan
Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress last year, Massenet's Cendrillon at
Christmas - and its summer-term offering comprised two wholly new
productions: Britten's The Turn of the Screw and A Midsummer Night's Dream.
For a music school this is quite an undertaking. One of the operas may be
only small-scale, but that does not necessarily make a high standard of
musical preparation easier to achieve. The orchestral playing on both nights
was consistently good. There are professional performances of these operas
that pass by without imparting as much character as the students did under
their conductors, Timothy Reynish and Christopher Gayford.
Like the operas, the two stagings were quite different. Sally Day's
production of The Turn of the Screw became entangled in problems as to what
to show on stage and what not, but it gave the audience something to think
about. At the beginning it was made clear that the Governess was besotted
with the children's guardian. When the ghost Quint and boy Miles later
appeared, both with the same looks and red hair, all manner of
inter-relationships was set up - a highly complex sexual equation.
It was hardly surprising that Marianne Joseph as the Governness should get a
lot out of her role, but she did so in a mature way, singing with care for
the words and putting before us a composed and educated woman. Michael
Bennett was an incisive tenor Quint and Mary Pope a strong, slightly raw
Miss Jessel.
The other producer, Geoffrey Saunders, saw A Midsummer Night's Dream in more
conventional terms. The sets resembled the original Covent Garden staging
(exhumed by the RNCM itself not so long ago). Nothing very sinister was
lurking in its nocturnal shadows. This was a benign dream, merely fantasy
and humour with a few moments of saccharine sweetness, as when Tytania
settled down for the night in a rosy pink bower like a huge meringue,
surrounded by flickering candles.
The impressive feature was the all-round strength of the large cast.
Singling out individual names seems unfair, but Elizabeth Campos made a
sparkling Tytania and Wyn Pencarreg a touching Bottom, if not the gauche
extrovert the role implies. Both pairs of lovers, Maureen Murphy and Jeffrey
Lloyd-Roberts, Louise Armit and Richard Whitehouse, included voices of some
promise. A pity that Puck was taken in pantomime-style by a girl: not, I
suspect, an idea of which Britten would have approved.

<TEXT>
Television, famous as the here-today-gone-tomorrow medium, described by my
predecessor on this page as 'the ephemeral art', is tonight repeating The
Rock'n'Roll Years for 1965 (7.30 BBC1). These programmes, mixing chart hits
with contemporary news clips, form some of the most evocative historical
documents imaginable. Today's programme deals with the year when Winston
Churchill died, John Lennon wrote a book, PJ Proby split his trousers
(again), Rhodesia sought independence and Watts rioted. Then at 9.00 BBC2
continues its repeat run of the 1984 series of Alas Smith And Jones, the
duo's first series after 'Not The Nine O'Clock News'. Later, at 12.10, BBC2
repeats a 1984 edition of 'Arena', produced by Alan Yentob who is now
controller of both BBC1 and BBC2: 'The Everly Brothers, Songs Of Innocence
And Experience' in Rock Docs. Radio 3 offers a concert by the BBC Scottish
Symphony Orchestra In Shetland which includes the first performance of David
Ward's 'Beyond The Far Haaf', dedicated to Scottish fishermen; and
Tchaikovsky's fourth symphony (7.30).

FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: 'Triumph of Death' rediscovered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago, a 'Triumph of Death' was found hanging in the bedroom of a
reclusive American multi-millionaire. The large canvas was clearly an old
copy of Breughel the Elder's famous painting in the Prado - dirty, damaged,
and badly repainted in the last century. Cleaning has now revealed it to be
a signed and dated version by Breughel's son, Pieter II. On June 18, it went
on view at the Museum Mayer van den Bergh in Antwerp until May next year.
A painting as macabre as Breughel's 'Triumph of Death' would not be
everyone's choice for a bedroom. However, its late owner was a remarkable
character. Peter Putnam was born into a wealthy family in Cleveland, Ohio.
As a young man, he renounced the comforts of wealth, working as a
theoretical physicist, a college lecturer and social worker, all the while
elaborating a complex theory reconciling science, morality and religion.
Yet Putnam was also a brilliant investor. He turned Dollars 7m into a
Dollars 40m fortune by the time of his death. Aged 62, Putnam was cycling
home from his job as a night-janitor in a small town in Louisiana when he
was struck by a car and killed.
Putnam and his adored mother Mildred were philanthropically inclined. Last
month, the American charity Nature Conservancy revealed that the cornerstone
of its Last Great Places appeal was a secret Dollars 38m bequest in the
wills of Putnam and his mother. Princeton University, where Peter graduated,
is dotted with the Putnam Collection of sculpture, presented as a memorial
to Peter's brother.
The redoubtable Mildred Putnam gave a quantity of 20th-century art to
Princeton, Cleveland Museum and elsewhere. Not all the beneficiaries showed
themselves grateful. Kent State University declined a piece she commissioned
from George Segal in memory of the four students shot by the National Guard
at the 1970 anti-Vietnam War protest. Mrs Putnam not only accepted her son's
homosexuality, she commissioned Segal for a piece honouring the Gay
Liberation Movement, which conservative Ohio did not wish to have. The
sculpture now stands in New York's Greenwich Village.
The residue of the Putnam fortune, including the 'Triumph of Death', now
belongs to a charitable foundation which Peter named after his mother. James
Corcoran, an American art-dealer, is master-minding the re-emergence of a
picture he estimates as worth between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m. The Mayer van
den Bergh makes an extremely good shop-window for it, being rich in works by
the Breughel family.
Fritz Mayer van den Bergh was an ardent admirer of Breughel the Elder at a
time - the 1890s - when others were lukewarm. The wealthy young aesthete was
able to buy for a song what is perhaps the most remarkable and mysterious of
all the elder Brueghel's apocalyptic visions. 'Dulle Griet', the armed
harridan who strides across a ghastly landscape of bloodshed and fire, makes
an apt pair for the Cleveland 'Triumph of Death'.
Pieter the Younger and Jan each copied the 'Triumph of Death', Jan twice and
Pieter, it now appears, three times. They saw no difficulty about altering
their father's composition. Certain changes are aesthetic. In the elder
Breughel's day, skeletons were shown with flesh on their bones; his sons'
creations are bone-naked. However, Pieter put clothes on his father's naked
Eve, and had second thoughts about a dead baby. However, if two Belgian
art-historians are correct, Pieter included other changes which make the
Cleveland picture far more than just a ghoulish pot-boiler.
Helene Verougstraete and Roger Van Schoute have suggested that Pieter was
painting a double-memorial. In 1625, the year before the newly-uncovered
date on the canvas, Jan and three of Jan's children died from cholera.
Another date is prominent in the picture; 1525, marked on funeral banners
carried by a procession of skeletons, together with two crossed bones and
the legend 'Obiit morte(m)', 'He has passed on.' What was the significance
of the date?
The suggestion is that Pieter was marking the centenary which had elapsed
between his brother Jan's demise and the birth of their father, Breughel the
Elder. If this view is correct, it pinpoints the master's date of birth
which is normally given only as 'circa 1524'. On the right of the painting,
the merry company interrupted by skeletons, is also cited in support of this
centennial thesis. Ten sprigs on the handsome gateau must commemorate 10
decades.
Pieter, it is claimed, had painted a masterpiece heavy with personal meaning
 -one last 'Triumph of Death' for the Breughels. Perhaps the theory is
correct, although is there any other evidence of 17th-century artists
marking family centenaries in this way? It seems far from obvious that a
bereaved person would remark a 100-year interval between a father's birth
and a brother's death.
Where Breughel the Elder's birthday is concerned, the theory may be
mistaken. However, the notion that a mourning brother painted the Cleveland
'Triumph' as a memorial certainly has poignancy, not least in terms of the
other Peter. Putnam bought his painting (sold as school of Breughel) when he
was about 20, touring Europe. Some four years earlier, in 1944, his adored
elder brother had been killed serving as a fighter pilot.
It is impossible not to think that Breughel the Elder's message struck to
the wealthy young man's heart. On two scrolls, Pieter had added to his
father's work the quotations from the Apocalypse and Ecclesiastes which it
illustrated so unforgettably; 'There came a pale horse whose rider's name is
Death, and Hades followed after him' and 'For man is on the way to his
eternal home.' Breughel's fearsome vision kept a 20th-century ascetic
company for the rest of his days.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: Present Laughter - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to see just one play in London's West End this summer, go for
the revival of Noel Coward's Present Laughter at the Globe. It is not
Coward's best piece and lacks the precision of Hay Fever and Private Lives,
but under Tom Conti's direction there are times when it seems the next best
thing and, because you may not be too familiar with it, there should be new
delights.
Conti stars as well as directing. He plays Gary Essendine, the actor, lover,
writer and wit who comes close to being Coward's idealised version of
himself. This dual role of actor/director is at the heart of the production.
It allows Conti to dictate the pace. At times, playing Essendine, he is the
protagonist: for example, when he savages a young would-be dramatist for
wanting to write pyschological plays, like Chekov. Go into rep, Essendine
tells him, and learn what is 'actable'. The young man, memorably played here
by James Purefoy, is duly stunned and henceforth wants to act, write and
live like Coward.
At other times, Conti the director becomes more detached. He stands back and
watches the action going on around him - from lovers, admirers and
domestiques alike. There is, if you are looking for theatrical influences, a
remarkable amount of Present Laughter in John Osborne's Inadmissible
Evidence, which was revived at the Royal National Theatre last week. Compare
the use of the telephone in both plays, as well as the promiscuity.
Where Coward and Conti score is in the detail and the household
arrangements. Essendine has three domestic helpers: a spiritualist
Scandinavian housekeeper played by Hana-Maria Pravda who has a devastating
touch with the hoover, a valet called Fred and a wonderfully smart secretary
(Gabrielle Drake) on whom he depends for almost everything but romance. Not
only do these wildly different people get along well enough with each other;
Essendine is at home with all of them. This is the classless society or
Coward showing off the breadth of his taste.
There is also a beautiful semi-separated wife ready to come to the rescue
whenever danger lurks or another woman threatens to go too far. Certainly as
played by Judy Loe she is a sparkling asset, a supremely elegant dea ex
machina always at the end of a telephone line at the right time. Thus here
is the essence of the Coward-Conti family.
Just like the Bliss family in Hay Fever no one else is allowed more than a
look-in for long, though some of the supporting parts in Present Laughter
are weaker. There is very little to be said for the two male roles of Henry
and Morris who looks as if they have strayed in from the nearest golf club.
Possibly that is a fault of the production rather than the original Coward.
If so, it is the only one. Conti's own performance is to be treasured. He
passes the ultimate acting test of sometimes being even better when he is
silent than when he is speaking. Watch him just observing other people. He
is marvellously vain. Whenever the door bell rings, he moves towards the
mirror to preen himself. When it rings almost for the last time, he makes
the same instinctive movement then draws back as if to say 'sod it]' He
makes Coward seem a much nicer man than he probably was, and he makes
Present Laughter the play to see.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: Moti Roti, Puttli Chunni - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even being in the audience at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East nowadays is
an experience in itself. Nowhere else in the London theatre is there such a
sense of direct participation. If Stratford East put on a really bad
production, one has the sense that the audience would throw things at it.
There is no such problem with Moti Roti, Puttli Chunni, which is Hindi for
'Thick Bread, Thin Veils,' and part of this year's London International
Festival of Theatre (LIFT/93). The source is the prolific Indian movie
industry which specialises in high drama, violence, passion and romance.
Here it has been partly turned into theatre: some of the action takes place
behind a veil, as though on screen, then the real characters appear, as in a
play.
The plot has also been devised for Britain. These are Indians who have
emigrated in order to get away from arranged marriages and undue family
interference, but who mainly consort with Indians when they get here,
maintain their links with Bombay and still stick very largely to their own
culture with a bit more freedom.
Moti Roti concerns a construction company called Kumar Developments which
operates in London's East End and, like many companies, is in trouble with
the end of the property boom and has probably cut a few corners on the way.
It attempts to revive its reputation by building a public health complex,
but when the Kumar family runs out of money, they seek to turn the complex
private. Corruption is rampant.
So is every other kind of passion. If one had to attach a label to the
style, it would be melodrama, so the old theatre at Stratford East is a very
fitting place for it. The audience hisses at anything villainous and cheers
ironically at the sentimental passages.
No doubt there is more to Moti Roti than meets the average Anglo-Saxon eye
and ear. Some of the dialogue is in Hindi. Yet even the dullest Englishman
can scarcely fail to rise to the zest, the passion and the sheer enthusiasm.
It may be soap, but it is Indian soap on an epic scale with handsome men and
beautiful women, though also a wonderful comic character in Ajay Chhabra's
Bunty.
The colours are lurid - mostly shades of purple - but even that adds to the
impression of an Indian Hollywood run wild. They call it Bollywood.
Direction and design are by Keith Khan. The audience at the first night was
a huge ethnic mix; they all loved it. Part of the pleasure is simply being
there.

FT  25 JUN 93 / People: CSEU confirms Robson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Robson, 51, was confirmed as the new general secretary of the
Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions at its annual meeting
in Llandudno on Wednesday.
Robson, deputy general secretary of the AEEU engineering union since 1990,
succeeds Alex Ferry, another former official of the AEEU, who was an
important player in the campaign by the engineering unions for a 37-hour
week.
The campaign won shorter working weeks for hundreds of thousands of workers.
Robson, who started his career as an apprentice at Swan Hunter shipyard, is
keen to start campaigning for a 35-hour week when the economy picks up. But
he believes many employers would be unwilling and unable to concede such
hours at present.
The CSEU is an umbrella organisation for engineering and shipbuilding unions
and negotiates on their behalf locally. It used to be an important force in
national pay talks with engineering employers but this role ended after
disputes over the shorter working week.

FT  25 JUN 93 / People: Rowlands takes on top job at HTV
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Rowlands, the 41-year old finance director of HTV, the ITV company for
Wales and the west of England was yesterday appointed chief executive with
immediate effect.
He takes over from Charles Romaine, 56, who was with HTV for two years and
successfully saw it through the bids for new franchises. It is believed that
Louis Sherwood, the HTV chairman sought Romaine's early retirement.
The appointment reflects the changing nature of independent television and
the hard struggle HTV faces following its high bid of Pounds 20.5m a year to
retain its franchise.
Rowlands, a qualified accountant with a Cambridge economics degree, is a
specialist in ITV advertising.
He joined HTV as finance director in May 1992 and had previously worked at
the Asda retail group. His responsibilities at Asda included devising and
implementing corporate property plans and managing new construction of about
Pounds 300m a year and Pounds 1.5bn of Asda property assets.
At HTV Rowlands has been responsible for cost-cutting and rationalisation
aimed at taking the company back to profit.
Sherwood yesterday paid tribute to Romaine's role in steering HTV through
the bid process against fierce competition and launching the policy of
selling non-core businesses and reducing the company's cost base. Rowlands
said he was confident HTV would be able to honour fully its licence
obligations.
He added: 'My immediate task is to ensure that HTV repays the loyalty of its
shareholders by returning the company to profitability.'

FT  25 JUN 93 / People: Taylor to head URA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Taylor, managing director of Amec Developments, has been chosen as the
first chief executive of the Urban Regeneration Agency, the public body that
will be set up this autumn to reclaim 150,000 acres of vacant land.
Taylor, a 43-year old Scot, beat off competition from 177 other candidates
to win the post. Lord Walker, chairman designate of the URA, said Taylor had
been chosen because he had experience 'at the leading edge of regeneration
activity and the personal qualities to match.'
'He is already well-respected in both the private and public sectors and
will give the agency a head start in developing the partnership approach
vital to its success,' he added.
Taylor, who originally trained as an architect, has spent four years at Amec
Developments, which is responsible for urban regeneration schemes in
Merseyside, Newcastle and Salford Quays.
Before joining Amec, he was managing director of Lancashire Enterprises, an
agency set up by local authorities in the north west.
Taylor has served on the Business in the Community task force responsible
for preparing a report on raising finance for inner city areas. He has also
been a member of the Prince of Wales' Urban Village Group and a director of
the North West Business Leadership Team.
Taylor, whose appointment was announced yesterday in a written parliamentary
answer by John Gummer, environment secretary, said that his task over the
next few months would be to decide on the agency's strategy with Lord
Walker.
He will work as a consultant to the Department of the Environment until the
agency is formally established under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Bill which is now going through Parliament.
The agency, which is sometimes described as a roving urban development
corporation, will subsume the Derelict Land Grant and City Grant programmes
which will account for Pounds 177m of funds from the Department of the
Environment this year.

More than 50 per cent of faxed documents are prepared on a computer, but
most are printed before they can be faxed. The alternative - to put a fax
board inside the PC - means other documents cannot be sent while the
computer is faxing, and the power has to be left on to receive faxes outside
office hours.
Japanese fax specialist Muratec has teamed up with software company
Wordcraft International to produce a plain paper fax machine that sits next
to the PC and enables faxes to be sent from both. Incoming faxes can either
be printed out or stored and displayed on the PC. Muratec: UK, 0737 780178.

<TEXT>
Bar codes are widely used on items such as food to identify the item. But in
blood transfusion, where large amounts of data need to be carried on the
blood bag, more complex options are being investigated.
The regional transfusion centres in Oxford, UK, and Kassel, Germany, are
looking at a two-dimensional bar code called PDF 417 to identify the donor,
reveal test data and so on. Unlike traditional bar codes where data is held
in the thickness of the stripes and the height of the bar is irrelevant,
PDF417, developed by Symbol Technologies, of Bohemia, New York, and promoted
in the UK by Bar Code Systems, contains a series of codes stacked on top of
each other.
As a result a single code can contain up to 1,750 characters, compared with
13 on a traditional bar code. Symbol Technologies: US, 516 563 2400. Bar

FT  25 JUN 93 / People: Publisher puts finance on board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dorling Kindersley, the publisher of highly illustrated reference books, has
appointed its first board-level finance director eight months after its
spectacular debut on the Stock Exchange.
He is Peter Gill, 37, group development director and company secretary of
Abbott Mead Vickers, the listed advertising agency. Gill, who spent 10 years
with Arthur Andersen, the chartered accountants, will also act as DK's
company secretary.
The publisher's finance function has until now been headed by Lyn Blackman,
who sat on the board only as company secretary. She will be moving to a
three-day week, and working on new business development.
Richard Harman, DK's managing director, said Gill's services had been
secured after a 'gentle search' by headhunters. No one had questioned the
absence of a finance director on the board during the flotation process -
partly, no doubt, because both he and Rod Hare, DK's operations director,
were chartered accountants. DK's shares have risen more than 75 per cent
since flotation.

FT  25 JUN 93 / People: Marsden quits Premier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Marsden, corporate development director of Premier Consolidated
Oilfields, has resigned to pursue other interests. Both parties say the
parting was amicable.
The departure of Marsden, an active former head of mergers and acquisitions
at County NatWest, comes six months after Roland Shaw, the founder of
Premier, nominally stepped down from his executive chairman position under
some pressure from institutional investors.
Whispers from the City suggest Shaw may, however, still be playing a more
active role than might be expected from a non-executive chairman. The
70-year-old Shaw, whose larger than life presense has dominated Premier for
10 years, is understood to be in the office for much of the week. 'He
(Marsden) may have been a bit frustrated,' said one close observer. 'Shaw
has given up much of the hands-on management. It is difficult for a chap
like that to suddenly retire.'

FT  25 JUN 93 / Technology: Topping up the hormones - The market for
menopause treatment is lucrative, says Clive Cookson in a series on drug
discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 51-year-old product, extracted from pregnant mares' urine, is turning
unexpectedly into a pharmaceutical blockbuster. The success of Premarin -
worldwide sales up 20 per cent to Dollars 642m (Pounds 428m) last year and
projected to reach Dollars 1bn in 1995 - is a testimony to the fast-growing
popularity of hormone replacement therapy for women during and after the
menopause.
Although HRT has been going as long as an average menopausal woman, new
research findings are propelling its growth. They show that oestrogens such
as Premarin not only relieve the immediate symptoms of menopause, such as
hot flushes, night sweats, fatigue and vaginal dryness, but also help
prevent two serious health problems of old age: osteoporosis (fragile bones)
and heart disease.
At the same time drug companies are developing more convenient ways of
delivering HRT than the traditional Premarin tablets sold by Wyeth, the
pharmaceutical subsidiary of American Home Products. The most important
innovation is the transdermal patch, pioneered by Ciba of Switzerland, which
releases hormones slowly into the blood through the skin.
Menopause is defined narrowly as a woman's last menstrual period, which
occurs at an average age of 51, but the term is now used more loosely to
describe the change triggered by the ovaries' declining capacity to produce
oestrogens (female sex hormones). Typically this starts in the late 40s and
continues well into the 50s.
Falling oestrogen levels affect the normal functioning of many body systems,
including skin, bone, blood vessels and sex organs. The most important
long-term impact is to accelerate the normal age-related loss of bone
density and minerals. The result is osteoporosis, which causes 1.3m bone
fractures a year in the US, at a total cost in health care estimated at
Dollars 10bn a year. More than half the women who break a hip in old age
will never be able to walk without assistance again and one in five dies
within a year of the fracture.
Menopause also removes the protection from heart disease given by
oestrogens, which reduce clogging of arteries and simulate the healthy
growth of blood vessels. Although younger women are much less likely than
men of the same age to die from heart attack or stroke, such deaths increase
rapidly after the age of 50.
HRT aims to restore oestrogens in the blood to a level slightly below what
is normal before menopause. Although Wyeth and Ciba dominate the market,
more than 20 other HRT products are currently available, including surgical
implants, creams and pessaries as well as tablets and skin patches. Most
contain natural oestrogens - either human oestradiol or 'conjugated
oestrogens' from pregnant mares. These are much less potent than the
synthetic hormones incorporated in oral contraceptive pills.
In addition to oestrogen, women on HRT whose wombs have not been removed by
hysterectomy are advised to take cyclical doses of a second hormone,
progestogen. Its role is to prevent excessive cells building up in the
lining of the uterus - a condition that can eventually lead to cancer of the
womb.
Clinical evidence for the long-term benefits of HRT is building up steadily,
as the World Menopause Congress in Stockholm has been hearing this week. The
risk of hip fracture is reduced by at least half after five years of
treatment and the risk of heart attack may be cut by 45 per cent.
The proportion of menopausal women in the UK who are on HRT has increased
from 4 per cent to 9 per cent over the past five years, according to the
Amarant Trust, a medical charity specialising in HRT. In the US about 15 per
cent are on HRT.
However, there is scope for far more women to benefit from HRT, says Val
Godfree, deputy medical director of the Amarant Trust. Busy family doctors
do not have time to explain HRT during the 10 to 15 minutes allotted to a
typical consultation, she says, or to work out the best therapy for each
individual. As a result, too many women give up after two or three weeks
because of the 'side-effects', before the therapy has had a chance to do
them much good.
The side-effects caused by oestrogen-progestogen combinations - including
breast tenderness, bloating and leg cramps - normally disappear within three
months, as the body becomes accustomed to the raised hormone levels. It may
also be possible to reduce side-effects by switching to a different
combination and/or from tablets to skin patch.
Beyond the immediate side-effects, some women steer clear of HRT because
they are afraid of the long-term risks of hormone consumption and/or because
they think it is wrong to interfere artificially with the natural ageing
process - a view that the author Germaine Greer expounded in her anti-HRT
book The Change, published in 1991. (Books about the menopause are a
lucrative publishing genre; Gail Sheehy's The Silent Passage, which favours
HRT, headed the US bestseller lists last year.)
Potentially the most serious long-term risk of HRT is a small increase in
the chance of developing breast cancer. This is still medically
controversial but Godfree concedes that the risk of breast cancer may
increase from 1-in-12 to 1-in-9 after 15 years on HRT.
Women who do not like taking sex hormones but still want to protect
themselves against osteoporosis may be prescribed other bone-strengthening
drugs, notably calcitonins.
Giving calcium (the main mineral in bone) directly as a dietary supplement
does not appear to prevent osteoporosis in well-nourished women. But
calcitonins - hormones that regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the
body - do help by reducing the resorption of mineral from bone into the
blood.
Sandoz of Switzerland leads the Dollars 1bn-a-year calcitonin market with
Miacalcic, a synthetic version of salmon calcitonin. Until recently,
calcitonins had to be injected but Miacalcic is now available as a more
convenient nasal spray.
Bisphosphonates - potent inhibitors of bone resorption - are a new category
of drug to treat osteoporosis. Sales are still small - only Dollars 80m last
year according to Arvind Desai, an analyst with Mehta and Isaly, the New
York healthcare investment company - but they are expected to rise as new
products come through clinical trials.
Meanwhile, a new generation of transdermal patches will be fuelling the
growth of the HRT market. The first, Evorel, was launched in Europe early
this year by Ortho-Cilag, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson. As with Ciba's
original Estraderm, a patch is applied twice a week to the buttocks or top
of the legs. But with a thickness of only 0.1 mm, Evorel is thinner than
Estraderm; it contains oestrogen dispersed in a matrix rather than a liquid
reservoir. Ortho-Cilag quotes clinical studies to show that Evorel suffers
less from two problems of the first-generation patches - their tendency to
fall off and to irritate the skin.
Other companies developing second-generation HRT patches include two US drug
delivery companies, Noven and Cignus, and Ethical Holdings of the UK. Noven
has signed licencing agreements with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer in Europe and Ciba
in the US, while Cignus is collaborating with Warner-Lambert.
The main advantage of patches over tablets, apart from convenience, is that
the hormone diffuses straight into the bloodstream. 'The patch avoids giving
large doses of oestrogen to the liver,' says John Stevenson, consultant
endocrinologist at the Wynn Institute for Metabolic Research. 'It is
therefore less likely to cause metabolic disturbances which might be seen
with the oral route.'
Menopause-related drugs are one of the fastest growing of all pharmaceutical
sectors, as Desai points out. Ironically, the growth is based less on new
chemicals than on well-known natural hormones.
Desai expects the overall market for menopause, osteoporosis and bone
disease treatments to continue growing at 15 to 20 per cent a year at least
until 1996 - 'and the rate of expansion could be even faster if sufficient
breadth of new products was available'.
The series will continue next month with an article on arthritis treatment.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Management: Secrets of the Semler effect - The man who set
corporate culture on its head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One somehow expects a brash, bizarre dresser, surrounded by public relations
people and assorted hangers on. One actually gets an engaging 34-year-old,
conservatively attired (even a touch preppy), calmly reflective,
conspicuously on his own.
Yet this is Ricardo Semler, Brazil's one-time enfant terrible and author of
an autobiographical book whose advance hype is extravagant even by the
standards of the UK publishing industry.
Subtitled 'the success story behind the world's most unusual workplace',
Maverick] describes a manufacturer of pumps, mixers and other industrial
equipment whose corporate hierarchy has been turned upside down, where
employees set their own hours and (in some cases) their own salaries, and
where everyone (managers, cleaners, messengers) has access to the company's
financial figures.
In the 13 years since young Ricardo was handed the reins by his
Austrian-born father, Semco has earned a reputation as one of Latin
America's fastest growing companies. Sales have increased six-fold and
profits have advanced by 500 per cent. But Semco has attracted international
attention much more for its refreshing - if sometimes quirky - ideas in
workplace organisation and employee democracy.
Executives from some of the biggest multinationals have sought to draw
inspiration from Semco's Sao Paulo well. MBA students have lined up to study
its restructuring techniques. And Semler himself says he received 6,600
letters from readers of
the Brazilian version of his book (and is proud of having had a personal
hand in answering all of them).
That the international edition to be published in September has been
translated into 11 languages - Semler penned the English version himself -
suggests a man eager to convert the world to his Semco model.
Not true, he insisted during an interview in London this week. 'The book is
not a mission statement. I wanted to get away from the Jesuitical approach
which you find in the US of going out and doing something yourself and then
telling others how to do it.'
Semler is naturally flattered that a company from Denver, Colorado, has been
set up on strict Semco lines, and he reports with obvious satisfaction that
he has had appeals for help from Norway and California. But he is adamant
that he is not about to take up consultancy. 'I've turned down numerous
offers,' he says. 'Semco is an ongoing project and we think we are only
half-way there. We need another 10 to 15 years to finish the job.'
Semler concedes that today's corporate giants could easily grow feet of
clay: 'Who would have guessed two years ago what was about to happen to
IBM?' But he is unperturbed by the prospect of economic change. 'I can't
imagine stronger downturns than we've already been through. We've closed
factories and had five to six redundancy programmes, that's everyone's risk.
The challenge for us is to show that the Semco model can be self-sustaining,
that it can carry on in the absence of a leader figure.'
To demonstrate the point Semco introduced the idea of a rotating chief
executive officer - five people do the job for six months at a time - and
Semler himself is increasingly taking a back
seat.
'The company now takes 30-40 per cent of my time. My next stint as CEO comes
up at the end of 1995. For the moment I don't have an office, or a desk, and
I don't sign cheques. I don't exist there from a job point of view.'
Semler is evidently not one to pore over the monthly cash-flow statements.
'Financial numbers are not an adequate indication of what is happening,' he
says. 'I feel closest to the company when I am talking to people in a hotel
about whether our dishwashers work, or talking to ship-owners about our
pumps.'
So does he subscribe to the latest cult of the customer? 'I read about them
(management fashions), but I don't take much notice. The main goal of a
company should be to create an entity which everyone involved in feels is
worthwhile. That
will then manifest itself in
good quality, good customer service.'
Asked about companies he admires, Semler cites the Delaware-based Gore-tex
manufacturer WL Gore. 'They work in a completely different field but there's
a philosophical identity,' he explains. 3M and the Mid-west furniture maker
Herman Miller have also earned his respect.
'We've picked the best from many systems - personal freedom, individualism
and competition from capitalism, the control of greed and sharing of
information and power from socialism, and the flexibility of the Japanese,
although we shrink from their family-like ties to the company and their
automatic veneration of elders.
'As far as we are concerned, problems like drug or alcohol abuse are not our
concern outside the company. This sort of paternalism is unacceptable. Nor
do we have a health club, which is the sort of thing that sometimes makes
people in the United States cross.'
As for the next 10 years, Semler aims to 'increase the depth' of Semco's
experience. 'At the moment, only about a quarter of our workforce set their
own salaries. I'd like to see everyone doing that. The same goes for our
balance sheet and financial analysis programmes.
'I also think people working from home is a good sign. At the moment only
about 20 per cent of our employees do so one to three days a week.'

FT  25 JUN 93 / Management: Time to get serious - Rank Xerox's ambitious
re-engineering programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three months ago Bernard Fournier, the French-born managing director of Rank
Xerox, sent out a terse announcement from his headquarters in Marlow,
Buckinghamshire. It was proof that the copier company had finally become
serious about 'process re-engineering' after years of merely flirting with
it.
In order to become 'the most productive company in our industry in the
world', Fournier declared, 'we need dramatic improvements in performance
which will be achieved through re-engineering of our business processes'.
His announcement came hard on the heels of a string of other decisions which
mentioned business processes and re-engineering in passing. They included a
drastic reshaping of the Marlow headquarters - involving the loss of 200
jobs and the reassignment of 1,200 - and a reorganisation of European
marketing, sales and service.
In his announcement just before Easter, Fournier did not enumerate the
productivity targets but they have since become known. They involve a cut of
about Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) in Rank Xerox's annual overheads.
That will be achieved by, among other things, removing the costly
traditional freedom of each European offshoot to develop and operate its own
processes and systems as it likes. Instead, seven uniform 'basic processes'
are being designed to span all functional departments across Europe. Several
are already well advanced. They will cover almost all the company's
activities - from 'time to market' (product development) through 'market to
collection' (customer order, installation and payment) to 'product
maintenance' (service).
To make the design and operation of the new processes effective, Fournier
said that each of them would in future be 'sponsored' by one of his top
managers from all over Europe, and that a bevy of senior executives
immediately beneath them would be the 'owners' (ie managers) of each
process. Coming from a company known for its propensity for managerial
innovation, such moves might seem unpractical theorising. They are far from
that.
Fournier is renowned - even notorious - for being practical and
down-to-earth. He expects the changes to pay off handsomely on the bottom
line. But he knows they will be far from easy and expects 'a fight' as the
new 'process owners' start to operate across the company's traditional
structure. That structure is still heavily functional.
But, as Fournier made clear, he and his top colleagues in the senior
management committee will not only constitute a 'business process board' to
spark new re-engineering programmes, they will also act as a separate
committee to monitor progress of the new strategy - in other words, to drive
it.
This determination is a far cry from 1990, when an attempt to spark a
re-engineering revolution in Rank Xerox withered on the vine because of
resistance from the established hierarchy, both in Europe and within the US
parent, Xerox.
'Now we're re-engineering not just a few processes, but the whole company,'
says John Drinkwater, Rank Xerox's director of business processes and
information management. That puts Rank Xerox 'streets ahead' of its parent,
he claims. In the US a much more technology-based re-engineering project was
brought to a halt in 1992 because of its cost. Even two years ago,
Drinkwater says, a proposal along the lines now approved in Europe 'wouldn't
have got airtime with senior management. Now it does because of the savings
it can offer - our existing ways of doing things aren't affordable anymore'.
That became patently evident last year, when two events occurred.
First, one of the company's 'quality improvement teams' concluded that there
was a yawning gap between the current return on assets and what needed to be
achieved if Rank Xerox were to be able to call itself 'the most productive
company in our industry'.
Then, as 1992 progressed, the extent of the immediate financial pressures
became obvious. In the year to October, pre-tax profits fell by 13 per cent
by one calculation and almost 19 per cent by another, thanks in part to a
rise in administration costs of nearly 10 per cent.
It is no coincidence that October was also when Fournier and his senior
colleagues told two teams to do a study of virtually the whole of Rank
Xerox. Rather than apply crude percentage cuts across the board, they were
asked to calculate the value added by every activity, and - if it survived
examination - place it within whichever of the seven new 'basic processes'
was most appropriate.
One pan-European team examined the role and size of the international
headquarters and all its support functions. The team concluded that all but
135 of the 1,500 full-time jobs there should be reassigned to the company's
business divisions or sales subsidiaries, or its 'technology and business
support group'. By cutting back on subcontracted work, only 200 jobs have
gone.
A second team has adopted a similar process-based approach to the
streamlining and redesign of Rank Xerox's field operations across Europe.
Its recommendations will be put to Paul Allaire, the chairman and chief
executive of Xerox, at the end of June, and consequent actions made public
in the autumn.
Financial pressures have certainly provided a vital spark for the process
revolution at Rank Xerox, but not the only one. Another is Allaire's
campaign to turn the whole Xerox group into a much faster-moving, more
market-connected and 'team-oriented' organisation. The introduction of
cross-departmental business processes as a 'horizontal' overlay across the
company's hitherto functional (or 'vertical' ) structure should help it
towards those objectives.
Rank Xerox is also implementing a variety of behaviour and culture change
initiatives, including a new-style leadership programme for the top 90
executives, and workshops for self-managed work teams.
Thanks to Fournier, a key policy document from Xerox, with the odd title of
The New Company Culture, has been expanded for European consumption. Below
eight high-flown American phrases about 'action-oriented', 'empowerment' and
'organisational learning', he has added the stark words 'process
re-engineering and simplification'. He certainly means business.

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: 'I have done nothing improper'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Full text of Michael Mates's resignation letter:
Dear Prime Minister,
When I came to see you earlier today, it was to re-iterate to you what I
told your office some days ago, namely that, if the continuing saga over the
representations I made to the attorney-general were embarrassing and
damaging the government, I would stand aside.
I believe that this is now the case and, although I have done nothing
improper, the daily leaking of letters and so-called quotes from unknown
sources - most of them wildly inaccurate - is causing such cumulative damage
to the important work of government that I must do what I can to bring it to
an end. I therefore wish to go. The past 14 months have been the happiest
and most fulfilling of my political life.
Working for Paddy Mayhew, a wise and brave secretary of state, and being
part of a government facing huge challenges which we are starting to
overcome, has been an unforgettable experience.
Thank you for giving me the chance to serve. I shall now do what I can to
put my part of the turmoil to rest. You need and deserve the staunch support
of the whole party. It goes without saying that you have mine: now and for
the future.
In retrospect, I rather wish I had sent the watch with its now famous
message to you.
Yours ever, Michael
John Major's reply:
Dear Michael,
Thank you for your letter today.
As I explained when you asked to see me, I fully accept that you acted with
complete propriety in raising with the attorney-general the concerns that
had been put to you about Mr Nadir's case.
I made it clear, as I have done in parliament, that I have no criticisms of
your actions on that account. I do, however, understand the reasons why you
have decided you must stand down from the government, and I respect them.
I am most grateful for all the work you have done in the Northern Ireland
Office since the election. You have handled the very difficult security
portfolio with great fortitude and skill, as well as dealing with finance
and personnel issues.
It is a job that makes immense demands, which you have met fully and
effectively. I know that Paddy Mayhew shares that view.
I am sorry that you had to stand aside from the government in circumstances
like this. But I am sure that you took the right decision with your usual
sense of duty.
I am most grateful to you for your warm words of continuing support.
Yours ever, John

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: Letter from Mates 'based on
misinformation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, KYRENIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL MATES, who yesterday resigned as Northern Ireland security
minister, may have sacrificed his political career by taking up a false
cause.
Scotland Yard said last night that the letter he wrote to the
attorney-general on behalf of Mr Asil Nadir, which complained about the
behaviour of two British police officers while in northern Cyprus, was based
on misinformation.
The officers whose alleged behaviour prompted Mr Mates's intervention, Mr
Jones and Mr Savin, were in northern Cyprus on business unconnected with
Asil Nadir or Polly Peck. In a detailed statement, which added to doubts
over many of the claims from Mr Nadir, Scotland Yard said the two officers
had been together in northern Cyprus only once, on October 9 1991, in
connection with the deportation of a Turkish Cypriot, Mr Surmeli Tuluco.
Mr Jones made a further visit to the island on November 5 1992 with another,
unnamed officer, while Mr Savin visited on November 11, again with a second
officer. Both visits were connected with different deportations.
Separately, the Serious Fraud Office, which has been investigating Mr
Nadir's business affairs with officers seconded from the Metropolitan fraud
squad, said that 'none of them have ever been to northern Cyprus'.
Mr Mates's letter was sent to the attorney-general on March 17 1993 with a
photocopy of a certificate allegedly issued by the acting commissioner of
police in northern Cyprus, giving dates of arrival and departure of Mr Jones
and Mr Savin.
The letter alleges both men stayed at the Altin Kaya Hotel, where they made
extensive inquiries of the proprietor, Mr Fahri Otcuoglu. Mr Otcuoglu said
he remembered two visits by Mr Jones and Mr Savin: one at the end of
September 1991, when they stayed for three days, the other at the end of May
1992, when they stayed for five or six days. His hotel, a small bungalow on
the outskirts of Kyrenia, was unable to provide any registration book or
other documentation to confirm this.
But the acting police commissioner for northern Cyprus, Mr Ali Cetin
Karahan, said yesterday he had no recollection of either a Mr Jones or a Mr
Savin coming to the island.
One of the hotel's barmen, an Englishman who asked not to be named, said he
recalled a visit by Mr Jones and Mr Savin, but insisted the two men had been
there on deportation duties.
Just how Mr Mates's letter came to be published remained a mystery last
night. Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, the lawyer acting for Mr Nadir in the UK,
said he had no knowledge of the letter prior to its publication. The only
reference he had to SFO investigations in northern Cyprus was correspondence
from the SFO stating they could not send their officers there because of
legal difficulties with the local authorities.
The events culminating in Mr Mates's resignation began on May 4 when Mr
Nadir became a fugitive from British justice by jumping bail and flying to
northern Cyprus, which the UK does not recognise as a legal entity.
Within four weeks Mr Mates found himself in the midst of a growing political
storm linked to the Nadir case when it was revealed by two Sunday newspapers
that over a period of 18 months the minister had written to the
attorney-general on Mr Nadir's behalf, questioning the conduct of the
Serious Fraud Office's inquiry into the Polly Peck empire.
It was also reported that three days before Nadir jumped bail, Mr Mates sent
him a watch with the inscription 'From C and M. Don't let the buggers get
you down.'

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: Testimony doctor owned Polly shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the doctors providing medical testimony which delayed action against
Mr Asil Nadir was a substantial shareholder in Polly Peck International, the
company founded by the fugitive businessman.
Mr Alan Wootliff, a doctor at Spitalfields Health Centre in London, held
nearly 300,000 shares at the time of PPI's administration in 1990. Some were
previously held in his wife's name.
The shares - which were worthless when he submitted medical reports on Mr
Nadir earlier this year - were not disclosed to the courts or in the
reports.
Copies of two letters written by Dr Wootliff for use in the criminal and
civil proceedings against Mr Nadir, and one confirming his opinion written
by another doctor earlier this year, suggest that Mr Nadir was in very poor
mental and physical health.
These letters provided some of the information which delayed investigations
by the Serious Fraud Office, by administrators to PPI and by Mr Nadir's
trustee in bankruptcy.
Asked whether there was any conflict between his medical views and his
financial interest, Dr Wootliff said: 'I would not let one cloud the other.
My conscience is clear. There was nothing illegal, immoral or unethical in
what I did.'
He defended his views on Mr Nadir and said: 'I was asked for my opinion at
the time. He was not capable of co-operation. The stress and strain must
have had some result. Perhaps if I examined him today it would be
different.' He said he had bought shares throughout PPI's history and had
known Mr Nadir since the 1960s.
Mr Paul Gordon-Saker, a partner with Alsop Wilkinson working on behalf of
the PPI administrators, said: '(The letters) prevented us from obtaining
information since last September. Clearly (Mr Nadir) doesn't look very ill
now.'
In a letter dated April 14 1993, Dr Wootliff says Mr Nadir has agitated
depression, disturbed thought processes, limited concentration, little sleep
and 'unrealistic thought disturbances'. He concludes: 'This is reactive upon
presumed unreasonable and demeaning strains that have been put upon him. The
position is most precarious and the outcome is liable to be tragic without
speedy resolution.'
In a letter on January 19 this year, Dr Wootliff concludes: 'We have a
rather fragile state which will not withstand stress for the time being'.
A third letter from Dr Lawrence Goldie of Harley Street, London, on March 3
this year describes 'an obvious and considerable deterioration in Mr Nadir's
physical condition' between consultations in September 1992 and February
1993.
'The despair which he manifests (anomie) can, in my experience, lead to
death,' he writes. 'This psychological deterioration . . . has commenced and
a life-threatening vascular catastrophe was imminent. He was incapable of
attending to any practical matters concerning his legal affairs or his
general living needs.'
Dr Goldie says he began 'psycho-analytic psychotherapy' three or four times
a week. He concludes: 'One cannot estimate exactly his full potential and
when the maximum benefit from psychotherapy will have been attained, but
considering his past history and present developments the duration should be
thought of as being at least 12 months and most probably two to three
years.'

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: Headless chickens and dead cats strain
island loyalties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT sounds more like the first ritualistic warning from the Sicilian Mafia -
headless chickens left pinned to the door, and a dead cat flung through the
window.
Such have been the threats against both the lawyer acting for Polly Peck's
administrators and the former head of Mr Asil Nadir's privately owned bank
on the island, as the Pounds 1bn UK financial scandal strains the loyalties
of this tiny Mediterranean community.
Whether or not Mr Nadir was involved in the attempt to frighten off both the
respected advocate Mr Orhan Bilgehan and Mr Kemal Birgen, the former boss of
Kibris Endustrii Bankasi, the incidents point to a darker side of the Polly
Peck story. 'Such things are common in a Mediterranean mentality. I've had
threats myself,' says Mr Mentes Aziz, Mr Nadir's personal lawyer and a
former policeman under the British rule.
Everyone from the northern Cyprus president Rauf Denktash to the underworld
bosses is watching anxiously for Mr Nadir's next move as, like Napoleon on
Elba, he contemplates his future from his island exile.
In such a tiny community, no one dares break ranks and tell what may have
really happened - least of all the government which has benefited from Mr
Nadir's, or rather PPI's, generous financial support. It may conceivably
benefit again if, as many Cypriots believe, Mr Nadir does have some money
squirrelled away.
The local mood is best summed up by one local casino owner. 'Whatever he has
he brought to Cyprus. That counts for all us lot here when the rest of the
world has turned its back on us,' he said.
The Nadir affair will no doubt reinforce the international isolation of the
self-proclaimed north Cyprus republic, declared in the wake of Turkey's
invasion in 1974 which ended intercommunal violence but left the island
divided.
The UK authorities have lost all hope of any co-operation from Mr Denktash.
The administrators appointed in October 1990 have had a frustrating 32
months in pursuit of PPI's Cyprus assets - the fruit business Sunzest,
Unipac, the Famagusta packing operation, and the three hotels.
Mr Aziz, acting for the local companies, has issued 23 separate injunctions
to block access to their accounts - including his own claim for Pounds
250,000 owed him by the administrators.
Little has been forthcoming from Mr Huseyin Erdal, head of the local
accountants who audited the PPI Cyprus books. Contacted at his Nicosia
office this week, Mr Erdal declined to discuss the case. Mr Erdal is
understood to be wanted for questioning by the UK's Serious Fraud Office.
The island operations, which are still under Mr Nadir's control, appear not
to have been cash-rich, as was at one time assumed by stock analysts in
London. The idea that the banks in Cyprus held cash deposits of Pounds 200m,
as stated in the PPI accounts, is dismissed by local officials who point out
that this is more than the total foreign exchange reserves of the entire
banking system.
Why, local bankers ask, did Mr Nadir not settle the 60bn of Turkish lira
(Pounds 3.7m) owed to the social security authorities? Why is Ms Elizabeth
Forsyth, a close associate of Mr Nadir who worked in London at South Audley
Management, a company with links to the Nadir family, driving around the
island in an old Mercedes once owned by Mr Nadir's father? Furthermore, why
has her telephone been cut off for non-payment of her bill?
One group which clearly believes Mr Nadir can salvage the situation is the
financial advisers, former partners and girlfriends, and of course the
pilots who facilitated his escape. They can all be found at the Jasmine
Court Hotel, one of the PPI assets over which the UK court-appointed
administrators have still not gained access.
They might like to learn of Mr Iskender Tarsuslugil, the Turkish businessman
now under investigation by the SFO for lending money to Mr Nadir in breach
of the terms of his bankruptcy. He was given short shrift during a visit to
Cyprus two weeks ago. Company officials say Mr Nadir refused to see him.
The money he lent to Mr Nadir was borrowed from a Turkish bank against a
house in Glebe Place, Chelsea, in the name of Mrs Leslie Ellwood, Mr Nadir's
former girlfriend and mother of two of his children. She stands to lose the
house if the loan is not paid in July. Mrs Ellwood is also currently on the
island.
Meanwhile President Denktash has tried to distance himself from the man he
once famously described as his economic commander. Foreign minister Mr Kenan
Atakol referred to Mr Nadir as a liability, but asked not to be quoted.
But severing those ties will not be easy. Hasan Ercakica, editor of the
opposition Yeniduzen newspaper, points out that the ruling National (UBP)
party only secured victory at the last election in May 1990 as a result of
PPI, through its newspapers, Kibris, Bozkurt and YeniGun and through cash
and in-kind payments to villages who voted for the UBP.
Even Turkey, which avows non-interference in the island's internal politics,
openly canvassed through TRT, the Turkish state television, the Turkish
ambassador, and parliamentary deputies who visited the island. Much will
depend on Turkey's attitude to the Nadir affair. The SFO has made some
progress persuading the Turks to provide banking records related to PPI.
Some say Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has been hurt by the
uncomfortable parallels between between Mr Nadir and his own playboy nephew,
Mr Yahya Demirel, who for many months took refuge in Cyprus, and has been
charged in Turkey with fraudulently obtaining money from a Turkish state
bank.

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: The Colonel decides to fall on his sword -
The end of a minister with a history of backing losers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON July 24 1989, as the losers and winners from Mrs Margaret Thatcher's 11th
reshuffle played out their parts in Downing Street, a burly, bushy-eyebrowed
MP strode past reporters, chuckling at the commotion across the street.
'Who's in and who's out?' asked Mr Michael Mates, MP for East Hampshire,
making a brief appearance unconnected with the drama across the street.
Almost exactly four years later Mr Mates himself was 'out'. Known around
Westminster as the Colonel because of his long Army career, he had finally
done the decent thing and fallen on his sword.
Perhaps it was surprising that his career embraced a period of ministerial
responsibility, given a streak of stubborn independence and outspokenness
which can lie uneasily alongside political office. Preferment was never on
the cards for a standard bearer of the Tory party's centre-left while Mrs
Thatcher was at Number 10. He never regained favour with the Tory right
after campaigning for Mr William (now Lord) Whitelaw for the leadership in
1975.
Mr Mates has since been closely aligned with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
and industry secretary, acting as his chief lieutenant in the trade and
industry secretary's 'wilderness years' between the 1986 Westland affair and
the 1990 leadership election.
Given that record, and the latest revelations concerning his links with Mr
Asil Nadir, the MP acquired something of a reputation for backing losers.
Even his finest hour, at the head of a full-scale Tory rebellion against
elements of the poll tax, ended in failure - crushed under the weight of a
100-seat Commons majority.
Now 59, Mr Mates started his political career 19 years ago by applying to
become Tory parliamentary candidate for Petersfield - now East Hampshire -
even before he had joined the party. He told his selection meeting he would
join if they chose him.
Continually passed over for ministerial office, Mr Mates concentrated on his
interests in defence policy and Northern Ireland, serving on several Commons
and backbench Tory committees. He chaired the all-party defence select
committee but found controversy over failure to disclose his business
connections with two defence-related companies. bringing criticism from the
committee on members' interests.
Appointed last year as a Northern Ireland minister, he warmed to the job.
But he never managed to win a following in the province, with nationalists
regarding him as as a slightly pompous Englishman unlikely to be hard on the
Army establishment.
Controversy returned once his links with Mr Nadir became public. In spite of
a strenuous defence, his chances of survival were not helped by a lack of
committed friends at Westminster.
The flow of damaging leaks inevitably spelled the end. The detail of Mr
Mates's misfortunes became swamped in the embarrassment that the affair was
inflicting on the prime minister and his government. In the end, he could
not avoid the fate which he had so rashly encouraged Mr Nadir to resist.

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: Senior figures seeking donations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR said last night that he was courted by senior figures in the
Conservative party seeking donations to Tory funds, Our Political Staff
writes. He said he had been to numerous lunches at the House of Commons
where he discussed policy with leading Tory figures including the then prime
minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Speaking to ITN from northern Cyprus, the former Polly Peck chairman said he
donated funds to the Conservative party because he believed in its policies.
He denied the donations had been made covertly.
'What I will say about the donations is, those donations were not done in a
secret manner from secret bank accounts or from overseas bank accounts. It
was done perfectly openly from an account of one of the companies that were
wholly owned subsidiaries.' Nadir said he expected nothing in return and
found it absurd to suggest he was trying to buy a knighthood.
When the Serious Fraud Office began to investigate Polly Peck, Mr Nadir went
to see his constituency MP, Peter Brooke, now the Heritage Secretary. He
said: 'Well, he was extremely sympathetic.'

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: Lengthy saga undermines PM's authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AFFAIR of Mr Michael Mates was more than a boil that had to be lanced.
There was a broader subtext about Mr John Major's style of government and
his control of his increasingly fractious party.
The resignation of the Northern Ireland minister leaves Mr Major weakened -
not because of the importance of Mr Mates, but because of the impression of
indecision that has pervaded around Downing Street.
The majority view among Conservative MPs was that the embarrasment and
damaging uncertainty might have been avoided if the prime minister had made
clear earlier and beyond doubt whether he believed Mr Mates should go or
stay.
There was regret that the lessons of the build up to Mr David Mellor's
resignation as Heritage Secretary last September had apparently not been
learnt.
For the past week Downing Street has repeatedly maintained that the Northern
Ireland minister was not guilty of a significant misdemeanour.
But when Mr Mates, with considerable political gumption, said he enjoyed the
'full confidence' of the prime minister, Downing Street refused to endorse
his words.
Little effort was made to stop reports of Mr Major happily leaving the final
verdict to the last night's meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs.
Most Tory MPs were sure that Mr Mates's resignation was inevitable. In the
event, Mr Mates resigned four hours before the meeting started.
Last night some Tory MPs were prepared to attack the media for trying to
dictate the composition of Mr Major's administration. The prime minister did
not join them. 'Assault. I see no assault,' he replied to one such Tory. He
perhaps accepted that much of the blame for Mr Mates's downfall, and the
fall-out on the Tory party, lay at his door.

FT  25 JUN 93 / The Mates Resignation: Lengthy saga damages Major
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE AFFAIR of Mr Michael Mates was more than a boil that had to be lanced.
There was a broader subtext about Mr John Major's style of government and
his control over an increasingly fractious Conservative party.
The resignation of the Northern Ireland minister leaves Mr Major weakened -
not because of the importance of Mr Mates, but because of the impression of
indecision that has pervaded around Downing Street.
Mr Mates, in his resignation letter, portrayed a picture of a prime minister
under pressure from the media and Tory MPs, The watch he sent Mr Asil Nadir,
inscribed, 'don't let the buggers get you down', should, in retrospect, have
been sent to the prime minister, Mr Mates wrote. 'You need and deserve the
staunch support of the whole party,' he added.
The majority view among Conservative MPs last night was that the
embarrasment and damaging uncertainty might have been avoided if the prime
minister had made clear earlier and beyond doubt whether he believed Mr
Mates should go or stay. For the past week Downing Street has repeatedly
maintained that the Northern Ireland minister was not guilty of a
significant misdemeanour. The gift of a watch was a mistake 'but not a
hanging offence'; the loan of a car was 'pretty trivial'.
But when Mr Mates, with considerable political gumption, said he enjoyed the
'full confidence' of the prime minister, Downing Street refused to endorse
his words.
Little effort was made to stop reports of Mr Major happily leaving the final
verdict to the last night's meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs.
Some Conservative MPs accused Mr Mates as trying to push the prime minister
around.
It is now clear that the 1922 Committee meeting would have been bitter and
divisive. Most Conservative MPs were sure that Mr Mates's resignation was
inevitable. Even his political allies saw the cumulative effect of a
succession of newspaper revelations as corrosive. But there was evidence of
last-minute lobbying by some of Mr Mates' friends. Accusations of 'dirty
tricks' against the Northern Ireland minister gained ground - fuelled last
night by the text of Mr Mates' resignation letter complaining of 'widely
inaccurate' leaks.
In the event, Mr Mates resigned four hours before the meeting started. His
fate followed a familiar pattern. Since the election, Mr Norman Lamont, the
former chancellor, and Mr David Mellor, the former national heritage
secretary, have also been victims of newspaper attacks, whispers of disquiet
among Tory MPs, and then ignominious resignation.
Last night some Tory MPs were prepared to attack the media for trying to
dictate the composition of Mr Major's administration, for turning on
ministers like a pack of wolves.
The prime minister did not join them. 'Assault. I seen no assault,' he
replied to one such Tory, rewriting the words of Nelson. He perhaps accepted
that much of the blame for Mr Mates' downfall, and the fall-out on the
Conservative party, lay at his door.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Council chiefs jeer at Banham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JOHN BANHAM, chairman of the Local Government Commission for England,
yesterday warned local authorities against mounting an 'expensive publicly
financed job-preservation exercise'.
He told the annual conference of the Association of District Councils in
Bournemouth that some district councils had spent as much as Pounds 100,000
on lobbyists during the first phases of the commission's reorganisation of
local government.
His comments provoked a hostile response, including jeers and hisses from
councillors and officials. Some delegates called for his resignation.
The association opposes Sir John's recommendations to create large unitary
authorities.
Local authorities in England suffered the loss of 42,000 jobs between March
1992 and March 1993, according to a survey published today by Municipal
Journal.

FT  25 JUN 93 / When Churchill halted SOE plan: The latest public records to
be released
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINSTON Churchill's wartime staff at 10 Downing Street were shocked by a
suggestion from a minister that the undercover activities of the Special
Operations Executive should continue after the war to help maintain control
in liberated Europe.
The disclosure, along with Churchill's dismissive response, is contained in
papers released yesterday for public scrutiny by the Public Record Office.
The Earl of Selborne, the economic warfare minister responsible for the SOE,
one of the most effective of the covert agencies spawned during the war,
sought the backing of the prime minister in May 1944 for the continuation of
the organisation's operations after the end of the war.
'In the administration of territories, liberated or conquered, there is
great scope for below the surface activity . . . if separatist movements
arise in Germany, SOE could pass the sinews of war to them without
incriminating HMG,' he wrote.
A note to Churchill from his private secretary expresses shock at the 'novel
proposal that HMG should take part in commercial bribery and corruption in
peacetime'.
The prime minister's response was brief: 'My dear Top,' he wrote. 'The part
that your naughty deeds in war can play in peace cannot at all be considered
at the present time.'
Over 10,000 men and 3,000 women worked for SOE at its peak in 1943, running
agents and encouraging resistance and sabotage behind enemy lines.
Other papers give additional information on the murder of Cora Crippen in
1910 by her husband, Dr Hawley Harvey Crippen, the most sensational murder
case of its day, and his subsequent trial and execution.
Crippen fled Britain with his mistress Ethel le Neve, 13 years his junior,
after apparently poisoning his wife at their home in north London. The
couple were arrested at sea after the captain of the liner on which they
were fleeing recognised them.
Home Office files on Crippen were originally intended to remain closed for
100 years but have now been released as part of the prime minister's push
for more open government.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Pay curb 'to hit living standards'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS covered by the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector settlement
pay limit will start experiencing cuts in living standards when the limit is
implemented for most groups this autumn, according to the latest analysis
from the Public Finance Foundation.
The foundation, an independent research body, says most public servants will
receive the 1.5 per cent rise at a time when inflation will be back to 3 per
cent and private-sector pay will be rising at about 4 per cent. The
foundation estimates that by next January inflation will be up to 4 per cent
and private-sector pay to 5 per cent.
Although the public-sector limit has so far been accepted with little
opposition, Mr Chris Trinder, the foundation's research director, says that
could change when the depressant effect on real earnings - combined with
next year's increase in National Insurance - starts to become apparent.
He also warns the government against the temptation of imposing a second
year of a settlement limit just because the first year has run so smoothly.
The Fire Brigades Union is, so far, the only big group to threaten
resistance to the limit. The RMT transport union is also holding a strike
ballot of its British Rail members against the limit but officials do not
believe they will win a strike mandate.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, was strongly committed to not
repeating the fixed settlement limit. Since his departure officials have
continued to insist that, while there must be no 'catch-up' on public-sector
pay, there will be a more flexible approach next year.
The Confederation of British Industry, which was an important influence
behind this year's 1.5 per cent limit, is also keen to see a mixture of
restraint and flexibility.
CBI officials say they want to see a ceiling on public-sector organisations'
pay bills, rather than on each individual's pay rise. Northumbrian Water
yesterday announced that it is extending into a fourth year its agreement to
give pay increases pegged to the inflation rate. The previous RPI agreement
had covered 1991-1992 to 1993-1994.
'The company council deserves credit for this forward-looking agreement and
it is good news for both the employees and the company', said Dr Jon
Hargreaves, Northumbrian Water managing director.

FT  25 JUN 93 / CBI says weak exports may threaten upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEAKENING in export demand from continental Europe may hold back the
expected recovery by manufacturing industry, a Confederation of British
Industry report says today.
It indicates that many manufacturers have become less confident over the
past two months about output growth this year, in line with signs of
economic fragility on the Continent and falling consumer confidence in the
UK.
The survey fits with other evidence that, after relatively strong growth in
the first quarter, the economy may have entered a new phase.
One bright spot from the report is that few manufacturers expect to increase
prices in the next four months, which suggests general inflationary
pressures remain muted.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said the survey indicated a
'small setback' for export orders. He pointed out that overseas orders
remained stronger than at any time between August 1990 and April this year,
reflecting a boost to competitiveness from the fall in sterling and the
success by many manufacturers in controlling costs.
The CBI's monthly survey of 1,606 manufacturers was conducted between May 28
and June 16. The employers' body said the report did not alter its view that
the UK would see reasonably good growth this year. Also, despite the fall in
export orders, domestic demand might have picked up slightly in the past
month.
Of the companies questioned, 21 per cent said export order books were above
normal and 31 per cent said they were below. The balance of 10 per cent
expressing a negative view compares with a balance of 5 per cent in the May
survey and a balance of 22 per cent cent saying order books were below
normal in April.
A balance of 12 per cent of companies expect output volumes to increase in
the next four months, after a comparable balance of 23 per cent in May and
one of 14 per cent in April.
Total order books are largely unchanged from May, with price rises expected
to remain subdued. The survey indicates the lowest net proportion of
companies since last November believes it will raise prices in the next four
months.
Stocks of finished goods remain more than adequate to meet demand, though
stock levels have been run down slightly since May. Finished goods stocks
are rated as more than adequate by 19 per cent of businesses and less than
adequate by 5 per cent.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Church to reduce property holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHURCH Commissioners, who have faced criticism for their management of
the Church of England's assets, plan substantial changes to their
property-dominated investment portfolio. Their policy is now to reduce
property holdings when the market allows.
Problems in the property market have been largely responsible for the
capital value of the commissioners' income-producing assets falling from
nearly Pounds 3bn in 1989 to Pounds 2.16bn last year. The proportion of the
church's property holdings - about half its total investments -
substantially exceeds that of most other institutions.
After criticism of the commissioners' asset management last year, Dr George
Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, asked Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy
firm, to produce a report. He also established a group including several
senior business figures to consider investment issues. The group is due to
report later this year.
In their annual report yesterday the commissioners acknowledged that in the
late 1980s their portfolio had been 'too heavily tilted' toward commercial
property development. 'We are now addressing these issues, and borrowings to
finance property development have been substantially reduced. Our target is
a more appropriate balance between our property and stock exchange assets.'
Sir Michael Colman, chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman and the recently-appointed
first church estates commissioner, said other leading investment funds
regarded 15 per cent property holdings as 'quite a lot in today's climate'.
His eventual aim would be for the church to be 'not too far away from what
other major funds are doing'.
Financial pressures on the commissioners are forcing them to reduce their
contribution to clergy stipends. The contribution fell from 45 per cent to
41 per cent last year and is likely to drop below 30 per cent by 1996.
Shortfalls have to be met through increased financial support from church
members.
Another heavy financial demand on the commissioners arises from the mounting
cost of clergy pensions. For the first time last year spending on pensions -
Pounds 63.9m - exceeded the Pounds 62.7m for stipends.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Pounds 208m spent on commercial property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL investors spent a net Pounds 208m on commercial property in
the first quarter of this year, says the Department of Trade and Industry,
Vanessa Houlder writes.
The figures show a marked upturn on the final quarter of last year, when
institutions sold Pounds 65m more property than they bought. The first
quarter figure, however, is down on the Pounds 366m that was invested in the
same period last year.
Analysts expect a strong increase in the second-quarter investment figures,
reflecting a surge in activity in the commercial property market. Some
institutions have been attracted back into property by the belief that
prices have stopped falling and that property is good value compared with
gilts and equities.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tebbit attacks EC farming
'conspiracy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD TEBBIT, the staunch Tory anti-Maastricht campaigner, last night
attacked the European Community's agriculture policy as 'a Franco-German
conspiracy'.
The former cabinet minister was speaking in the Lords on the fourth day of
committee stage debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, the
measure which would ratify the Maastricht treaty.
He protested that the Common Agricultural Policy subsidised Greek tobacco
farmers while the Community was unable to save the jobs of British coal
miners.
He said: 'If we applied the CAP argument to the coal mining communities of
north-east England, or Wales or Scotland, we would have a very different
look to this country.
'They are communities who are finding it extremely difficult to find
alternative work - and, I might add, the product of their labours was
essentially useful and not essentially dangerous.'
He complained: 'But these, after all, are mere English, Scots and Welsh
miners, and they're not to be treated with the same kid-glove approach as
the Greek tobacco farmers.
'Where is the equity? Where is the sense of being 'communautaire'? Where is
the social cohesion in these matters?'
Supporting calls to remove CAP provisions from the Bill, he condemned the
policy 'a Franco-German conspiracy against the public interest of the
citizens of the Community and particularly against those of the UK and,
indeed, the citizens of the world'.
Pressed by Lord Bonham-Carter (Lib Dem) on whether he had changed his
general stance on Europe, Lord Tebbit said: 'You must not assume that we all
through life resolutely resolve to refuse to learn from our experiences.
'I voted (to join the EC in 1973) on the basis that, if we were at the heart
of Europe, we would be able to resolve these things.'
Junior employment minister Viscount Ullswater told him that Britain, by
being at the heart of Europe, had succeeded in getting CAP reform onto the
Community's agenda and some progress was now being made.
The committee stage debate was adjourned until Monday.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: British Coal seeks buyers for more
pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Coal yesterday offered a further five pits it no longer wants to
mine to the private sector and said it was receiving 30 inquiries a week for
all mines which have so far been advertised.
Yesterday's additions were Vane Tempest, Seaham and Westoe in the north-east
of England, Grimethorpe and the linked Houghton Main in Yorkshire and
Trentham in Staffordshire. Potential licensees must register their interest
by July 16.
British Coal has now advertised 14 of the 20 pits it intends to offer to
private operators because it no longer sees a market for them under its
control.
Mr Eddy Hindmarsh, the corporations' head of operations, said it was too
early to say how many full tender submissions would result. But there was no
operational reason why some of the mines currently being preserved on a care
and maintenance basis should not be back in production in the autumn.
British Coal has already started to close some of the 12 pits it reprieved
in March.
Labour is expected to try and rekindle public interest in the issue by
focusing on coal when it next has the opportunity to select the subject of a
House of Commons debate early next month.
The move follows a scathing attack on the government's coal white paper by
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, who this week described
the document as a 'fraud' intended not to save the jobs of miners but of
'ministers in the House.'

<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is continuing to
make good progress in hospital in Venice following his mild heart attack
earlier this week, his department said yesterday.
It is expected that he will fly back to the UK in the next few days and will
undergo further medical tests.
During Mr Heseltine's absence, ministers at the DTI will continue to fulfil
the responsibilities described in their portfolios and to represent the
department as appropriate at cabinet committees.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, DTI minister of state, will attend cabinet meetings as the
department's most senior minister.
Mr Sainsbury will also take responsibility for issues requiring a decision
by a minister.
His responsibilities cover areas such as industrial competitiveness;
electronics and mechanical engineering; aerospace; shipbuilding and regional
development.
Trade minister Mr Richard Needham told a conference of 120 business people
yesterday that they should target the Asia Pacific Rim for energy exports.
Mr Needham said the area offered an unequalled rate of development and while
British industry had made some inroads, more could be done.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew promises fresh effort for
talks on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, last night pledged to
explore all avenues that might be fruitful in an attempt to restart talks on
constitutional change in the province.
Sir Patrick told the Commons he was keen to assist in reopening a political
dialogue and build on the advances made in talks over the last two years.
But he acknowledged: 'Regrettably a lot more progress must yet be made
before direct rule will no longer be needed in the interests of all the
people of Northern Ireland.'
There were issues that required 'further, private consideration' between the
British government, the Irish government and Northern Ireland parties.
Sir Patrick was introducing the Northern Ireland Act (Interim Period
Extension) Order, which extends direct rule for another year.
Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said he was moving
away from a 'neutral agenda' towards an internal settlement.
He said: 'It's now time for both the British and Irish governments to
reinvigorate and deepen their co-operation within the Anglo-Irish Agreement.
The two governments should seek to make whatever progress is possible and
seek ways to share responsibility and ensure the needs of the people of
Northern Ireland are met.
'If the parties themselves are not able to meet together and talk together .
. there is increasing responsibility on both governments to sit down and
resolve their differences.'
Earlier, Sir Patrick underlined the government's resolve to defeat
terrorism. There were 75 murders by terrorists in Northern Ireland last year
and 33 so far this year, he said.

Last year 405 people were charged with terrorist-related offences -
including 101 with murder and attempted murder. By June this year, 158
people had been charged, he said.

OFFER, the electricity regulator, said yesterday that Pounds 1.35bn was
raised last year through the fossil fuel levy on electricity consumers.
About 98 per cent of this went to nuclear power generators.
Renewable generators, who produce electricity from sources including wind
and the sun, received the remaining 2 per cent but their share is likely to
rise to 6 per cent this year.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Call for halt to changes in
curriculum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A THREE-YEAR halt to further changes in the national curriculum was urged
yesterday.
A report by Dr Rosemary Webb of Manchester University, found that teachers
laboured under an 'enormous burden of work' and no longer found any joy in
the job because of the number of changes already implemented.
The report is aimed at Sir Ron Dearing, who is conducting an urgent
government-ordered review of the national curriculum.
In her study of primary schools, commissioned by the 146,000-strong
Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Dr Webb described the national
curriculum as 'overloaded'.
A reduction in content was needed across all subjects, she said.
During the three-year lull, Dr Webb suggested schools should be allowed to
choose to cover 70 per cent of the curriculum subjects.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: N Ireland prison staff vote for
action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland's 3,000 prison officers have voted overwhelmingly in favour
of industrial action because of overcrowding in jails.
Prison Officers' Association officials in the province said yesterday that
80 per cent of those members balloted supported some form of action.
The POA committee for Northern Ireland is due to meet today to discuss what
form the action should take, but it is not expected to involve a strike.
Any action will hit the Maze, Crumlin Road, Magilligan, and Maghaberry
prisons as well as a young offenders' centre in Belfast.
The Northern Ireland Office said overcrowding claims were exaggerated but
POA officials said the situation in the province had become intolerable.
Some prisoners were having to share two to a cell, and in some cases there
were three to a cell, it said.
Speculation that US president Bill Clinton may send a peace envoy to the
province was renewed yesterday.
The new US ambassador to Ireland, Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, presented her
credentials to Irish President Mary Robinson in Dublin and said she planned
to visit Northern Ireland.
Mrs Kennedy Smith, sister of President John F Kennedy, said a US peace envoy
was still on the agenda 'and may come up at a future date', but added: 'At
the moment, it's not being considered.' She took up her position almost 30
years to the day after she accompanied President Kennedy on his historic
first visit to Ireland.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government relents on export cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Government yesterday bowed to business pressure by increasing the
insurance cover it offers to exporters.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said 'transitional' reinsurance support
provided to export insurers by the government's Export Credits Guarantee
Department would be extended by at least three years.
The facility - introduced when the ECGD's short-term export credit insurance
business was privatised in 1991 - was to be phased out at the end of next
year, threatening more than Pounds 1bn in exports annually.
'We are not going to be in a position where British exporters are going to
fail to get business because of a lack of cover,' declared Mr Needham, who
said that he had responded to representations made to him.
Details of how the reinsurance scheme will work have yet to be thrashed out,
but exporters and their insurers have welcomed the move.
'This is good news,' said Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute
of Export. 'We have to export our way out of the recession. This kind of
support is very helpful.'
'The decision to extend the transitional reinsurance facility will greatly
assist British exporters to make long-term and strategic business plans,'
said Mr Colin Foxall, managing director of NCM Credit Insurance, the
country's biggest export credit insurer.
'It takes a lot of the uncertainty away for British exporters,' added Mr
Terry Bridgman, director of Trade Indemnity, the credit insurer, which along
with other smaller players in the market will benefit from government
reinsurance support for the first time.
NCM controls about 80 per cent of the market for short-term export credit
insurance. TI has about 15 per cent. When it privatised ECGD's short-term
business in December 1991, the government had hoped there would be
sufficient reinsurance capacity available in the private sector. However, a
sharp contraction in the reinsurance market has since occurred and exports
have risen.
'It has become clear that in the immediate future capacity in the private
reinsurance market may well not expand sufficiently to meet the likely
demand for short term export credit insurance,' said Mr Needham.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Challenger holds key for Vickers
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Challenger 2 tank, on which the long-term prosperity of Vickers, the
engineering company, may depend, was put through its paces for the first
time yesterday, Daniel Green writes.
The Ministry of Defence has ordered 140, while Oman has signed a contract
for 18. The future of one of Vickers' two tank factories at Newcastle upon
Tyne and Leeds, which employ 800 workers each, depends on further orders.
The MoD plans to upgrade its fleet of more than 400 Challenger 1 tanks. But
the Army would be happy to have a smaller number, perhaps 200, of Challenger
2s.
An order for 200 of the new tank would be worth between Pounds 400m and
Pounds 600m and would keep Vickers working for up to six more years.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten row over leaked plan for
school premises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, was yesterday at the centre of a
fresh political row after leaked ministerial correspondence revealed a
cabinet split over plans to scrap 'inessential' regulations covering school
premises in England and Wales.
The correspondence, leaked by Labour, indicates senior ministers do not all
agree with Mr Patten's proposals to deregulate quantity and quality
standards for school playing fields. The plans also call for the abandonment
of some rules governing teaching space standards.
The letters pinpoint Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, as the chief
cabinet dissenter on the grounds that a 'less prescriptive' approach would
be better than 'complete abandonment of any standards.'
Warning Mr Patten not to underestimate the 'flak' the measure would attract,
Mr Brooke said deregulation was likely to be seen by the 'playing field
lobby' as 'a cost saving device, with potentially disastrous results for
team games and for the ability to deliver the PE requirements of the
National Curriculum.'
Without the reference point provided by minimum standards, 'it is difficult
to see how you will be able to judge whether the school playing field space
is adequate or not in considering any application to dispose of such land,'
Mr Brooke said.
Deregulation would also 'add to the lobby mounted following the winding up
of the Play Unit that this government does not take children's play
sufficiently seriously.'
Mr David Hunt, the former Welsh secretary, warned that the issue was a
'sensitive' one 'which will need careful presentation.' On balance, however,
he supported the idea.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, urged that the 'benefit'
of deregulation be extended 'in practice' to independent schools.
In a letter to Mr Hunt, Mr Patten said the regulations were being reviewed
because the 'costs of compliance go well beyond any realistic prospect of
the capital expenditure which is likely to be made available for improving
existing buildings.'
'Almost any outcome is bound to become controversial. But we now need to
grasp the nettle,' he said.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, accused Mr Patten of showing
'total contempt' for the concerns of parents, governors, teachers and
pupils. Mr Patten had admitted the 'Conservative policy of allowing the
fabric of our schools to crumble has been a disaster,' she said.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Troops may test out future weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence is likely in future to let soldiers try out weapons
before production of them is started, the Commons defence committee
suggested yesterday.
A report by the committee related the troubled tale of the Army's new SA80
rifle, which has been through 32 modifications at a cost of Pounds 24m.
'The lesson the ministry (has) learned is that the general usage of the
weapon should be tested in the hands of soldiers during the design and
development phase,' the committee said.
'We have to express some surprise that it has taken over 300 years of
personal weapon usage by the British army to discover this fact.'
The 'catalogue of faults' included early-production weapons that could fire
spontaneously if dropped on their muzzles; safety catches that could break:
firing pins that did break; magazines that could fall off; a bayonet that
not only could fall off but which broke at the tip and was difficult to
sharpen; and triggers that had to be manually flicked back into position
after firing.
The committee was particularly damning about the 'shoddy' cleaning kit,
which included a leaky oil bottle and poor brushes. It said it was
astonished that the MoD could have accepted such equipment into service.
It would be an outrage, it added, if the ministry found itself liable for
changing the cleaning kits after paying Pounds 9m for them.
Incorrect cleaning drill was blamed for snags during the army's Gulf
deployment in 1990-91, which the committee said 'could have had disastrous
consequences'.
Evidence to the committee by British Aerospace, whose Royal Ordnance
subsidiary makes the rifle, acknowledged that 'adverse publicity'
surrounding the SA80 had deterred foreign customers.
Future export prospects appeared to be small, although a few had been sold
to Mozambique and Jamaica. The rifle's reputation was 'unreasonably
tarnished' by early troubles, it said.
The committee agreed that the rifle was a significant improvement on the
weapons it replaced. Although it could not be fired from the left shoulder,
it was 'a highly accurate weapon and sound when properly maintained'.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Council refuses to pay Pounds 5m to bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOCAL authority is refusing to repay more than Pounds 5m to Credit Suisse,
the Swiss bank, on the grounds that the council itself acted unreasonably
and outside its powers when it first guaranteed that it would pay the money.
Allerdale Borough Council in the Lake District faces a claim by Credit
Suisse for Pounds 5.23m plus interest on a loan to a development company the
council set up to build a leisure complex and timeshare lodges at Keswick
railway station.
The project, launched in 1985, failed to keep up with revenue forecasts, and
Allerdale Development Company went into liquidation in November 1990. The
High Court hearing about the issue, scheduled for up to five weeks, is seen
as a test case for councils which have entered into similar guarantees.
Mr Christopher Clarke QC, for Credit Suisse, said the council was suing Mr
Anthony Perry, its former chief executive, to make him liable for any sum up
to Pounds 6m it might be ordered to pay Credit Suisse.
It was also suing Cipfa Services, owned by the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy, which advised the council at the time. Mr Perry had
also made an application against the council to an industrial tribunal. The
case was postponed pending the result of the hearing.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS, winner of a best airline food and wine prize, is having to
make embarrassing refunds to business class passengers from Gatwick who are
being served sandwiches instead of a full meal on some European services.
It has been forced to downgrade its normal Club class service on some
Gatwick flights because of a shortage of cabin crew and an unexpected
upsurge in traffic.
Disgruntled Club class passengers are being refunded the difference between
their fare and the normal economy fare to compensate for the substandard
meal service. Economy passengers are being given vouchers to buy
refreshments at airports.
A BA official said the airline had been a 'victim of its own success'.
'We just did not expect so much traffic on our new Gatwick services,' he
explained, adding that BA was recruiting an additional 35 former Dan-Air
employees to boost flight crews on the Gatwick services.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Small tour operators welcome OFT holiday inquiry: Travel
agents favour large companies over independents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT tour operators were delighted yesterday at news that the Office
of Fair Trading has launched an inquiry into the links between large holiday
companies and travel agents. Many say their brochures are increasingly kept
off the racks of the large travel agents.
Approval, however, was not universal. Mr Nicholas Leche, managing director
of Continental Villas, which sells luxury holidays in the West Indies, the
Mediterranean and other destinations, said the large groups' behaviour
caused him no difficulties.
'It's a lot of whingeing,' he said. Continental Villas sells most of its
holidays through independent travel agents, although it does also use Hogg
Robinson and American Express. Mr Leche says he would not want to use the
other large retail outlets anyway. 'By and large, they've got idiots on the
counter,' he says.
Others feel they cannot afford to take such a relaxed attitude. Mr Peter
Kerkar, chief executive of Cox &amp; Kings Travel, says Lunn Poly, the largest
retailer, will not carry brochures for his company's holidays to India,
Latin America and Russia. He says: 'They say we don't have enough sales
volume through them. The irony is if they don't rack us we'll never have
enough sales volume through them.'
Over the past year, links have tightened between the three largest operators
 -Thomson, Airtours and Owners Abroad - and the largest retail outlets.
Thomson has owned Lunn Poly for 20 years. The travel industry had long
accepted that the Thomson-Lunn Poly link was an arm's-length one, allowing
other operators to sell their holidays through the retailer's shops. Last
September, though, Airtours, the fast growing tour operator run by Mr David
Crossland, bought the 333 Pickfords branches.
It failed in its attempt earlier this year to buy Owners Abroad, after Mr
Michael Heseltine rejected the OFT's advice that the bid be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Earlier this month, Airtours bought the
214 Hogg Robinson branches and is rumoured to be buying Aspro, another
operator.
Unlike Thomson, Airtours did not hide its intention of using its travel
agents to push its own holidays. Pickfords would not stop selling other
companies' products, Mr Crossland said, but if each branch made just one
more Airtours booking each week, it would add Pounds 2m to pre-tax profits.
Independent operators say Pickfords staff are given extra incentives to sell
Airtours holidays and that that has resulted in other travel agents doing
the same.
Airtours refused to comment, but Lunn Poly and Thomas Cook, which is linked
to Owners Abroad, admitted that they had recently introduced staff
incentives. Lunn Poly said that staff would, for the first time, be offered
incentives to sell the holidays of four operators: Thomson, Virgin Holidays,
Sunworld and Cosmos. Lunn Poly would not say how much the incentive was or
whether it was paid in cash or in operators' holidays.
Thomas Cook said that for the past two years, staff have been offered
incentives to sell the holidays of 45 companies, including all the large
operators. The incentive was in the form of points that staff collect
towards a trip offered by one of the operators. Thomas Cook said, given the
number of operators involved, it did not think the programme restricted
consumer choice.
Mr Christopher Kirker, managing director of Kirker Europe Holidays, a small
company selling short breaks to European cities, said travel agents should
be made to tell consumers about such incentives. He said: 'The basic issue
is whether it's right from the public's point of view that they should be
hoodwinked . . . I'm not particularly against incentives . . . I'm against
the public not being told what's going on.'

FT  25 JUN 93 / Nicotine patch plea rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY selling nicotine patches designed to help smokers give up
cigarettes failed in the High Court yesterday to challenge an official
ruling that its product was 'medicinal'.
The ruling by the Medicines Control Agency means it would be a criminal
offence to sell Nicostop patches without a licence.
Tobyward, a mail order company of Stratford, east London, asked Mr Justice
Tucker for permission to seek a judicial review and a declaration that
Nicostop was not a medicinal product, as defined under the 1968 Medicines
Act, and a licence was not therefore required. The judge said the
application was 'premature and misconceived'.

<TEXT>
CARLSBERG-TETLEY, Britain's second-largest brewer, is to shed about 300 jobs
as part of a rationalisation affecting three of its breweries and several
depots, Guy de Jonquieres writes.
The company said the cuts were caused by keen competition in a declining
beer market. Most of the redundancies will be at breweries in Burton,
Wrexham and Northampton. The company also plans to close or relocate three
depots in Wales, with the loss of 12 jobs.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Relief and cheers at winning dockyard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORK at Devonport dockyard in Plymouth, on the banks of the Tamar between
Devon and Cornwall, had virtually stopped by 3.30pm yesterday as hundreds of
the 5,000 workers gathered in baking sunshine to listen to the defence
secretary's Commons statement on the Trident refitting contract.
The management of Devonport Management Ltd, the consortium which runs the
300-acre yard, had set up a public address system at Albert Gate, outside
the 10-storey administrative block, dwarfed by the three hangar-like sheds
of the frigate complex.
At first, Mr Malcolm Rifkind's statement was heard in tense silence, except
for a scattering of applause when he described Rosyth's last-minute
cut-price bid as 'quite unreasonable.' Yesterday's Western Morning News had
trumpeted 'All set for Trident triumph', but it was only when Mr Rifkind
said Devonport's total costs were Pounds 64m less than Rosyth's that the
workers knew the contract must be clinched.
When Mr Rifkind confirmed this was the case, the rest of his words were
drowned by jubilant cheers. Blue hard hats were waved in the air and the
yard's hooter was sounded. A placard was waved saying 'Devonport simply the
best'. Mr Mike Leece, the managing director of DML, stepped forward to as
big a cheer as any manager could ever hope to receive from his workforce.
But he warned that the yard had to deliver continuous improvements and
compete for the refitting of every surface ship. Even with the Trident work
there are likely to be more redundancies - he referred to the 6,500 that had
gone in recent years. He added: 'We send our thoughts to the people in
Rosyth.'
Managers and workers took no pleasure in Rosyth's defeat. Mr Pete Saunders,
an electrician, said: 'It has taken a year to decide the blatantly obvious.
If it had gone to Rosyth that would have been purely political.'
Mr Gordon Dyer, a maintenance worker, prepared to celebrate in traditional
fashion. 'We will be going to the pub - it's the best place, isn't it?' The
nearest pub to Albert Gate is The Complex, just one of the 600 south-west
businesses which supply the Devonport complex and which stood to lose if the
Trident contract had gone to Rosyth.
There will also be relief among the 12 Tory MPs in Devon and Cornwall.
Labour won Devonport at the last election, but the two other Plymouth seats
are held by Conservatives, one by only 2,013 votes.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Shrinking navy prompted great nuclear race: David White
tracks the two-year highly politicised battle for the contract to refit
Trident submarines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUGGLE to secure industrial work from Britain's shrinking navy has set
communities in the far corners of the country against each other, competing
for influence like the city-states of medieval Italy.
Last month an alliance between Glasgow and the Cumbrian stronghold of
Barrow-in-Furness succeeded in eclipsing the shipbuilding tradition of
Tyneside. Their battle ended with the Swan Hunter shipyard in receivership
after losing a contract to build a helicopter carrier.
Now Rosyth in eastern Scotland has lost a desperate and protracted contest
to hold on to its role as the refit yard for the submarines carrying
Britain's strategic deterrent.
The choice of the rival Devonport dockyard at Plymouth as the site for
refuelling and refitting the new Trident vessels means Rosyth will also lose
its work on other nuclear-powered submarines. The work is at present split
between the two dockyards. With refits worth between Pounds 3bn and Pounds
5bn over the next 20 years, submarines provide the backbone of the business.
The consolation prize - the promise of 18 big warship refits for Rosyth -
cannot disguise the devastating blow to the yard and the potential threat to
jobs in Fife.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, talked of 'a healthy future for both
yards'. But Rosyth's prospects, beyond the promised programme of work, are
at best uncertain. From experience, its managers, Babcock Thorn, are
suspicious of government promises.
As a Devonport executive commented recently: 'Nobody believes there's a
long-term future for the dockyard that doesn't have Trident.'
The 'great nuclear race' was launched two years ago when Devonport made an
unsolicited bid to take the Trident work. It realised that the smaller
submarine fleet planned by the Ministry of Defence would justify no more
than one facility. Rosyth, with a new dock project under construction, would
be the natural choice.
In a highly politicised battle, the government backed away from a decision
late last year and has since postponed it several more times.
The two sides have conducted a tit-for-tat propaganda campaign. Rosyth,
counting on the backing of Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said as many as
18,000 jobs were at risk; Devonport's claims rose to 23,000. The two argued
over where the Conservative party would suffer most - in Scotland or the
south-west, where five of six seats in and around Plymouth are Tory-held.
Each yard tried to prove that the other could exist on surface ships alone:
Rosyth argued that Devonport was ideally placed next to an important warship
base; Devonport said Rosyth was more likely to manage on a smaller workload.
It suggested that Rosyth's partly built new submarine dock complex could be
used to modernise oil tankers.
The government has already sunk more than Pounds 120m into the complex,
known as RD57. The original plan for a covered dock would have cost Pounds
450m to complete. In the face of Devonport's counter-proposal, Rosyth pared
that down to Pounds 267m. In December it dug up another, cheaper plan, based
on adapting existing docks and undercutting Devonport's Pounds 162m price by
Pounds 15m.
Devonport retorted by saying it could provide the same facilities as Rosyth
for Pounds 131m. It then hit on a new way of handling nuclear refuelling and
cut its estimate to Pounds 120m. Rosyth also reduced its figure. On Tuesday,
at the 11th hour, it produced a radically revised proposal for Pounds 60m,
but to no avail.
Apart from investment costs, Devonport argued that the nuclear workload
would enable it to carry out other ship refits at unbeatable rates, saving
at least Pounds 100m over the next 15 years.
Government procrastination has served to cut its costs sharply but at the
expense of political wear and tear. 'The delay has done harm to both ends of
the country,' says Mr David Jamieson, Labour MP for Plymouth Devonport.
Measures to cushion the impact by guaranteeing work to Rosyth place an
artificial constraint on Devonport by limiting the number of surface ship
refits it can compete for.
How much that is likely to affect Devonport's business is not yet clear.
'You could refit the entire Royal Navy from now onwards using the dry docks
at Devonport and support 4,500 people,' says Mr Peter Whitehouse, business
development manager at Devonport Management Ltd. Navy officers believe that
would have saved the service money. But it proved politically impossible.
DML argues there will only be enough work to occupy one dockyard fully, and
that two dockyards can be maintained only as long as one is artificially
subsidised.
Since the yards were placed under private-sector management six years ago,
work volume has dropped sharply.
In spite of diversification into activities ranging from yacht-building at
Devonport to train-refurbishment at Rosyth, the combined workforce has been
halved in that period from more than 17,000 to 8,650. The workload will
decline further as more of the fleet is made up of modern frigates designed
to need less upkeep.
One senior navy officer says: 'We have not really adapted to the end of the
steam age.' Replacing ships' steam engines involved substantial rebuilding,
but today's gas turbine engines can be swapped at sea.
The MoD's intention six years ago was to increase the amount of competition
outside the 'core' programme of work allocated to the dockyards. The
ministry still wants as much competition as possible in surface ships and to
move further towards full privatisation after the managers' contracts run
out.
Last summer, proposals were invited for the purchase of one or both yards.
About a dozen companies responded, but the government decided to wait until
the nuclear submarine contest was decided before taking its plans further.
Naval shipbuilders, which want a share of refit work, will be in the front
line of bidders. Interested parties include GEC, owner of the Yarrow yard on
Clydeside. The terms on which privatisation will be handled remain unclear.
The government is expected to keep at least a golden share in the nuclear
facilities, to avoid being held over a barrel in the setting of prices for
servicing Trident boats.
The MoD is anxious to hand over responsibility for redundancies, hitherto
paid for by the government. 'There has to be a further shake-out in the
whole shipbuilding and refitting industry,' a senior ministry official said
this week.
At the start of the decade, more than 30,000 were employed building and
overhauling ships for the navy. By the end of the 1990s the figure is not
expected to be more than about 11,000-12,000.

FT  25 JUN 93 / MPs sceptical about work pledges for Rosyth: Devonport
success welcomed by west country Tories - Scots likely to view decision as a
further slight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCUSATIONS of bad faith on the part of the government and some scepticism
about the future of Rosyth dominated reaction at Westminster yesterday.
Yet the scale of the commitment made to the Scottish yard enabled some
Scottish Conservatives to find a silver lining. The yard was guaranteed the
refit of half the surface fleet including aircraft carriers.
Opposition MPs questioned whether the undertakings about work to be
allocated to the yard should be believed. Mr Menzies Campbell, the Liberal
Democrat defence spokesman and MP for north-east Fife, was among those who
quoted the promise given by Mr George (now Lord) Younger in 1984, that the
Trident refit work would go to Rosyth.
Mr George Foulkes, a Labour defence spokesman, also pressed for assurances
about how binding the new contractual obligations would be on the government
and whether Mr Rifkind's assessment that only 450 jobs would be lost at
Rosyth was shared by Babcock Thorn, the company that manages the yard.
Concern about the future work was not confined to the opposition. Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, was unable to give an immediate answer to Mr
George Kynoch, Tory MP for Kincardine and Deeside, who asked whether the
allocated programme of work would be enough in itself to keep Rosyth
profitable. While his statement enabled Mr Rifkind to refer to
'scaremongering' during the long negotiations for the contract, he was
unable to be as categoric as some MPs would have liked about the impact of
the decision on Rosyth.
He made clear that the government's assessment of job losses related to
Ministry of Defence work and did not take account of any other possible
redundancies, which would be a matter for Babcock Thorn. Any improvements in
productivity would also affect the figures.
The Westminster exchanges were peppered with opposition calls for the
resignation of Mr Rifkind and of Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, who
was in the Commons to hear the statement.
Awarding the Trident work to Devonport - a decision warmly welcomed by
Conservative MPs in the south-west of England - will have shored up the
Tories' position in the west country, but the decision could still cause
serious long-term damage to the Conservative party in Scotland.
Most Scots will see the decision as a betrayal of past undertakings, and
will feel that it panders to English demands.
They will recall the government pledge that the Trident refitting work would
go to Rosyth - a promise given partly to help sell the decision to base the
submarines on the Clyde at Faslane, at a time when the nuclear disarmament
movement was strong.
Had Rosyth won the Trident contract it would have guaranteed the future of
the yard well into the 21st century.
As matters now stand, the yard will definitely survive for only 12 years.
Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, pointed out that the
government in 1987 gave a conditional seven-year guarantee on British
Steel's Ravenscraig complex near Glasgow. In the event it closed, already
severely run down, after five years, and was a running sore to the
Conservative party for much of that time.
Yet the scale of the work guaranteed as a consolation prize to Rosyth is
bigger than most people had expected.
The claims of Tory MPs, such as Sir Nicholas Fairbairn and Mr Bill Walker,
that a decision against Rosyth would lead to the defeat of all 11 Scottish
Tory MPs at the next general election now look to be exaggerated.
The Scottish Conservatives have been trying to consolidate the revival which
began at last year's general election when against all expectations they won
two seats and increased their share of the vote.
With Mr Lang a skilful and soothing Scottish secretary, and Labour and the
Scottish National parties in disarray, Scotland has recently been one of the
government's few trouble-free zones.
The claim that the government broke its word over Rosyth will hamper that
recovery. It will not help erode the perception among many Scots that at
heart the Scottish Tories are the English Tory party.

FT  25 JUN 93 / 'Chance in life is falling through my fingers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETRAYAL was the word which hung in the air yesterday at Rosyth as a group
of the dockyard's apprentices crowded around a taxicab radio by the main
gate to hear the live Commons statement on the Trident refits.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind's promise of a substantial workload of surface vessel
refits for Rosyth was greeted with deep suspicion - the apprentices all
recalled that the government had promised Rosyth the Trident refits too.
'We were guaranteed the submarines before, and that didn't help,' said
17-year-old apprentice welder Gary McGrouther. He doubted that he had any
long-term future at Rosyth or even in his own country. 'After our
apprenticeships we'll probably have to look abroad for work - there's
nothing in Scotland,' he said. Another 17-year-old apprentice, Neil Smart,
said he did not believe Mr Rifkind. 'Scotland has been totally deceived,' he
said. 'I think we'll get to finish our apprenticeships, but after that it'll
be hard to find a job in Scotland.'
Also listening to the cabbie's radio was 65-year-old Mr Charles Logan, a
painter at Rosyth for more than 40 years before his recent retirement. 'I
feel sad, extremely sad,' he said as Mr Rifkind finished speaking. 'We feel
we've been sold down the river.'
'We have been stabbed in the back,' said 25-year-old labourer Mr Kevin
Collins as he posed for press photographers besides Rosyth's dock. Rosyth
was promised the work in 1984, he said, and the decision now to give the
Trident work to Devonport was political. 'There's a lot of Tory MP's down
there; they'd lose a lot of votes.'
The dockyard has around a score of female apprentices. One of them,
18-old-trainee mechanical engineer Ms Jennifer More was looking downhearted
as she summed up her feelings. 'I've been given a chance in life and it
seems to be falling through my fingers.'
There was widespread scepticism about whether the government's pledges to
Rosyth would give it a secure future and whether the new arrangements would
be acceptable to the Royal Navy.
Mr Colm McConnell, secretary of the Institution of Professional Managers and
Specialists at Rosyth, said: 'We will see the Navy having another mutiny and
demanding service work returned to the south.
'There is no way we can see the Navy accepting these vessels coming away
from their base ports, some of them for a year.'
Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Babcock Thorn, which runs Rosyth Royal
dockyard, condemned Mr Rifkind's announcement as the wrong decision. He
believed that Rosyth's last-minute proposal, in which it cut the cost of the
refitting by Pounds 70m, was the best way ahead.
'Quite clearly our bid was a better bid', Mr Smith said. But he insisted
there was not now a question mark over Rosyth's survival; the government's
surface warship commitment was more substantial than expected, he said,
thanks to two years of campaigning on behalf of Rosyth.
Rosyth now had to change from nuclear submarine refitting.
'We must accept the challenge,' he said. But he added: 'I still think it's
the upside-down solution. I don't think there's much logic in what they have
done.'
Mr Smith accepted that Devonport might try to close Rosyth by vigorous
competition, but he insisted that Rosyth would gain such expertise in
surface refits in the coming eight years that it would have the greater
expertise of the two yards. 'I accept we are going to have difficulty in the
long term maintaining our position against competitors', he said.
Mr John MacDougall, leader of Labour-controlled Fife Regional Council, said
the council had grave doubts that Rosyth could survive in the long term with
surface ship refitting alone.
'Rosyth is geared to submarine refitting. Devonport is geared to surface
work. Swapping roles could mean an immense cost to the taxpayer.'
The 450 job losses predicted by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary,
is much less than the thousands forecast by the management.
But the loss of submarine work will be a grave blow to the dockyard's
business, which work on surface ships may not offset fully. Submarine work
is much more valuable and labour intensive than other work.
At present, submarine work makes up about half of the Pounds 160m turnover
of the Babcock Thorn consortium, with the rest provided by surface ships and
work for the private sector, the latter alone making up 20 per cent of
sales.
Rosyth employs 3,700. Mr Smith said this could fall to 1,500 within two
years and could easily drop to 1,000, even if the submarines were replaced
by surface ship work.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Securing satisfactory price to secure orders
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSYTH DOCKYARD would have to agree a satisfactory price to secure orders
for refitting the surface ships intended to give it a continuing role after
losing the the Trident submarine contract, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence
secretary, told the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes.
The government had a majority of 72 (281-209) at the end of a three-hour
emergency debate in which Labour warned that Rosyth's closure would have a
devastating effect on the Scottish economy. Mr Rifkind emphasised that
Rosyth would be allocated 18 'major' warships and 49 other vessels for
refitting over the next 12 years. Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence
procurement, emphasised that the allocation of ships for refit at Rosyth
meant than no other yard would be able to tender for the work. Mr Rifkind's
insistence that the interests of the taxpayer had to be safeguarded brought
angry protests from opposition MPs. They accused him of breaking a promise
from a former Tory defence secretary that Rosyth would be given a
'guaranteed' programme of work refitting Tridents.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Contemporary art sale brings in Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S yesterday held its most successful sale of contemporary art in
London for three years, bringing in almost Pounds 5m from 117 lots with just
11 per cent unsold by value, Antony Thorncroft writes.
A 1953 painting by Francis Bacon, a study for a portrait, which had been
lost from view for 40 years, was the star lot, selling for Pounds 562,500 to
a private Continental collector. Its estimate had been Pounds 300,000 to
Pounds 400,000.
The German artist Gerhard Richter retains his popularity. 'Neger', depicting
a group of Africans and based on a press photograph, did well at Pounds
320,500, while a work by Anselm Kiefer, another German artist, which
involves straw in its construction, sold for Pounds 309,500.
Top price at Christie's contemporary art sale was Pounds 485,500, well over
double the estimate, for a mobile by Alexander Calder.

<TEXT>
UPJOHN, the US manufacturer of the controversial Halcion sleeping pill, said
yesterday it would take the UK licensing authority to court over its
decision to revoke Halcion's UK licence this month. Karen Zagor in New York
writes.
Mr Simon Pearl, solicitor at Davies Arnold Cooper in London, which is
representing the company, said: 'Upjohn is challenging the validity of the
licensing authority decision in accordance with Section 107 of the Medicines
Act. The case will be heard by a High Court judge.'
Sales of Halcion were suspended in the UK in 1991 amid safety concerns after
a woman in Salt Lake City in the US blamed the drug for causing a rage
during which she killed her mother. The woman sued Upjohn and the case was
settled out of court.
Sales of the drug are suspended in Brazil, Argentina and Norway. In the US,
it remains on the market in small doses with strict labelling.
Upjohn contends that the UK licensing authority ignored favourable comments
from two government-appointed panels when it decided to revoke Halcion's
licence.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is today offering to the private sector a further five pits it
no longer wants. It said it was receiving 30 inquiries a week for all the
mines that have so far been advertised.
The additions to the list of pits being offered are Vane Tempest, Seaham and
Westoe in the north-east of England, Grimethorpe and the linked Houghton
Main in Yorkshire and Trentham in Staffordshire. Potential licensees must
register their interest by July 16.
British Coal has now advertised 14 of the 20 pits it intends to offer to
private operators because it no longer sees a market for them under its
control.
Mr Eddy Hindmarsh, the corporation's head of operations, said there was no
operational reason why some of the mines at present being preserved on a
care-and-maintenance basis should not be back in production in the autumn.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Decision greeted with allegations of betrayal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dockyards decision, although widely expected, was greeted with deep
disappointment and allegations of betrayal in Scotland. There was scepticism
about whether the government's pledges to Rosyth would give it a secure
future and whether the new arrangements would be acceptable to the navy.
Mr Colm McConnell, secretary of the Institution of Professional Managers and
Specialists at Rosyth, said: 'We will see the Navy having another mutiny and
demanding service work returned to the south.
'There is no way we can see the Navy accepting these vessels coming away
from their base ports, some of them for a year.'
The Babcock Thorn management may find that their predictions of thousands of
job losses if Rosyth lost the Trident contract may not be fulfilled.
However, Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Babcock Thorn, which runs
Rosyth Royal dockyard, condemned Mr Rifkind's announcement as the wrong
decision.
He believed that Rosyth's last minute proposal, in which it cut the cost of
the refitting by Pounds 70m, was the best way ahead.
'Quite clearly our bid was a better bid', Mr Smith said. But he insisted
that there was not now a question mark over Rosyth's survival; the surface
warship commitment the government had given was more substantial than
expected, he said, thanks to two years of campaigning on behalf of Rosyth.
Rosyth now had to change from nuclear submarine refitting.
'We must accept the challenge,' he said. But he added:'I still think it's
the upside down solution. I don't think there's much logic in what they have
done.'
Mr Smith accepted that Devonport might try to close Rosyth by vigorous
competition, but he insisted that Rosyth would gain such expertise in
surface refits in the coming eight years that it would have the greater
expertise of the two yards. 'I accept we are going to have difficulty in the
long term maintaining our position against competitors', he said. 'We will
make the best of what we have and I think there's an opportunity'.
Mr John MacDougall, leader of Labour-controlled Fife Regional Council, said
the council had grave doubts that Rosyth could survive in the long term with
surface ship refitting alone.
'Rosyth is geared to submarine refitting. Devonport is geared to surface
work. Swapping roles could mean an immense cost to the taxpayer.' He said
there were vital links missing from the package.
The 450 job losses predicted by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary,
is much less than the thousands forecast by the management.
But the loss of submarine work will be a grave blow to the dockyard's
business, which work on surface ships may not offset fully. Submarine work
is much more valuable and labour intensive than other work.
At present, submarine work makes up about half of the Pounds 160m turnover
of the Babcock Thorn consortium, with the rest provided by surface ships and
work for the private sector, the latter alone making up 20 per cent of
sales.
Rosyth employs 3,700. Mr Smith said this could fall to 1,500 within two
years and could easily drop to 1,000, even if the submarines were replaced
by surface ship work.
Any rundown will affect the rest of the economy of Fife and eastern Scotland
because the dockyard and the adjoining naval base (also running down)
generate Pounds 380m a year to the Scottish economy and directly or
indirectly supports 18,000 people, of whom 11,000 are in Fife.
The yard generates about Pounds 30m of purchases among companies in
Scotland, excluding direct purchases by the Ministry of Defence.
In 1992 the company's wage bill was put at Pounds 100m, of which 86 per cent
went to people living in Fife. Shops, hotels, restaurants, public houses and
taxi firms will suffer.
The yard deals with 800 companies in Scotland and the effect of its rundown
would be spread beyond Fife across the Firth of Forth into the Edinburgh
area, and further afield to the Glasgow area. It employs half of Scotland's
engineering apprentices.
The unions questioned how the dockyard could possibly maintain its current
3,700 employees in the light of yesterday's announcement.
'It's a slow, lingering death,' said Mr Brian Negus, chairman of the Rosyth
industrial unions.
The Rifkind promise, he said, amounted to one and a half ships a year and
Rosyth would find it very hard to compete against Devonport, which would
seek to undercut it.
Mr Colm McConnell, secretary of the Institution of Professional Managers and
Specialists at Rosyth, dismissed Mr Rifkind's promise of surface vessels as
a 'sop' to get the government off a political hook.
'We don't believe the guarantees spelt out by Rifkind will come to
fruition,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT men believed to be Moslem fundamentalists were arrested yesterday on
charges of conspiring to blow up several sites including the United Nations
headquarters in New York, the FBI building and two road tunnels linking
Manhattan to New Jersey.
Mr James Fox, head of the FBI's New York office, said five of the men were
arrested in a bomb factory in Queens in the middle of mixing a 'witches
brew' of ingredients used in other bombings, including New York's World
Trade Centre.
The FBI would not comment on reports that the accused were planning to
assassinate, among others, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and New York Senator
Alphonse D'Amato, a Republican who advocates the death penalty for
terrorists.
The arrests come nearly four months after a bomb exploded at the World Trade
Centre, in the worst act of terrorism on US soil. Before the explosion,
which killed six people and injured 1,000, the US had been largely free from
acts of international terrorism.
Those arrested, five of whom are Sudanese resident in the US, are believed
to have ties to Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, the blind Egyptian preacher who
allegedly inspired the World Trade Centre bombers. The sheikh has condemned
the Trade Centre bombing and is appealing against a deportation order from
the US.
Mr Fox said there was 'no indication of foreign involvement' in the latest
plot, and added that the FBI had no plans to arrest the sheikh.
An FBI court filing describes a Mr Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali of Jersey City
as a central figure in the conspiracy. It alleges that he suggested
detonating a car bomb in the UN complex, and that he had taken part in a
test explosion before the Trade Centre bombing.
The trials of suspects in the World Trade Centre bombing are scheduled to
begin in September. The eight arrested yesterday face up to 15 years in
jail.

<TEXT>
WORLD economic growth will continue sluggish this year, running at 1.5 per
cent, but should double next year to 3 per cent, according to a UN survey
published yesterday, reports Michael Littlejohns, from New York.
The Russian and other economies in transition following the collapse of the
communist system are forecast to record a further 10 per cent fall in output
after last year's 17 per cent decline.
Continued strong economic growth - 5.5 to 6 per cent - is projected for most
Asian countries with China registering a remarkable 11 per cent increase
following last year's rise of almost 13 per cent.
UN forecasters, who claim a better track record than the World Bank and the
IMF warned the Chinese economy was in danger of over-heating because of
rapid growth in money supply and inadequate government revenues.
The report said a hesitant recovery appeared under way in the US, Britain
and Canada. However, Japan's output would grow only slightly - 1.5 per cent
against 1.3 per cent in 1992 - while Germany's would decline by 0.5 per
cent, and French and Italian output would slow.

Laurie Morse visits America's strike-ridden coal country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 60 miles southeast of St Louis, Missouri, just after county highway 13
splits off on its own and crosses the Kaskaskia river, the first
hand-lettered sign appears on the roadside: 'This is UMWA Country.'
As the road travels south and east the signs get thicker and more insistent.
Tiny towns appear every five miles or so, linked by country roads trimmed
with ditches overgrown with sweet clover, orange lilies and cheat. 'Peabody
guilty of unfair labour practices,' neat white signs on the lawns of modest
midwestern houses declare.
Peabody, a subsidiary of Hanson of the UK, owns the coal fields, but the
United Mineworkers Union of America owns the towns. The coal mines that run
beneath most of this rural acreage and feed the area's families and economy
are fallow, shut down by a selective strike begun by the UMWA on May 10.
The UMWA has been without a contract with the nation's biggest coal
companies, represented by the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, since
February 1. At issue is job security, with union miners seeking a contract
guarantee to receive jobs at any new mines BCOA companies or their
subsidiaries open.
The union has escalated the strike gradually, until about 14,000 of its
60,000 miners are on the picket lines and all the BCOA companies have been
targeted. The union proposes to add to the strike until the BCOA gives in.
The BCOA contends union miners are less productive than non-union colliers.
In a press conference on Wednesday, Mr B R 'Bobby' Brown, president of
Consol Energy and chief negotiator for the BCOA was firm: 'The BCOA will not
give every new job to the UMWA. The BCOA will not structure the contract to
aid union organising.'
Mr Richard Trumka, UMWA president, says BCOA companies have circumvented the
1988 labour agreement by opening new mines under subsidiaries they claim are
not bound to the union. Both sides are finding excuses not to return to the
bargaining table.
Marissa, Illinois sits in coal country, a region known geologically as the
Illinois basin, a bowl-shaped lump of coal touching five states where
reserves are enormous, barely tapped, and sufficient to power the US for
hundreds of years.
Peabody mines here, with Arch Minerals, and Consolidated Coal Company, which
is partly owned by the German company Rheinbraun AG. Unlike Arch and Consol,
Peabody is not yet operating non-union mines, but may join the trend with a
subsidiary, Premier.
As the power companies pay more to clean up their emissions to meet clean
air regulations, they compensate by paying less for the 'dirty' coal. Some
utilities have turned away from coal altogether, and use alternative fuels.
Illinois coal prices have dropped to Dollars 22 a ton in the 1990s from more
than Dollars 60 during the 1970s coal boom.
The resulting slump has led to a rash of mine sales and consolidations. Mr
George 'Sam' Shiflett, president of Peabody coal and chairman of the BCOA,
says to remain competitive coal companies need more flexibility than the
union contract allows. The strike, he says, risks losing the company's
utility contracts, and could shut the mines permanently.
With about 10,000 union miners in Illinois already unemployed, the strike
could seriously damage the union and its members. However, Mr John Cox,
regional director of the UMWA and a veteran organiser, insists that job
security at stake in the strike are all the more vital because of the
economic climate.
He cites union demographics. The average age of a UMWA miner is 46, up from
26 in 1973. Too young to retire and too old to start a second career, they
want security, not higher wages and benefits.
Near strike headquarters in Marissa, Peabody's Baldwin mine is tapped out
and slated to close in three months, strike or no strike. If Peabody opens a
new hole nearby under the Premier name, miners such as Mr Steve Hodges, a
fourth generation UMWA miner who has worked for Peabody for 20 of his 38
years, are not likely to be hired.
Mr Hodges' only means of keeping his family's generous health benefits,
vacations, and a Dollars 20-per-hour wage is to be successful in the strike.
Otherwise, he says, he will be on the street, looking for work at Dollars 5
per hour. Peabody made millions of dollars from its mines last year, he
says, and should want his experienced labour.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Deficit bill inches through Senate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate yesterday moved slowly but inexorably towards passing the
Democratic majority's version of President Bill Clinton's Dollars 500bn
(Pounds 333.3bn) five-year deficit reduction plan.
In the morning, interrupting a debate conspicuous for its partisan
theatrical rhetoric, the Democrats beat back, on a 50-48 vote, a last-ditch
Republican attempt to kill the proposed increase of 4.3 cents a gallon in
fuel taxes.
On Wednesday night, a hastily cobbled together Republican alternative
deficit package was defeated 55-43. There was one defection from the party
line on each side: Senators Richard Shelby, the Democrat from Alabama, who
invariably votes against his own party, and James Jeffords, the
independent-minded moderate Republican from Vermont.
The Republican proposal claimed to be able to achieve the same budgetary
goal without any tax increases. It would have capped spending on federal
entitlement programmes and frozen most other disbursements at current
levels.
Mr Leon Panetta, budget director, denounced it as a step backward to
'trickle-down economics' that rides 'to the rescue of wealthy Americans in
the country and sacrifices the middle class in the process'.
Democratic causes did not emerge unscathed. Senator George Mitchell, the
majority leader, had to accept defeat of his amendment to restore some
Dollars 3.6bn in tax breaks for small businesses. Four Democratic Senators
joined the Republican minority to deny it the three-fifths majority
required, but Mr Mitchell said he would introduce another variation.
Liberal Democrats were also intent on forcing a vote on an amendment
reducing the scale of the proposed cuts in Medicare payments, and claimed
some support from Mr Clinton. Even if they do not succeed in the Senate
round, a compromise between the Senate and House bills may ultimately

The White House remained cautiously optimistic the bill would pass. Vice
President Al Gore, who is also Senate chairman, was on hand to cast any
necessary deciding vote. Mr Clinton himself was reported to be diligently
working the phones from the Oval Office.

Germany's AEG and CKD of Prague have formed a joint venture to make rail
systems which could employ up to 2,000 people in the Czech Republic by next
year, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary has announced Christopher Parkes reports
from Frankfurt.
The link with the Czech group, internationally known for its Tatra brand
trams, is expected to generate sales this year of DM170m (Pounds 68m) rising
to DM300m in 1994.
The German group, which will have a 55 per cent stake in the venture, said
investments could reach DM100m in the medium term.

AUSTRALIA'S prime minister urged China yesterday to lower tariffs and reduce

membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Tony Walker
reports from Beijing.
Mr Paul Keating, on a two-day visit to Beijing, also held out the prospect
of a closer partnership between the two countries in the production of
woollen items. China imports about 66 per cent of its raw wool needs.
Australia is sitting on a huge stockpile of wool which has depressed the
market to its lowest level in years.

FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: 'Quad' talks on market access fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRINKMANSHIP by leading industrial nations over a big trade liberalisation
package is to be pushed to the very eve of next month's Group of Seven
summit at which it is due to be presented.
This follows the failure of trade ministers, meeting in Tokyo yesterday, to
settle long-standing differences on opening their markets.
'It is unfortunate that we could not come to a full agreement,' said one
Japanese participant, adding however that as a result of two days of
sometimes acrimonious debate, negotiators had 'become rather more
realistic'.
The so-called 'quad' trade ministers - from Canada, Japan, the US and the
European Community - instructed officials to hold one further round of
negotiations in Toronto next week. They themselves are to hold a special
meeting on July 6, the eve of the Tokyo G7 summit, when they hope to agree a
'balanced and broad' package of tariff cuts in manufactures, and market
opening in services.
Hopes have been raised that this big market access package could be used as
a springboard for winning broad international backing for global trade
reform under the long-delayed Uruguay Round. This in turn would provide a
fillip to the recession-hit world economy.
Putting a brave face on events, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner,
said that yesterday's failure was 'not surprising, given the magnitude of
our ambitions'. His US counterpart, Mr Mickey Kantor, pointed out that he
had 'never been in a negotiation that ended before it had to. . . It is
neither surprising, nor disturbing that we did not reach a conclusion
today'.
Strongly held differences emerged at the outset of the meeting, when EC
negotiators effectively withdrew earlier market-opening commitments, arguing
that they had been made on the assumption of big cuts in US textile tariffs,
which range from 20 to 40 per cent. In the event, the textile proposal fell
far short of expected levels, averaging cuts of about a third, and including
many exceptions.
Other critical stumbling blocks included the EC's unwillingness to make deep
cuts in its tariffs on non-ferrous metals and aluminium, and Japan's refusal
to drop tariffs on spirits and wood products.
Sir Leon said he would make no prediction about progress between now and
July 6. He insisted, however, that the package had to include 'something
that is balanced and broad' - balanced, 'otherwise other industrial and
developing countries will not go along with it', and broad and deep, 'or it
won't address the needs that the world economy presents'.

FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Brave faces, guarded pessimism - The mood
in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICKEY Kantor, the US trade representative, put a brave face on it: 'I
have never been in a negotiation that ended before it had to,' he said
yesterday as trade ministers from the 'quad' countries of Japan, the
European Community, Canada and Japan faltered in their efforts to agree an
ambitious tariff-cutting package before the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo
next month.
'Until you get to the final day, it will not end. It's neither surprising
nor disturbing that we did not reach a conclusion today.'
Mr Kantor was commenting on two difficult days in Tokyo where disappointment
over US proposals for cutting tariffs protecting American textile companies,
coupled with EC and Japanese refusal to slash tariffs on spirits, wood
products, non-ferrous metals and computer parts, crushed hopes of any
substantial trade liberalising package being finalised then for the G7
summit next month.
Their failure puts in jeopardy the ability of leaders of the industrial
world to present at the G7 summit a package of reforms to revive the global
economy from its current dogged recession. What is more serious, the failure
raises fresh doubts over whether the long-delayed Uruguay Round of
international trade liberalisation can be wrapped up by mid-December.
Other trade ministers euphemistically referred to the vexations of the past
week as the 'most intensive' negotiations so far held by the ministers. The
mood contrasted sharply with optimism when they last met in Paris two weeks
ago. There, Mr Kantor talked of being 'at last in striking distance of the
largest market access package in history'.
A Japanese negotiator talked yesterday of discussions becoming 'rather more
realistic'.
'It was unfortunate that we could not come to a full agreement - which was
our target. But we have two weeks to find a package and report,' he said.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said: 'Everyone will go back to
their capitals, take stock, and see whether the progress so far is adequate
for the relaunch of the Uruguay Round, or whether they need to put more into
the pot.'
Negotiators in Tokyo yesterday remained convinced that a 'big package' of
tariff cuts among the quad countries (which account for about two-thirds of
world trade) was essential if other industrial countries, and those in the
developing world, were to be persuaded to commit themselves to an ambitious
Uruguay Round package of trade liberalisation.
They decided to hold a further week of official-level talks and a
ministerial meeting in Tokyo on July 6 - the eve of the G7 summit - in a
last effort to reach a deal that could be presented to G7 heads of state.
The hope is that negotiations could then be transferred to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva for their bilateral commitments to
be 'multilateralised' by the other 111 contracting parties.
But they could point to little headway in Tokyo, nor convey any optimism
that their so-far intractable disagreements could be resolved by the G7
meeting. Most conspicuously, US proposals to cut peak duties protecting
American textile companies have been dismissed as 'unsellable'. The EC
appears unable to meet demands for tariff cuts for computer parts and
aluminium, while Japan has drawn criticism for its truculence over
liberalisation of the markets in distilled spirits and wood products.
Details of differences were kept secret yesterday: 'The closer you get to
the end, the more damaging it is to go into detail,' said Sir Leon.
On a positive note, Japan offered to deregulate its welfare pension fund
market to allow foreign fund managers greater access. This is expected to
raise the foreign share of the welfare pension funds market significantly
from the current 0.1 per cent.
Although Sir Leon remains optimistic that further progress can be made
before the G7, he was careful not to raise unrealistic hopes. 'We have got
what we have in the kitty now and if that's all there is, that's all there
is.'
Others close to the talks were even more cautious. 'Areas where the
ministers could not agree, officials will not either,' said one.
Even if they did, the task of winning wider international approval and a
Uruguay Round settlement is far from simple:
Mr Peter Sutherland, who succeeds Mr Arthur Dunkel as director general of
Gatt on July 1, will find himself in the thick of complex negotiations among
more than 100 nations just days after coming into office.
Long-festering conflicts would have to be settled between July and December.
They includereform of farm trade, Japanese and Korean refusal to open
markets to rice imports, procurement rules, procedures for settling trade
disputes, and a new, stronger international trade watchdog to be called the
Multilateral Trade Organisation.

FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Midwest speaks up for Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARM and manufacturing interests in the US midwest have grown weary of
holding their fire against foes of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Like business groups and public officials across the country, they believe
anti-Nafta forces, particularly labour unions and Mr Ross Perot, last year's
independent candidate for the presidency, need to be answered if the pact is
to be implemented next January on schedule.
In Illinois, the defence will be taken up by a coalition of 200 of the
state's largest companies, representing agriculture, manufacturing,
electronics, oil, steel and finance. The objective is to regenerate
political momentum for the pact.
In Washington, a business coalition, USA Nafta, has the same goal. It is
attracting support from across the country. The nation's governors,
particularly those in the west, are also coming out for the pact. According
to a survey by the heritage foundation, 40 of 50 governors strongly support
the agreement, with 10 undecided or not responding.
'If Nafta is to become a reality, the White House has to be behind it,' said
Mr Bill Lane, of Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker. He said the group
will work with the Illinois congressional delegation to create a pro-Nafta
force in Washington.
Illinois, with its farm and manufacturing base, has a lot at stake. Mexico
is its second largest foreign market, with exports of Dollars 16.5bn
annually.
Group members include drug maker Abbott Laboratories; electronics
manufacturer Motorola; the giant retailer, Sears; Amoco Oil; and a variety
of farm organisations and food companies. Caterpillar stands to gain Dollars
45m in additional sales under Nafta. In 1992 it sold Dollars 200m in engines
and equipment to Mexico.

FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US sets conditions for delaying sanctions
against Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has agreed to delay sanctions against Japan in its dispute over
government procurement of construction services, on condition that the
Japanese agree to talk about opening the entire market to foreign
contractors.
Furthermore, the US wants Tokyo to agree to an extensive negotiating agenda
designed to end the Japan's exclusive bidding system, increase its
anti-trust enforcement and agree to a series of 'quantitative indicators' to
measure progress.
Several quantitative indicators have been suggested, such as: the number of
foreign company contracts won in Japan compared with those in Europe; volume
of exports; number of winning foreign bids; joint ventures in which foreign
companies are the prime contractors; the number of foreign engineers
assigned to joint venture projects.
Under US law, sanctions are due to be announced next Wednesday. However, Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has the flexibility to delay
retaliation if the reprieve is seen to be in the national interest.
A senior US Commerce Department official said sanctions at this time could
severely damage the prospects for key talks to establish a bilateral trade
negotiating framework and complete a tariff reduction package for the
Uruguay Round.
'What we're asking for is within the power of the bureaucracy to agree,' he
said. US negotiators were still waiting optimistically for their Japanese
counterparts to respond to their proposal.
The Clinton administration was not caught unprepared by last week's collapse
of the Japanese government. It sees the possibility of long-term gains from
the installation of a reform-minded regime. The next government is expected
to be installed and operating by the end of July.
Administration officials believe that, despite the 'dead body' in power,
deals can be done with the powerful bureaucracy, but completion of pacts
will be more difficult. Historically, it has been elected officials who
usually pressure the bureaucracy to take the final steps needed for
breakthroughs.
If there is any consensus at all in Washington on trade, it is that Japan is
the 'outlaw' in the world trading system. US officials say past bilateral
negotiations produced few real market openings because Japan does not follow
the operations of the free market in an orthodox way.
'Experience has shown that (the other trade agreements) didn't go far
enough,' the senior official said.
Intensive reviews of the pacts usually revealed that the Japanese met their
commitments to take agreed steps, but what would work in a typical market
system 'makes no difference' in trying to gain access to the Japanese
market.

<TEXT>
GEN Ibraham Babangida, Nigeria's military leader, is due today to break his
silence, in a national broadcast in which he is expected to outline a new
political programme following the annulment of presidential elections
earlier this month.
Britain and the US yesterday imposed minimal military sanctions against
Nigeria. The UK Foreign Office in London said Britain would discuss
appropriate action with Washington and the European Community and did not
rule out further sanctions.
The Foreign Office called on the Nigerian government to reverse Wednesday's
decision to cancel the June 12 poll: 'Nigeria deserves better than a further
period of unstable and undemocratic military rule.'
British measures include the withdrawal of military advisers from Nigeria, a
bar on new military training courses and the suspension of visas for
military personnel from that country. At least four of Nigeria's military
leaders have been trained by the British army. Gen Yukubu Gowon, who took
power in a coup in 1966 and was head of state until 1975, trained at
Sandhurst, while Gen Olusegun Obasanjo and Gen Muhammadu Buhari, who took
power in 1976 and 1984, were at Aldershot. President Babangida trained with
the Royal Armoured Corps.
In Washington the Clinton administration said it was suspending Dollars
450,000 (Pounds 300,000) in annual aid set aside for training Nigerian
military personnel, and ordered Nigeria's military attache to leave. The
State Department is to issue a travel advisory discouraging US citizens from
going to Nigeria.
A spokesman for the Social Democratic party of Mr Moshood Abiola, who was
widely believed to have won the election, said of the president's planned
broadcast: 'What will the government say now that the people will believe?
They have brought on a crisis of confidence.'
The Nigerian government claimed last night it had unearthed a US and British
anti-Nigerian plot and pledged 'necessary action' against any country or
interest group that sought to interfere in its internal affairs. 'The
federal government is aware of the enemy that gave rise to the chaos in
Somalia, Sudan, Yugoslavia and so on and wishes to reassure Nigerians that
it will not allow foreign interference to exacerbate the present crisis.'

<TEXT>
TOP OFFICIALS of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party yesterday unleashed
a vitriolic attack on the record of the leaders of a group of 44 defectors
who on Wednesday set up a new party to challenge the LDP in a snap general
election on July 18.
Mr Yohei Kono, cabinet secretary, launched an unprecedented attack on Mr
Tsutomu Hata and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, leaders of the new conservative party,
called Shinseito, accusing them of having been up to their neck in corrupt
politics in the past.
Mr Kono made his attack as Mr Hata paid courtesy calls on opposition party
leaders in which they agreed the main aim should be to defeat the LDP, which
has been in power for 38 years.
Social Democratic party leaders said the leaders of the two parties had
agreed they had a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' to defeat the LDP and to
introduce political reforms.
The head of Rengo, Japan's largest trade union federation, joined opposition
party officials in calling for a national convention of opposition parties
to be held next week to agree an electoral pact which could pave the way for
a coalition government.
However, the difficulties of organising a viable coalition were underlined
by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the recently formed Japan New party, who
said he did not want to join a coalition with Mr Hata's group because of its
members' past links with corruption.
Mr Hosokawa said he would co-operate with a 10-strong group of LDP defectors
who set up the New Harbinger party earlier this week.
Mr Kono's onslaught, which was endorsed by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime
minister, was designed to undermine the credentials of Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa
as reformers.
Echoing questions raised by most newspaper editorials after the launch of
Shinseito, Mr Kono said the new party's two leaders had been closely linked
to Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former LDP power-broker who is about to be tried on
charges of massive tax evasion.
However, Mr Kono's attack - which amounts to accusing the defectors of being
no better than the LDP - is an indication of the difficulties the ruling
party's weakened leadership faces in responding to Mr Hata's challenge.
A poll in the Yomiuri newspaper found the approval rating for the Miyazawa
government had fallen by 15.9 percentage points to 10.4 per cent, the second
lowest rating ever recorded. Emiko Terazono adds: Uncertainty over the
future of the LDP has prompted the country's leading banks to reconsider
loans to the party.
The LDP asked the banks for Y20bn (Pounds 125m) in low-interest loans, but
the banks are likely to scale down the amount to Y15bn following the split
in the party. Until now, the LDP's ability to maintain stable rule over the
country had served as a 'collateral' for bank loans.
Meanwhile, Japanese business groups, which have traditionally backed the
LDP, expressed the need for a more flexible approach.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Businessmen braced for troubles ahead

WITH relations between Nigeria and the west under strain after General
Ibrahim Babangida's annulment of the presidential election, the country's
long-suffering business community is bracing itself for difficult times.
Western threats to cut off aid and 'review relations' with the military
regime are being treated with caution and scepticism.
Many believe western leverage is limited. Cutting off aid, as Washington has
threatened, will have little impact, unlike in Kenya where aid inflows are
substantial and proved an important lever for western governments seeking
political and economic reform.
'It's not as if we had great hopes for the civilian government anyway,' said
one businessman. 'If anything we were preparing for continuing drift and
mismanagement.'
The country has experienced half a dozen coups since independence, endured a
civil war over Biafra's secession, and seen the oil-boom years of the 1970s
give way to austerity in the 1980s and 1990s. Businessmen and other
observers acknowledge, however, that Nigeria's predicament has seldom looked
so bleak.
Yet for all the difficulties, they argue, it is not a market that can be
ignored. With a gross domestic product of Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) and
population approaching 90m it is the largest market in black Africa.
Guinness, for example, sells 100m litres of stout a year in Nigeria, making
it the third largest market after Ireland and the UK.
Trading conditions have long been difficult. Access to export credit
facilities, for instance, are already very limited - hardly surprising given
the level of arrears, more than Dollars 600m owed to Britain alone.
The strain in relations with key trading partners does not help, but
businessmen say it will not prompt any fundamental reappraisal of their own
strategy.
Those already operating in Nigeria will stay, accepting that the book value
of their assets is nominal; those contemplating a new or additional
investment would probably have waited until the new civilian government had
established a track record.
In theory, Nigeria is most vulnerable to pressure not over trade and
investment, but over its external debt of around Dollars 30bn. Servicing the
debt should consume 40 per cent of export earnings. In practice, Nigeria
sets aside around 25 per cent and allows arrears to mount, rising from
Dollars 2.2bn at the end of 1991 to Dollars 3.4bn at the end of last year.
Without rescheduling, the debt burden becomes increasingly unmanageable, but
rescheduling depends on renewing an International Monetary Fund agreement,
which lapsed more than 18 months ago. Western governments may now warn Gen
Babangida that debt relief is conditional both on economic reform and on an
early handover to a civilian government.
However, Gen Babangida could respond by turning it into a populist issue,
and trying to divert attention by calling attention to what he would argue
is the unfair treatment Nigeria has received from its creditors,
notwithstanding deepening austerity.
As the economic pressure increases the president may contemplate declaring a
moratorium on debt, putting the blame on the traditional scapegoat for
African and other leaders - 'outside forces'.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Morocco goes to the polls, but the king will still rule:
Elections considered freer than in the past will help soften the monarch's
feudal image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE first general elections to be held in Morocco in nine years do
anything at all, it will be to soften the 'feudal' image many foreign
observers have of King Hassan.
Some 11.5m Moroccans go to the polls today, most with the secret hope that
the results will be closer to the ballot papers cast than has traditionally
been the case.
If so, many Moroccans are likely to be encouraged in their hope that the
king is seeking to broaden the narrow group of advisers and senior
industrialists around him to include younger technocrats and businessmen.
A new constitution endorsed by 99.96 per cent of the electorate last
September requires the government to reflect the balance of forces in
parliament. For his part, King Hassan has made public his wish to delegate
some powers in recognition of changes in the kingdom over the past 20 years.
Local elections in October last year were, by common consent, reasonably
free. Provincial governors and other local officials brought less pressure
to bear on voters than is customary. The amount of cash wielded by certain
candidates, notably in the northern Rif region around Tangiers, provoked a
public outcry, and the authorities were forced to bar some of them.
The money is believed to come from the export, worth up to Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) a year, of local cannabis, a long-standing mainstay of this
traditionally poor region. The fact that most of the barred candidates
belonged to the Constitutional Union (UC) and the National Assembly of
Independents (RNI), the two key parties of government in the past eight
years, embarrassed the government, which was seeking help from the European
Community to eradicate cannabis and develop the north economically at the
time.
At the same time the opposition is pleased that the electoral register has
been computerised and that 60,000 voters who appeared to enjoy the privilege
of voting in two places will now enjoydoing so in one.
Over the past 10 years, political parties have been allowed to speak out on
a range of issues, including the increased inequality which has resulted
from successive International Monetary Fund-backed economic restructuring
programmes. But direct criticism of the monarch is out.
The authorities have been ruthless with any opposition that is 'off limits',
especially on Morocco's West Saharan policy. Last April, the international
human rights organisation Amnesty International alleged that, despite
'positive changes in recent years', hundreds of people who had 'disappeared'
for more than 10 years were still unaccounted for. The majority of
'disappearance' victims have been from Western Sahara.
Today polling will take place in the Western Saharan provinces, as it did in
1984 and 1992, in spite of the fact that Moroccan sovereignty is not
recognised by the UN and leading western powers.
The election is for 222 constituencies in the 333-seat parliament. (The
remaining seats will be filled by members elected from local councils and
professional bodies.)
The main opposition comes in the form of an alliance of four parties, the
two most important of which are the nationalist Istiqlal party and the
Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP).
Meanwhile, Mr Abdeslam Yassine, who leads the radical Islamic Al Adl
Wal-Ishan (Justice and Improvement) movement, remains under house arrest,
and the party is barred from contesting the poll.
The government-supporting RNI is led by the king's brother-in-law and former
prime minister, Mr Ahmed Osman, and the UC by another former prime minister,
Mr Maati Bouabid. Both parties are broad chapels in which personal and clan
rivalries matter more than ideological differences.
The main battle is to convince the electorate that casting a vote will make
a difference to their lives. Some two thirds of the population are
illiterate and the economic restructuring of the past decade has increased
the extremes of wealth and poverty.
A second year of drought last year and a poor cereal crop that cut gross
domestic product by 3.5 per cent means that the half of the population that
lives on the land may have more pressing matters to attend to.
Many ordinary Moroccans would not dream of voting for an 'opposition' party
 -for them that would be tantamount to sacrilege. The King of Morocco, scion
of an Alaoui dynasty that has ruled the country since the 17th century,
remains the real fount of all power, be it religious, symbolic or economic.
Last September, the king repeated his view that the doctrine of Islam
forbids him to reign without ruling.
Most observers expect senior members of USFP and Istiqlal to join some form
of coalition government. King Hassan has consistently demonstrated
finely-tuned political antennae, time and again outmanoeuvring the
opposition with a bold gesture. To pursue and deepen his dialogue with the
EC, he knows that he must move beyond the trappings of democracy. The next
government will provide a clearer indication of the speed at which the
monarch wishes to travel.

<TEXT>
The Australian government has reduced its 1992-93 budget deficit estimate
from ADollars 15.9bn (Pounds 7.1bn) to ADollars 15bn because of a higher
than expected collection of company tax and an underspending on
infrastructure works, writes Emilia Tagaza in Melbourne.
But Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, said the improved outcome would not
affect the ADollars 18bn starting deficit expected in 1993-94. This reflects
the carrying over of infrastructure works and welfare spending promised
during the March election.

<TEXT>
PALESTINIANS in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip face a mounting economic
'disaster likely to spiral out of control. . . resulting in the total
disruption of people's lives', according to a British charity, writes Julian
Ozanne in Gaza.
In a draft report Oxfam, one of the largest UK aid agencies, says the
decision by Israel to seal off the occupied territories in late March
stripped tens of thousands of Gazans of their livelihood. 'The population
faces the prospect of hunger and total immiseration if no action is taken,'
Oxfam says.
Israel has slightly eased the closure recently by granting temporary travel
permits to 14,000-19,000 Gazan migrant workers to resume their jobs in
Israel. When Israel closed the territories, about 45,000 migrant workers
were put out of work.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Beijing fears grow over runaway economy: Inflationary spiral
and political dislocation are starting to hurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S official press continues to trumpet economic gains, giving front
page treatment to glowing testimonials such as yesterday's People's Daily
report which hailed the 'surging' economy.
But at another level, officials are making little secret of their deepening
concern at the government's apparent inability to slow what some are
likening to a runaway train. Worries are also growing about the political
costs of an overheating economy, accompanied by spiralling inflation.
China's boom, while it is bringing a better life to millions, is also
tending to emphasise differences between rich and poor, country and city.
Peasant unrest fuelled by heightened dissatisfaction over a widening gulf
between rural and urban incomes is not the least of the government's
problems at present. Fear of increasing militancy among China's 900m rural
dwellers has prompted a hasty re-think of economic priorities, leading to an
easing of the financial burden on hard-pressed farmers.
Measures adopted thus far to restrain the macro-economy, including credit
curbs, interest rate increases and a clamp on capital spending appear to be
having limited impact in the face of the economic momentum generated in the
past year since paramount leader Deng Xiaoping opened the doors wider to
investment, urging his countrymen to 'seize the moment'.
Chinese economists and western officials say that unless evidence emerges
soon of the economy slowing, and perhaps more important, of inflation
abating, then more decisive steps will be required. Apart from a further
tightening of credit and increases in interest rates, the authorities may be
obliged to consider administrative steps such as import curbs they have
fore-sworn thus far.
Mr Wu Mingyu, a senior economic adviser to the State Council, China's
cabinet, believes that while the government is on the right track in pushing
ahead vigorously and courageously with market reforms, steps to cool the
economy such as interest rate increases were 'too little, too late.'
The government's economic advisers were urging such measures three to four
months earlier, he revealed, but this advice was not heeded.
Among factors that delayed earlier action was the convening of the National
People's Congress, or parliament, in March this year, that endorsed speedier
economic reform. Officials reportedly did not wish to convey negative
signals about the pace of reform on the eve of this important event.
Lingering concerns over appearing to contradict Mr Deng's calls for a growth
spurt may also have been a factor in delaying action longer than desirable.
China's senior leader has reportedly come round to the view recently that
the economy needs to be calmed; but the leadership itself is far from united
on the steps required, with divisions between conservatives advocating more
decisive measures and reformists, anxious that care be taken lest clumsy
intervention might derail the reform process altogether.
Beijing is awash with reports that the leadership will soon convene a party
plenum to debate economic reform and more specifically how to manage the
economic boom. If such a gathering materialises its main task would probably
be to forge a consensus out of present differences. Mr Deng's failing health
and an intensification of manoeuvring among leadership contenders is adding
to uncertainties.
With each succeeding day more evidence accumulates that China's economy is
continuing to defy relatively puny official efforts to restrain it. The
International Monetary Fund acknowledged this week that its forecast of 8.5
per cent would vastly understate China's growth this year in view of the
fact that China's industrial output continued to accelerate in April and
May. Output was up by by 24 per cent in the first five months of the year,
compared with last year.
China's State Planning Commission this week reported that the economy would
grow by 13-14 per cent in the first six months of the year, compared with a
rate of 12.8 per cent last year, and a forecast 9 per cent for the whole of
this year. GNP growth in the first quarter exceeded 15 per cent.
Among stark figures that underline difficulties facing the government are
those that show that in spite of much talk about restraining capital
spending, investment in fixed assets actually surged in May by Dollars
52.8bn (Pounds 35.2bn), equivalent to one third of the Dollars 150bn total
for the first five months of this year.
The government is also wrestling with a deteriorating trade balance,
continued pressure on the depreciating yuan and inflation that reached an
annualised 17 per cent in the first quarter in China's 35 larger cities, and
which is almost certainly continuing its upward spiral in the absence of
tougher measures to lessen demand. Government jitters over the economy are
likely to intensify as the social costs of inflation bite harder.
China's trade deficit stretched to Dollars 3.1bn in the first five months on
imports of Dollars 33.3bn, an increase of 26.9 per cent over last year,
against exports of Dollars 30.2bn, up just 8.2 per cent. The import binge is
unlikely to be allowed to continue in spite of grand diplomatically inspired
buying pledges that have more to do with China seeking to demonstrate its
political value to a recession-plagued west than they do with the country's
real financial circumstances.
China's fast-depreciating yuan is an almost certain cause of nervousness in
Beijing at present with no real sign that the local currency has reached a
floor since it was allowed to float from June 1 at official swap centres,
sliding about 25 per cent against the dollar on the first day, and slipping
further since.
In the absence of signs of a firm hand in control of the economy the
currency will almost certainly continue to drift lower and nervousness among
foreign investors will increase.
Chinese officials face difficult decisions before they depart Beijing next
month for their summer vacations. As a western economist said: 'They face a
practical problem what to do: they fear that anything they do will result in
a harder rather than a softer landing. But the longer they hold off, the
harder the landing will be.'

Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, yesterday admitted for the first time that
he had been sidelined for nearly two months with a heart condition, writes
Tony Walker in Beijing. Previously Chinese officials had insisted he was
suffering from a bad cold.
Mr Li made reference to his health problem at the end of a meeting yesterday
in Beijing with Mr Paul Keating, the visiting Australian prime minister.
China's premier said he had suffered a bad cold in late April, and an
ensuing medical check-up had 'showed that I also suffered from a minor heart
condition'.
'I have now recovered quite well, following a period of medical treatment
and rest. The doctors still advise me not to attend too many activities,' Mr
Li said. His admission follows weeks of speculation about his health. He
disappeared from view in late April and did not re-emerge until last week.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Waigel cancels French talks after Paris urges rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Theo Waigel, German finance minister, yesterday pulled out of a top-level
meeting booked for today with Mr Edmond Alphandery, his counterpart in the
Paris government, after the French minister criticised the Bundesbank's
'restrictive' interest rates policy.
Mr Alphandery said on radio that he had called the meeting on his 'own
initiative' and hoped to use it as a forum for 'a joint discussion of the
conditions for a concerted reduction in French and German rates'. He urged
Germany to speed up cuts because Europe was 'suffering from overly
restrictive monetary policies, notably the unduly restrictive German
policy'.
The Bonn Finance Ministry claimed the routine meeting of the Franco-German
economic and finance council had been postponed because of pressure of work
on Mr Waigel. Officials said it was quite normal for dates to be rearranged
at short notice.
But Mr Alphandery's remarks touched a sensitive spot at a particularly
sensitive time. Mr Waigel is preoccupied with preparing and sounding out
opinions within the coalition and parliamentary groups on a crucial package
of government spending cuts. He is under heavy pressure from the Bundesbank
to produce and push through a package that will convince the central bank
and foreign exchange markets that Germany's fast growing public sector
deficits can be brought under control.
The Bundesbank, which was to have been represented by its president, Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, at today's meeting, appears increasingly willing to
resume rate reductions to help boost the economy. But it is constrained by
the recent instability of the D-Mark, and was unlikely to have taken kindly
to Mr Alphandery's tone.
The French minister's remarks reflect France's growing assertiveness as the
franc has strengthened against the D-Mark. French official short-term rates
fell below those of German levels this week for the first time in 26 years.
Yesterday's suggestions of co-operation were dismissed as 'nonsense' by the
Bonn Finance Ministry. Closing ranks, its counterpart in Paris said
postponement of the talks was perfectly normal and that there was no
misunderstanding between the countries.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Kurds take campaign to streets of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE assaults by radical Kurdish groups on Turkish diplomats and commercial
offices in Europe yesterday marked a new phase in Turkey's eight-year
separatist rebellion.
Just three months ago there was real expectation of a breakthrough to peace
in the bloody struggle.
When the Kurdish separatist leader Apo Abdullah Ocalan called a unilateral
ceasefire on March 20, Kurdish exiles in Europe, many deeply opposed to
Apo's radical form of Marxism, applauded the move. The Turkish press,
usually nationalistic on the Kurdish issue, urged the government to do
respond. Western governments waited expectantly.
Now, the violent incidents across Europe have come at the same time as
reports of a big army operation against camps of the rebel Kurdish Workers
Party (PKK) in mountains near the Iraqi border.
The army offensive follows the massacre in Bingol of 33 unarmed Turkish
conscripts, who were dragged from a bus and shot. The army operation, unlike
many earlier hardline responses, appears to be endorsed by a public opinion
outraged by the attack, which in effect derailed the real progress that had
been made.
It is hard to see how the government in Ankara could have acted differently.
Diplomats say the attacks around Bingol have been particularly vicious. The
massacre was seen as final evidence that from his headquarters in the Bekaa
Valley in Lebanon Apo no longer has real control over his field commanders.
The interior minister Ismet Sezgin had earlier announced that villagers were
to be allowed to re-adopt their original Kurdish names - a further
concession to cultural rights of the Kurdish minority.
The attack took place on the evening that the national security council
approved a limited amnesty for rebels who laid down their arms. The decree
was immediately revoked.
The violence unleashed yesterday reflects the underlying frustration of many
Kurdish groups at the breakdown of the initiative begun with the ceasefire.
At the same time events have conspired against those in the Turkish
administration committed to reform.
In retrospect, the death of President Turgut Ozal in April is now seen as a
turning point. He was perhaps the only Turkish politician courageous enough
to adopt the sort of liberal policies needed to win over moderate Kurds and
undermine the rural support of the PKK.
During his presidency, Kurdish newspapers were allowed and a privately run
Kurdish cultural institute was set up. However, any further moves, such as
allowing Kurdish-language television or even the teaching of Kurdish in
schools have been blocked. The question of Kurdish-medium schools is not
even on the horizon and political parties appealing to nationalist or
separatist ideologies remain banned.
Mr Ozal's death and the political uncertainty that followed undercut the
momentum for a settlement. And President Suleyman Demirel has never had the
vision to see his way past the nationalist opponents of Kurdish reform.
The PKK has already warned that it will attack Turkish tourist targets, a
threat so far not carried out. But yesterday's incidents show the Kurds want
to attract European attention to their cause.

FT  25 JUN 93 / German exports to Europe may fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMAN exports to Europe could decline by 1.5 per cent this year but North
America and Asia will offer good trade prospects, the German chambers of
commerce and industry (DIHT) said yesterday.
In a survey of its chambers of commerce and trade representatives in 52
countries, the DIHT said exports to the European Community, which account
for 55 per cent of Germany's exports, are expected to fall by 1 per cent.
Exports to countries in the European Free Trade Association could fall
slightly more.
The report indicates that exports to North America could grow this year by 4
to 5 per cent, as German competitiveness is enhanced by a strong dollar. In
Latin America, exports are likely to grow by 8 per cent after a 6.2 per cent
rise in 1992.
The report also shows good prospects for exports to Asian countries, except
Japan. Exports to the Pacific rim could grow by 3 per cent this year but a
sharp fall will continue to characterise exports to recession-struck Japan,
particularly for luxury goods.
German imports from the EC, which account for three-fifths of Germany's
imports, could fall by 2 per cent, the report noted. But the strong reliance
of east European countries on Germany will continue to rise. Thirty per cent
of exports from Hungary, Poland, the Czech republic and Slovakia go to
Germany.
Meanwhile the Munich-based economic institute, Ifo, said business confidence
was rising in Germany despite the continuing downturn in the economy. It
also noted that many enterprises were expecting improved export conditions
worldwide.
In its monthly survey of manufacturers, distributors and building companies,
Ifo said that 'fewer enterprises were now pessimistic about the economic
prospects for Germany'.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Police act on Treuhand charges
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE yesterday started investigating several investors in eastern Germany
after evidence from the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and
privatising industry in the east, alleging corruption or misuse of funds.
Two directors of Twenty First Century, a Malaysian-based subsidiary of
Dalmia, the Indian conglomerate, were temporarily detained after allegedly
misusing funds granted by the Treuhand for environmental clean-up and other
investments.
Dalmia had bought two east German enterprises employing more than 1,700
workers. According to the Treuhand, the company had invested only a small
fraction of the DM100m (Pounds 40m) originally committed in its contract
with the Treuhand.
Police have also taken action against Mr Wolfgang Greiner, who has bought 18
enterprises since late 1990 from the Treuhand's regional branch in Halle,
near Leipzig. He has been accused of defrauding the Treuhand of DM24m. The
agency has also heavily penalised Alcor AG, a Swiss trading house, for
breach of contract because it failed to guarantee 1,700 jobs until the end
of 1994. It will have to pay heavy compensation for redundancies.
The action follows a decision this week to establish a department to monitor
implementation of the 40,000 sales contracts so investment commitments and
job guarantees are honoured until the contracts expire. Most contracts are
spread over four or five years.
A spokesman for the Treuhand said the agency was determined to close
loopholes, introduce more accountability, and send a signal to those who
have already bought property from the Treuhand that every contract will be
monitored. He added that between 30 and 40 of the total 40,000 contracts
drawn up by the Treuhand were considered 'criminal cases'.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Canny survivor ready for carve-up deal: The local hero on
whom mediators are pinning their hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REVILED in Sarajevo as a traitor, Mr Fikret Abdic believes that he can save
Bosnia's Moslems from annihilation.
Mr Abdic, 47, has emerged from a long silence in his home town of Velika
Kladusa in north-west Bosnia to challenge President Alija Izetbegovic for
leadership of the Moslems.
The bid is backed by the two international mediators, Lord Owen and Thorvald
Stoltenberg, who have been frustrated by the intransigence of Mr
Izetbegovic. He is clinging to the idea of a united Bosnia, which is no
longer on the western agenda.
The mediators are looking for an alternative Moslem to cut a deal with
Bosnian Serbs and Croats on partition of the republic.
This week Mr Abdic made clear he was willing to do the job. Asked about the
proposal for a three-way partition, Mr Abdic said no plan should be rejected
out of hand. In defiance of Mr Izetbegovic, he joined a Bosnian presidency
delegation to Geneva to begin talks on the carve-up.
Mr Abdic is no newcomer to the political scene. In his native Cazinska
Krajina, a densely populated entirely Moslem region of north-west Bosnia, he
is known as Babo - Daddy in the local language. In elections for the Bosnian
presidency in 1990 he won 1.2m votes - more than Mr Izetbegovic, who
nevertheless became the first to hold the rotating position.
Less religious than Mr Izetbegovic, Mr Abdic was always first and foremost a
communist entrepreneur.
He is credited with massively enriching Cazinska Krajina, one of Bosnia's
poorest regions, by building up Agrokomerc, an agro-industrial plant. His
fortunes plummeted when he was imprisoned in 1987 for issuing Dollars 300m
(Pounds 200m) in unbacked promissory notes, Yugoslavia's biggest financial
scandal.
Mr Abdic's supporters claimed he was a political prisoner framed by jealous
rivals in the ruling communist party. Others said he was just one of the
country's more successful white-collar criminals. In any case, his stint in
jail sent his popularity soaring.
However, Mr Abdic never succeeded in garnering much support within the
Moslem-led Party for Democratic Action.
Throughout the vicissitudes of war he has remained in his Velika Kladusa
bastion, where he dedicated himself to ensuring the survival of his enclave,
one of the six-UN designated safe areas. The pocket is surrounded by Serb
forces in Bosnia and neighbouring Croatia. This canny survivor has managed
to keep up trade with Croatia despite the Serb blockade.
He has even traded with the Serb besiegers, not entirely surprising as Serbs
and Moslems in the region have traditionally close ties, having fought side
by side as communist partisans in the second world war - not the case in
most of Bosnia.
He was praised in a recent edition of the Serbian army magazine Vojska for
advocating an end to the war. 'Most Moslems want an end to the war and do
not support the policies of Mr Izetbegovic,' he was quoted as saying.
In spite of support from the international mediators and from Bosnians Serbs
and Croats - all eager to see the partition of Bosnia over and done with -
it would be premature to write off Mr Izetbegovic
Mr Abdic is a local hero in his fiefdom. In Sarajevo he counts for little.
After 15 months of fighting, Mr Izetbegovic has built up an army and
nominated generals who are not likely to ditch him now. The Moslem-led army
has in recent weeks seized Croat-held territory in central Bosnia and is
unlikely to accept a carve-up.

He has apparently decided that this is the best way of signalling its desire

Arnaldo Forlani last autumn have met strong resistance.
The DC's poor showing in recent municipal elections has been attributed to
its identification with the worst excesses of the coruption scandals.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Bosnian leader urged to drop boycott of talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, is under mounting pressure from
all sides, including his own, to abandon his boycott of peace talks in
Geneva, where the three Bosnian factions are discussing a Serb and Croat
plan to divide the country into three loosely connected ethnic republics.
The seven Bosnian presidency members in Geneva for the talks said yesterday
they were taking collective charge of the negotiations on Bosnia's future
and would not rule out any ideas that could lead to a durable and just
peace.
Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, said he had phoned Mr
Izetbegovic in Sarajevo, leaving no doubt he urged him to take part in the
talks. Warning that Bosnia could be 'literally dismembered and destroyed' if
the conflict continued, Lord Owen said crucial leaders of Bosnia's Moslems
must be involved in the negotiations.
The Bosnian presidency, minus Mr Izetbegovic and his deputy, Mr Ejup Ganic,
left for Zagreb yesterday and will meet the EC 'troika' of foreign ministers
in Brussels tomorrow. Members plan to return to Geneva for talks on Monday
with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations mediator.
Mr Franjo Boras, a Croat and presidency head in Mr Izetbegovic's absence,
yesterday denied any 'coup d'etat', citing Bosnia's constitution which
stipulates a collective presidency with the rotating president only primus
inter pares. Mr Boras became 'acting president' after Mr Fikret Abdic, a
Moslem critic of Mr Izetbegovic, waived his rights under an alphabetical
order rule.
Presidency members said they were listening to all ideas and would consult
political groups in Bosnia before taking any decisions. Mr Abdic rejected
accusations that the presidency, which includes Serbs and Croats, was
involved in a 'sell-out' of Moslems.
Mr Boras said Wednesday's meeting with the Serbian and Croatian presidents
was largely concerned with nine constitutional principles on which a
confederal state would be based. These principles, already agreed between
the Serb and Croat sides and the international mediators, provide similar
guarantees for freedom of movement, human rights and demilitarisation to the
nine principles in the ill-fated Vance-Owen plan for 10 autonomous
provinces.
Unlike those provinces, the constituent republics could enter into separate
agreements with foreign states unless this could 'damage the interests of
other republics'. This would let Serbs and Croats have economic and
political links with their 'mother' countries.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Catalans wary of links with Gonzalez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S SOCIALIST prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, is facing difficulties
in his attempt to form a stable government with the Catalan nationalists as
junior coalition partners.
The Socialist leader fell short of winning an overall majority in parliament
in his fourth successive general election victory on June 6.
Mr Jordi Pujol, the chief minister of the Barcelona- based autonomous
government of Catalonia and the leader of the area's ruling Covergencia i
Unio (CiU) coalition, said yesterday after talks in Madrid with Mr Gonzalez
that the Catalan nationalists would support a central government headed by
Mr Gonzalez only if the latter adopted CiU's electoral programme.
Mr Pujol, however, stopped short of slamming the door on a coalition
government by agreeing to set up a committee, made up of senior CiU members
and executives of Mr Gonzalez's PSOE Socialist party, to examine the common
ground between the two political groups.
The committee will have plenty to disagree about, as the CiU, unlike the
PSOE, supports a full overhaul of Spain's rigid labour legislation, sharp
spending and tax cuts, and a far-reaching privatisation programme.
The Madrid meeting amounted to a poker game in which the Catalan leader made
an unexpectedly determined bid to increase self-rule in Catalonia. Mr Pujol
said a precondition for any CiU support for Mr Gonzalez was Madrid's
acknowledgement of the idea of fiscal co-responsibility with Catalonia.
As a first step, Madrid would have to hand over 15 per cent of the income
tax raised in Catalonia to the Catalan government.
However, Mr Gonzalez's party draws its main support from the underdeveloped
south and west of Spain where local Socialist leaders are wary of increased
privileges for the wealthy Catalan region.
PSOE suspicions of the Catalan nationalists are likely to emerge today when
Mr Gonzalez meets the Socialist party executive committee to report on
progress towards forming a new government. The left wing of the PSOE favours
a coalition with the Communist-led coalition Izquierda Unida (IU), an option
that Mr Gonzalez has so far discounted.
The PSOE won 159 seats in the elections two weeks ago, 17 short of an
overall majority in the 350-member Congress chamber.
Mr Gonzalez could ensure a governing majority through a coalition with
either IU, which won 18 seats, or with CiU, which won 17.
The prime minister has until the middle of next month, when he faces an
investiture debate in parliament, to form a coalition.
If he fails, he will have to form a minority PSOE government which would be
forced to do deals, law by law, with either the Catalans or IU.

FT  25 JUN 93 / EBRD chief Attali reimbursed twice for Tokyo flight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES ATTALI, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, was reimbursed twice for a first-class return flight to Tokyo -
by the bank and by the organisers of a conference at which he was giving a
speech.
Last night Mr Attali said it had been the result of a clerical error.
Mr Attali also accepted a Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 20,000) fee for making the
speech in May 1992. He said last night he had since handed the funds to
three unnamed Jewish charities.
Separately, it has emerged that the EBRD's audit committee has received
details of several new flights on private jets taken by Mr Attali in 1992.
Mr Attali said last night that, earlier this year, he had reimbursed the
EBRD for the flights.
The EBRD's audit committee will in the next three weeks complete an
investigation into allegations of overspending and lax financial controls at
the bank. A director of the bank said the committee would take a close
interest in fees paid to Mr Attali and the double payment of the flight
expenses.
Mr Attali, who has been criticised for the bank's overspending in the two
years since it was set up, said last night that his personal assistant, Mr
Francois Olive, had issued instructions earlier this month that the bank
should be reimbursed for the expense of travelling to Tokyo over a year ago.
An EBRD official said Mr Attali flew first-class to Tokyo from London on a
British Airways flight on May 13 1992 and returned to Paris by Japan Air
Lines on May 15. The cost of such a round trip would have been approximately
Pounds 7,000, British Airways said yesterday.
Mr Attali made the speech at the end of the trip, on May 15, at a conference
organised by Asahi Shimbun, the leading Japanese daily newspaper. On the
trip, Mr Attali also met senior Japanese officials.
An EBRD official said that under the terms of his contract with the Asahi
Shimbun, Mr Attali had also received Dollars 30,000 for a speech made for
the newspaper in the spring of 1991, although the official was not sure
whether on the earlier occasion Mr Attali had yet joined the EBRD.
However, the official said that Mr Attali had signed the contract before
joining the EBRD. Under the terms of the contract, Mr Attali also received
Dollars 20,000 for being part of the international body set up by the
newspaper to advise on the conferences. The EBRD's staff handbook says:
'Bank officials and staff members owe their duties entirely to the bank'.
It adds that bank officials shall not 'accept any remuneration from any
government, entity or person in connection with their appointment or service
with the bank'.
Mr Attali said last night: 'I would like to point out in no uncertain terms
that with the salary I make from the bank and the revenue from my books, I
do not need to make money from travel reimbursements.'
He also pointed out that he had a surplus of Pounds 8,000 on his EBRD
corporate credit card: 'That shows the bank owes me money.'
Mr Attali said: 'I have given some 80 speeches in the last two years. In
almost all cases, they have been free of any fees. In two cases, I have
cashed the money to be sent to a humanitarian association (the International
Association against Hunger) and a Romanian orphanage.'
The bank's audit committee has also learned of several new occasions on
which Mr Attali used private jets, in addition to the 26 uses disclosed to
the committee in April.
Mr Attali said last night that there had been an extra four or five flights,
most of them to Paris, by private jet in 1992. The cost had originally been
billed to the EBRD. Earlier this year, he had decided to reimburse the bank
for them, in anticipation of a change in the bank's 'air travel policy'.
The cheque for several thousand pounds was received by the bank's finance
department at the end of April. The first public disclosure of Mr Attali's
frequent use of private jets came in the Financial Times. Mr Attali said the
cheque had been written in February and had been 'held up' in Mr Olive's
office.
The EBRD, set up to make investments in eastern Europe, is owned by 54
governments and agencies.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Major suffers further jolt as Mates resigns: Letter to
attorney general 'based on bogus information'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday suffered another jolt to his leadership when Mr
Michael Mates was finally forced to quit as Northern Ireland minister over
his links with the fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir.
Mr Mates bowed to pressure from Conservative MPs and resigned because of the
'cumulative damage' caused by revelations about his connections with Mr
Nadir after weeks of speculation about his future.
His departure is the third from the government since last year's general
election and raised fresh questions among Tory MPs about the prime
minister's style of government. Mr David Mellor resigned as national
heritage secretary in September and Mr Norman Lamont resigned as chancellor
last month.
Hinting that he felt he was the victim of a campaign against him, Mr Mates
complained in his resignation letter to the prime minister of 'the daily
leaking of letters and so-called quotes from unknown sources  - most of them
wildly inaccurate'.
But Mr Mates's embarrassment was compounded when Scotland Yard said that the
letter which precipitated his resignation was based on bogus information
about police investigations into Mr Nadir and his assets. According to
Scotland Yard, the two Metropolitan Police officers named in the letter sent
to the attorney general by Mr Mates, complaining about police and inland
revenue investigations, were in Northern Cyprus not to look into Mr Nadir's
affairs but on unrelated business.
The letter, published in the Daily Mail, claims that two officers, Mr David
Jones and Mr Geoff Savin, visited Northern Cyprus to make extensive
inquiries about Mr Nadir and his assets.
But in an unprecedented contradiction of a minister's statement, Scotland
Yard, while confirming that the pair visited Northern Cyprus, said: 'They
had no association with or responsibility for any investigation relating to
Mr Nadir.'
Scotland Yard said Mr Jones and Mr Savin were members of SO1(3), a branch of
the Metropolitan Police's international and organised crime branch dealing
with extradition and deportation.
The former minister was further embarrassed by reports of him dining at the
Reform Club in London on Wednesday night with Mr Christopher Morgan, a
public relations adviser to Mr Nadir.
The controversy over Mr Mates came to a head when the Northern Ireland
minister, after taking soundings among Conservative colleagues at
Westminster, asked for a meeting with the prime minister to offer his
resig-nation.
Mr Major had avoided giving anything other than lukewarm support to Mr
Mates, fuelling the impression that Downing Street was prepared to allow the
minister to resign but was not prepared to sack him.
But in an afternoon announcement which took the House of Commons by
surprise, Mr Major said that he had accepted Mr Mates's resignation 'with
regret'.
He stressed that he believed Mr Mates had behaved 'with complete propriety'
in raising Mr Nadir's case with the attorney general. Replying to Mr Mates'
resignation letter, Mr Major added: 'I am sure that you took the right
decision.'
Mr Mates, referring to the watch he had sent Mr Nadir inscribed, 'don't let
the buggers get you down', said in his resignation letter to the prime
minister: 'In retrospect, I rather wish I had sent the watch with its now
famous message to you.'
The leak of Mr Mates's letter to the attorney general provoked claims by
some of the former minister's colleagues that he was the victim of a 'dirty
tricks' campaign.
Rightwing MPs, however, denied he was a victim of his long lasting support
for party leadership contender Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary.
Mr Mates' decision to resign marked a swift about-turn. Early yesterday, he
had appeared determined to remain in office. On Tuesday he said he had the
'full confidence' of the prime minister - suggesting he was determined to
brazen out the calls for him to resign.
The latest controversy has added to Mr Major's difficulties in exerting his
leadership credentials. Tory MPs now show less and less inhibition about
calling for changes in ministers or policy.
Adding to the Tories' embarrassment was the claim by Mr Nadir on ITN
television last night that he was courted by senior figures in the
Conservative party seeking donations to Tory funds.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Clarke warns he might raise taxes: Chancellor says Lamont's
medium-term projections would leave deficit too high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke has issued a blunt warning that he will be to ready to
raise taxes in his November Budget unless an acceleration in the pace of
economic recovery brings a faster reduction in government borrowing.
In an interview with the Financial Times - his first with a newspaper since
he became chancellor last month - Mr Clarke said the medium-term projections
set by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor, would leave the deficit at too
high a level.
He emphasised that a decision on whether to raise additional tax revenue
would not be made until three or four weeks before the Budget. He would then
have a much clearer idea of the strength of recovery and the extent to which
it would reduce the level of borrowing.
He left no doubt of his readiness to take tough decisions if he thought it
necessary.
Mr Clarke signalled also that there was no immediate prospect of a further
reduction in interest rates, emphasising that economic recovery was now
under way and that he was determined not to take risks with inflation.
He said he had decided to 'sit on the fence' in the political debate about
independence for the Bank of England, saying: 'There's nothing that's going
to happen in a hurry on the central bank front.'
The chancellor said economic growth alone could not close the Pounds 50bn
annual gap in the government's finances. Based on current tax, spending and
economic growth projections, the deficit would fall to about 4 per cent of
national income by 1996-97. 'Where we stand at the mo-ment . . . the
forecast I have indicates that the deficit is too high.'
He rejected as 'unrealistic' the idea that the government could squeeze
public spending below the ceilings agreed by the cabinet for the next three
years. The remit given to EDX, the cabinet committee charged with setting
the Whitehall budget, had been the toughest in recent memory.
Mr Clarke acknowledged that his judgment on whether to add to the Pounds
10bn of tax increases announced in March would depend on whether the overall
economic outlook had improved by the autumn. He declined to offer his own
forecast of likely economic growth, but hinted that the Treasury's
predictions in March might be revised upwards.
'The stronger or more sustained growth becomes, the less likely I am to look
at the tax side of the account. If growth shows signs of faltering or
weakening, the more likely I am to look for revenue.'
Mr Clarke also declared that he would have no fixed target for the level of
sterling as long as it remained outside the European exchange rate
mechanism. He was concerned over sharp movements in either direction, but
the value of the pound would influence rather than dictate the overall
stance of monetary policy.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Long-term future of Rosyth in doubt as Trident bid fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG-TERM future of Rosyth dockyard, Scotland's biggest industrial site,
is in doubt after yesterday's government decision to refit Trident
submarines at the Devonport yard in Plymouth.
However, the bitter blow to Rosyth was offset by promises of guaranteed work
on surface warships until 2005.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, announcing the long-awaited decision
in the Commons, said he expected the government's plan would cost 450 of the
3,700 jobs at the Rosyth yard, far fewer than predicted.
Another 350 would be lost at Devonport, which employs 4,950, because of the
declining refit programme. The redundancies could be absorbed 'without
significant difficulties', Mr Rifkind said.
The defence secretary later told MPs during an emergency debate that over
the next 12 years Rosyth would be allocated 49 further vessels for refit
work in addition to the 18 major warships referred to in his original
statement.
The decision concludes a two-year battle by Devonport to stop Rosyth setting
up facilities for the Trident boats. Nuclear-powered submarines will in
future all be refitted at the same yard as the Trident vessels. The work is
estimated at between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 5bn over the next 20 years.
Rosyth has up to now handled the UK's Polaris submarines, being replaced by
Trident. Other nuclear submarines have been refitted at both yards.
Devonport's Pounds 120m plan was Pounds 12m cheaper than Rosyth's, Mr
Rifkind said. Total cost includes a further Pounds 116m worth of equipment
common to both proposals, mainly from Rolls-Royce and Associates, which
makes the submarine reactors. The overall difference, including savings on
running costs, was Pounds 64m.
The cabinet disqualified a last-minute bid by Rosyth, more than halving its
investment cost to Pounds 60m. Mr Rifkind said it was 'quite unreasonable'
to submit a completely new idea so close to the decision. The plan also
contained 'unacceptable risks' by using an emergency dock.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, who had argued strongly in favour of
Rosyth, insisted losing the Trident work was 'not the end of the world' for
the dockyard. He said it would continue to provide thousands of jobs.
But the strength of anger among opposition MPs was seen as the Commons held
an emergency debate on the decision.
Some Scottish Tory MPs joined opposition politicians in expressing
bitterness at the government's 'betrayal' of its commitment to give the work
to Rosyth.
The cross-party Commons defence committee is to scrutinise the decision. Sir
Nicholas Bonsor, its Tory chairman, said the MPs wanted to be sure that work
given to Rosyth would be enough to ensure its survival.
The work allocated to Rosyth would 'taper down' after 2000, he said. Rosyth
would be the only yard receiving allocated surface ship work, and
shipbuilders could join the competition for other refits.
Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Rosyth, said the decision was 'a major
setback'.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Police 'not in Cyprus to probe Nadir'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, KYRENIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND YARD said last night that the letter written by Mr Michael Mates to
the attorney general on behalf of Mr Asil Nadir complaining about the
behaviour of two police officers was based on misinformation.
The letter, published in yesterday's Daily Mail, refers to a visit by two
Metropolitan Police officers - Mr Jones and Mr Savin - to Northern Cyprus
where, it claims, they made extensive inquiries about Mr Nadir and his
assets.
Scotland Yard last night confirmed that the two officers visited Northern
Cyprus but said: 'They had no association with or responsibility for any
investigation relating to Mr Nadir.' They were there on completely different
business, it added.
In a statement which is virtually unprecedented and which raises questions
about the source of Mr Mates's information, Scotland Yard said police
officers Mr David Jones and Mr Geoff Savin were members of SO1(3), a branch
of the Metropolitan Police's international and organised crime branch
dealing with extradition and deportation.
Scotland Yard said the two officers had been together in Northern Cyprus
only once, on October 9, 1991, in connection with the deportation of a
Turkish Cypriot, Mr Surmeli Tuluco.
Mr Jones made a further visit to the island on November 5, 1992 with another
unnamed officer, while Mr Savin visited on November 11, again with a second
officer, on both occasions in connection with different deportations.
Separately, the Serious Fraud Office, which has been the investigating Mr
Nadir's business affairs with officers seconded from the Metropolitan fraud
squad, said that 'none of them have ever been to Northern Cyprus.'
Mr Mates' letter was sent to the attorney general on March 17, 1993 with a
photocopy of a certificate allegedly issued by the acting commissioner of
police in Northern Cyprus, detailing the dates of arrival and departure of
Mr Jones and Mr Savin.
The letter alleges both men stayed at the Altin Kaya Hotel, where they made
extensive inquiries of the proprietor, Mr Fahri Otcuoglu. Mr Otcuoglu said
he remembered two visits by Mr Jones and Mr Savin: one at the end of
September 1991, when they stayed for three days, the other at the end of May
1992, when they stayed for five or six days. His hotel, a small bungalow on
the outskirts of Kyrenia, was unable to provide any registration book or
other documentation to confirm this.
But the acting police commissioner for Northern Cyprus, Mr Ali Cetin
Karahan, said yesterday he had no recollection of either a Mr Jones or Mr
Savin coming to the island.
One of the hotel's barmen, an Englishman who asked not to be named, said he
recalled a visit by Mr Jones and Mr Savin, but insisted the two men had been
there on deportation duties.

Headless chickens left pinned to the door, a dead cat flung through the
window; such have been the threats against the lawyer acting for Polly
Peck's administrators and the former head of Asil Nadir's privately owned
bank on the island of Cyprus. The Pounds 1bn UK financial scandal is
straining the loyalties of this tiny Mediterranean community, where no one
dares break ranks and tell what may have really happened - least of all the
government which has benefited from Nadir's, or rather PPI's, generous
financial support.

FT  24 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Boots active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears over US litigation - which proved unfounded - gave Boots a rocky ride,
sending the price down 9 at one stage before the company moved to quash talk
that its troubled Manoplax heart drug faced action. 'It was an entirely
fictitious rumour and one that caught Boots when market sentiment towards it
is low,' said one analyst. Boots' reassurances brought the stock back to
close just 2 lower at 437p in modest volume.
The market was shocked but not completely surprised by the latest profits
warning, the third in 12 months, issued by Spring Ram, the building
materials to bathrooms group. Spring Ram shares, which were driven down 8 to
61p late on Tuesday, plummeted to 50p as the latest warning was issued, but
later stabilised and closed a net 8 1/2 cheaper at 52 1/2 p. Turnover in the
shares was a heavy 7.8m.
The switch recommendation, out of RMC and into Redland saw the latter move
up 10 more to 466p and the former slide a further 7 to 743p.
The latest asset sales by BP, including the sale of Purina Mills, its US
animal feeds group, for Dollars 425m, came as no surprise to the market and
BP shares eased 1 1/2 to 312p on routine turnover of 5.3m. The recent
bearish note issued by NatWest Securities kept British Gas under pressure
and the stock dipped 5 to 300 1/2 p.
The 13 per cent increase in the dividend total announced by Norweb, the
latest of the regional electricity companies to report preliminary figures,
came as a considerable disappointment to a market accustomed to the 'recs'
leap-frogging each other to pay higher and higher dividends.
Three 'recs' have already reported, with East Midlands lifting the dividend
by 14 per cent and Manweb and South Wales increasing their payments by 15
per cent.
Norweb shares dropped 17 to 480p after the figures were announced. Other big
losers in the sector included South West Electricity (due to report this
morning), down 13 at 458p, and Yorkshire (which reports tomorrow), off 8 at
488p.
The pharmaceuticals/chemical sectors remained one of the market's most
active areas, with the big stocks coming under renewed downside pressure
primarily because of the Goldman Sachs downgrade of Glaxo late on Tuesday.
The Goldman move triggered a fresh wave of selling in the pharmaceuticals on
Wall Street.
Glaxo continued to bear the brunt of the selling, the shares sliding to 577p
at one point before finishing a further 8 1/2 off at 579p, for a two-day
loss of 19 1/2 . Turnover was 6.3m.
The weakness spilled over into other drug shares, with SmithKline Beecham
finally 12 lower at 434p after turnover of 2.5m. Wellcome's recent
underperformance, triggered by worries about the challenge to US patents on
Retrovir, expected to commence next week, and the cancellation of a clinical
study of its Flofan drug, saw the stock price retreating sharply to close 23
down at 686p after much higher than usual turnover of 4m.
Zeneca, sustained by the successful outcome of the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue
and Tuesday's placing of the rump of the rights at 612p, held at 626p. ICI,
whose shares raced ahead after the Zeneca demerger, came under renewed
pressure, closing 10 1/2 weaker at 681p.
The strong buying of Fisons gathered pace, driving the shares up 5 more to
182p.
Medeva shares were given a mauling, retreating to 209p before rallying to
close a net 10 lower at 213p.
Against the market trend, Kingfisher moved forward 13 to 613p.
Another bout of enfranchisement rumours helped to buoy GUS 'A' shares,
sending them ahead 28 to 1745p.
Sedgwick, the insurance broker, attracted heavy buying interest from London
and overseas investors, the shares moving up 4 to 198p after turnover of
6.1m, the heaviest single day's business this month.
Unable to reverse its downward trend, United Biscuits fell a further 6 1/2
to 396p on a BZW sell note and ever more ebbing rumours of a bid.
A return to trading with a Pounds 16.4m cash call did not inspire confidence
for Alexon, the women's wear retailer, and its shares tumbled 13 to 65p.
A fresh property cash call found an unresponsive market and sent down the
shares of Frogmore Estates 17 to 404p after it asked for Pounds 42.9m via a
rights issue at 345p.
With its debut on the market, Carpetright, Sir Phil Harris's carpet retail
chain, proved the most highly traded stock with a volume of 22m, although
its performance was greeted by some analysts as being more due to marketing
than fundamental value. The stock jumped 17 1/2 to 165 1/2 p.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kymmene halves losses with
productivity boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KYMMENE, the Finnish forestry group, halved losses after financial items to
FM164m (Dollars 29m) in the first four months, with productivity gains and
cost-cutting helping to offset the continuing market depression.
The result, which compares with a FM337m loss in the same 1992 period, was
achieved on a sales increase to FM5.41bn from FM4.35bn. Operating profits
rose to FM547m from FM172m.
Despite the improvement, the company still lags its big domestic rivals,
Repola, Enso-Gutzeit and Metsa-Serla, which have all recently reported a
return to the black for the same period.
Kymmene said its recovery had been slowed by the prominence of printing and
writing papers in its product range - where prices remain particularly
depressed - and the large proportion of its output emanating from France and
Germany, which have strong currencies.
Like its competitors, Kymmene has benefited from the weaker markka for sales
from Finnish mills, but the depreciation pushed up its financial costs for
the period to FM658m from FM470m.
Market conditions remain tough, but the company is expecting price rises for
some products - such as coated magazine paper and newsprint - towards the
end of the year. Its result should also benefit from falling interest rates
and a plan to lop a further FM500m off annual costs.
The group expects seasonal factors to lead to a worsening of its result in
the second four months, before sales and earnings pick up again later in the
year.
Internal measures to improve earnings were proceeding as planned and falling
interest rates would reduce financing costs in the coming months, the
company said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BHP, the Australian resources company, and Magma Copper, the US copper
producer, have formed a joint venture to consider bidding for a share of the
potentially large El Abra copper prospect in Chile.
The joint venture is expected to be one of many interested in developing El
Abra which has been put out to tender by Codelco, the Chilean resources
group. Bids are due to close by the end of August, with any decision due by
the end of 1993.
A BHP announcement yesterday said preliminary studies commissioned by
Codelco indicated that El Abra could produce 265m pounds of copper per year,
using low-cost oxide leaching/SX-EW methods.
BHP already has an important presence in the Chilean copper industry through
its stake in the Escondida mine in which it is partnered by RTZ of the UK.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Peugeot-Citroen hopes for
recovery in second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT-CITROEN has been hit by falling sales, higher stocks and costs, and
lower margins in the first half of this year. However, the French carmaker
hopes that a second-half recovery in sales will keep it in profit for 1993.
Mr Jacques Calvet, the group's president, warned that the company might have
to add to the 2,600 lay-offs it had already planned to make this year. He
said that the group had lost ground in a European market which itself
dropped by 17.3 per cent in January-May this year, compared with the same
period of 1992.
Peugeot-Citroen's share of the European market fell slightly to 11.8 per
cent in the first five months of this year, compared with its 12.2 per cent
average last year.
Mr Calvet told the annual shareholders' meeting that June had been more
encouraging for the group's sales.
In a market which he believed would contract overall by 13 per cent over the
full year, he forecast that Peugeot-Citroen would raise its market share to
13 per cent, with helpful publicity coming from the triumph of the Peugeot
905 in the Le Mans 24-hour race.
But the car group would have to reduce its stocks of unsold cars, which were
too high, he said.
The cost of carrying these stocks was outweighing the positive effect of
lower French interest rates, leading financial costs to rise slightly to
FFr1.5bn (Dollars 262.7m) this year, Mr Calvet said.
The Peugeot president said that he was sticking to his plan for a 12 per
cent improvement in productivity this year, to be achieved by more job cuts
and de-stocking.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: GAN chief warns on sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of GAN, one of France's largest insurers, yesterday said that
the group had to address the problems of its lossmaking damage division if
it was to be ready for privatisation.
Mr Francois Heilbronner told a shareholders' meeting in Paris that there
were already 'signs of improvement' among GAN's general insurance interests
and at CIC, its banking subsidiary. But he warned that damage insurance was
still in a precarious state.
The damage division made a loss of FFr1.27bn (Dollars 222m) in 1992,
contributing to the dramatic decline in GAN's overall net profits to FFr402m
from FFr2.32bn in the previous year.
Mr Heilbronner hoped for 'a significant improvement' from the damage
division in 1993 with a 'return to break-even' next year. He said GAN was
already raising premiums for motor and industrial insurance and turning down
high-risk business.
The French insurance industry had a tough time in 1992, particularly in the
damage sector. There was intense pressure on premiums and claims rose
sharply. The property crisis also made it difficult for insurers to counter
the pressure on operating profits by selling assets. GAN was more vulnerable
to these problems than the other two state-controlled insurers, Union des
Assurances de Paris and Assurances Generales de France.
All three companies are scheduled for privatisation by the new centre-right
government, with AGF and UAP seen as the likeliest candidates for an early
sale. However, Mr Heilbronner yesterday reaffirmed GAN's commitment to
privatisation, saying its aim was to be 'ready for the moment' when the
state decided to begin the sale.
Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Victoire, the private-sector French insurer,
warned its annual meeting in Paris that although the company was recovering,
net profits for 1993 would be 'well below' the FFr1.8bn made in 1991.
Profits plunged to FFr214m in 1992.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi exposure details emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI, the heavily- indebted Italian industrial group which owes about
L6,500bn (Dollars 4.25bn) of its L31,000bn debts to foreign banks, is
believed to have outstanding credits of around L100bn to Citibank.
Bankers say the US bank is one of Ferruzzi's biggest foreign creditors,
following a long-standing credit relationship with the group cemented by
personal friendships between Mr Raul Gardini, Ferruzzi's former head, and
some leading executives of the bank's Italian subsidiary.
It has been assumed that French banks are among the most exposed because of
Eridania Beghin-Say, the Paris-based agro-industrial group in which the
Ferruzzi Finanziaria holding company is the controlling shareholder.
About 110 foreign banks lent money to the Ferruzzi group. The large number
reflects the diversity of Ferruzzi's operations, which span farming to
commodity trading, chemicals and financial services, and their international
range.
Apart from its strong presence in Italy and western Europe, Ferruzzi is an
active trader on the Chicago commodities and futures markets and also had
wide-ranging activities in Latin America.
Other foreign banks believed to have lent heavily to Ferruzzi include Chase
and Banque National de Paris. Neither bank could be reached for comment
yesterday evening.
The latest focus on Ferruzzi's borrowing, details of which remain highly
secret, comes just as Mr Gardini took the unusual step of sending a lengthy
open letter to the Sole 24 Ore business newspaper.
In the letter, Mr Gardini seeks to defend himself from mounting criticism
that he was largely responsible for the explosive rise in the Ferruzzi
group's debts. Mr Gardini, who is married to one of the daughters of the
late Mr Serafino Ferruzzi, its founder, was its guiding spirit from Mr
Ferruzzi's death in 1979 until a family row triggered his exit in 1991.
Mr Gardini, who last year mounted a challenge for the America's Cup yacht
race, largely subsidised by Ferruzzi's Montedison subsidiary, claims the
group's debts mushroomed only after his departure. He reveals that he was
approached recently to help sort out the group's problems, but was unable to
accept.
Solvay, the Belgian chemical group, faced with an expected loss in the first
half of 1993, aims to cut investment to below BFr20bn (Dollars 572m) this
year, said Mr Daniel Janssen, the chairman of the executive committee,
Reuter reports from Brussels. 'While we had an investment programme of
BFr23bn in 1993, we gave ourselves an objective to be below BFr20bn,' Mr
Janssen told a Belgian newspaper.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Shoprite boosted 62% to Pounds 1.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOPRITE, the fast-expanding discount food retailer which operates mainly in
Scotland, lifted interim pre-tax profit by 62 per cent to Pounds 1.69m.
The company is based in the Isle of Man, where it has property interests,
supermarkets, and a car dealership, but discount food retailing has become
its principal activity.
Fourteen new stores were opened during the period, increasing the number in
Scotland to 47.
Group turnover for the half-year to May 2 increased 75 per cent to Pounds
66m.
Earnings per share jumped 50 per cent to 1.91p (1.27p) as did the interim
dividend, to 0.6p.
Mr Deryck Nicholson, chairman, said that despite significantly increased
turnover, profits for the half were only slightly above those in the second
six months of last year partly due to the decision to lower prices and
margins.
Prices in the company's stores have fallen by an average of 8 per cent in
the last year.
Income from the Isle of Man property business also fell from Pounds 1.7m to
Pounds 600,000, following the sale of one of the company's office blocks.
The interest charge increased to Pounds 949,000 (Pounds 742,000) but gearing
fell from 66 per cent to 27 per cent after a share placing and open offer
raised Pounds 9.8m in February.
Analysts are forecasting Pounds 4.8m for the full year.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Channel tunnel manager jailed for bribery over pipe
contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROJECT MANAGER working on the Channel tunnel has been jailed for two
years after admitting accepting bribes for passing on confidential details
about pipework contracts.
Mr Thomas East, a project materials manager for Humphreys &amp; Glasgow, a
Croydon-based engineering company, had access to details of multi-million
pound contracts and was prepared to leak them to corrupt information
brokers, self-employed traders in details about pending contracts.
In return, he shared commission won by the brokers if their clients then won
the contracts. During 1989, Mr East was paid a total of Pounds 250,000,
Southwark Crown Court heard.
The case ended on June 11 but reporting restrictions were imposed until
yesterday when a separate trial ended.
Both trials followed investigations by the Serious Fraud Office into a
series of cases of alleged corruption involving the operation of such
information brokers. These inquiries have largely concentrated on the role
of brokers in the North Sea oil industry.
Humphreys &amp; Glasgow were contracted to be responsible for the design and
procurement of all pipework in the project.
Mr East, who admitted three charges of conspiracy to defraud, fed
confidential details to Mr Raymond Doust, who has since fled the country,
and information about a Pounds 17m contract to broker Mr Terence Richmond,
said Mr Stephen Batten, QC, for the SFO.
The contract was won by a German company, and two others were awarded to Mr
Doust's clients, Trouvay and Cauvin of Le Havre and Raccortubi of Italy.
Mr Richmond, whose trial which took place in November was also not
reportable until yesterday, received a two-year suspended jail sentence and
was fined Pounds 40,000 after he admitted one charge of bribery.
In the other trial which ended yesterday, Mr Shigiki Furutate, an executive
with C. Itoh, the Japanese conglomerate, was acquitted of conspiring to
defraud British Petroleum by paying information brokers for confidential
details of tenders for BP contracts.
The two information brokers who sold the secrets after bribing BP staff, Mr
Josef Szrajber and Mr Paolo Sorelli, were each jailed for three years in
April.

<TEXT>
THE easiest way to check the freshness of the eggs you buy used to be to
peer at them in a strong light. The latest option is to check the sell-by
date stamped on their shells. The new freshness test is of particular
interest to Linx Printing Technologies as a potential source of new
business. Linx, based in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of a handful of
specialists in the Pounds 250m worldwide market for continuous ink-jet
printers - machines placed at the end of production lines to print bar codes
or sell-by dates on boxes or bottles.
While ink-jet printing flourished in the 1980s with changes in European
Community consumer laws on sell-by dates, both Linx and UK rival Domino
Printing Sciences have recently warned that profits will not reach
expectations this year, largely because of the recession in Europe and the
impending maturity in the market - although Linx admits to what chairman
Derek Harris calls 'structural problems on the marketing side'.
That market maturity, twinned with the knowledge that many small companies
go through a cycle of rapid development and then become ossified, has been
the impetus behind Linx's decision to re-assess the strength of its research
and development. To ensure it becomes more than just a one-product company,
Linx is looking for new technology areas as well as exploring new markets
for ink-jet technology.
'The future of our business lies in continuing to develop the technology,'
Harris says.
Six months ago the company, which now has a staff of 175, set up a pure
research group of seven - the same number of people the company had when it
started back in 1987. 'We're hopefully trying to recreate the environment
which created the original product,' says Hillar Weinberg, Linx's technical
director. 'We felt we weren't doing enough fundamental research. We felt we
had to put in more research to stay ahead.'
The development team has also been re-focused. 'In the first year
development was easy,' Weinberg jokes. 'There weren't any disturbances:
there weren't any customers.'
But as the business grew Linx's development staff was pulled into the area
of customer support, explains Weinberg, extending development times. The
solution has been to set up a separate support team, and draw a line between
the development and support activities.
Elaine Pullen, engineering director, acknowledges that seven pure research
staff to investigate both ink-jet printing and emerging technologies is
small: 'Once there are some ideas that look promising then we can put more
resources in.'
George Weiss, chairman and managing director of medical equipment maker
pneuPAC, a company with a turnover of Pounds 14m, says he has a completely
different problem. 'We have more ideas than we can cope with. The real
problem is to balance R&amp;D production and marketing.'
Luton-based pneuPAC specialises in pneumatically controlled ventilation
equipment for emergency use - 95 per cent of British ambulances carry the
ventilators.
Like Linx, which sells 80 per cent of its equipment overseas, pneuPAC is a
big exporter, with 50 per cent of sales going abroad. And both companies
cite Japan as one of their largest overseas markets - Linx even makes a
machine with a Japanese keyboard.
Compared with Linx's adventurous approach to R&amp;D, pneuPAC's product
development is meticulously thought through. When a new product is mooted it
is closely scrutinised in order to minimise the development costs. To do
this Weiss and his colleagues break each product down into standard
component parts. This also increases reliability in a sector where a faulty
part can cost lives.
'We design the overall product range and then work backwards to individual
parts. We look for the maximum number of standard elements,' Weiss explains.
'We have to ask: is this incremental, building on our expertise?'
Because all the development work is done in-house, Weiss believes several
advantages accrue. Competing products can be developed in parallel and the
marketing department can work closely with those doing the R&amp;D. Weiss prides
himself on listening to potential customers and building their needs into
the next range of products. 'We're very conscious of market needs as they
are implied or clearly stated.'
Much of the 8 per cent of pneuPAC's turnover that is re-invested in R&amp;D is
spent on the 'D' rather than the 'R'. But Weiss argues that although the
company does not invent new principles, it does apply them effectively. As
an example he points to the company's latest product, a neonatal transport
ventilator. The design contains many of the standard parts but also
incorporates a vortex amplifier, which measures how fluids flow through
orifices, necessary for the resuscitation of new-born babies.
Unlike Linx's Weinberg, who argues that small companies have to believe they
will one day become a Microsoft or a General Motors, Weiss believes one of
the big dangers for small companies is 'going over the top' and trying to
develop a product it does not have the capability to market.
He is speaking from experience. Three-and-a-half years ago Weiss bought a
company that specialised in microprocessor-controlled anaesthesia equipment
and he then spent Pounds 500,000 completing the development of a machine to
measure the parameters needed by an anaesthetist in an operating theatre.
The work complete, Weiss decided to mothball the project. His fears were
that the company was not big enough to take on the multinational
corporations that comprised the competition. 'It was a large market where
the upside could be huge but so could the downside. I took the decision that
we weren't big enough. As a small company we have to look at niche technical
environments.'
Linx faces few such problems. Because ink-jet printing is a niche technology
that combines engineering with electronics and the chemical skills to
develop specialised inks, it is an area that has been largely spurned by the
big industrial manufacturers. Of the top handful of ink-jet printer
manufacturers, all are specialist companies with the exception of the
Japanese conglomerate Hitachi.
For many small companies, though, it is simply a matter of time before the
giant players in the market realise there is money to be made and enter the
same field. Such was the case for S&amp;S International, which specialises in
software to detect computer viruses.
But, says operations manager David Banes, the company has seen off many of
its larger competitors and is still the market leader in Europe.
S&amp;S issues a new version of its Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit every month.
The latest release can detect 3,077 different viruses, whereas the
equivalent product a year ago only needed to detect 2,160.
Although the scope of S&amp;S's research programme is determined by factors
outside its control - the number of new viruses created - like pneuPAC it
relies on feedback from its customers and distributors to help focus its
development programme and determine which viruses should be tackled.
Once a new virus is targeted, researchers in S&amp;S's virus laboratory write a
description of it using a specially developed language. This enables the
engine at the heart of the anti-virus software to detect it when it appears
in a company's software.
S&amp;S also uses the virus laboratory as a marketing tool, taking potential
customers there to show them how the product is developed. 'Ninety per cent
of customers come out having bought our product,' Banes says.
Banes believes the company's swift reactions in the development of new
software should keep it ahead of the field. And, like Weiss, he thinks
continued success will depend on the company carrying out innovative R&amp;D
within the sector it knows best. The jury is still out on whether Linx's
bolder approach will also prove the more successful.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): More than just A B C
 -Specific definitions of the consumer psyche are replacing the old market
research groupings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are you an Age Acceptor or an Age Modifier? Perhaps you are a Successful
Idealist, an Affluent Materialist or a paid-up member of the Resigned Poor.
Do you live in an Along-with-the-Drift or a Boom-then-Decline neighbourhood?
One thing's for sure - you are no longer just a dull old A, B, C1/C2, D or
E.
It used to be said that A/Bs had money and taste; C1s taste but no money;
C2s money but no taste; and D/Es no taste and no money.
But today there are many ways of slicing the population cake other than by
simply cutting such crude wedges. The old socio-economic categories - on
which so many vital marketing and advertising decisions have depended - are
increasingly being displaced by other, more sophisticated segmenting
techniques that try to probe consumer psyche, not just allot social class.
'We may think we know A/Bs are different from D/Es,' says Peter Sampson,
development director with the market research company Infratest Burke. 'But
consumers today are adopting contradictory buying modes. How can
socio-economic categories tell us why someone driving a Pounds 30,000 car
also wears a Pounds 10 wristwatch? Or why another person buys premium price
Haagen-Dazs ice cream yet also buys the cheapest own-label toilet paper?
There's no predicting an overall consumer type anymore.'
Successfully identifying these new distinctions increasingly looks like the
key to finding customers, retaining their loyalty and targeting money spent
on advertising. The conflations and fragmenting of consumer types also bode
well for the market research industry, whose turnover as measured by the
26-member Association of Market Survey Organisations increased by 8.7 per
cent in real terms last year.
Given Europe's shifting social and demographic patterns - the current
breakdown of the two-parent family, the forecast reduction in 15-24
year-olds and the growth of the 45-54 age group - there is every reason why
this trend will continue.
To combat the risk of making fallacious assumptions, though, companies
themselves are also branching out into consumer research.
The UK branch of Nestle, for instance, is pilot-testing a scheme that is
being closely watched by its French and German counterparts.
Nestle UK is collating a list of 100,000 customers who have demonstrated
their attachment to its Buitoni brand Italian food range.
David Hudson, the company's director of strategic marketing, says that the
database will be turned 'into a club of people who all share a love of
Italian food'.
Hudson compares the old socio-economic categories to a map that tells
travellers nothing more than which continent they are on.
'I need usage and attitude-related data which actually tell me what the
consumer is thinking about our products. Our Casa Buitoni club will have a
newsletter about Italian food. It won't just be a means of dishing out
money-off coupons. It will allow us to know where our customers live, who
they are, what they like doing, which of our competitors' products they use
and why.'
The move by Nestle does not signify that the company is abandoning brand
advertising; rather its club - a direct marketing technique - is being
explored as part of a broad marketing mix.
Martin Glenn, new product development director of Pepsi Foods International
in the UK, shares Hudson's sceptical view of the old ways of analysing
customer types. 'Socio-economic classifications are no longer useful for
products which are closely substitutable, such as snack foods or cars. They
do not segment most mass markets; all A/B/C1/C2/D/E types buy Walkers crisps
or Ford cars. You need to understand your own market on a specific level, to
look at usage and attitudes within a market.'
Glenn, formerly with Mars' European Petcare division in Germany, has spent
the past decade bringing new consumer products to market. 'Ten years ago
every good brand manager would have his target group of consumers, skewed
towards A/B/C1s or C2/Ds or whatever. But marketing understanding has
greatly improved. These definitions now don't discriminate with sufficient
accuracy. The A/B/C/D/E categories don't discriminate even by income - E is
meant to be pensioners but you can have some very wealthy pensioners.'
While socio-economic segmenting can still give a broad-brush picture of the
market place, researchers and advertising agencies now deploy hundreds of
different lifestyle categorisations such as the ones used at the beginning
of this article.
Take Young &amp; Rubicam's model, which is called The 4 Cs. Paul Edwards, head
of planning in the UK, says it stands for cross-cultural consumer
classification.
'It's a socio-psychological way of measuring people, dividing them into
seven value groups. Two people can have the same behaviour but different
values behind that behaviour. This system allows us to segment for any
product across different cultures, where we couldn't possibly use the old
socio-economic categories.'
There are also geo-demographic analyses, most of them variations on the
theme of postcode exploitation. The theory is that housing types are more
subtle guides to purchasing habits - consumers tend to buy the same sort of
goods and services as their neighbours.
In the late 1980s, CACI Information Services developed Acorn, the world's
first geo-demographic classification system. Acorn has since come up with
dozens of classifications, based on UK government population census
information.
The old socio-economic distinctions seem even more outdated now that
companies are calling for pan-European market research in order to help them
market their products on a pan-European basis. If socio-demographics are
inadequate on a single-country basis, they seem even more so when crossing
borders.
Sampson of Infratest Burke was also a member of a working group of the
Amsterdam-based European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research. In the
late 1980s the group investigated the possibility of harmonising
socio-economic definitions.
The task proved impossible as Esomar discovered that such harmonisation was
not only difficult but misleading. Socio-economic analysis of European
consumers could not be satisfactorily harmonised because class-plus-income
patterns were so different in each country. Instead, Esomar now uses a
system of research based on ownership of consumer durables.

THE US Commerce Department has revoked an earlier decision to impose stiff
dumping duties on Japanese-made flat-panel displays used in portable
computers, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
The duties of 63 per cent were imposed in 1991 and applied to active matrix
liquid crystal displays, which are the most widely used type of multi-colour
displays for notebook computers.
The market is dominated by Japanese manufacturers, who petitioned the
International Trade Administration to lift the duties. Large US personal
computer manufacturers including International Business Machines, Apple and
Compaq were also opposed to the duties. The companies claimed there were no
viable high volume suppliers for this type of display in the US.
However, the final ITA decision came after a petition filed by Guardian
Industries, which recently acquired Optical Imaging Systems, the only US
manufacturer of active matrix displays. US companies opposing the duties are
customers for Guardian's displays.

FT  24 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Treuhand rebuffs steel producers - East
German privatisation agency declines to sell Ekostahl mill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand agency charged with restructuring and privatising east German
industry is not prepared to sell one of its steel mills to Thyssen and
Preussag, powerful west German steel producers, officials said yesterday.
Earlier this week the two west German producers presented a proposal to the
Treuhand for Ekostahl, situated on the Polish border. The plan would cut
Ekostahl's workforce to 1,000, scrap plans to build a mini-mill, and use the
plant for back-up steel services, rather than steel production.
The Treuhand and local state officials have rejected the offer on the
grounds that it would not save jobs, commit investment or modernise
Ekostahl.
Instead, officials remain determined to modernise Ekostahl through subsidies
designed to prepare the plant for privatisation. The modernisation programme
would transform the cold rolling plant into a mini-mill based on hot-rolled
steel and would make Ekostahl one of the most modern and competitive in the
region.
Agency officials believe Thyssen and Preussag want to take over Ekostahl to
stifle competition.
The offer by the west German companies coincides with interest by Riva, the
Italian steel group, in acquiring a 51 per cent stake in Ekostahl. An
investment by the Italian group would partly finance construction of the
mini-mill, and make the mill commercially viable and eventually competitive.
Riva's interest follows failed attempts by Ekostahl's management to win
EC-backed subsidies totalling DM1bn (Pounds 400m) for its modernisation
programme. The EC ruled the mill might add to overcapacity in the steel
sector.
However, the Treuhand has consistently rejected such arguments.
Before unification, Ekostahl produced more than 2.5m tons, which has since
been reduced to 900,000 tons, and employed in excess of 12,000 people. It
now has 3,500 full-time employees.

Labour has lost support steadily to the anti-EC centre and socialist parties

FT  24 JUN 93 / Confusion reigns over unified EC trade policy: The single
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY half a year into the new European single market, there is still
confusion about the EC's failure to forge a unified trade policy.
Take Chinese fluffy toys, for example. The European Commission wants to
impose a unified quota on Chinese toys - ranging from stuffed animals to
pop-guns - which would cut imports by 74 per cent. But EC toymakers are
wondering why. 'We as an industry don't require protection and our question
is if we don't want protection, who on earth does?' asks Mr Peter Waterman,
a vice-president of Hasbro Europe, probably best-known for producing the
Sindy doll.
An EC-wide toy quota is part of the Commission's proposal to abolish, or
harmonise, some 6,500 national restrictions on imports, many of which have
existed since the Second World War.
In the process, the Commission is treading on the toes of some EC
industries, like the toymakers, which depend partly on imports and want a
completely free market, and others, such as EC textile manufacturers, which
see cheap imports as a threat and demand greater protection.
Southern EC members, led by France, have further complicated the issue by
linking the liberalisation of quotas to a streamlining of the use of
Community trade weapons. If national protection is no longer available, they
argue, then the EC must speed up the procedure for acting against unfair
trade from beyond Community borders. So-called 'liberal' northern countries
argue in their turn that such changes would give too much power to the
Commission.
With both sides dug firmly into the ideological trenches, Commission
officials say the chances of making progress on the package are 'pretty
low'.
Surprisingly, the worst fears of Brussels officials have not been realised.
At the beginning of the year, many predicted chaos at external borders, with
national customs officials unsure whether to demand import licences or not,
and confrontation at internal frontiers, as member states maintained
controls on goods to prevent parallel imports undermining national
industries.
Imports from state trading countries - China, North Vietnam and North Korea
 -would be hardest hit, pessimists warned. Large importers, notably Reebok
and Nike, which manufacture training shoes in China, began to make
contingency plans to ship their products through EC countries with no
national restrictions.
In practice the lifting of border controls and the weakness of the European
economy seem to have come to the temporary rescue of the importers.
Since January 1, member states which want to extend national quotas have
sought and usually won Brussels' permission to do so, using a special
procedure. Those that have not asked - Britain and the Netherlands, which
extended quotas unilaterally, and Germany, which dropped them - now face
court action brought by the Commission in an attempt to preserve the
principle of unified EC trade policy.
National restrictions were already leaky, even before the single market was
officially inaugurated. The formal lifting of border controls has made
national quotas even more difficult to enforce.
The existence of a single market also seems to have deterred governments
from seeking emergency protection against parallel imports from other EC
countries.
Lack of demand means non-EC exporters are working within national quotas
where they exist, so EC countries have not been provoked into taking tougher
action to protect markets.
In the textiles sector, for example, countries exporting to the EC have
promised not to disrupt 'traditional' trade patterns even when EC-wide
quotas are agreed. Some exporters say that commitment, will hinder the
natural evolution of the single market in textiles. But for the time being,
as Mr Erik Diekmann, a vice-president of Mondial International, the buying
services arm of C&amp;A, the retail chain, points out 'there has not been any
great difficulty in importing (textiles), because of the depressed market'.
The real problem is that the future of a unified EC trade policy is still
shrouded in uncertainty. Neither the importers, nor their EC-based
competitors can plan ahead with any confidence. Mr Patrick Brooks, a
consultant advising Reebok, says: 'Ultimately, they can get stuff in. What
they can't do is budget for a really steady import situation.'
Some exporters even go so far as to blame a significant slackening in
exports to the EC - in the textile sector, for example - on fear about how
new single market regimes will be applied, rather than on recession.
While the problem of national quotas remains unresolved, importers are aware
that individual member states could start acting unilaterally to restrict
imports, and disrupt the internal market.
European toymakers believe they have scotched recent French attempts to
hinder imports. They say the French were insisting on extensive technical
documentation before allowing Chinese toys onto their market. The demand was
withdrawn only after the Commission intervened.
Italy wrote to the Commission in March asking for wider-ranging emergency
measures to limit imports of Chinese shoes, ceramics and silks from other EC
member states. The Commission's reaction was a stark warning to Italy to
stick to EC rules on lifting or extending quotas.
But nervous Commission officials admit that every day the rules remain
unclear, the possibility of one country taking the law into its own hands
grows stronger.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Jail urged in French insider trade case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prosecutor in the Pechiney insider trading trial yesterday demanded the
maximum penalty of two years' prison for Mr Alain Boublil, a former aide to
the late former French prime minister Mr Pierre Beregovoy, and for Mr Samir
Traboulsi, a Lebanese financier, as well as a record FFr80m (Pounds 9.5m)
fine for the latter.
In all, the prosecutor, Mr Jean-Claude Marin, requested prison sentences for
five of the nine defendants and fines for the others. Lawyers for the
defendants, who have maintained their innocence, will begin their summing up
today.
The case, which Mr Marin claimed had sullied the image of Paris' financial
market, centres on allegations that suspiciously large purchases of shares
were made in Triangle, a US group, just before it sold its American Can
subsidiary to Pechiney, the French state-controlled metals and packaging
group in November 1989.
The prosecutor claimed the trial disproved the widespread impression in
France that those 'in the circles of power' could never be brought to
justice. But he exonerated the late Mr Beregovoy, who committed suicide on
May 1, shortly after he had given evidence to the investigating magistrate,
from 'rumours that he was the real mastermind of all this'.
As finance minister in 1988, Mr Beregovoy was only told of Pechinery's
takeover plan after several of the alleged 'inside trades' had taken place,
Mr Marin said.
Referring to Mr Boublil's relationship with Mr Traboulsi, the prosecutor
complained of the former's 'incredible confusion between service to the
state and a useful friendship expensively maintained by stays in palaces and
dream cruises on luxury yachts'. Mr Boublil admits his presence on Mr
Traboulsi's yacht on which some Pechiney-Triangle negotiations took place,
but nothing else.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Anger at Bonn's oil tax rise plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German industry federation (DBI) yesterday issued an outraged warning
against government plans to raise the tax on oil products following an
agreement by the leaders of Germany's coalition parties.
The BDI said an increased tax burden on car drivers would be 'absolutely
counter-productive'. It warned that the move 'will sharpen the downturn in
the automobile industry and will have negative consequences for the whole
economy'.
But the government, in desperate need of additional revenues, seems
determined to go ahead with the taxes. Coalition leaders meeting
representatives of their parliamentary groups yesterday agreed to increase
the petrol tax by 16 pfennig, from the current 92pf per litre, starting on
January 1. The diesel tax is to go up by 7pf from its current 54pf per
litre.
The government coalition is expected formally to ratify the planned
increases today, after which legislation will be introduced for
parliamentary approval.
The coalition will also discuss the introduction of a controversial plan to
have motorists pay for using the German motorway network through the use of
a vignette (tax sticker) which motorists would have to display.
The sharp oil tax rises will provide the federal government with DM8.5bn
(Dollars 5bn) a year. The funds are to be used for restructuring the
loss-making railways and improving motorways.
The move represents a last-ditch effort by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to raise
tax revenues before federal elections next year.
Long-distance road hauliers are also up in arms against the planned increase
in the diesel tax, warning that 'it would destroy any positive effect' from
the deregulation of the EC road haulage market.
The EC transport ministers agreed at the weekend on a common system for
charging lorries for using EC roads. In Germany, taxes on lorries are to be
halved to be closer to similar taxes in other European countries. But German
hauliers have repeatedly warned that the deal would have no positive
consequences if diesel taxes were subsequently increased.

GERMANY'S constitutional court last night upheld the right of the government
to keep German troops in Somalia, provided parliament agrees to it.
The court's decision, which represents a victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and his governing Christian Democratic Union (CDU), could pave the way for
Germany gradually playing a greater role in activities outside the Nato
area.
It could also strengthen Germany's position in its attempts to gain a seat
in an expanded United Nations Security Council.
A statement issued by the court said the current German mission in Somalia
would stay there provided parliament gave its assent.
Opposition to the court's ruling is unlikely since the three-party coalition
government had last month agreed to send the troops.
The opposition Social Democrats last week asked the court for an injunction
against Germany's involvement in Somalia on the grounds that the fighting
there had changed the operation from a humanitarian to a combat mission. The
SPD argued that this change of role violated the constitution, which limits
any military activities by the German army, navy and air force, to Nato
territory.
The government insisted that the mission remained humanitarian.
Germany has deployed 300 troops in Belet Huen, north of the Somalia capital
of Mogadishu. An additional 1,400 troops are due to be sent in mid-August.
The court's decision follows a similar injunction aimed at preventing German
pilots from flying air surveillance missions in Nato Awacs aircraft over the
former Yugoslavia, which eight judges overruled.
Earlier in the day, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, said
the UN would be undermined as a body if Germany decided to withdraw its
troops from Somalia.
Speaking during a visit to Bonn, Mr Boutros Ghali said: 'I hope that the
German soldiers will stay in Somalia so that they will be able to continue
their humanitarian action there in favour of peace and security.
'Our success in Somalia is not a success for peace as such, but a success
for the actions of the UN as a whole,' he added.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (14): Damage limitation is likely - Alice
Rawsthorn investigates an anxious period in arts funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY say some acts are impossible to follow. Mr Jacques Toubon has the
dubious honour of trying to follow one of those acts.
He was appointed this spring as France's new culture minister, succeeding Mr
Jack Lang who, during nine years in the post, became one of the most
influential members of the old socialist cabinet and the most powerful arts
minister in Europe.
The Lang era - l'epoch Lang, as Liberation, the French newspaper, called it
 -was a gilded period of public patronage for the arts in France. Mr Toubon
has taken over at a time when the economy is under pressure and every
ministerial budget, including culture, is set for cuts.
Mr Lang was lucky. He presided over the opulent offices of the culture
ministry at the Palais-Royal at a buoyant time for the French economy. His
close friendship with President Francois Mitterrand also helped him to
strengthen his position in the cabinet by adding media, architecture,
education and, even, the deputy prime ministership to his original culture
brief.
This left Mr Lang with the cash, and the clout, to implement his ideas. He
embellished the traditional elements of socialist arts policy, such as state
subsidy and industrial intervention, with modern concepts, notably corporate
sponsorship. He spruced up France's old institutions and opened new ones.
Paris was transformed by the construction of the glittering grands projets,
the monumental modern buildings such as IM Pei's Louvre Pyramid and Jean
Nouvel's Institut du Monde Arabe.
Mr Lang was doubly fortunate in that his own programmes were accompanied by
a stream of petits projets, the provincial architectural schemes initiated
by ambitious local mayors such as Mr Jean Bousquet at Nimes and Mr Georges
Freche in Montpellier. These played an important part in enhancing the image
of France as a dynamic cultural centre.
L'epoch Lang has attracted as many criticisms as compliments. Mr Lang was
loathed by the right, notably by Mr Jacques Chirac, the Paris mayor and Mr
Toubon's political mentor. The conservatives cited the decline in cinema
attendance and rising illiteracy as evidence of Mr Lang's failure. But the
criticism simply attracted more attention to the flamboyant arts minister
who, for the past five years, has regularly topped the polls as France's
most popular elected politician.
Mr Toubon has none of his predecessor's advantages. The economy is in
recession. Mr Edouard Balladur has asked all his ministers to make cuts.
Given that at least FFr900bn of the FFr1,367bn government budget is
committed to salaries and debt service, there will be intense pressure on
'discretionary' expenditure, such as arts subsidies.
The new minister will try to minimise the damage. Mr Toubon is a genuine
arts enthusiast who has revealed a weakness for his predecessor's flamboyant
style in his high profile visit to the Cannes film festival - and his
decision to award the Order of Arts and Letters to Elton John, the pop star.
Mr Toubon is also an extremely ambitious man. He is the son of a casino
croupier who joined the political elite after winning a place at the
prestigious Ecole National de l'Administration and now hopes to use the arts
as a stepping stone to a more important ministry. He will not want to be
remembered as the budget-cutting philistine who demolished the Lang legacy.
The problem is that Mr Toubon is ill-placed to resist political pressure.
First, he has less influence than Mr Lang. He has inherited the culture
portfolio, but not his predecessor's other responsibilities  - media,
architecture, education and the deputy premiership.
Moreover his main political ally, Mr Chirac, is not in the government. The
Paris mayor has gambled that his chances of winning the 1995 presidential
elections might be better if he stays away from the political fray.
Mr Toubon cannot even count on basking in the reflected glory of provincial
arts programmes.
The petits projets of the 1980s have brought many French cities to the brink
of bankruptcy. Their publicity-hungry mayors are now concentrating on paying
off their debts rather than commissioning new buildings.
The new minister does at least have the consolation that the cultural tide
was turning against Mr Lang, whose gauche caviar style was better suited to
the affluent 1980s than the ascetic 1990s. Even the left had turned against
him. Mr Eric Rohmer, the French film maker, parodied his policies in his
latest movie, The Tree, The Mayor and The Mediatheque.
This might make life a little easier for Mr Toubon as he braces himself for
the cuts. The critical question is where they will fall. The only hint so
far is that Mr Toubon plans to switch the emphasis of expenditure away from
Paris towards the provinces.
This bodes ill for some Paris institutions such as the Institut du Monde
Arabe, which already has funding problems; the Louvre, still in the throes
of renovation; and Opera de Paris, which may have to fight harder for its
FFr520m annual subsidy and delay its plans for a petite salle.
Mr Toubon has already made it clear that there is no question of new grands
projets. The old ones are now completed, with the exception of the FFr7.2bn
Bibliotheque de France, which is still under construction.
But Mr Lang made a pre-emptive strike by sanctioning FFr4bn of work on the
scheme. Mr Toubon has conceded that rather than write off the money, the
Bibliotheque will go ahead after all.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (13): Monetary policy moves over / A look
at the Bank of France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE an erratic sea-captain, Edouard Balladur is having to tack back and
forth between the Scylla of budget deficits and the Charybdis of economic
recession. But at least Edmond Alphandery - his first mate - has found a way
to keep inflation down - by handing monetary policy over to the Bank of
France.
Parliamentary debate on the historic project to give the Bank of France
autonomy in setting monetary policy started inauspiciously on June 8. Most
of the central bank's staff were outside the National Assembly, protesting
at what they saw as the lack of employment guarantees; inside the Palais
Bourbon the extreme left and right joined together to denounce the
government for abdicating its monetary sovereignty to faceless central
bankers.
'One cannot serve two masters: the French people and money,' thundered Mr
Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who has now left the Socialist party on the grounds
that it has forsaken true socialism.
Cheering him on from the conservative benches was, among others, Mr Jean de
Gaulle, the late general-president's grandson. But it was quickly clear that
the new statute for the Bank of France would have no difficulty winning
parliamentary approval.
Mindful, however, of the divisions that exist within the government majority
over Maastricht, Mr Alphandery, the economy minister, has been at pains to
stress two points.
First, France would have a strong interest in giving its central bank
autonomy in deciding on interest rates and the money supply, even if there
were no Maastricht treaty to oblige it eventually to move in this direction.
'We can only rejoice that our European obligations happen to converge with
our own internal self-interest,' he told parliament. Those countries (apart
from Japan) which gave their central banks the most independence were also
those with the lowest inflation.
Second, the model chosen is distinctively Gallic. It owes little to either
Germany's Bundesbank or the US Federal Reserve system. This assuages rather
than aggravates French nationalist sentiment, at the same time incurring
minimum change in how the Bank of France has developed since Napoleon set it
up in 1800.
In general terms, the Bank of France will keep its multifarious activities,
which give it the largest staff of any central bank in Europe. Its 17,189
employees will continue to compile their enormous array of data on French
companies and their debtors, to provide management advice to industry, to
run the country's payment clearing system, to supervise commercial banks,
and even to conduct some commercial banking themselves.
The concern of the staff at the Bank of France's headquarters on rue de la
Vrilliere in Paris, and the 212 branches around the country, has been that
Mr Alphandery did not sufficiently guarantee in the new statute that all
these activities would be maintained. Some activities, such as management
consultancy, had started since the previous Bank of France law of 1973.
Despite the June 8 strike, most staff concerns seem unfounded. Mr Jacques de
Larosiere, the governor, has been adamant that the bank's scope of activity
should be maintained, particularly in regulating commercial banks. He
stoutly resists any idea that France should ape the German system which
confides monetary policy to the Bundesbank and banking supervision to a
separate office in Berlin.
The sole change of emphasis, outside monetary policy-making, is that the
Bank will henceforth not try to expand its own commercial banking activity.
At present, the Bank of France holds some 100,000 accounts, mainly for its
own staff but also for some companies. This number has not grown for some
years, but the French Association of Banks had long complained about unfair
competition from the central bank.
In all these activities the government will continue to maintain its
operational links with the central bank. Not so, of course, in monetary
policy, which henceforth is to be run by a special committee. Mr Alphandery
describes it as a 'sanctuary' (because of the way its members will be
shielded from political interference).
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will have nine members - the governor
and his two deputies (appointed by the government for renewable six year
terms), together with six outsiders. The latter would also be appointed by
the government, but from a short list of 18 provided by various
parliamentary and judicial bodies. They will serve staggered nine year terms
which cannot be renewed or revoked (except for serious venal offence). No
MPC can have another job during his or her term, nor anything but a public
function for three years after retiring.
The structure is clear. But certain ambiguities will only become clearer
over time. Article 1 of the law set the Bank's goal as 'ensuring price
stability', but goes on to say that this should be 'in the framework of the
government's general economic policy.' There is potential for conflict here.
Nor is there any definition of price stability. That, says Mr Alphandery,
would be for the Bank of France to judge, just as the Bundesbank does.
Another grey area lies between the clear role of the government in setting
overall exchange rate policy concerning the European Monetary System parity
and fluctuation bands, and the Bank's clear role in deciding day-to-day
intervention in the foreign exchange markets.
The law is also silent on accountability. But Mr Alphandery says he expects
it to lead to more openness about monetary policy, with the governor
probably testifying to parliament twice a year, as the US Fed chairman does,
and holding press conferences, as Bundesbank presidents do.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (10): Farming roots run very deep - Some
CAP reforms go right against the grain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where else but France would a Communist deputy (Mr Remy Auchede)
representing a heavily industrialised constituency (Pas-de-Calais), stand up
in Parliament and declaim that 'rural society is the standard bearer of the
great values of solidarity and humanity which make for the coherence and
identity of our nation.'
Mr Auchede did so this month. But the long-held maxim that what is good for
French agriculture is good for France has been put under increasing
scrutiny, both by the reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP) and by the Gatt world trade negotiations.
So far as the Gatt is concerned, it is no longer clear to the Balladur
government and France's captains of industry - although they remain very
wary about voicing their doubts in public - that France can afford to
isolate itself in the Gatt (and in the EC) by holding a world trade accord,
with potential multi-billion dollar gains to all parties at a time of
widespread economic depression, hostage to its agricultural interests.
France may not want to see cuts in the EC export subsidy system which has
made it the world's biggest agricultural exporter after the US. But farming
now accounts for only 2.4 per cent of French gross domestic product, much
less than services which a Gatt agreement would help expand.
Nor is it any longer axiomatic that the old-style CAP has been 'good' for
French agriculture. Certainly its high price supports have provided French
farmers with the incentive to increase their productivity by an average of 5
per cent over the past 40 years - with borrowings and investments which have
made Credit Agricole France's biggest bank.
Exploiting its natural advantages of soil and climate, France has become the
EC's one big 'agri-power', with a regular surplus of about FFr50bn a year on
its food trade and accounting for nearly a quarter of total EC production.
But this has been production for production's sake. With Brussels ready in
the past to take unlimited amounts of food into storage and to subsidise the
dumping of surpluses on to world markets, farmers generally have not had to
bother about consumer demand in the way that other industries must. Now,
farmers must re-learn marketing skills which have grown rusty over past
decades.
The CAP reforms have produced two changes which go right against the grain
for French farmers.
One is the switch to direct income aids to compensate farmers for cuts in
price supports. This has already happened in oilseeds, whose price support
was reduced by 40 per cent in 1992 to world levels, though with compensatory
direct payments to farmers spread over 1992-93 (which meant that French farm
incomes dropped by 7 per cent in 1992).
This move to the kind of 'deficiency payments' system which Britain had
before it joined the EC - and which the US still has - has made many French
farmers feel like 'pensioners of the state'.
They were always that under the old CAP, of course, but provision of state
aid through price support gave them the illusion they were earning their
living from the market.
The second change, unwelcome to French farmers proud of their ability to
plant up every available hectare and to squeeze every last quintal from it,
is the set-aside system.
The new general requirement that larger European farms leave fallow 15 per
cent of their arable land could lead, according to some French estimates, to
some 1.5m hectares coming out of production in France - equal to the total
of land under cereal cultivation in Denmark, or 10 times that in the
Netherlands.
One trend which the CAP reforms seek to reverse is the intensification of
farming.
The most efficient French farms, in the 200km radius belt around the French
capital known as the 'Paris basin', can compete with any in the world. But
they do so by using a good deal of fertiliser and pesticides. The value of
these intermediate inputs, as a share of total agricultural production, rose
from 18.9 per cent in 1950 to 43 per cent in 1990, to the benefit of French
companies such as Elf-Aquitaine, which makes fertiliser as a by-product of
its oil business, and Rhone-Poulenc, which makes agro-chemicals as well as
ordinary chemicals.
The reaction of French farmers to set-aside will be to make them all the
keener to get the most out of land remaining in cultivation. But
environmental concern about 'agri-pollution' may eventually prove a
restraint. As for livestock, Brussels is now providing financial incentives
to persuade farmers to rear fewer animals on a given area of pasture.
There is a widespread fear that the CAP's new restraints on production and
the likely Gatt restrictions on subsidised exports will increase the
'desertification' of the French countryside. This is quite possible. The
number of individual French farms has dropped from 5m in 1950 to about 1m
today, although the total number of people working on the land is higher
than 1m. According to the 1988 census, there were 1m farmers, 800,00 family
helpers and 156,000 hired hands.
Nevertheless, this relatively small section of the population retains an
enormous emotional and political hold over its fellow citizens, partly
because many town-dwellers have country cottages and partly because so much
of the French way of life has its cultural - certainly gastronomic - roots
in the countryside.
The farm vote, too, is conveniently distributed across the political
spectrum. Most farmers vote conservative - which puts the present government
under an obligation to them - but some, particularly in the south and south
west, have a tradition of voting on the left.
As a result, no French politician has wanted to tell the farmers what they
do not want to hear.
Under international pressure the Balladur government is gradually taking its
courage into its own hands - certainly more so than the last centre-right
government, which chose the head of the largest farmers' union, FNSEA, to be
France's agriculture minister. It has acquiesced in the EC's commitment to
the US to restrain Europe's production of oilseeds, although it still
remains opposed to export subsidy cuts insisted on by the US. But the French
government may be mistaken in thinking that it is doing the farmers a favour
by slowing the pace of change for the rest of France's rural community.
One of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's first acts was to order a temporary
stop to the shutting down of any public service, and to the opening of any
big new supermarkets, in the countryside. Certainly everyone living in
France's rural communities wants to keep their post offices and public
transport. Clearly, too, small shopkeepers will welcome the respite from
supermarket competition. But it is questionable whether the government is
doing the farmers themselves a service by denying them the same consumer
benefits as their city brethren enjoy.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (11): Sore point of pride / A look at
pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French pension system has been in urgent need of reform for years, but
for the past decade successive governments have baulked at the challenge of
getting to grips with the problem.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has sworn that his administration
will be the exception. Little more than a month after taking office he
tabled a modest package of measures intended to alleviate the financial
pressures on the system, and the best brains in the economy ministry are now
beavering away on a sweeping plan for long term reform.
These radical proposals are still a long way from completion. But over the
next few months it should become clear whether or not Mr Balladur really has
succeeded in bucking the trend and producing a long term plan to modernise
the French pension system.
Pensions are a point of national pride in France. The old socialist
government reduced the retirement age to 60 - the same as Italy. People can
now retire in France much earlier than most other European Community
countries, where the average age is 65.
French pensions are also reasonably generous. Under the socialists, anyone
retiring at 60 who had worked for 37.5 years received a state pension
equivalent to 50 per cent of their annual salary in their 10 highest-earning
years, to a maximum of FFr149,820. This meant that the average French
pensioner was paid FFr5,000 a month in 1991; men received FFr6,613 and women
FFr3,504.
The problem is that France can no longer afford such a generous system.
Founded in the post-war era, the system is run on a cash management basis by
the Caisse de Retraite, a public sector institution which pays out pensions
to the elderly from the money received from those in employment. This
arrangement worked well in the 1950s and 1960s when France had a large young
workforce and a relatively small elderly population.
But demographic trends have since ensured that the number of pensioners has
grown, leaving proportionally fewer employees to pay for their pensions.
This scenario will worsen from 2005 onwards as the products of the post-war
'baby boom' start to retire.
The pension system already operates at an annual deficit of FFr20bn, with
just 3.3 workers to support each pensioner. But the number of employees per
pensioner will have fallen to 1.9 in 2005 and to 1.3 in 2040. This means
that, for the present system to survive, each French worker would have to
give up 35 per cent of his or her total income, against 18.9 per cent today.
One solution is to raise the retirement age. Mr Balladur has already done
so, albeit indirectly. His recent reforms left the 'right to retire at 60'
intact but increased the length of time people must work to qualify for
pensions from 37.5 years to 40 years after the year 2003. He also extended
the period for calculating the amount of the pension from the 10
highest-earning years to 20 years, thereby slightly reducing the final
tally.
These measures should help to increase the revenue coming into the system,
while reducing the outflow of pension payments. But they are only a stopgap.
The long term solution to the pension problem will be to supplement the
state system, by encouraging people to invest in private pensions.
Past governments have been deterred from launching private pensions partly
because of the opposition of the trade unions, which are committed to the
concept of the state accepting responsibility for pension provision, and
partly because of the logistical difficulties. The crux of the problem is
persuading the French electorate to spend extra money on their own pensions
at the same time as they are still paying contributions to the state to
support those already in retirement.
The late Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the old socialist prime minister, was forced
by the unions to abandon his plans to introduce private pensions. The unions
are still vigorously opposed to any changes to the state pension system, but
Mr Balladur does have the advantage that, as a conservative, he is less
vulnerable to trade union pressure than his socialist predecessor.
However, Mr Balladur does still face the hurdle of deciding what form of
private pensions to introduce. He also has to sell them to the French
electorate, which will be particularly tricky at a time when disposable
incomes are already under pressure because of the recession.
The prime minister can, at least, count on the support of the financial
community which is waiting with ill-disguised impatience for the arrival of
pension funds in France.
Private pensions, after all, do promise to provide a sorely needed source of
capital for the Paris stock market, which could go a long way towards
solving its long-standing liquidity problem as well as averting crisis in
the present pension system.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (12): Interior minister focuses on
immigration issues / Profile of Charles Pasqua
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S immigrants might well be warning their children that if they don't
behave, Charles Pasqua will come and take them away - were it not for the
parents' fear that the interior minister may be coming for them anyway.
But for most native-born French Mr Pasqua is far from an ogre. The
65-year-old former Ricard drink salesman, outspoken in his rough southern
accent, is one of the country's most popular politicians. According to one
opinion poll, 70 per cent of French welcome Mr Pasqua's return to the
interior ministry.
He was best known in the later 1980s for promising to 'terrorise the
terrorists' - bombs associated with the Middle East had been planted in
Paris. Now, controlling legal immigration and stopping illegal immigration
is his priority.
'France no longer wants to be a country of immigration,' he says, arguing
that with unemployment so high, job competition requires France to aim at
zero immigration. In fact, many immigrants fill the menial job slots which
most native French no longer covet.
Now the backlash has come; in May France said it was suspending Schengen's
implementation until EC partners joined France in tightening immigration
policies and practices on external frontiers.
But matching the barrage of nationality and immigration legislation which Mr
Pasqua and other ministers have submitted to parliament would be a tall
order. It includes:
Removal of the automatic right of French-born children of foreign-born
parents to French passports. Henceforth, such children must affirm their
right to French nationality, which they can lose if they have committed any
prison-worthy crime. Foreign spouses of French nationals would have to prove
two years of cohabitation, instead of one, before getting citizenship.
A foreigner (who can neither be a polygamist nor a student) must show that
he has lived two years legally in France, and that he has adequate financial
means, in order to get his family to join him. Local mayors can suspend a
marriage ceremony temporarily to carry out an investigation.
The right to political asylum is to be written into French law for the first
time but the practice of granting it will be made more restrictive.
More expulsion orders will actually be carried out; last year only 20 per
cent were.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (6): The stuff films are
made of - Champion weightlifter may be too old to compete in 2000
</HEADLINE>

POUND for pound, Naim Suleymanoglu is almost certainly the strongest man in
the world. The 'Pocket Hercules', as the Turks affectionately have dubbed
him, is unofficial mascot for Turkey's bid to host the 2000 Games.
Suleymanoglu, the world champion weightlifter, is a great favourite in
Turkey. A two times Olympic gold medallist and currently the world record
holder in all three categories at his weight - 'snatch', 'jerk' and the
'combined lifts', Suley- manoglu stands, metaphor- ically at least, 'head
and shoulders' above his rivals in the sport.
Today he enjoys the sort of hero status that Turks normally reserve for
their football idols. And if Turkish newspapers are to be believed, he has
adopted the glitzy lifestyle of football stars, too.
'Whatever they say, he came back in 1992 and in my book that's what makes
him such a great champion,' says Cuneyt Koryurek, Turkey's leading sports
writer.
Suleymanoglu is only 1.53m (5 foot) tall, and weighs 60kg (9st 6lb), or at
least that was his weight at the last Olympics in Barcelona. 'The strange
thing about this sport, is that unlike other events you lose weight when you
lay off competing,' he says during an interview in the garden of the sports
writers' club in Ankara.
His story should be the stuff films are made of. A Bulgarian by birth, he
was a member of the country's troubled Turkish minority, from Ptichar, a
mountainous area populated by ethnic Turks.
His father worked down the mines. He was also just 5 foot tall, his mother
who worked in a greenhouse was only 4 feet 7 1/2 inches.
Naim Suleimanov, to use the Bulgarian spelling of his name, was in some ways
a classic product of East Bloc sporting culture. As a boy, he was spotted by
the Bulgarian sports authorities, and was later favoured with his own
apartment and a monthly allowance. He was quick to reveal his class, winning
his first international competition at the age of 14, when he came to within
5 1/2 pounds of beating the adult world record for combined lifts.
But his arrival as a sportsman in the early 1980s coincided with an
unpleasant government campaign aimed at forcibly assimilating his community.
Mosques were closed down. Religious holidays were outlawed and the use of
Turkish banned and religious clothing forbidden.
Suleymanoglu himself had his passport withdrawn and his name changed to Naum
Shalamanov. After criticising the government while competing in a tournament
in Vienna, he was forced to recant on national television.
Having already been approached on earlier trips abroad by Bulgarian
defectors, his own eventual defection was only a matter of time.
While attending a team banquet in Melbourne, Australia, after the World Cup
competition, he slipped out to the washroom and did not return, holing up
for four days before presenting himself at the Turkish consulate to ask for
asylum.
If there was little international comment, in Turkey he became a cause
celebre. Turgut Ozal, then prime minister, sent his private jet to London to
collect the weightlifter. On arrival in Turkey, Suleymanoglu knelt down and
kissed the tarmac.
Ozal was 'more like a father to me,' Suleymanoglu now says of the former
Turkish president who died in April.
Suleymanoglu did not disappoint his new patron. Two years after defecting,
he competed at the Seoul Olympics and broke the snatch world record with
just his second lift, breaking it again with his third. According to the
authoritative Complete Book of the Olympics, 'his combined total was larger
than that of the winner in the lightweight division and his best lifts in
both the snatch and jerk were greater than those of Paul Anderson when he
won the heavyweight division in 1956. At that time, Anderson weighed 303
pounds. Suleymanoglu in 1988 weighed 132.'
There are rules which state that an athlete who changes his nationality
cannot compete at international level for his new country for three years,
unless permission is secured from his former country. Sofia eventually
granted a waiver after the Turkish government paid over Dollars 1m.
Suleymanoglu also undertook to refrain from criticising the Zhivkov
administration.
For all that, this world champion sportsman still cannot return to Bulgaria,
despite the overthrow of the hated Zhivkov regime, and despite the financial
settlement. Two months ago he applied for a visa to compete in Sofia and was
told he would have have to wait 15 years before the authorities would lift
the ban. The Bulgarian Sports Writers Association is now taking up his case
in the courts in Sofia.
Asked today why he chooses to live in Ankara, not Istanbul, Suleymanoglu's
reply is diplomatic: 'One loses a grip on oneself in Istanbul, so I try to
keep away from the place.'
When not working out, he is completing his studies at the Gazi University in
Ankara, doing a volleyball course - perhaps an odd choice for someone of his
Lilliputian proportions.
Now 26, he will probably be too old to compete, should Istanbul get the
Games in 2000, although nothing is ruled out.
'Of course if Istanbul did get it, it would be out of this world. But I'm a
sportsman and it's not my business to promote the Games,' he says, although
he does admit to having signed a few pairs of shorts for the cause.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (7): Many a meal for the
epicure - Visitors can discover the city's merits with a knife and fork
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<TEXT>
IMAGINE the Istanbul 2000 Olympics, pity the poor synchronised swimmers
stuck in the Olympic village while beyond a world of gastronomic temptation
beckons.
It is hardly surprising that weightlifting and wrestling, sports which often
allow great caloric intake, are the ones at which Turkey competes best. For
the visiting epicure, the principal merits of Istanbul's Olympic bid can be
uncovered with implements no more complicated than a knife and fork.
Despite a complex heritage, Turkish cuisine remains craft and not art. Skill
is admired but 'foodies' are rare. Diners will search out the restaurant
which prepares a familiar dish that little bit more special; other
restaurants are quick to copy a dish that has gathered fame, but there is no
love of innovation per se. You can buy imported kiwi fruit, but it is the
brave restaurateur who would add one to somebody's dinner.
The curious exception to this are the large hotels which have pioneered
gentle transformations in Turkish eating habits ever since 1915 when the
palace chefs succumbed to the lure of the pastry shop at the now defunct
Tokatliyan Hotel and ordered a western-style confection for one of the
Sultan's particularly important dinner parties. The Japanese restaurant in
the Swiss Hotel, the Chinese restaurant in the Ramada, and the Italian
restaurant in the Conrad have all made their marks.
Now all the chefs at the five-star hotels are thumbing through their
grandmothers' recipe books to rediscover Ottoman court cuisine. A
conscientious and not over-priced place to sample this is in the dining room
or garden of the more modest Kariye Hotel. Lunch in this neighbourhood of
restored buildings can be combined with a trip to the famous mosaics of St
Saviour in Chora or the rarely visited Sinan-built mosque by the Theodosian
land walls at Edirnekapi.
Many visitors find it hard to disabuse themselves of the notion that the
brochette is the apogee of Turkish cooking. While kebab restaurants are
common and popular, many native Istanbulus look upon them as a provincial
intrusion from the Arab and Kurdish parts of Turkey, to be treated with the
sort of disdain with which Mrs Beeton would eye a chicken nugget. The poor
package tourist who finds his gnashers bouncing off a piece of rubbery Shish
Kebab (in time to the gyrations of a belly dancer) may well agree.
Turkish meat, unless pounded and marinated, is often too fresh to be tender.
The best kebabs, therefore, are often made from seasoned mince of beef and
lamb, kneaded to a gelatinous pulp and moulded around a skewer. Hanedan,
near Besiktas harbour, is a pleasant upmarket kebab house with good starters
and which also serves the other accoutrements of a south-eastern cuisine -
fresh baked flat bread, and lahmacun, a tiny pizza flavoured with meat,
tomatoes, red peppers and fresh lemon.
Less salubrious, but equally fine is Hamdi, beside the spice market in
Eminonu. The original restaurant was recently torn down, but a sister
establishment across the street still maintains the tradition. Here the meat
is mixed with pistachio or grilled alongside Turkish loquats - the so-called
'Malta plum'. As delicious as the decor is hideous are the pickled garlic
cloves, a spicy dip with pomegranate juice and onion or, for desert, kunife
 -sweetened shredded wheat heated with a cheesy filling.
Outside the main city, towards the centres of recreation, the woods and
beaches, there exist large family restaurants which serve any variety of
meat dishes including kuzu tandir, lamb baked in a clay pit oven. Gelik,
Beyti and Kosova were once countryside restaurants before the city burst its
banks and expanded out towards the airport and the proposed Olympic village.
Summer may be fine for sport, but not for fish. Istanbul, a city surrounded
by water, is famous for its seafood but in the warmer months the variety is
much reduced. For many, it is the quality of the copious cold and hot hors
d'oeuvres (meze) that is important, accompanied by raki, an anis drink, or
one of the palatable Turkish table wines.
Unusual starters and much tastier than they sound are chiroz (a dried fish
rehydrated with some vinegar and topped with fresh dill) or lakerda, a
salt-cured fish washed of its saltiness and served with red onion. The
trend, however, in the more exclusive restaurants these days is to serve a
more limited variety of meze, lest the customers skimp on more expensive
fish.
Korfez, on the Asian side of the Bosporus at Kanlica, caters to Istanbul's
highest society with creative elaborations on the Bosporus meal. Its owner,
Mr Omer Salur, has imported from the famous Kemal'in Yeri in his native
Izmir fish baked in a hardened salt casing to seal in the juice. Other
restaurants have been quick to imitate him. Deniz, across the water in
Kirecburnu, has learned the lesson well. Nearby, outside Tarabaya, is
Facyo's - a long-established fish restaurant famous for its meze.
Huzur, known locally as Arab'in Yeri (Chez l'Arab) in Salacak outside
Uskudar remains an old-fashioned fish-and-meze place, with the essential
ingredient of a dramatic view - the historic skyline is across the water.
Cinaralit is probably the best establishment in Ortakoy, Istanbul's infra
dig neighbourhood where bars and clubs loiter behind the seafront
restaurants.
Kumkapi, on the Marmara below the old city, has a number of establishments,
most of them restaurants founded by head waiters who used to work at Kor
Agop, the grandfather of them all. Like the national variety, restaurant
politics displays a tendency to schism.
Some family dynasties remain stable, however. Selim Peucak carries on his
father's tradition at Vila Rifat on the island of Buyukada (take a horse and
carriage from the ferry station to Maden). The restaurant is on the terrace
of a wooden house, and much of the produce comes from the garden beyond.
Dinner here is generally a set menu consisting of a vast array of
traditional meze and grilled meat.
Equally secluded, but right in the centre of the 19th century business
quarter of Beyoglu is Haci Salih (find the Anadol Pasaj next to the Atlas
Cinema). Beyoglu is undergoing a great transformation, with cafes and new
bars (try Kaktus) taking over from the clip joints that once abounded. Haci
Salih is part of an enduring tradition, however. Some of the regular
clientele have memories of the original restaurant which for 40 years
occupied much larger premises nearby, now taken over by an establishment
called Haci Abdullah which has its aficionados.
Mr Abdullah Movit, son of the original Salih, keeps his father's name alive.
There are only a few tables, service is over by late afternoon and there is
no alcohol. However, there is no better place to sample the basics of
Turkish cooking. The current Mr Movit is not a haci (a pilgrim to Mecca) and
even takes the occasional drink, but he says the most important quality of a
restaurateur is to have a good heart. He shudders when he recalls a stuffed
aubergine, during his days of military service in the southern city of
Iskenderum. Ever since, he has been reluctant to eat any meal that he has
not cooked himself.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (7): Wages can go down as well as up  / A
look at some trends in employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most depressing thing for Edouard Balladur, who knows his new government
will be judged primarily on its unemployment record, is the feeling that he
may have failed even before he has properly started.
Publicly the prime minister counsels against despair, telling the National
Assembly last month that 'there is no reason why France should be condemned
to a higher unemployment rate than its neighbours'. But his own government's
forecast that unemployment (10.9 per cent in April) will soon surpass
France's previous jobless record of 11.1 per cent (in spring 1987), and keep
on rising until the end of the year, accords with France's sad track record
on job creation.
Only the exceptional years of 1988-90, with growth running at nearly 4 per
cent, produced a dip in France's unemployment rate. Otherwise it has risen
more steadily than in any other industrialised country.
The reason is that, largely because of structural rigidities in the labour
market, and high payroll taxes acting as an incentive for employers to keep
their workforce to a minimum, France has required a minimum of 2.2 per cent
annual growth just to maintain the existing number of people in work.
By 1995 the French economy might be recovering, but there are no grounds for
optimism in the intervening 18 months. Germany's recession is causing
France's biggest market to collapse, and to France's immediate north and
south French business people face exporters whose goods, priced in devalued
sterling, lira and pesetas, have a considerable price advantage over their
own.
This may not result in a flood of British, Italian and Spanish imports into
France. With certain supermarkets vaunting 'Buy French' policies, the
country stayed in comfortable trade surplus for the first two months of
1993. But the threat of this import competition is being used by French
manufacturers to demand lower wholesale prices from their suppliers - who
are increasingly going outside France, and also outside Europe, to north
Africa or Asia to have their goods made. And this delocalisation or transfer
of production hits employment in France further.
There is not much Mr Balladur can do about delocalisation, except to rail
vainly for a proper 'social' clause in any new Gatt accord imposing on
developing countries the kind of welfare costs that France itself has such
difficulty in shouldering. French companies cannot be prevented from taking
advantage of cheaper costs, and often equal quality of work, elsewhere.
Certain companies have laid themselves open to criticism by Mr Balladur and
his ministers, in the abrupt manner in which they have carried out
redundancies.
For instance: SKF, the Swedish ball-bearing maker, gave its St-Cyr workforce
the required notice of its general plan to make 35 redundant - but no
advance notice to the unfortunate 35, concerned that they had been chosen
for redundancy. SKF thought it was doing the 35 a favour by sending them
straight home in taxis. The 35 did not think so - and neither did the
politicians. But France's conservatives, when they last came to power in
1986, scrapped the system of administrative control over redundancies; they
do not intend to reimpose it.
And yet, they have had to resort to other devices, for which they had
criticised their Socialist predecessors. One such is the contrats
emploi-solidarite (CES), a system of temporary work schemes, in which the
Socialists were accused of parking the young unemployed, in order to
disguise the number of those without work rather than to improve their
chances of getting a real job. Mr Michel Giraud, the new labour minister,
plans to increase the number of CES places from 450,000 to 650,000 over the
next year.
A longer-term aim of the government is to subsidise the doubling (to
400,000) of full apprenticeships in industry over the five-year life of its
economic programme. A reason why one in every five young people under 25 is
without a job is that the barrier for entry into France's technical
institutes is set unnecessarily high. Vocational training places are only
for those who pass the all-round tests of France's generally excellent
school system.
The Patronat employers' federation endorses the idea for more
apprenticeships tailored to industry's specific needs. But it says companies
can often ill afford the financial jump required in taking apprentices on
permanently.
France has a minimum wage, known as the SMIC, which currently stands at a
uniform rate of FFr 5,756 a month. A recent Paribas study shows that over
the past 20 years the SMIC has doubled in real terms, rising much faster
than average pay; it claims this prices least-qualified workers out of the
job market.
When he was finance minister, the late Mr Pierre Beregovoy suggested a lower
SMIC for young workers. But he was howled down by fellow Socialists, and no
one in the Balladur government would dare tamper overtly with the SMIC.
Yet it is no longer unthinkable in France that wages should sometimes go
down as well as up. One remedy, heavily touted by the Socialists during the
election, was work sharing - the idea of spreading the available work around
more people. The notion was largely ridiculed by the conservatives, who said
those in existing jobs would never accept less pay for less work, just to
add some strangers to their work force. But in the last few months some
workers have proved themselves even more self-sacrificing, agreeing to work
the same hours for less pay - with the all-important psychological
difference that they are saving the jobs of people they know: their
colleagues.
For example, the work force at Potain, a building company, has agreed to an
overall 7 per cent pay cut to save 174 jobs. And staff at Publicis, France's
number two advertising agency, have swallowed pay cuts ranging from 2 per
cent for the lowest paid to 8 per cent for the highest paid, in order to
ward off 30 redundancies.
To reward and to encourage such altruism, Mr Giraud came up with a scheme by
which the state itself would offer to make up part of the pay cuts. His idea
was that the government should only step in financially if and when all
other means to prevent redundancies had exhausted.
The labour minister promised that any state compensations for pay cuts would
be partial, temporary and carefully scrutinised. But the potential for abuse
was demonstrated by the behaviour of a Sarrebourg packaging company, Morin
Emballages. Suddenly the management gave its 450 employees 48 hours to agree
to a 5 per cent pay cut, or face redundancies. A political row followed -
and the management backed down.
But it was general opposition from both sides of industry which led Mr
Giraud to shelve his scheme in mid-June. A more promising structural change
has been the government's decision to start shifting some of France's
welfare costs from companies' payrolls on to the general budget.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (9): Transitional Stage - The Bourse has
been transformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past decade the Paris stock market has been radically changed. Reform
after reform has swept aside the old rules and regulations in an attempt to
create a new system to secure its future in the 1990s.
The market is still in a transitional stage. Most anachronisms have been
abolished, but it has yet to make a complete break with the past so that it
can move forward. The appointment of Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right
government will - French financiers hope - mark the final stage in the
transformation of Paris into a thoroughly modern financial centre.
After all, it was Mr Balladur who, in his earlier guise as finance minister
in the Chirac government of the mid-1980s, initiated the first reforms which
were to replace the old, protected Paris market with the deregulated system
of today. The Balladur initiatives were continued in the late 1980s by his
socialist successor, the late Mr Pierre Beregevoy.
The result of their efforts was the abolition of the old agents de change
who had dominated French equities for decades, and the creation of a modern
market using the state-of-the-art Relit settlement system and operated by
the securities subsidiaries of the big French banks and global financial
groups.
But the reforms of the 1980s did not go quite far enough. Despite the best
efforts of Mr Balladur and Mr Beregevoy, some of the old Gallic
idiosyncrasies have lingered on. The French rules on 'block' trading, or
large transactions, are still so strict that it is cheaper for most
securities houses to execute such deals in London rather than Paris.
Similarly the survival of l'impot de bourse, the tax levied on the turnover
of shares in Paris, does little to stem the flow of business away from
Paris.
These anachronisms have aggravated the fundamental problem of the Paris
stock market: lack of liquidity caused by a shortage of equity and
investment.
One reason for the equity shortage is that so many large French companies
are controlled by the state. Despite the Chirac government's privatisation
drive and the socialists' partial privatisation policy, at least 20 per cent
of French output comes from public sector companies.
Another factor is the nepotistic structure of the private sector, where many
big companies, such as Michelin and L'Oreal, are still controlled by the
founding families, and where there are so many 'sweetheart'
cross-shareholding deals that most of the remaining groups are not only
bid-proof, but have relatively small amounts of equity in public issue.
This dearth of equity has undoubtedly made the Paris market less attractive
to investors. Meanwhile the state's stranglehold over the pension system has
deprived France of the private pension funds that provide such useful
sources of capital for the US and UK stock markets. At the same time, the
combination of high interest rates and tax breaks has encouraged personal
investors to plough their savings into SICAV money market funds rather than
into shares.
Mr Beregevoy did his best to resolve these problems. However, his hopes of
abolishing l'impot de bourse, accelerating the partial privatisation
programme and introducing private pension funds, were stymied by the
opposition of the socialist traditionalists and the unions.
So far it looks as though the new Balladur government will have better luck,
not least because, as a centre-right administration, it is less vulnerable
to union pressure. Mr Balladur has already abolished l'impot de bourse on
small transactions. Mr Edmond Alphandery, his free marketeering economy
minister, has also tabled proposals for a privatisation drive which could
include the sale of up to 21 companies over the next two years. Pension
reform is in the pipeline and, as soon as the government budget can cope
with the loss of revenue, l'impot de bourse is expected to be scrapped.
It will take time for these measures to have a tangible effect on the
market. The government will not be able to sell off all its privatisation
candidates within the two-year lifespan of the present parliament. Pension
reform will be fraught with problems and, even when private pension funds
have been introduced, it will be years before they provide a substantial
source of capital.
But Mr Balladur has shown every sign of being determined to complete the
reforms he began in the mid-1980s and to prepare the Paris stock market for
the next century.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (8): Some of the red tape has been removed
 -David Buchan examines foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct foreign investment, in the form of outright acquisitions of local
companies or the building of green field factories, seems to most French
people a more solid contribution to their economy than financial portfolio
investment which can take flight more easily (see article on privatisation).
But the controversy over Hoover's decision to switch its European vacuum
cleaner production from Dijon to Scotland - and lower paid workers - has
reminded many French that direct foreign investment can be flighty, too.
The Hoover case was controversial, because the decision to disinvest was
taken in the middle of a French election campaign, and because there was a
suspicion, denied by the US company, that it was playing off two sets of
European workers against each other. But it is not the only case of
controversial foreign disinvestment; SKF, the Swedish ball bearing maker,
and Iveco, Fiat's truck making arm, have also run into criticism for the
abrupt manner in which they have laid workers off in France.
However, given the much larger number of French companies which have been
switching production to lower cost regions of the world, France has reason
to be grateful for what new foreign investment it has been attracting.
Certainly, Mr Jean-Daniel Tordjman, who holds the new post of France's
special representative for international investment, is philosophical.
'There are always going to be closings (of foreign-owned plants) as well as
openings, just as with domestic investment.'
For the moment the latter category outweighs the former. Foreign-controlled
companies created 14,148 jobs last year, though of course the net addition
to employment was somewhat less - and dwarfed by the inexorable rise in the
total number of unemployed, which hit 3.1m in April 1993.
Nonetheless, last year saw a levelling-out of the traditional imbalance of
French companies investing far more abroad than their foreign counterparts
in France. Foreign-owned firms now employ 22 per cent of France's industrial
workforce. They account for 27 per cent of its manufacturing output and 30
per cent of its exports, with particular strength in the food-processing,
electronics and chemicals sectors.
Mr Tordjman acknowledges the general slowdown in foreign investment. The US
remains the biggest single source of outside investment in France. The most
eye-catching of US projects is the Euro Disney complex outside Paris, which
got off to a somewhat rocky start in spring 1992, but American companies
such as Storage Tech and Dell Computer also built new facilities, in
southern France.
Among European investors, the most notable shift was the decline in new
investment from Germany - now so preoccupied with its eastern half - and the
rise in investment from Switzerland, prompted, perhaps, by Swiss companies'
concern about their country shutting itself out of the EC.
For all France's anti-Japanese rhetoric, particularly on car imports, almost
all the Japanese electronics companies now have French subsidiaries. But in
general, Japanese investment has slowed down in response to Japan's domestic
problems, and this has been only partly compensated for by increased
investment from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.
'For a long time, we didn't give a clear message that we welcomed foreign
investment,' says Mr Tordjman. 'But we do now - partly because we ourselves
have become big investors abroad and we realise the importance of creating
the right climate.' He ticks off the advantages of investing in France:
efficient transport and telecommunications links; relatively cheap
utilities; low inflation; relatively little pressure for wage increases
(partly because of high unemployment) and a corporate tax rate which has
come down from 50 to 33 per cent in the past five years.
On the minus side, however, are the high payroll costs; employers have had
to shoulder these in order to help finance the French welfare state which,
in contrast to most of France's neighbours, gets little help from direct
taxation. The Balladur government is trying to shift the burden of these
payroll costs gradually on to the general state budget, but its room for
manoeuvre is tightly constrained by the size of the budget deficit.
France has made a special effort to attract headquarters companies to cities
such as Paris. Mr Robert Tarika, head of Ernst and Young's tax and legal
department in Paris, says that such headquarters 'are taxed on the basis of
expenses incurred plus a reasonable rate of deemed income . . . which means
that the tax amounts to less than 3 per cent of their total costs, compared
to about 15 per cent in the past.'
Mr Tordjman still complains that nearby rivals such as Belgium overdo the
tax breaks for multinationals' headquarters, but claims that France has at
least cut some of the red tape with which it used to entangle the new
foreign investor. For example, the head of every foreign business in France
 -like his domestic counterpart - must obtain a 'carte de commercant'. It
used to take six months to get this out of the local administration. Now, Mr
Tordjman claims, it takes three weeks.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (5): Water - relief is
at hand / Olympic visitors may face less inconvenience than in the past
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
If the 1980s were taken up with road and telecommunication projects in
Turkey, the 1990s seem certain to be the decade for the water business. And
nowhere is there is a greater need of a improved water infrastructure than
in Istanbul, a city already close to a population of 9m and projected to
reach 20m by the year 2010.
A successful Olympic bid will no doubt spur those efforts, but Iski, the
city water authority, is already planning a big investment programme.
At a cost of around Dollars 5bn, the Greater Istanbul Sewage and Water
Project comprises some 16 biological treatment plants and several thousand
kilometres of supply pipe. In addition, Turkey is considering a large scheme
to divert a river 150 miles away on the Asian mainland to augment the city's
water supplies.
Iski has not spent much more than Dollars 200m in any one year on capital
investment. To conceive of spending as much as Dollars 500m a year - as is
envisaged under the master plan - to meet the needs of the Games in 2000
represents a major challenge.
As for ongoing projects, most should be complete in the next three years.
The heaviest workload is projected over the next three years, and accounts
for almost the total Dollars 500m to be spent on waste- water projects. A
further Dollars 100m will be needed to conclude the city's various water
supply projects.
The one real concern is Iski's ability to handle such a heavy workload.
According to some assessments, its financial position has deteriorated over
the last year. Iski's income fell from Dollars 74m in 1991 to Dollars 60m
last year, as collection rates have worsened. Interestingly, government
institutions are the worst offenders.
Demography is only one reason why the current system is under such strain.
If the maze of cisterns and aqueducts is any measure, the problems of water
management have taxed city planners even from Byzantine times.
Today to meet the city's water needs is both an engineering and an
institutional challenge.
Not a moment too soon, you hear Istanbul's long-suffering residents grumble,
wistfully remembering those beach holidays on the shores on the Marmara.
Today only the foolhardy will swim in the waters around the city.
Istanbul has just six reservoirs including Terkoz on the European side,
which was constructed by the French in the 1800s.
In 1990, the drought was so severe that the authorities had to ship in water
from the Asian mainland. Iski also resorted to cloud seeding with a mixture
of propane gas and silver iodine to encourage the rains.
Nowadays, there is an additional problem - pollution. Omerli Lake on the
Asian side is Istanbul's principal water source, currently supplying half
the city's drinking water. Today the lake is in critical danger from
contamination. Dr Ergun Goknel, the Iski president, estimates that around
600,000 illegal settlers have built homes on public land around the lake and
are discharging their effluent directly into the reservoir.
Iski has managed to win agreement from a number of local municipalities to
prevent illegal settlements. Unfortunately, the agreement does not include
the areas where the problem is most severe.
The World Bank is now considering supporting a Dollars 800m programme to
protect the reservoir shoreline and provide existing settlements with full
water and sewage services. The Nordic Investment Bank is financing the
feasibility study but there is some concern that the bank will not be
willing to fund the bulk of the project.
According to one expert assessment, the nearby Elmali reservoir is already
unsuitable as a drinking water source.
The city's sewage problem is perhaps even more urgent. At present there is
not a single biological treatment plant for a population of 9m people. An
estimated 90 per cent of the city's effluent is dumped unceremoniously in
the Bosporus or the Sea of Marmara, damaging the coastline and polluting the
waters.
Mr Bedrettin Dalan, the former mayor, claimed he would make the waters of
the Golden Horn as blue as his eyes - but it turned out to be an empty
boast.
In another controversial project, supported by the World Bank, engineers
were asked to consider injecting partially treated sewage into the Bosporus,
making use of the bottom current which would carry the main solids up to
Black Sea where they would decompose.
At the time, the project seemed to offer an ingenious solution to the city's
sewage problems, utilising as it did the Bosporus' considerable powers for
natural purification. The project made use of the fact of the channel's
bottom current which because of the difference in salinity flowed against
the main current, back into the Black Sea.
The other attraction of the scheme was that it got round the problem of a
large-scale land acquisition which would be required if a treatment plant
was to be built. This is a major problem in such an overcrowded city.
However Mr Nurettin Sozen, the new mayor, abandoned both projects and
undertook a detailed review of the city's environmental policies.
The Mediterranean is like a 'big sink and Istanbul is the plug,' says one
foreign engineer involved in the city's water infrastructure.
Iski claims its new policy is more advanced than anything in Europe, where
the Community has only just adopted the ban on sea and river discharges, and
the directive comes into effect only in 1998. 'In Istanbul we introduced
such a code long ago, before the EC's Mediterranean convention, even before
the Black Sea countries,' says Dr Goknel.
The result was a new scheme, involving a tunnel, to intercept the sewage now
being discharged direct into the Bosporus. The only site large enough, and
with the right hydrological and environmental standards, was 40 miles away
at Riva on the Black Sea. The British group Taylor Binnie and Partners, a
venture between consultants Binnie and Partners and the Acer Construction
group, has been awarded the design contract. Binnie claims it will be the
largest treatment plant of its type in the world.
Mr Jaro Pavel, a local site manager, says the tunnel itself, at some 4.6
metres, will be almost as wide as the London Underground.
Many government aid agencies are eyeing opportunities in the water field.
In the wake of the 1990 drought, Japan's official development arm, the
Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund, is looking at the possibility of
funding the Melen River project, perhaps the most ambitious proposal
currently under consideration.
The scheme involves construction of a pipeline 170km away on the Black Sea,
a major damming complex. The cost will be more than Dollars 1bn.
Only last month Iski (or Istanbul Su ve Kanalizasi Idaresi to give it its
Turkish name) awarded a Pounds 100m contract to the UK company Wallace
Evans, for the latest stage of what is now claimed to be the largest public
health scheme in the world.
The project involves construction of an 18km tunnel, 11km of open-cut sewer
and a new sewage plant deploying the latest biological screening
technologies.
The athletes may be thankful for their efforts. The nearby Buyukcekmece lake
is the proposed site for the rowing competition.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (4): Scrambled eggs for
players at the Games - Is the city in with a chance? How the Olympic
Committee is seeking international support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALREADY, Istanbul has persuaded 32 of the 96 members of the Inter- national
Olympic Committee to visit the city. Mr Sinan Erdem, president of the
National Olympic Committee and vice-chairman of the bid committee, believes
if just another 20 come, then Istanbul is in with a real chance.
'Not since the war have we had such a compact project,' says Mr Erdem, a
former volleyball player who has worked for the Olympic movement for 26
years.
The Istanbul bid committee is nominally headed by Mr Mehmet Ali Yilmaz, the
minister for sport. This businessman and sports fanatic used to have a sofa
big enough to seat the entire squad of Trabzonspor, the football team he
owns.
The bid itself is costing around Dollars 10-12m, much of it spent on
preparing the bid document, a weighty package in English and French. There
are also advertising expenses and the cost of a permanent staff of experts,
not to mention the entertain- ment allowance for visiting IOC members.
Nevertheless, for those outside sport, the mechanics of winning the Games
may be difficult to comprehend.
Lord Of the Rings, a book published in the run-up to the Barcelona Olympics,
provided a fairly damning portrait of bribery and corruption - allegations
that Mr Erdem strongly rejects. For him, the IOC members are a group of
individuals.
Mr Atilla Aksoy, of Young &amp; Rubicam, believes the bid will be decided on
more practical considerations. 'You have to know how to get 150,000 eggs to
the village every morning and then scramble them,' he says to illustrate his
point.
Istanbul's bid is more compact than that of Peking, although Sydney has
similar advantages. Design work was done by two US firms - Stang &amp; Newdow
and Copeland Hirthler, both of whom were co-ordinated by Young &amp; Rubicam.
The site chosen for the Games is near the present Buyukcekmece Lake, which
will be the focus for a nest of stadiums - even the sailing is not far away
in the beautiful marina at Fenerbahce on the Asian side of the sea of
Marmara. Mr Erdem likes to point out that the archery at the Los Angeles
Games had to take place in Mexico.
The Olympic village nearby will comprise some 7,000 flats, considered ample
for the estimated 15,000 competitors who will attend the Games. The units
have already been sold. After the Games, and a quick coat of paint, the
apartments will handed over to their new owners. There will be no cost to
the Olympics authorities.
The telecommunications centre will be sited in the Istanbul World Trade
Centre which is due to be opened in July. Turkey is already linked to its
own Turksat satellite programme - beaming to central Asia and to the
country's guest workers in Germany and other European countries. Given the
revolution that has occurred in Turkish telecommunications over the past few
years, officials are confident that Turkey can comfortably handle such a
large media event.
No-one - at least no-one in Istanbul - is scoffing at the bid. The budgeting
for the Games is considered conservative. Moreover, the government has
agreed to underwrite any shortfall in revenues. There will therefore not be
any direct burden on the city.
The revenue from selling the TV rights has been projected at Dollars 480m.
At Barce- lona, TV deals generated more than Dollars 500m and at Atlanta the
site of the next Games in 1996, the estimate is Dollars 800m.
'We didn't want to show the TV world that we were dependent on television,'
says Mr Aksoy. He estimates that 40 per cent of the TV sponsorship may come
from Europe.
Ticket pricing has still to be finalised, although organisers say the aim is
to make it as cheap as possible for the spectators. 'It shouldn't be seen as
a rich man's club,' says Mr Aksoy.
In another gesture to the populist ideals of the Games, Istanbul is
promising to pay the travel expenses of all athletes and officials. In
addition, Dollars 3m is budgeted to pay for journalists from the former
Soviet Union and developing countries. Mr Aksoy says that in Barcelona they
were starving.
Prince Albert of Monaco, in his capacity as member of the IOC, visited
Istanbul a few weeks ago. Driving through the traffic to the proposed site
for the Olympic village, he tried to phone Hong Kong, then New York and then
home to Monaco. Somewhat to his surprise, he got through to all three places
without a hitch.
Istanbul is full of surprises. For instance, visiting the Grand Bazaar, Mr
Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC, must have been taken aback to
find a carpet seller who could speak his native Catalan]

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (6): Aux armes, citoyens] - Paris and the
provinces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARISIANS 'should realise the French provinces are not Kamtchatka or the
Kalahari desert,' President Mitterrand said recently when he was
inaugurating the TGV high speed rail link from the French capital to Lille.
He was commenting on the guerrilla tactics employed by large parts of the
national civil service in resisting government efforts to shift them from
Paris, in the interest of reducing congestion in the capital and increasing
employment in the rest of the country. The war between Paris and the
provinces goes back at least two centuries, to the French revolution.
First, the Girondins tried to reduce the predominance of Paris over the
provinces, only to be succeeded by the Jacobins, who then centralised the
French state more than the Bourbon kings had ever succeeded in doing. The
most serious attempt to push the pendulum back came only in 1982-83.
Regions were then given a real responsibility for their own economic
development, and some real money (largely from car and property taxes) to
carry it out. But 10 years of supposed regionalisation has done nothing to
diminish the relative weight of Paris in the economy.
The Ile de France region, in which Paris is situated, is still home to 30
per cent of the country's university students, 40 per cent of its managers,
42 per cent of all its offices, 60 per cent of its researchers and 78 per
cent of the headquarters of France's top 200 companies.
Recent Socialist governments decided on a more dirigiste solution.
During her year (1991-92) as prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson announced a
plan to send 15,000 civil servants out of Paris by 1996 - and double that
number by the end of the century. Two years later only about 2,000 have
departed the capital, grumbling about the extra cost and time spent in
commuting back to Paris.
Certain institutions have not taken their exile from Paris lying down. The
most notable among these has been the Ecole Nationale d'Administration
(ENA), the fount of France's civil service elite.
ENA was ordered to Strasbourg by Mrs Cresson (not herself a former enarque),
where it is being re-housed in a former prison. But ENA's influential
association of former pupils challenged the decision. Earlier this month the
Conseil d'Etat, the country's highest administrative court, ruled that Mrs
Cresson had not followed the proper procedure in moving the school to
Alsace.
But ENA's old boys reckoned without one of their number. Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur has decided to risk the wrath of his patron, Mr Jacques
Chirac (enarque and mayor of Paris) and uphold Mrs Cresson's decision. To be
sure, he could do no less without emptying of all content his pledge for a
new regional planning policy.
The Paris lobby is stronger than ever in the new government. No fewer than
eight ministers are elected from the Paris area. They include Mr Balladur
himself; Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister who also holds (as French
politicians are allowed to do) the presidency of the Ile de France regional
council; and Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister who also presides over
the nearby Hauts de Seine department. But Mr Balladur's partner in coalition
 -the UDF - strongly favours more regionalisation; this Girondist tendency
in the UDF is one of the characteristics which distinguishes it most from
the more Jacobin RPR, the neo-gaullist party of Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac.
More important, Mr Balladur knows that most of the elements in his regional
policy are passive - such as putting a freeze on the closure of public
services and the opening of new supermarkets in the countryside. Other
policies, too, are narrowing his options in regional policy. Planned defence
cuts - which in 1994 involve demobilising 10,000 soldiers, closing a
garrison in Limoges, shutting down the submarine base in Lorient in Brittany
 -have raised a minor furore among local politicians.
His privatisation programme, too, reduces the number of state employees
which the government can direct to the provinces. The Conseil d'Etat, for
instance, raised the same administrative objection to shifting Seita, the
state tobacco making monopoly, from Paris to Angouleme. But since Seita is
now on the privatisation list, it will presumably be eventually allowed to
decide for itself where it wants to sit.
And what, one might ask, is the point of the French state pouring money into
fast transport if it cannot exploit (say) the new TGV link from Paris to
Lille by putting the national patent office in the provincial city?

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (5): So far the omens are not ideal /
Review of the privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a new French government were to choose an ideal moment to sell off a
score of France's biggest public sector companies, this would certainly not
be that moment.
A sluggish stock market, an uncertain economic outlook and a stream of
gloomy company results do not add up to the ideal climate for share issues.
Yet within the next few months Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right government
will embark on one of the most sweeping privatisation programmes that Europe
has ever seen.
The privatisations - which could involve the sale of up to 21
state-controlled companies including Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de
Paris in banking, Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals, Elf-Aquitaine in oil, Pechiney
in packaging and the Air France airline - are scheduled to start from
September.
The Balladur administration now faces the challenge of implementing its
radical privatisation proposals despite the unreceptive state of the French
economy and the Paris stock market. It must then get to grips with the
longer term task of assessing how the sales will affect the relationship
between the state and industry in France, which still owns, after Italy,
Europe's second largest public sector.
To some extent the present programme marks a continuation of the policy
pursued by the last conservative French government, the Chirac
administration, between 1986 and 1988. The right then raised FFr120bn by
selling off 29 companies - including the Societe Generale bank, Alcatel
Alsthom, the electronics concern, and the Havas media group - until the
stock market crash in October 1987 brought its issues to an abrupt halt.
The new list of privatisation candidates includes the 12 companies
originally slated for sale in 1986, and 10 new candidates, most of which -
notably the Renault motor company, and Aerospatiale, the aerospace concern -
had previously been regarded as unsellable, whether on financial or
strategic grounds.
The Balladur government's zest for asset sales is partly the product of
ideology. Both the RPR and UDF, the two centre-right parties that make up
the current coalition, are politically committed to the concept of reducing
the role of the state in industry.
Privatisation forms an important part of the new laissez faire approach to
industrial policy championed by Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister. He
recently warned that the new administration would be far stingier about
subsidising ailing state concerns than its predecessors, and much more
welcoming towards the prospect of foreign investors taking stakes in the
French public sector.
However, the government is also motivated by financial considerations.
The inflow of cash from privatisation sales will be absolutely essential if
it is to succeed in its plans to restrain public borrowing (the budget
deficit is expected to reach FFr317bn this year) and to invest in economic
regeneration. The prime minister has already announced proposals for a
FFr40bn 'Balladur bond' - he hopes to raise capital for public works and
housing programmes this summer by issuing special bonds which will convert
into shares in newly privatised companies.
The critical question is whether the stock market will be able to absorb the
proposed privatisations. The old socialist government was forced repeatedly
to postpone plans for its smaller partial privatisations because of the
sluggish state of the market.
It is instructive that Mr Edmond Alphandery, the new monetarist economy
minister, has reserved the right to scale down the new issues, by selling
off small tranches of shares, if the market is too weak to take full-scale
sales.
So far the omens are far from encouraging. The Paris stock market was almost
static last year and has shown no sign of improvement in 1993. However, the
market traditionally rallies in the fourth quarter, which means that if it
follows its usual seasonal pattern, it should be starting to pick up in time
for the first round of sales in September. James Capel in Paris expects the
CAC 40 Index to reach about 2,200 by the end of this year.
Mr Alphandery also has plans to encourage individual investors to
participate in the sales, through tax breaks and phased-payment schemes
which will also be open to employee share-owners. Moreover, the recent
reductions in French interest rates should help the government's efforts to
persuade the public to withdraw their savings from SICAV money market funds
and to reinvest them in equities.
Finally Mr Alphandery is counting on a high level of interest from
international investors. He has abolished the old 'ceiling' rule under which
foreigners could not own more than 20 per cent of former state companies. He
has also invited foreigners to become noyaux durs, the 'hard core' investors
encouraged to take long term stakes in newly privatised French companies to
smooth transition to the private sector.
But the strong franc might deter some international investors, particularly
those in weaker currency countries such as the UK. The new government's
fondness for noyaux durs and 'golden shares' (that enable the state to block
indefinitely the takeover of strategic concerns) could also dampen
international interest, particularly among US and UK investors who tend to
dismiss such measures as protectionist and anachronistic.
The other serious impediment to the government's plans is the fragile state
of some of the privatisation candidates. The French economy came under
strain last year; this year it has slipped into recession. A number of
companies on the Alphandery list are simply not suitable for sale, at least
not for a reasonable price in the short term.
Bull made a loss last year, as did Air France. Mr Longuet has already warned
that both groups face severe financial difficulties this year. Credit
Lyonnais fell into the red. Union des Assurances de Paris and GAN Group, the
insurers, suffered sharp falls in profits. Renault is now bracing itself for
a bruising year in the intensely competitive motor market. Some of these
groups may be sellable towards the end of the present government, if the
economy improved, but others will probably be postponed for several years.
The consensus among analysts is that the government will begin with the more
robust candidates. Elf, Rhone-Poulenc and Pechiney are the prime industrial
targets. Banque Nationale de Paris and Assurances Generales de France are
the favourites in finance, even though both saw profits decline last year.
These issues should start to come on stream in the autumn, but the first
serious test of the stock market's appetite for government asset sales is
this month's partial privatisation of Credit Local de France, the banking
group which specialises in local authority loans, in the sale of a 30 per
cent stake for FFr4bn to FFr5bn.
Credit Local is a small issue which, given that the legislation was already
in place, does not really belong to the mainstream privatisation programme.
But the response to the sale could be critical in influencing the timing and
scale of the larger issues. It will also provide a useful slug of shares for
Mr Balladur's bonds.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (2): Plans to make city
a centre of culture - Its role as an international metropolis is being
resumed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANSEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
1993 IS the Year of Istanbul, according to Mr Fikri Caglar, Turkey's
Minister of Culture. He wants to make it an international centre of culture.
Yet without government help the city is already resuming the role, as an
international metropolis, which it lost after the fall of the Ottoman Empire
and the transfer of the Turkish capital to Ankara in 1923.
A 104-year-old Englishwoman, Leila Duran, can remember arriving in Istanbul
as a young bride in 1912: 'It was all French] Everyone spoke French]' Now
'everyone' speaks English: for the first time since the 1920s the city is
part of the world economy, with a fully convertible currency. It contains
half Turkey's manufacturing industry, and its inhabitants have incomes of
Dollars 10,000 a year, five times the national average. The fall of the
Soviet empire has helped the rise of Istanbul as an international economic
and diplomatic centre.
Istanbul businessmen commute regularly to the new Turkish- speaking capitals
of Baku and Tashkent. Selling more blue jeans and leather jackets than
carpets and kelims, the Grand Bazaar has become the Oxford Street of the
Balkans.
In certain districts, such as Nisantasi, Ortakoy and Atakoy, the stigmata of
wealth have appeared: picture framers, espresso bars and Japanese
restaurants. Night clubs such as Club 29, Andromeda and Fly-Inn Bar (with an
aeroplane in its ceiling) are as modern as any in the west. Clothes, hair
styles and music are exactly the same as in Covent Garden or Les Halles. As
one young advertising executive told me, reflecting the wishes of most of
his generation: 'We want everything to be standard'. Even a shop selling
shirts with personalised monograms has opened near Istiklal Caddesi, the
main shopping street of Istanbul. Banned to cars, the street may become as
elegant as it was in the 19th century, when it was the cosmopolitan,
French-speaking Grande Rue de Pera.
The new wealth and confidence of Istanbul are being translated into art and
culture. The annual Istanbul Book Fair, which started in 1981, now has 250
publishers' stands. Bizim Sehir (Our City - an Istanbul magazine forbidden
to use its original name, Kostantiniye, because of the Greek connotation)
calls it 'a tempest, a cultural outburst'. Although the 1992 fair was marred
by confiscation of pro-Kurdish items, the public was so eager for books that
there were queues around the block. At times, there were so many book-lovers
inside that you could not see the books.
As in the 19th century, there are now Istanbul publishers, and writers,
working in English and French as well as Turkish.
1515, for example, specialises in works restoring Ottoman history to its
proper place at the heart of Europe. They are written in French by Turkish
and foreign historians such as Selim Diringil and Ethem Eldem. Eren Books
has produced an excellent illustrated work by Bahettin Oztuncay, in English,
on James Robertson, the Scot who in the early 1850s was one of the first
photographers of Istanbul, as well as chief engraver of the Imperial Ottoman
Mint. The quality of photographic reproduction is now as high as in the
west.
Another sign of the transformation of Istanbul is the slow emergence of an
art market. There are more than 30 commercial art galleries, and many more
antique shops. The annual Istanbul Antique and Decorative Arts Fair, the
largest between Italy and the south-east Asia, was started eight years ago
by Kusav, the Foundation for Turkish Art. It is held every autumn in the
silahhane or arsenal of Yildiz, the secluded art nouveau palace complex of
Sultan Abdul Hamid II, in the north of Istanbul, which is gradually being
restored and opened to the public.
Below frescoes of Ottoman battleships, in the scented ambience of a fashion
parade, to the sound of piped Beethoven, dealers sell Ottoman turban-holders
and silver snuff-boxes; spoons made in equal parts of tortoise shell, ivory
and coral; or a painted wooden wall from a late 17th century ablution-room.
For the first time, as in a western metropolis, collecting has become a
fashionable pastime. There is a new passion for Islamic and Ottoman art.
Most wealthy Istanbulus prefer fabrics from London and Paris. However,
traditional Turkish colours and patterns are beginning to be used, to
remarkable effect, in the tiles made by Gorbon or the fabrics of Aykut
Hamzagil. Even Istanbul's gleaming modern fast food outlets sell as much
Turkish as American food.
Love of Istanbul is helping to transform its millionaires into cultural
entrepreneurs. Mrs Cigdem Simavi, wife of a prominent former newspaper
proprietor, is director of Kusav, the Istanbul Foundation for Culture and
Arts started by Dr Nejat Eczacibasi, owner of Turkey's largest
pharmaceutical company. She has helped to organise the Istanbul
International Festival of Music for the past 20 years.
Recently, Kusav founded the Istanbul International Biennial of modern art,
in the Fezhane, a long low red building trapped between the roar of the
traffic on the Ataturk bridge and the stench of the refuse in the Golden
Horn. Where once fezes were manufactured for the citizens of Constantinople,
such wonders as a row of blue baths from Belgium, mini-priapuses from Turkey
and trolleys of dirty linen from Bulgaria were installed.
Will they really help the declared aim of the government and the foundation
to make Istanbul 'a capital of world culture'? Strangely, there were no
exhibits from countries in Istanbul's historic hinterland of the Middle
East.
Up the Bosporus, in a wooden mansion in Buyukdere, is the Sadberk Hanim
Museum, established with the help of Koc Holding, the largest company in
Turkey. Named after the wife of the head of the family, Vehbi Koc, it is run
by their daughter, Sevgi Gonul. Its splendid collection of antiquities
ranges from neolithic goddesses to Byzantine ear-rings, from Hellenistic and
Roman gold diadems (I counted at least 10) to Iznik tiles as good as those
in Topkapi Palace itself. This privately owned and funded museum provides a
better view of daily life, and domestic rituals in Ottoman Istanbul than any
other museum.
On display at the Sadberk Hanim are examples of the embroidered silk
envelopes in which letters were sent, the round tasselled velvet coverlet
which a coffee-pourer wore over the left shoulder, and a bed on which the
son of a wealthy family was circumcised. For good luck the bed was festooned
with embroidered towels shaped into butterflies and roses.
The restyling of Istanbul, its growing resemblance to a modern European
city, are accompanied, simultaneously, by its destruction. Both effects have
the same cause: prosperity. As the Turkish proverb goes: 'He who holds the
honey-pot is bound to lick his fingers' and, despite public protests,
planning restrictions are regularly flouted.
Skyscrapers and housing estates are closing in on the Bosporus and the
Golden Horn. As if playing a game of architectural grandmother's footsteps,
every summer the visitor returns, they have moved nearer. One of the great
architectural crimes of the last five years has been the construction of a
glass and concrete hotel, sprawling insolently above, and dwarfing, the
19th-century grandeur of Dolmabahce Palace. Some bedrooms have been
especially decorated to make Japanese businessmen feel at home.
Behind Istanbul's smart modern facade, the city is torn by an economic and
demographic explosion without parallel since its conquest by the Ottoman
Turks in 1453. Owing to immigration from Anatolia, the population has
doubled in the past seven years, from 5m to more than 10m; and still the
Anatolians come.
The 50,000 or so Istanbulus whose families have lived there for many
generation and who speak with a traditional Istanbul accent feel like a
hunted minority. The pollution caused by traffic and industry is so bad
that, in most districts, people need air filters in their apartments. Some
2m inhabitants are said to have no running water.
Can the city survive its own growth rate? Professor Nurettin Sozen, mayor of
Greater Istanbul, has plans for a metro, an improved sewage system and the
cleaning of the Sea of Marmara. Realists urge an entrance tax, or a
programme to relocate industry to the east.
In the mayhem of modern Istanbul, it is not surprising that some turn to
fundamentalist Islam. In November 1992, the religious Welfare Party won four
mayoral seats in Istanbul. The victory was immediately dismissed by members
of Istanbul's modern elite as of no significance. But Mr Cuneyt Ayral,
devotee of the old and a businessman in the new Istanbul, says: 'As long as
Istanbul appears paved with gold, the city's fate is sealed.'

a history of Istanbul under the Ottoman sultans.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (3): The tension with
Ankara - Olympic bid may have impact on local government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISTANBUL is a society with its own traditions formed over centuries. But it
is also regarded with a proprietorial eye by the rest of the country for
which it serves as a commercial and cultural hub. As national politicians in
far-away Ankara are all too aware, what happens in Istanbul matters to
people in the most remote corner of Turkey.
In practice, this means that central government has been reluctant to lose
control of a city that generates some 40 per cent of the nation's tax
revenue and a similar proportion of GNP. Yet with a population estimated
unofficially at over 9m, it is clearly impossible to administer a city of
Istanbul's size and complex topography by remote control.
A jaundiced view of the city's history over the last 45 years lights on the
tension between a capital anxious to get its hands both on the wealth and
political credit which the city generates and the efforts of local
politicians to reinvest it locally.
Such a description, however, fails to take account of the major attempts to
reorganise local administration in Turkey - both in the early 1960s when
cities first elected their mayors democratically at the ballot box and more
recently during the 1980s when large municipalities like Istanbul were given
an additional tier of elected government.
Indeed, one frequent argument heard in support of Istanbul's Olympic bid is
that it would concentrate the minds of Turkey's politicians, who even now
are contemplating further radical re-organisation to cope with the
additional demands for amenities and services by the year 2000.
Historically, a centrally organised provincial government has been a safety
net for a local government which did not have ready access to revenue for
capital projects or technical expertise. In practice, administrative
tutelage, the right of Ankara at one stage to control even low-level
appointees, acted as a check on local autonomy.
For Ankara politicians, getting too close to the source of the country's
wealth has its risks. Adnan Menderes, the Democrat prime minister, became
personally involved in the reshaping of Istanbul, cutting boulevards through
neighbourhoods with a scant regard for niceties that helped to fill the
charge sheet when he was overthrown by the military in 1960 and later tried
and hanged.
It took Ataturk eight years to return to Istanbul after he fled to join the
nationalist cause. Towards the end of his term as prime minister, the Ozal
government seemed to be there most weekends. Was it mere coincidence that it
was then the press began to accuse the late Turgut Ozal of dynastic
ambitions?
'Everyone is trying to get their bit of the city,' according to Mr Tugrul
Erkin, who serves as general secretary to the mayor. Building regulations
particularly on the scenic Bosporus appear to be iron tight. Mr Ishak
Alaton, joint head of Alarko Holding, and Mr Erkin's former private sector
boss, complains it is easier to get planning permission in Moscow than
Istanbul. Yet the popular belief is that patience brings massive rewards - a
determined and well-connected speculator will find a gap between the
overlapping tiers of state and local authorities.
The rewards for catering to the expanding needs of a city that doubles in
size every 15 years are so great that according to Mr Hari Kozakcioglu, the
current governor, the contractors will fall over themselves to build the
Olympic venues for free in exchange for the right to develop the adjacent
properties.
Mr Kozakcioglu's own office is the subject of much discussion. Should
Istanbul be hived into Asian and European sides or should the authority of
the governor's office be expanded, making Istanbul virtually a state within
a state?
This follows from the major local re-organisation after 1983, when many of
the basic elements of urban administration, including the creation and
enforcement of its own master plan, were given to the newly elected Greater
Istanbul Municipality. The assumption was that the city with its large tax
base and ready supply of human resources could cope. Responsibility for a
variety of day-to-day services was entrusted to 15 newly formed district
municipalities.
At the same time, central administration remained represented in the person
of the governor, a professional bureaucrat appointed centrally. The
governor's office also retained responsibility for items like policing and
education.
The truth is that although the mayor of Istanbul enjoys the largest personal
popular vote of any politician in the country, governing the city is a
political graveyard. Mr Bedrettin Dalan, the last mayor but one, was seen to
be a victim of his own ability to get things done, a rising star whom Turgut
Ozal, then prime minister, felt obliged to shoot down.
The electorate, however, failed to distinguish their loyalties. In the 1989
municipal election Mr Dalan fell victim to the unpopularity of the Ozal
government and was hounded from office. His Social Democrat successor, Mr
Nurettin Sozen, may fare no better in the election scheduled for March 1994.
This would be particularly ironic given that Mr Murat Karayalcin, the mayor
of Ankara, is widely tipped to succeed as head of the Social Democratic
People's party this autumn.
Mr Karayalcin is probably no better at muddling through, but in Ankara, a
city at the heart of the political machine, with a population of 4m rather
than Istanbul's 10m, it is always easier to make one's mark.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (2): No shying away from the challenge -
Alice Rawsthorn tests the new prime minister's grip on the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING this spring's general election campaign Mr Edouard Balladur, then one
of the higher profile campaigners for the RPR Gaullists and now prime
minister, was wont to say that the old socialist government had left the
French economy in its 'worst state since the second world war'.
Mr Balladur was exaggerating. It is fair to say that there was serious cause
for concern about France's economic condition.
Unemployment had reached record levels by breaching the 3m barrier. Real
interest rates were among the highest in Europe, with bank base rates at 10
per cent and inflation at 2 per cent, thereby imposing pressure on consumer
confidence and industrial investment.
France had slid into recession, with the first quarter GDP figures showing a
second successive quarterly reduction in the real rate of growth for the
first time since the Gulf War. The socialists had also over-spent and the
government deficit was rising rapidly.
Finally, the French franc was threatened of a renewal of the money market
attacks that had plagued it through the winter.
That was the bad news. The new prime minister could, however, seek solace in
the French economy's underlying strengths of low inflation, competitive
wages, the well-equipped corporate sector with low levels of debt and the
high rate of personal savings which might be coaxed out of SICAV money
market funds and into the stock market.
Mr Balladur's task is to redress France's weaknesses and to embellish its
strengths, so that his centre-right coalition can prove that it has
regenerated the economy and reduced unemployment by the time the French cast
their votes in the 1995 presidential polls.
The new premier could scarcely be accused of shying away from the challenge.
One of his first initiatives was to ask his new ministers to find FFr20bn of
cuts from their budgets, thereby setting a suitably austere tone for his
administration.
He then commissioned an audit of the French economy to assess the real state
of government finances. Mr Balladur unveiled the audit's findings in
mid-May, having delayed doing so as a mark of respect following the suicide
of Mr Pierre Beregevoy, his socialist predecessor, earlier that month.
The audit concluded that, if the budget deficit remained unchecked, it would
escalate to FFr410bn, or 5.8 per cent of GDP, this year.
The new prime minister then tabled a number of measures - including FFr7.7bn
increases in tax on alcohol and tobacco and FFr21.5bn cuts in government
spending - to try to restrain the 1993 deficit to FFr331bn, or 4.5 per cent
of GDP.
Mr Balladur hopes soon to accelerate the process of deficit reduction with
the proceeds of his privatisation programme. It starts this autumn, and
could include the sale of as many as 21 state-controlled companies over the
next two years. His plans should also be aided by lower interest rates,
which ought to make it cheaper for the government to service its debt.
At the same time he is launching an economic regeneration programme - which
involves public works, housing schemes and incentives to encourage job
sharing - to stem the rise in unemployment and to stimulate growth.
These initiatives will be financed by the special FFr40bn 'Balladur bond'
issue scheduled for launch later this month.
Again, Mr Balladur's efforts should be bolstered by lower interest rates.
His government is fortunate in that its arrival coincided with a significant
softening of the Bundesbank's attitude to reducing German rates, spurred by
the deterioration in the German economy.
French interest rates, both official rates and commercial bank base rates,
have fallen steadily since the late March elections without imperiling the
franc. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the monetarist economy minister, is now so
sanguine about the franc's prospects that he claims French rates could fall
below those of the Germans.
In theory, the recent rate reductions should have restored confidence among
consumers and the corporate sector, thereby stimulating expenditure and
industrial investment.
Lower rates should also make SICAVs less attractive as investment vehicles
and encourage the public to switch to shares once the privatisation drive
gets under way.
But in practice there is no sign of a pick-up in confidence. French
companies are churning out increasingly gloomy results, particularly as the
strong franc is making it ever more difficult for them to remain competitive
in export markets.
These problems have been aggravated by the fragile state of Germany, which
is France's largest trading partner. A further handicap to French recovery
is the weakness of Japan and other European economies.
The toll of job losses shows no sign of stopping. The latest figures show
that the number of people without jobs rose to 3.1m, or 10.9 per cent of the
workforce, in April. As a result consumer confidence has remained depressed,
as has consumer spending.
The new government had initially hoped to hold the fall in the real rate of
GDP growth to 0.4 per cent this year. However the most recent official
estimates suggest it will be closer to 1 per cent. Given that France needs
to generate annual growth of 2 per cent just to keep employment stable, this
means further increases in unemployment are unavoidable.
Already more job losses are coming. Michelin, the tyre maker, has been
forced to resort to emergency short-time working. LVMH, the luxury goods
group, recently announced the first-ever redundancies in the history of
Moet-et-Chandon, its flagship champagne house. The government itself plans
to start scaling down the enormous French civil service at an annual rate of
1.5 per cent from the present staffing level of 2.1m.
Meanwhile Mr Michel Giraud, employment minister, only recently averted the
risk of a sudden surge in the jobless figures early this summer when the
socialists' contrats emploi-solidarite temporary youth work programme ends.
Mr Giraud has not only extended the scheme - which was fiercely criticised
by the political right when the socialists introduced it - but also he has
increased the number of places on it from 450,000 to 600,000.
It remains to be seen how effective Mr Balladur's measures will be. The most
positive news since his government's arrival is the fall in interest rates -
although the Bundesbank can claim much of the credit for that. The new prime
minister has, however, scored high marks for his efficiency at getting to
grips with the government budget, which has certainly helped to win the
markets' confidence and thereby bolstered the franc.
But it is still too soon to say whether Mr Balladur will succeed in being
more than just an prudent manager of the public purse and if he has the
chutzpah to persuade French consumers and industry to show more confidence
in their own economy.
If he succeeds, France should return to growth from next year onwards and
unemployment may start to fall. But if Mr Balladur fails, the French economy
will stay stuck in its vicious cycle of depressed confidence and weak
demand, which augurs ill for the right's prospects of returning to power
after the 1995 presidential poll.

Profile of Edouard Balladur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THERE is an oriental smoothness of manner about Edouard Balladur
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
he was born into an expatriate French banking family in Turkey - which hides
qualities of toughness and pragmatism in France's 64 year old prime
minister.
Both qualities have been in evidence in his first 12 weeks at the Matignon.
He has imposed on French farmers acceptance of the EC's oilseeds accord with
the US - a very small step for the Gatt negotiations, but a big one for a
French prime minister. Furthermore, he has travelled to Brussels and
Washington to tell France's partners that Paris will go no further towards
agricultural trade reform until and unless it sees non-farm concessions on
the table.
He has quickly had to bend to the winds of recession, capping a May 10
austerity budget with measures on May 25 to try to boost economic recovery.
And, over military base cuts, he has quelled a revolt of his own RPR
Gaullist backbenchers against his defence minister of another party, Mr
Francois Leotard of the UDF.
Stamped by his years working for Georges Pompidou, Mr Balladur is a moderate
Gaullist; a believer in consensus at home and a pro-European in foreign
policy.
His experience of being at Pompidou's side in May 1968 will stand him in
good stead in future crises - which, however, he hopes to defuse by
dialogue; he has talked to the unions, as well as the employers, more than
the Socialists recently did.
As finance minister (1986-88), Mr Balladur was the first to launch the idea
of a European central bank. He is no free trader; very few French are. But
he is realistic enough to know that France must use persuasion as much as
pressure to make its European Community partners see the Gatt through French
eyes.
Might he make a run for the presidency in 1995? Edouard Balladur has always
maintained that his ambition goes no further than to be a successful prime
minister - that, indeed, is the basis of his close entente with Mr Jacques
Chirac, the energetic 60 year old mayor of Paris. Mr Chirac wants the Elysee
 -residence of the French presidency  - as much as ever. But success at the
Matignon could yet suck Mr Balladur into the contest.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (4): A workhorse more liberal than
Colbertist / Profile of Gerard Longuet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERARD LONGUET is one of the new government's workhorses. This energetic 47
year old has overall responsibility for industry and foreign trade, as well
as posts and telecommunications for which he was minister in 1986-88.
Les Echos, the economic daily, said of Mr Longuet: 'If there can be such a
person as a liberal-Colbertist, it is him.' Economic liberalism favouring
free trade and deregulation goes against the long tradition of French state
intervention in industry established by Colbert in the 17th century. This
apparent contradiction is likely to manifest itself in Mr Longuet's
determination to shake up what remains of state-controlled industry and
public utilities, after privatisation, while standing up for France's
national interests in the EC and in the Gatt negotiations.
It falls chiefly to Mr Longuet to watch over the 14 non-farm areas of the
Gatt negotiations, where the Balladur government is now pushing so hard for
progress. Do not expect from him any softness when it comes to imports of
textiles from Asia or cars from Japan.
Piloting the privatisation bill through parliament is the responsibility of
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister. But Mr Longuet's role may be
crucial to bringing some of the weaker privatisation candidates to market.
For instance, he has served notice that the government no longer has the
means - even if the EC would permit it - to bankroll Bull, the
state-controlled computer maker which has lost FFr15bn in the past three
years, and that Bull, which is on the privatisation list, needs a new
strategy.
In general terms, Mr Longuet wants to bring capable industrial partners into
state enterprises, before as well as during their stock market floatation,
and would like to see privatisation accompanied by a capital increase. He
has in mind Alcatel, which was worth FFr 6bn when it went private in 1987 as
Compagnie Generale d'Electricite and is now worth some FFr 80bn (after
considerable acquisitions). And he sees no reason why part of the big public
utilities' activity - should not be subjected to competition, some of it
from other EC utilities.
Mr Languet has started out slightly more liberal than Colbertiste in tone.
Deepening recession may, however, reinforce the latter tendency.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (1): A late dash for the
tape - In this four-page survey, John Murray Brown looks at Istanbul's
prospects of winning its bid for the Olympics at the turn of the century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be only one medal awarded on September 23, when the 96 members of
the International Olympic Committee gather in Monaco to announce the venue
for the 2000 Games.
But Istanbul is making a late dash for the tape and if the enthusiasm of the
local organising committee is any measure, the city may still just pip the
current favourites, Peking and Sydney, to the winning post.
A physical, historical and symbolic melting pot of religions and regions,
straddling two continents, Istanbul offers what is perhaps a unique setting
for the world's biggest sporting event.
Compared with its European neighbours, Turkey has a young and growing
population. Moreover, in a location so close to the founding site of the
Classical Games, Turkey is also a window to a vast Asian region to its east,
where sports competition is in its infancy and the Olympic ideals have still
to make an impact.
Logistically too, Istanbul would seem to have many advantages. An hour ahead
of continental European time and seven hours from the eastern US, television
advertisers can be confident of their investment. Istanbul's central
geographic position also means that on average competitors, to get to the
Games, will have to travel less than five hours, an important consideration
in terms of time and expense for the poorer nations competing. Climatically
too, Istanbul believes it offers the perfect site for both athletes and
spectators.
Financially sound, the Turkish city's bid is underwritten by the government
in Ankara. With just one abstention, Turkey's parliament last year passed a
unique Olympic law providing the national IOC rights over the Olympic logo -
important in a country with rudimentary trademark cover - and pledges to
make up any shortfall in revenues stemming from the Games. The law provides
the national Olympic Committee with the authority to go ahead with the
project even if the municipality or national governments change. In
addition, the bid envisages the free acquisition of state-owned land for
many of the major facilities to be built.
Officials speak confidently that they can meet the need for new
infrastructure on time. The budget envisages spending more than Dollars 400m
on the Olympic village and the various facilities, including an 80,000-seat
main stadium, where work is due to start later this year. As for coping with
the huge influx of additional visitors for the Games, officials claim that
Istanbul currently has almost twice as many hotel beds as Barcelona, the
last Games venue in 1992, and the tourism board estimates the number will
have almost doubled by the year 2000.
If the bid is successful, the city metro, now under construction, is to be
extended to the Olympic village, and a new air terminal is envisaged. Mr
Attila Aksoy of advertising agent Young and Rubicam, which designed the bid
logo, claims the Games will impose no burden on the city. Conversely, given
the location far from the centre, the Olympics are not expected to interrupt
the city's daily business life.
Today Istanbul receives around 2m tourists a year, a considerable strain on
the capacity of its existing infrastructure. However the city municipality
has in place several large ongoing projects for the water systems, to
improve the mass transport network and the introduction of city gas supply -
all in a bid to ease the overcrowding and the currently high levels of
pollution. Expenditures will continue regardless; a successful Olympic bid
would merely serve to accelerate the plans.
In addition, every day some 5m people move from one part of the city to
another. Traffic congestion is worsening. Money was invested in sea-buses to
encourage commuters to leave their cars at home. For those who did use cars,
the municipality constructed parking lots in a bid to ease the traffic
problem in the old's city's narrow streets. Paradoxically, the sea-buses are
still running at a loss, and the car lots are frequently empty. Meanwhile,
the congestion deepens and the city crawls to a halt.
But then, Istanbul has always been a wonderful contradiction. From one of
the old wooden mansions on the Bosporus, or a fish restaurant in Bebek, the
city has all the chic of the French Riviera. Venture into one of the city's
poorer quarters, the gece kondu (built in a night) and this European
identity is under threat from other influences, Moslem fundamentalism, and
the Arab and Kurdish communities from Turkey's south-east.
Mr Cuneyt Ayral, publisher of Bizim Sehir, an Istanbul newspaper which
documents green issues, believes the municipality should impose a tax on new
arrivals. 'You pay to live in Paris, and New York, so why not Istanbul?' he
asks.
The World Bank, which is helping fund various water improvement projects,
takes a similar stand, urging Iski, the water authority, to seek an economic
return for the services it provides.
The Games, it is hoped, will spur the authorities to address all these
issues. The municipality has already instituted new guidelines about waste
discharges. More and more industries in the city are installing waste
treatment plants. Mr Kriton Curi, a professor of environmental engineering
at Bogaci University, points out: 'Today the only green places in the city
are those occupied by the army.'
Turkey certainly has no shortage of skilled contractors to do the job. Today
more than 20 companies have wide overseas experience.
Turkey's private sector can be expected to take up the challenge, too.
Sports sponsorship, a relatively new phenomenon, is growing by the day. An
unseemly crowd brawl at the European basketball championship between teams
from Greece and Turkey did little for the ongoing political dialogue. But
the television coverage did wonders for Efes Pilsen, sponsors of the Turkish
team. Tuborg, its great rivals in the local beer market, is now said to be
considering a similar sponsorship programme.
Moreover, for Turkey's sportsmen, the hope is that the Games will spur a
national revival. Although modestly represented in historical medal tables -
26 golds in a total of 53 medals since 1936 - the athletic prowess of the
Turks is heavily concentrated in such events as weightlifting, wrestling and
judo - where Turkey had a female competitor who took a bronze in Barcelona.
The national press gives plenty of space to sports, but like the tabloids in
the UK, the obsession is with football. Mr Yalcin Aksoy of the Sports
Ministry in Ankara says many of the Olympic events are currently not even
practised in Turkey. It is not a problem of lack of facilities, he says.
'Even the facilities we do have are not fully used.'
Turkey's bid still faces considerable hurdles, not least an image problem.
That is unfair, since it is based on the years of military rule, which ended
over a decade ago.
Mrs Tansu Ciller's election as the country's new prime minister and the
first woman to lead Turkey should redress the balance and somehow lift the
veil on Turkey, a predominantly Moslem country with a devoutly secular
constitution. As an Istanbulu, there is some expectation that Mrs Ciller may
be persuaded to canvass for the city's cause rather as Mr John Major, the UK
prime minister, has done for Manchester.
Winning the Games would be a badly needed fillip for one of the world's most
important historical sites, and instil a new discipline into the city's
planning policies, something which is painfully missing today.
At the national level, the staging of the Olympics would merely provide
further vindication of Turkey's modernising trend and offer a great
incentive to go further in opening itself economically and politically to
the world.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (1): Cohabitation honeymoon - Edouard
Balladur's new centre-right coalition has a huge majority to push through
its programme of economic recovery - although the Socialist President
Mitterrand and commitment to the franc/D-mark parity may set constraints
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, commented recently: 'One doesn't enter
government to enjoy oneself.'
A few weeks in office had brought him political headaches over deficits;
recession; general sniping from within his ruling coalition; and two
enduring migraines in the form of persistent unemployment at home and
France's awkward isolation in the Gatt world trade talks.
Mr Balladur knew it was not going to be easy. He had plenty of time to
prepare himself. It was obvious long before the March legislative election
that the conservatives would sweep the socialists out of power, though their
margin of victory - 484 seats out of a total of 577 - was even bigger than
most people expected.
It had also been obvious for a long time that the RPR Gaullists' former
finance minister was headed for the Matignon (the residence of French prime
ministers) because he was sufficiently emollient in style for President
Mitterrand to nominate, and sufficiently pro-European for the UDF, the
junior coalition partner, to accept.
In fact, the 'cohabitation' between the conservative premier and the
socialist president is one of the few areas where things have gone smoothly.
So far, the courteous climate between the two men bears no comparison with
the storms that accompanied the conservatives' first cohabitation - in
1986-88, with the more abrasive Mr Jacques Chirac as prime minister - with
Mr Mitterrand. The 76-year-old president is, of course, weakened politically
by the reduction of his Socialist party's parliamentary strength to one
fifth of its previous representation. Moreover, he is in uncertain health.
A smooth cohabitation is the desire of most French citizens, who also
evidently trust Mr Balladur's economic competence to pull them through their
present problems. The result is that Mr Balladur's personal rating is still
high in the opinion polls.
If the economy does not pick up, this honeymoon cannot last beyond the
autumn. By then, or by 1994 at the latest, France's politicians will be
positioning themselves to make their grab for the country's supreme
political prize, the presidency, in 1995.
Mr Balladur has less to fear from direct attacks from the Socialist
opposition than indirect sniping from his own camp. The Socialist party is
painfully trying to reorganise itself under Mr Michel Rocard, who is
expected to carry the party's standard in 1995 unless Mr Jacques Delors
tries to wrest it from him. The leaders of both government parties, Mr
Chirac of the RPR and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the UDF, stayed outside
the government in order to to be free to run for the presidency  - which in
practice means being free to distance themselves from Mr Balladur if need
be.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing has already seen the need. In early May he openly
criticised the prime minister for being too austere in announcing tax
increases. The fact that many Gaullist deputies agreed with the UDF leader
helped to push Mr Balladur into announcing, in late May, some reflationary
measures to fight unemployment. If the jobless rate continues to rise
remorsely into next year, then Mr Chirac, the prime minister's patron, may
want to mark his distance from the premier.
Given the state of the economy, this is quite likely - and it is liable to
cause serious dissension in Gaullist ranks. On the monetary side, all is
ostensibly strength and confidence. Foreign exchange has flowed into the
Bank of France, which has repaid debts incurred in the autumn-winter
campaign to defend the franc and has been able, too, to cut interest rates
seven times while the franc has strengthened inside the European exchange
rate mechanism.
But this is largely because economic activity in Germany has weakened even
more dramatically than in France. This does not say much for France. The
government forecasts that the economy will contract by 0.4 per cent this
year - and most commercial banks say the drop will be nearer 1 per cent.
Unemployment, standing at 3.1m or 10.9 per cent in April, will perforce go
on rising.
In fact it seems that France needs to grow by at least 2 per cent a year
just to keep the same number of people in work. Part of the reason is the
country's very high social charges on salaries - charges which bankroll its
welfare state. French employers welcome the start Mr Balladur has made in
lowering these charges - and they also welcome the other measures: to
improve the supply of labour (with more apprenticeships); and the demand for
it (with more spending on housing and public works).
But Mr Francois Perigot, the Patronat chief, has said that until they see
consumer spending rising, his members are not going to risk their precarious
finances by taking the initiative to hire more workers.
To help plug the budget deficit hole, the government has at least some
substantial assets to sell. It has the Socialist nationalisers of the early
1980s to thank for these. Some 21 industrial companies, banks and insurance
companies are now slated for privatisation in theory, over an indefinite
period. In fact the government must make some quick sales this autumn; it
needs FFr40bn in cash this year to cover its special 'recovery' bond issue.
At the same time, it must avoid over-burdening a frail domestic stock market
 -given that it wants control of most of the privatised companies to stay in
Gallic hands.
Indeed, on a broader front a certain xenophobia has taken hold in France.
Something of a national panic has set in about 'delocalisation', or transfer
of production out of France to cheaper regions of the world. A recent
alarmist Senate report (it claims that 'the fire is inside the house') has
sparked scare speculation about France losing a further 5m jobs to Asia,
eastern Europe and north Africa in years to come.
It ignores the fact that some French companies have actually been able to
expand jobs in research and marketing at home by shifting labour-intensive
production elsewhere.
But the reality of global competition is attested by industrialists such as
Mr Francis Lorentz, former head of Bull, the computer company,who
acknowledges that 'software made in India is cheaper and better made than
that made in France'.
The possibility of a Gatt deal compounds these worries for many French and,
after years of sulky inactivism from his Socialist predecessors, has brought
Mr Balladur out to fight France's corner. His decision to swallow the 'gnat'
of the EC oilseeds accord with the US, but to try to stiffen the Community's
resistance to the 'camel' of overall farm export subsidy cuts, is excellent
strategy.
But it may have come too late. For all the rhetoric (back in vogue) - about
strengthening 'Community preference' in trade, the European Commission
appears to be near a tariff-cutting deal with its important Gatt partners.
Yet the French premier may strike a more general chord with his partners
when he stresses that the Uruguay Round provides a key opportunity for the
12 to 'affirm their international identity,' as they pledge to do in the
Maastricht treaty.
In a quite different field, Mr Balladur has provided another chance for the
EC to assert itself, with his idea that it should initiate a European
security pact.
To prevent 'a second Yugoslavia' breaking out elsewhere, he suggests that
the EC, together with the US, should help central and east European states
negotiate good neighbour agreements on frontier and minority issues, and
that at the least, the Community should insist on eastern European countries
settling security disputes before they join the EC.
Thus France remains the main fount of new ambitions for the Community,
although Maastricht has fostered an anti-EC streak in French political life
 -as the parliamentary debate over giving independence to the Bank of France
showed - and even though France's new government takes a more cold-eyed view
of some of its previous European commitments.
One of these is the Schengen free-travel accord, negotiated by France and
its continental EC partners. Paris has shelved implementation of this while
it cracks down on immigration both legal and illegal, and narrows
eligibility for French nationality. These measures are seen as the handiwork
of Mr Charles Pasqua, the hard-line interior minister. But they also respond
to the new French mood.

FT  24 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brewery bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Takeover moves put some fizz into brewery stocks as JA Devenish soared 85 to
367p on an agreed Pounds 214.3m paper and cash bid from the rival Greenalls
Group. But as many analysts flinched from a price they saw as high, the
bidder, which is offering one Greenalls share and 394.5p nominal of
convertible bonds for every two Devenish shares, or cash of 356.5p per
Devenish share, saw its stock price slide 28 to 358p.
Boddington, which has a 19.2 per cent stake in Devenish after a failed
hostile takeover bid two years ago, bounced 13 to 286p. Whitbread, with a
shareholding of 11 per cent in Devenish, saw its prices rise. The 'A' shares
firmed 3 to 500p and the 'B' 10 to 980p.
Brewery specialists had mixed views but ones largely tempered by caution
over dilution of earnings in the short term on a highly priced bid.
'Christmas has come six months early for Devenish's and Boddington's
shareholders,' said Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest Securities as he warned of a
risk of Greenalls' move being 'scale for scale's sake'.
Scale also concerned Mr Martin Hawkins at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, who feared
that too large an operation can erode the important street level aspect of
brewing operations. He did, however, believe that concern over dilution of
earnings was exaggerated and was hopeful over medium-term prospects.
Another beneficiary of Greenalls' move, and particularly the high price it
placed on Devenish, was Grand Metropolitan, which is rumoured to be seeking
a sale of its Chef and Brewer public houses. The high value may strengthen
market talk of a GrandMet disposal of those pubs. GrandMet, which moved up 7
to 432p, was also still riding the wave of Tuesday's positive investment
seminar.

FT  24 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Minorco targets on alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION company Tarmac jumped to the top of the market's perceived list
of bid targets after Minorco, the mining group, sold its 36 per cent stake
in Charter Consolidated for Pounds 235m. However, some analysts suggested
that Minorco might use the cash to bid for Union Miniere.
Tarmac shares moved against the market trend, adding 6 at 135p in trade of
2.1m as talk that Minorco may use the proceeds of the sale to launch a bid
for the UK housebuilder did the rounds.
However, such suggestions were thought wide of the mark by Mr Emil Morfatt
at Smith New Court. He said: 'Minorco has looked at Tarmac but it is only
interested in the quarrying assets, not the rest of the business. My guess
is that Minorco is likely to go for Union Miniere (the Belgian group) which
is a world class European mining group. It may also be interested in using
some other funds to increase its stake in a large Chilean copper
development.'
English China Clays was another of the names mentioned as a possible target
for Minorco and the stock advanced 11 to 456p.
The repurchase of the Minorco stake helped shares in Charter Consolidated
itself, taking the group up 14 to 648p, with sentiment aided by final
results at the top end of market expectations and a broker's recommendation.
One analyst said: 'It is a relief that Charter has been able to buy the
stake. What is more it renders immediate enhancement of earnings.'

FT  24 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie struggles to hold on to 2,900
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLAGGING performance by the US dollar and dwindling confidence in
prospects for a cut in UK base rates took the heart out of the London stock
market yesterday. By the close of trading, the FT-SE 100 Index was
struggling to hold on to the 2,900 level which was regained only at the
beginning of this week, and equities were overshadowed by weakness in stock
index futures.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100 at 2,900.7 for a loss on the day of 6.9.
Early deals saw the index at 2,917 but the 2,900 benchmark crumbled in
mid-afternoon as renewed selling of the blue chip drug stocks took its toll.
The September contract on the Footsie lost much of its premium over the cash
market. However, London rallied towards the close in spite of an early fall
of 16 Dow points on Wall Street.
Hopes for lower interest rates in the near term were discouraged when the
Bundesbank trimmed repurchase rates by only a very modest amount,
effectively postponing rate cut expectations for at least a couple of weeks.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, although helped by unexpected bid activity among
the smaller brewery stocks, finished 2.4 easier at 3,215.5.
In addition to the Pounds 214m bid for JA Devenish, the West of England
brewer, from Greenalls, the corporate scene was enlivened by wider-ranging
financing moves. The decision by Charter Consolidated, the mining and
building equipment group, to buy in for Pounds 235.5m the 35.7 per cent
stake held by Minorco opened up a range of acquisition possibilities in the
London market.
Shares in Rothmans International and Dunhill Holdings, the tobacco and
luxury goods companies, were suspended as the group proceeded with the
planned reorganisation disclosed on the previous day. London traders found
encouragement in these large-scale restructuring moves by blue chip
international companies.
Market indices were hit by the new selling pressure on the blue chip
pharmaceuticals which focused on Wellcome. Trading in these traditionally
heavy volume stocks lifted Seaq turnover to 601.1m shares, from Tuesday's
587.3m which was worth Pounds 1.28bn in retail value. Non-Footsie business
made up around 59 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total.
UK stock market strategists remained confident that equities have
successfully moved into a new trading range based upon the 2,887 Footsie
area. They pointed to the depressive effect yesterday of the setback in
pharmaceuticals and other dollar-earning stocks, which had been driving the
market ahead in the earlier part of the week.
Also indicating underlying confidence were the corporate moves across the
range of the market, including the retail-ing sector where hints of
enfranchisement of the Great Universal Stores 'A' shares resurfaced.
But strategists continued to warn that European economies were showing
uncertain trends and that activity in the ERM currencies would make it
difficult for rates to be cut in Germany and in the UK.
Not all analysts of the UK market have been fully convinced by the stock
market's recent advance. Mr Peter Thorne at Nikko has predicted that the
market may fall back towards Footsie 2,800 over the next few weeks 'as the
reality of slower than expected economic recovery materialises'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LACKLUSTRE session was seen in the derivatives sector as hopes of a cut in
UK base rate all but dwindled, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was steady at the
opening with the first trade recorded at 2,922, just ahead of Tuesday's
closing level. A brief spate of buying - mainly from independent traders -
sent the contract to the day's high of 2,937 at around 10am.
However, with the fading hopes of a reduction in interest rates, the higher
level proved difficult to sustain and sellers emerged in a thin market,
bringing a retreat for the contract.
A poor gilts sector and the early decline on Wall Street brought further
selling and the day's low of 2,914 was recorded at around 3pm.
September finished at 2,916, down 4 from its previous close and some 3
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 11 points.
Volume was thin, reaching only 5,778 contracts by the official close.
In traded options, activity in the index options made a substantial
contribution to the day's total volume of 28,250. Some 9,890 lots were dealt
in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,455 in the Euro FT-SE 100 contract.
British Airways was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,271 trades
and was followed by Asda with 1,156 contracts.

FT  24 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines afresh as data
disappoints
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
THE LATEST batch of disappointing economic news left US share prices lower
for the second consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 30.72 at 3,466.81.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 2.74 lower at 443.19,
while the Nasdaq composite dipped 1.98 to 684.79. Trading volume on the New
York SE amounted to 278m shares.
Yesterday's economic data was bearish for equities. The Commerce Department
said that durable goods orders fell 1.6 per cent in May, the third straight
monthly decline. Although the durable goods figures are notoriously volatile
and unpredictable, the numbers still surprised analysts, who had been
predicting a solid rise in orders.
Also, the government reported that it had revised its estimate of
first-quarter gross domestic product growth from 0.9 per cent to 0.7 per
cent - the slowest growth rate in more than a year. The data, taken with
recent profits warnings from major corporations, unnerved investors who fear
that stocks are overvalued relative to the current, and future, state of
corporate earnings and economic growth.
Among individual stocks, a sizeable group of Dow constituents ran into heavy
selling, although it was difficult to identify a pattern among the losses.
Du Pont fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 47 1/2 , Walt Disney gave up Dollars 2 1/8
at Dollars 40 1/2 in volume of 1.3m shares, Eastman Kodak shed Dollars 2 to
Dollars 50 7/8 and Sears Roebuck tumbled Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 .
Nike, which issued a profits warning earlier in the week, dropped a further
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 54 1/2 , and rival sports shoe maker Reebok lost
Dollars 1 1/4 more to Dollars 27 1/2 .
Ford slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 50 1/2 on news that the auto maker's
sales of US-made cars fell 5.8 per cent in the middle of June, the first
sign of a slowdown in car sales for some time. Ford's US-made truck sales,
however, remained strong.
Atlantic Richfield receded Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 114 5/8 , Texaco lost
Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 62 3/8 , Phillips Petroleum shed Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 28 7/8 and Royal Dutch Petroleum dipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 91
7/8 after broking house Kidder Peabody lowered its investment ratings for
the four oil companies, in part because of an expected decline in crude oil
prices.
Other oil issues were also lower, Chevron declining Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars

<TEXT>
INDEX-RELATED selling and buying by public pension and insurance funds
dominated activity, and share prices fluctuated in quiet trading, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average was finally down 45.78 at 19,492.52 after moving between
19,617.51 and 19,368.14. Investors focused on the futures markets in
Singapore after rumours that futures buying by a New York based fund had
pushed the Nikkei up by 1.7 per cent on Tuesday.
Volume fell to 230m shares from 349m. Overall rises led declines by 553 to
455, with 154 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section
stocks gained 7.01 at 1,562.39. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on
1.06 at 1,195.42.
Dealers said trading would remain subdued ahead of this weekend's Tokyo
metropolitan election. The Nikkei is expected to move between 19,000 and
19,500 in light trading.
Banks rose on technical trading. Industrial Bank of Japan advanced Y30 to
Y2,850 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y90 to Y2,150. Steel issues were hit ahead
of the decision on steel dumping by the US, Nippon Steel dipping Y6 to Y360
and Sumitomo Metal Y7 to Y322.
Real estate issues lost ground on profit-taking following Tuesday's gains.
Mitsui Fudosan shed Y10 to Y1,220.
High-technology stocks were weak, with Matsushita Electric Industrial down
Y20 to Y1,310 and Toshiba Y13 off at Y687. However, Sanyo Electric rose Y15
to Y440 on reports of plans to increase its imports of products from
overseas production bases, and NCR Japan moved ahead Y60 to Y1,250 on the
announcement of a computer order.
Power utilities firmed on buying by individuals' cumulative stock investment
schemes. Tokyo Electric Power appreciated Y50 to Y3,500.
Bargain hunting pushed up Nippon Telegraph and Telephone by Y26,000 to
Y881,000. Companies having close ties with NTT also gained ground, Oki Cable
adding Y40 at Y591 and Daimel Y60 at Y1,100.
Individual investors were noted buying smaller stocks. The Tokyo SE second
section index finished 12.02 ahead at 2,168.42, while the over-the-counter
market added 8.96 at 1,504.03.
Hanix, the construction machine maker which filed for court protection last
month, traded for the first time since June 1 at Y110, having plunged from
the Y2,480 level seen at the end of May.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 14.24 points to 21,523.47 in volume of 21.3m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets again produced mixed performances.
HONG KONG saw early gains trimmed after the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
communique failed to mention any agreement on infrastructure projects. The
Hang Seng index closed a net 15.91 up at 7,062.64, having advanced 50 points
earlier in the day.
Wharf Holdings and Jardine Matheson rose 40 cents and HKDollars 1.50 to
HKDollars 20.40 and HKDollars 60 respectively on early speculation, which
proved unfounded, that China and Britain would approve a container terminal
project.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index fell below the key 1,700 level in late
trade, the market staying volatile ahead of the end of the financial year on
June 30.
After a weak start inspired by Wall Street's overnight fall, the All
Ordinaries remained on the down tack throughout the day to end 17.9 off at
1,698.8, the lowest level since May 25, in turnover of ADollars 277.8m.
BHP fell 16 cents to ADollars 13.74 in advance of its results, due tomorrow.
Leighton lost a cent at ADollars 1.75 after falling as low as ADollars 1.72,
following its ADollars 33m share placing.
TAIWAN was pulled higher by a technical rebound, led by financials and blue
chips, after its recent extended falls.
The weighted index finished 69.68, or 1.7 per cent, up at the day's best of
4,132.17. Turnover was still thin but higher than in recent days at TDollars
16.8bn.
JAKARTA edged forward to a peak for the year in moderate trading. The
official index rose 2.21 to 358.38.
SINGAPORE benefited from late bargain hunting which left the Straits Times
Industrial index 3.43 firmer at 1,791.11, after an intraday low of 1,760.42.
SEOUL closed sharply lower after profit-taking in blue chip manufacturing
issues and financial shares amid worries about the liquidity constraints of
institutional investors. The composite index weakened 8.09 to 762.53.
Growing labour unrest, including a stalemate at Hyundai Motor, was a further
cause for concern. Hyundai lost Won300 to Won28,600.
US anti-dumping charges on South Korean steelmakers, ranging from 5 to 18
per cent, pressured the sector. Posco shed Won500 to Won25,700.
MANILA continued to retreat in spite of healthy market liquidity and the
composite index fell 14.30 to 1,554.66.
BOMBAY was undermined by fears of fresh political turmoil following a report
by a parliamentary committee investigating a Dollars 1.28bn securities
scandal which criticised two ministers. The BSE index lost 17.17 to
2,232.12.

FT  24 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan rises again on signs of
labour accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sustained assault on the D-Mark, and the weak opening on Wall Street
took some of the shine off continental equities, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN took heart on signs that the government, unions and employers were
close to an accord on labour costs, and the Comit index rose 9.42 or 1.8 per
cent to 537.40.
Foreign demand revived for telecommunications issues after Iri announced
that a plan for reorganisation of the sector would be ready by the end of
the month. Stet soared L280 or 9 per cent to fix at L3,380 and Sip was L147
ahead at L2,440.
Recurring rumours of an industrial or financial accord continued to boost
Fiat, L254 higher to fix at L6,345.
The banking sector, by contrast, was under pressure after comments by the
treasury minister, Mr Piero Barucci, that there were at least 10 Italian
companies unable to cope with their debts. San Paolo slid L170 to settle at
L9,520.
Ferruzzi and Montedison steadied after the recent volatility. Ferruzzi
dipped L20.50 to L531.10 while Montedison fixed L29 lower at LL845 before
L842 after hours.
Nuovo Pignone, the engineering group, rose L99 to L5,359, after ENI
announced plans to sell its stake.
FRANKFURT ended just 1.31 higher at 1,699.39, having reached 1,712.15 in
midsession. DTB players, it was said, took advantage of the highs to sell
baskets of shares in the cash market. Export-sensitive cyclicals rose
further on the strength of the dollar, but financials looked soggy on
worries that the D-Mark's comparative weakness might impede the decline in
interest rates.
In chemicals, Hoechst rose another DM4.20 to DM258, for a two-day gain of
DM10. The pharmaceutical and agrochemical group, Schering, picked up DM9.30
to DM794.50 and Mr Werner Kiesse at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt said that a
rumour had been circulating about a joint venture between the two companies.
Turnover rose from DM7.2bn to DM7.7bn. On the downside, the software
company, SAP, dropped DM222 or 13.5 per cent to DM1,425 after it disclosed
that it had failed to achieve forecast profits.
PARIS closed its June account with another modest rise, index arbitrage
bringing volatility into a wide spread of share prices. The CAC 40 index
closed 7.13 higher at 1942.41,in turnover of FFr4bn, up again from FFr3.6bn
on Tuesday.
Peugeot rose FFr9 to FFr549. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Securities noted
that at yesterday's agm the chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, expected the
company to get a 12.2 per cent share of the European car market this year
against 11.8 per cent over the first five months.
L'Oreal rose FFr41 to FFr1,085 on short covering. Fallers included UAP,
FFr15 easier at FFr589, and Canal Plus, down FFr24 to FFr1,271 for a two-day
fall of FFr47 on fears that it was reaching market share saturation in the
television subscriber stakes.
ZURICH turned back after a firm opening as the dollar weakened and the SMI
index shed 12.1 to 2,322.9.
Against the trend, Swissair added SFr15 to SFr693 in respose to optimistic
earnings estimates for this year and 1994 from a leading Swiss Bank.
Shares in Richemont, parent of Rothmans International and Dunhill Holdings,
were suspended until tomorrow pending an announcement on the group's
restructuring.
AMSTERDAM, under pressure from the lower trend on Wall Street and the weaker
dollar, was unable to hold on to early gains. The CBS Tendency index gave up
0.2 to 110.9.
Hoogovens shed FL 1.70 to Fl 32.50 on news that it will be hit by US
anti-dumping duties.
STOCKHOLM fell 1.2 per cent in heavy trading in respose to higher domestic
interest rates, a weaker krona and the announcement of a 3.8 per cent drop
in first quarter GDP. The Affarsvarden index dropped 12.7 to 1,063.10.
On its first day of public trading, Celsius, the defence group, closed at
SKr140 compared with the special privatisation price of SKr100 for private
investors and SKr106 for institutions.
ISTANBUL registered its fifth consecutive record high, and its tenth this
month as the market index rose 135.3, or 1.2 per cent to 11,412.1. Five-day
gains added up to 1,751.93 points, or 18.1 per cent.

FT  24 JUN 93 / US machine tool makers stage revival: The industry is making
a resolute attempt to turn itself round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On either side of the Atlantic, investing in machine tool producers is not
what it used to be. In both the US and the UK, the ravages of Japanese and
continental European competition have left fewer companies to choose from.
Yet, after having been written off five years ago as a sector sinking
without trace, the US machine tool industry is making a determined attempt
to turn itself round.
The turnround has been led by two companies with totally different product
strategies, the NYSE-quoted Cincinnati Milacron and the over-the-counter
stock, Giddings &amp; Lewis.
Milacron, which also has a successful plastics machinery business, has
restored its reputation as a world class producer of standard machine tools,
while G &amp; L, helped by the 1991 acquisition of Cross &amp; Trecker, has been
transformed into the industry's most broadly based machine tool and factory
automation group.
Mr Eli Lustgarten at PaineWebber says: 'There has been a lot of action in
these stocks in the past year. Both have been terrific stocks.'
Milacron's shares rose from about Dollars 9 at the end of 1991 to a high of
Dollars 29 5/8 this year, before slipping recently to close at Dollars 24 on
Tuesday.
G &amp; L had seen its stock climb from about Dollars 11 to a high of nearly
Dollars 30 this year before it dropped sharply to Dollars 20 1/2 in late
April after the shock resignation of Mr William Fife, the chairman and chief
executive who masterminded its turnround strategy. The shares have since
recovered to close at Dollars 23 on Tuesday, but their setback spoilt an
upturn which has seen both companies, and especially Milacron, outperforming
the Dow Industrial Average so far this year.
Mr Lustgarten points out that industrial stocks have been rising in the past
six months. There has been strong interest in cyclical companies which can
benefit from industrial recovery, but there is also a sectoral argument for
investing in machine tool companies.
'There is no doubt that the outlook for the US machine tool industry is much
more favourable now. The products are much more competitive, there has been
restructuring and consolidation, and the currency situation is favourable,'
he says.
But is the optimism misplaced, or at any rate premature? In May last year,
Value Line forecast that net profits for the six companies which then formed
its machine tool industry sector would be Dollars 65m in 1992, and Dollars
95m this year.
In the event, profits last year were just Dollars 24.2m and the forecast for
this year is Dollars 85m. The latest figures exclude Brown &amp; Sharpe, which
is no longer in the machine tool business. But two of the smaller
prod-ucers, Gleason and Monarch, made losses last year after restructuring
and closure charges.
Even last May, machine tool companies were trading on price/earnings ratios
of 20 to 30 at a time when the US industrial recovery was patchy at best.
Mr Thomas Burns at County Natwest USA believes that the upturn in machine
tool shares has not been premature. If you believe that the macro-economic
situation will allow machine tool orders to recover, you invest to
anticipate rather than wait for it to happen, he says.
Mr Lustgarten, however, thinks the recent downturn in machine tool shares
brings them 'back to reality' after rises based on judgments about profits
that turned out to be excessive.
PaineWebber downgraded Milacron from 'attractive' to 'neutral' on April 26
because of the price, while the fall at G &amp; L was 'a catalyst for something
that was long overdue', he says.
It looks as if both Milacron and, particularly, G &amp; L will have to work hard
over the next two years to meet the more optimistic earnings forecasts. The
recession in Europe and in the aerospace market are particular problems.
The overall outlook, however, looks reasonably bright, especially at home.
US machine tool orders were up 16 per cent in the first quarter of 1993,
year-on-year, but producers are not sharing equally in the rise.
Value Line thinks that most machine tool companies will report stronger
earnings this year, and says that several stocks have significant recovery
potential to 1996-98. Few would have thought that possible five years ago.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slides against strong yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANDEEP DEOL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR continued to hold centre stage in the currency markets yesterday
but the focus of attention shifted to its exchange rate against the yen,
writes Sandeep Deol.
The dollar weakened in London to close at Y109.15, against Y111.35 on
Tuesday. In New York it finished at Y109.0.
A resurgence of the yen was evident soon after the markets opened.
Profit-taking on the dollar's recent gains reversed the trend of eight
consecu-tive days of dollar rallies and the currency quickly moved to trade
below Y111.
The spark for more intense dollar selling came in the afternoon with the
release of disappointing US economic data. Durable goods orders fell 1.6 per
cent in May against forecasts of a 1.1 per cent rise. First-quarter GDP
growth was also weaker than expected, revised down to 0.7 per cent from 0.9
per cent before.
Revived rumours from New York that President Bill Clinton was seeking a
stronger yen to correct Japan's huge trade surplus with the US also boosted
sentiment for the yen.
Mr Steven Hannah, director of research at IBJ International, suggests that
the large Japanese trade surpluses will continue and that the US appears to
have few other approaches to correct the imbalance.
The yen rise is expected to continue in the near term unless, says Mr Mark
Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, Japanese local
elections at the weekend see significant weakening in the position of the
LDP.
The dollar slide against the yen was mirrored to a lesser extent against the
D-Mark. The dollar closed near the day's low in London at DM1.6935 from an
early high of DM1.7060 and London's close on Tuesday of DM1.6970. It ended
in New York at DM1.6920.
The Japanese currency also appreciated sharply against the D-Mark in spite
of only a very moderate easing of rates at yesterday's German securities
repurchase tender. The Bundesbank trimmed its 'repo' rate by just one basis
point to 7.59 per cent.
The yen had climbed to Y64.50 to the D-Mark by the close from Tuesday's
Y65.59 finish and now stands very close to its all-time high of Y64.1
reached last week.
The softer D-Mark allowed another European central bank to trim its interest
rates yesterday. The Bank of Spain cut its intervention rate by around  1/4
point to 11.55 per cent.
This resulted in a slight easing of the peseta against the D-Mark, which
finished in London at Pta76.25 from the previous day's Pta76.16.
Sterling saw very little interest in the absence of any significant economic
statistics. It failed to make headway against any of the major currencies
and was unaffected by the news that UK construction orders rose 10 per cent
in the three months to April.
The pound lost 1 1/2 pfennigs to finish at DM2.4925. Against the dollar it
ended at Dollars 1.4725 from Dollars 1.4780.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Expectations lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION on the UK money market that the government might soon reduce
interest rates eased yesterday, after the Bundesbank made only a minimal cut
in its repo rate.
Another factor was what some participants in the money market interpreted as
signals by the Bank of England through its normal dealing operations that
imminent monetary loosening is unlikely.
There were other signs that the move earlier in the week towards lower
interest rates across Europe was running out
of steam. The Bank of Spain cut one of its money-market dealing rates by
about 25 basis points to below Tuesday's average of 11.55 per cent, but kept
its key intervention rate at 11.25 per cent.
The cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate from 7.6 per cent to 7.59 per cent
caused little excitement. It was seen as a minimalist response to calls for
lower official rates to offset growing signs of economic decline across
Europe.
The German central bank said unsatisfactorily high inflation meant it must
remain cautious in its monetary policy to avoid triggering a rise in capital
market interest rates.
Even so, a cut in the bank's official discount and Lombard rates is still
considered likely over the next few weeks. One theory is that the Bundesbank
had been almost forced to lower the repo rate to provide the German money
market with sufficient funds to cover the June reserve requirement for
commercial banks.
In Britain many money market participants think bank base rates are unlikely
to come down soon. That was illustrated by a slight rise in the three-month
interbank rate, quoted last night at about 5 7/8 per cent, up about  1/16
percentage point.
On the futures market, the September sterling contract mirrored this trend.
It shed 5 basis points to 94.16. The December contract closed at 94.28, down
3 basis points.
Some dealers interpreted the relatively large amounts of late assistance by
the Bank yesterday and Tuesday as a sign that the Bank was casting doubt on
theories that cuts in base rates might be imminent to help signs of
recovery.
Others felt that the size of the late assistance, which reached Pounds 445m,
was related to technical factors caused by commercial banks' unwilling-ness
to part with bills earlier in the day. Total injection of funds by the Bank
to the money market was Pounds 1.493bn.

Three-month COPPER continued to trade in a narrow range between Dollars
1,900 and Dollars 1,870 a tonne on the LME. Although Chile's labour
contracts at Chuquicamata have now been settled, the market remained
cautious ahead of end-June US contract expiries. ALUMINIUM was resilient,
following Tuesday's shake-out. Dealers said the market continued to shrug
off negative factors, such as rising stocks, with supportive buying
re-emerging on dips. TIN's recent technical rally is now concluded, and the
market once again focused on bearish fundamentals. Prices fell away from the
outset, and three-month metal equalled the recent 20-year low of Dollars
5,070 a tonne. NICKEL continued to decline on the perception that physical
supplies of Russian nickel are on their way to Europe. The strength of the
dollar weighed on the GOLD market. 'People thought gold was holding up well
against the strong dollar but now currency factors are taking their toll,'
one London dealer said. Prices in Canadian and Australian dollars, and South
African rand were high enough to encourage limited amounts of producer
selling, adding to pressure on prices.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Biggest zinc producer adopts
'no growth' policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION MINIERE of Belgium wants to give up its role as the world's biggest
zinc producer, said Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, the chief executive, yesterday.
He said UM's new management:
Had cancelled a BF10bn (Pounds 195m) project to double annual capacity from
200,000 tonnes at the Balen zinc refinery in Belgium.
Would within five years sell its Union Zinc refinery and associated mines in
the US where about 100,000 tonnes a year are produced compared with UM's
total output of 530,000 tonnes last year.
Would also within five years dispose of its zinc mines in Sweden which last
year produced 111,000 tonnes of concentrate (an intermediate material).
At the end of last year UM permanently closed its zinc refining plant at
Overpelt in Belgium, removing 100,000 tonnes or 2 per cent of western world
production capacity.
Mr Rodier, talking to the Association of Mining Analysts in London
yesterday, said UM was not particularly proud of being the world's biggest
zinc producer with an 11 per cent market share. While UM would develop and
grow its copper, zinc recycling and Hoboken precious and special metals
divisions, it was following a 'no growth' policy for the zinc refining
division which would be used as a cash cow for the next ten years. 'Within
five years our profits will be much less exposed to zinc prices,' he
promised.
Mr Rodier said for 20 years there had been too much zinc refining capacity
in Europe. UM had done its part to improve the situation by closing
Overpelt. However, it would be willing to take part in a plan being
formulated by European Community producers where one or two of them would
permanently shut smelters and other EC producers would provide cash to cover
the closure costs.
He implied other producers wanted the European Commission also to take
action against zinc imports from eastern Europe by way of tariffs and quotas
but UM would not support any such moves unless the industry first agreed to
address the problem of overcapacity. Mr Rodier said it would probably take
eight to 12 months for the industry to agree a voluntary closure scheme and
start putting it into effect.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Normal' Russian harvest
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN grain harvest will be 'normal' at between 105m and 110m tonnes
this year, an International Wheat Council conference was told yesterday.
This compares with the IWC's May estimate of 101.6m tonnes for 1992.
Mr Andrei Lavrov, general director of Khlebrossi, the leading Russian
procurement agency, said that 62m hectares had been sown to grains, with 23m
hectares down to wheat.
The state would need to procure 23m tonnes of wheat this year, Mr Lavrov
said. Last year it bought 13m tonnes internally, and it would not buy more
than that this year.
Mr Lavrov said the Russian grain sector was finding it easier to adapt to
market conditions than many other sectors of the troubled economy. This was
because it had experience of the international markets and had built up good
relations with its bankers, he suggested.
The privatisation of the industry had led to increased trading through
exchanges, including the Moscow commodity exchange, where the figures had
risen from dozens of tonnes to 300,000 tonnes last year.
'The Russian peasant has for the first time a choice of who to sell his
supplies to,' said Mr Lavrov. Profits for grain growers had risen by 400 per
cent last year.
Mr Vladimir Semenyuk, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian grain products
procurement agency, said the Ukraine was launching a campaign to boost its
animal feed grain production.
Since 1975 the country had been a net importer of grains, he told the
conference. But it aimed to become a net exporter of at least 5m tonnes of
grain by 1995.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ghana hopes for Dollars 100m
from gold mine sell-off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GHANA'S CASH-strapped government hopes to raise Dollars 100m this year
through the sale of a 20 per cent stake of Ashanti Goldfields Corporation,
the country's biggest gold producer jointly owned by UK-based Lonrho group
and the government.
Mr Emmanuel Agbodo, the head of Ghana's privatisation programme, said the
government was calling for bids from interested mining companies. Ashanti
Goldfields, he said, was 'conservatively' valued at Dollars 500m.
The company produced 654,293 ounces of gold in the 1991-92 fiscal year,
which ended in September. The target for the present fiscal year is 744,345
ounces.
At present the government of Ghana owns 55 per cent of Ashanti Goldfields.
Lonrho, with 45 per cent, also has the management contract for the mines. Mr
Agbodo said the government planned to reduce its shareholding to about 35
per cent. The new partners would be required to accept Lonrho's operational
control of the mines.
The sale, which will be Ghana's biggest sell-off exercise to date, is being
handled by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation.
The projected Dollars 100m windfall has already been included in the
government's 1993 budget. Without this pivotal source of income, the
government risks derailing its carefully balanced budget - the cornerstone
of World Bank-approved economic reforms.
But Mr Agbodo conceded that the timing of the sale might not be to Ghana's
advantage, as mining multinationals are unlikely to rush an investment
decision of such magnitude.
The proposed sell-off, however, underscores Ghana's commitment to pursuing
one of the few privatisation programmes on the African continent.
Mr Agbodo also confirmed that a Guernsey subsidiary of Gold Fields of South
Africa had acquired a controlling stake of the government-owned Tarkwa
underground gold mine for Dollars 2m. Tarkwa, in Ghana's western region,
still has large reserves of low-grade ore, but has conducted virtually no
exploration work in recent years. Gold Fields of South Africa is also
looking into the possibility of purchasing the neighbouring Prestea gold
deposits for a similar sum.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chagrin among the chateaux: The
Bordeaux wine and spirits fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EVA KALUZYNSKA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIGHT before the grand opening in Bordeaux this week of Vinexpo, the
world's premier international wine and spirits exhibition, the region's
venerable Chateaux de Fronsac was struck by lightning and burnt to the
ground.
Given the present malaise of the French wine trade, which is struggling to
maintain its pre-eminent position in a profoundly changed market, it was
difficult to resist seeing the disaster as an omen.
Exhibitors gathering in the Mecca of the wine world on Monday had already
heard disquieting news of champagne producers laying off workers. Also
giving pause for thought were reports of traditional arch-rivals in Bordeaux
and Bourgogne, producers of some of the world's greatest wines, teaming up
in marketing efforts to stave off the worst effects of world recession.
French proprietors are realising, not before time, that the mystique of
producing the finest wines on earth is flimsy insurance against competition
from competent and increasingly confident producers elsewhere. More
hard-headed market watchers say France is getting its come-uppance for years
of greed and complacency.
'Maybe we were naive, but we didn't realise how fast Bulgaria, for instance,
would steal the British market for budget red wines,' says Mr Gilles Dupuch,
President of the Union of Entre-deux-Mers Producers. 'There are big changes
ahead. We rested on our laurels far too long. Bordeaux producers have to
realise it's not enough just to be Bordeaux any more. They're in intense
competition and they're going to have to bite the bullet.'
Ms Serena Sutcliffe, head of Sotheby's Wine Department in London, agrees.
'People are looking for quick, easy flavour. Basic Bordeaux is quite subtle
and it lacks that big impact. It's difficult to wean people buying wine on a
tight budget away from the full-frontal attack of a Bulgarian Cabernet
Sauvignon once they've experienced it, though directly you go up a notch,
Bordeaux's full of flavour.'
Vinexpo, a biennial exhibition launched in 1961, has attracted more
exhibitors than ever this year. Visitors taste all day, and party all night
as Bordeaux's chateaux open their gates to the world in lavish style. There
are wines from some 40 countries on offer, from China to Chile, Austria to
Australia.
Despite a tradition of courtesy in the wine world, there is no doubt about
the undertone of cut-throat competition for a shrinking market. 'The
atmosphere is much more nervy than before,' says Mr Eric Boschman,
Brussels-based master sommelier and regular visitor to Vinexpo. 'Buyers are
behaving like cats on a hot tin roof. Producers are very aware the global
volume is static, or even shrinking, and they are having to work three times
as hard to make it.'
Overall, consumers are drinking less wine, but moving up-market. Some 26 per
cent of Europeans say they are teetotallers, while a Vinexpo survey among
people aged 18 to 30 found 39 per cent saying they never drank any alcohol.
There is a significant number of newcomers at this year's exhibition, as
well as countries trying to consolidate their position, and it is plain that
they are not altogether welcome among the locals. France, Italy and Spain
have huge surpluses; but the European Community is set-to pull the plug on
the wine lake.
The EC's biggest producers are bracing themselves for reforms in the
framework of the common agricultural policy that are bound to involve
grubbing up at least 10 per cent of their vines and some very hard-headed
selection to keep only the best.
The presence of central and eastern European wine growers, virtually within
sight of EC growers, is among the most keenly felt threats. Moldova and
Romania are exhibiting in their own right for the first time, inspired by
Bulgaria's success. Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary and even Ukraine are
represented - the last with a reappearance of the legendary Massandra wines
from the Crimea. Poland is there too, showing spirits.
All are hoping to expand their trade, particularly with the EC. And they are
pinning their hopes on agricultural produce in the first instance.
On Monday at the European Community's summit meeting in Copenhagen, leaders
pledged to open up their markets to products from the fledgling democracies
further and faster than originally planned, on the basis that trade is
better than aid, and far, far better than more wars on the community's
eastern front.
Optimists in France and elsewhere in French-dominated markets are telling
themselves that drinkers who strayed from French wines while prices were
high will simply revert to type as the market forces rates down.
Others are not so sure, however. Mr Dupuch says wines made from a single
variety of grape, standard in the New World and, increasingly, elsewhere,
have got consumers accustomed to reference points that are easier to
understand than the complex wines of Bordeaux. 'Sauvignon spells magic out
there. My wines are made of Sauvignon, Semillon and Muscadelle, and we don't
explain that on the label. We're going to have to get better at telling
people what's good about our wines, why they should like them.'
Mr Boschman is convinced that France will only keep its market by fighting
for it. 'It's true there are those who'll drink Bulgarian or Romanian wines
in private who would never dream of serving anything but French at a dinner
party,' he says. 'But there are so many good, inexpensive wines around now
and Bordeaux's lost its halo. People all over the wine-drinking world are
discovering new flavours and styles and it's not obvious why they should
stop.'

In the last week of the Australian selling season, wool prices have been
better than expected, and a steadier note has replaced last week's downward
drift. Japan has been competing strongly, with good support from Europe. The
AWC market indicator yesterday was 445 cents a kg., compared with 450 cents
a week before. In the Bradford market, business is even quieter as the
holiday period begins, but the combing and spinning sectors are very busy.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US exchanges choose flavours of
the month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN AN effort to generate volume and income for their members, two US
commodities exchanges are introducing futures and options on food products
this summer.
This continues a long line of relatively obscure and usually short-lived
agricultural product launches as small exchanges struggle to rebuild trading
volume in the flagging farm futures sector.
New York's Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange last week launched futures in
cheddar cheese and non-fat dry milk. Options on the futures began trading on
Tuesday.
US dairy prices have traditionally lacked volatility, held in check by huge
oversupply and high government price supports. However, government subsidies
have been reduced recently, leaving milk and cheese prices above support
levels. This has injected uncertainty into the markets, and made them ripe,
the CSCE believes, for futures hedging.
The new dairy futures contracts trade for just one hour each afternoon in
the CSCE's sugar pit, after the exchange's main markets are closed. The late
hour was meant to encourage members to stay after their regular sessions to
trade the new products. The cheese contract represents 40,000 lb of cheddar
in 40-lb blocks, while non-fat dry milk futures trade in 44,000 lb
increments, in 25-kg bags. The contracts are deliverable, free on board, to
any manufacturing plant within the continental US.
Despite strong pre-launch support from the dairy industry and healthy
first-day volume, the contracts appear already to have soured. Only five
cheese and two milk futures contract changed hands on Monday. Cheese for
July delivery finished at 120.5 cents a lb, while non-fat dry milk ended at
103.75 cents a lb. Traders say the contracts are faltering because of a lack
of fundamental information on US dairy production and supply and the dairy
industry's complete unfamiliarity with futures trading.
The Minneapolis Grain Exchange is likely to face similar hurdles in its
attempt to make a futures market in frozen white shrimp. The tiny exchange,
which now boasts a century-old futures contract in hard red spring wheat,
plans to launch shrimp futures July 12. The idea isn't completely new. The
Chicago Mercantile Exchange briefly traded shrimps in the 1960s, but the
project was quickly abandoned.
For the past decade the MGE has searched in vain for fresh futures fodder.
Mr James Lindau, the exchange's president, thinks shrimp will be a winner.
'The economics are right for this contract,' he says. 'The commodity has
price volatility. Shrimp is a multi-billion dollar industry in which
hundreds of companies produce, distribute, process and sell the product.
Mr Lindau recently returned from a marketing trip to Ecuador, which exports
70 per cent of its white shrimp harvest to the US. Export prices for these
have slumped by 25 per cent in the last five years, and producers are under
pressure from rising fuel prices and high shipping costs.
Mr Lindau says he is willing to wait for the market to develop and can see
potential for other fishy contracts, like salmon.
The New York Mercantile Exchange has received approval from the UK Treasury
to allow UK traders to deal directly on Access, its after-hours electronic
trading system. The system will be launched in New York this evening.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S Korean oil demand close to
UK's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA had the fastest-growing oil consumption in the world last year
when usage rose by more than 20 per cent to 1.6m barrels a day - almost the
same level as the UK - according to Mr Peter Davies, chief economist at
British Petroleum.
Launching BP's statistical review of energy, Mr Davies highlighted two
trends: the continuing strong growth in energy demand in Asian countries and
the fall in consumption in the former Soviet Union, which cancelled each
other out, leaving world demand steady.
Oil production from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
grown to meet expanding demand from East Asia with Opec output touching
26.2m b/d last year, the highest level since 1980. Mr Davies estimates Opec
capacity at 27.5m to 28m b/d.
The collapse of the economy in the former Soviet Union has led to declining
energy consumption in Russia where it fell by 3 per cent and the other
republics: consumption dropped in Ukraine by over 18 per cent partly as
supplies from Russia were diverted.
At the same time, production last year dropped by 1.3m b/d to 8m b/d. BP
looked at the Samotlar field in western Siberia where reserves were
estimated at 25bn barrels when it was first discovered. The field was
brought to peak production very quickly, maintained that peak for less than
5 years and has since declined at a rate of 15 per cent a year.
Mr Davies said the field was brought on too quickly and over-produced, in
contrast with a similar field such as Pruhoe Bay, Alaska, where peak outout
was lower but total recovery will be significantly higher.
Growth of gas consumption is growing rapidly in the expanding economies of
East Asia with usage up by over 30 per cent last year in South Korea, 17.8
per cent in Malaysia and 13.5 per cent in India.
Mr Satish Sharma, India's petroleum minister, says there has been some
foreign interest in the 45 blocks of oil exploration acreage being offered
as part of India's fifth round of awards. He says this round will be
followed by a rolling programme that will put acreage on offer every 6
months.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Bunds ease as bank dismays with minimum
repo cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, announced the smallest possible cut
in the repo rate yesterday, and bunds slipped back as a long-suffering
market registered its irritation. Bund futures for September eased 0.07 to
95.04.
The bund market had already lost hope of an imminent cut in key interest
rates because of the combination of continued strength of the dollar,
relatively high money supply growth, and the announcement that the repo
would be at a variable rate.
When the Bundesbank announced it was reducing the repo rate by one basis
point to 7.59 per cent, one analyst described the move as the 'worst of both
worlds'.
Investors are now concentrating on forthcoming regional inflation data, the
first of which could be announced tomorrow.
Opportunities to look for clues on the interest rate front from the next
repo rate announcement will be limited because it will come on a Thursday
rather than a Wednesday. This is to avoid its release on the last day of the
month. Consequently, it will come just before the next Bundesbank Council
meeting.
FRENCH government bonds rallied yesterday and the yield spread over German
10-year bonds closed below 10 basis points for the first time.
The country's government bond market is not expected to be affected by
France's new FFr40bn four-year government bond, targeted primarily at
private savings currently in money market funds.
September futures on the Matif settled higher at 119.36, and underlying
10-year bonds rose 0.12 to 111.89.
THE UK government bond market recovered from the latest bond auction
announcement, although dealers said earlier weakness had largely been a
knee-jerk reaction.
The Bank of England is to auction Pounds 3.25bn of stock on June 30.
Although some dealers feel the amount is on the high side, the 10-year
maturity and the coupon are attractive to overseas investors, owing to their
FOTRA - or tax exempt for foreigners - status.
The yield curve flattened as recent evidence of non-inflationary growth
continued to persuade investors to switch to the long end. The benchmark 9
per cent Treasury stock due 2008 jumped  9/32 to end at 107. At the short
end, five-year gilts ended  1/32 up at 101 3/16 .
IN SPITE of disappointment that the Bank of Spain failed to cut the repo
rate, government bond prices held firm.
Economists had anticipated a quarter percentage point reduction in the key
lending rate, but it was left at 11.25 per cent. A reduction in the daily
lending rate of 0.23 point to 11.32 per cent failed to make up for the
disappointment.
However, September Bono futures traded in Barcelona lifted a quarter point
to 93.55.
JAPANESE government bonds held up well following a Y800bn auction of 10-year
bonds with a 4.7 per cent coupon. The futures contract fell back during
Japanese trading, but stabilised towards the close. September yen futures
slipped 0.25 point to 107.47 in Japan.
ALTHOUGH prices at the short end of the US Treasury market were pressured by
renewed talk of an interest rate rise, longer-dated securities held their
ground following a weak durable goods report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 104
9/16 , yielding 6.761 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
slightly weaker, down  3/32 at 99 27/32 , to yield 4.191 per cent.
A newspaper report claiming the Federal Reserve may still be close to
tightening monetary policy to curb inflation set the tone for a downbeat
start to trading, with fear of higher rates depressing shorter-dated
securities right from the opening. The short end was undermined by selling
ahead of the afternoon auction of Dollars 11bn of five-year notes.
The auction passed off uneventfully, although most of the demand appeared to
come from the New York dealing community - an indication that some players
were scared away by the reports of a possible Fed tightening. At the long
end, however, prices edged higher, on news of an unexpected 1.6 per cent
decline in May durable goods orders.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: No-frills service from US
fund manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FIDELITY Brokerage, a division of the US-based fund management company, has
formed Europe's first cross-border institutional brokerage facility offering
cut-price execution-only services to professional fund managers.
The concept is already well entrenched in the US markets, where
execution-only brokers have gained considerable market share from integrated
securities firms which also make market and provide research. In the UK,
where Fidelity's operation will be based, execution-only brokers for
domestic transactions have declined sharply since deregulation in 1986.
Mr Mark Collier, managing director of Fidelity Brokerage, said he expected
the new service to spur the growth of cross-border investment, not only for
European clients but for US institutions seeking direct access to European
markets.
'We are simplifying cross-border investment. We are taking the mystique out
of it,' he said.
Fidelity said it believed competition in the European fund management
industry would increase substantially, and that institutions would
increasingly demand better execution services at lower commission rates to
gain a competitive edge. And because of the trend towards quantitative
management while large institutions were increasing their own in-house
research capacity, their need for execution-only services was rising.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Venezuelan oil group's US
unit plans Dollars 1bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, Venezuela's state-owned oil
company, is planning an offering of Dollars 1bn of bonds in the public US
market.
A registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
covers the issue of Dollars 1bn of senior notes by PDV America. This
consists of Dollars 250m each with five and seven-year maturities and
Dollars 500m of bonds with a 10-year maturity.
Salomon Brothers is managing the issue, which is guaranteed by the
Venezuelan parent and Propernyn, a Dutch subsidiary which holds the parent's
European, Caribbean and US assets, including PDV America. PDV America is the
holding company of Citgo Petroleum and the Venezuelans' 50 per cent stake in
Uno-Ven, a joint venture with Unocal.
As the state oil company is widely seen as well-managed, and since the
borrower is a US entity with significant assets in the US, it may be
regarded by some investors as a better credit risk than the Republic of
Venezuela. Petroleos de Venezuela's total foreign debt at the end of May was
Dollars 4.07bn, newspapers in Caracas reported yesterday.
Despite a 15-month political crisis in Venezuela, Venezuelan borrowers have
been been fairly active in international capital markets this year,
following a period last year in which market access for Venezuelan borrowers
was closed. There have been six international bond issues this year - four
in the name of the republic and two in D-Marks  - totalling Dollars 530m.
The parent was borrowing earlier this year in the domestic debt market in
Venezuela, where real interest rates are very high. The government, heavily
behind in payments on its domestic commitments, hopes the withdrawal of the
oil company from the domestic market will create a space for it to borrow to
fund its deficit.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Zeneca set for Dollars 300m
Yankee bond offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENECA Group, the bioscience business recently demerged from ICI, is set to
launch a Dollars 300m issue of 10-year Yankee bonds in the US market, writes
Tracy Corrigan.
The proceeds will be used to repay some of the company's Dollars 850m debt
to the ICI Group.
The refinancing will allow the company to substantially reduce interest
costs, since the average coupon on the existing debt, maturing in 2002, is
9.2 per cent, while the coupon on the Yankee bonds is likely to be below 7
per cent.
The ICI debt can be repaid without penalty at any time after January 4 1994,
so the Yankee bond proceeds will be added to general corporate funds ahead
of repayment early next year.
Zeneca already has a shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission, following a Dollars 1.3bn issue.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Swedish deal keeps Swiss franc sector
active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swiss franc sector of the international bond market continued to attract
considerable attention yesterday, with straight bond deals from the Kingdom
of Sweden and De Nationale Investeringsbank, the Dutch banking group.
Dealers said interest in the sector reflected the attractive swap rates
available to borrowers and the relative strength of the Swiss franc, which
is drawing new investor demand.
The Kingdom of Sweden's SFr500m, 10-year bond issue was swapped into US
dollars to give funding at fractionally above Libor. Sweden has been
borrowing in a range of currencies recently, but yesterday's deal was its
first issue in the Swiss franc sector since 1988.
Credit Suisse, lead manager, said the yield of 4.75 per cent compared
favourably with a yield of 4.52 to 4.55 on 10-year Swiss government bonds.
One rival house described the deal as 'priced rather tightly', although the
market seemed fairly confident the deal would be placed with time.
The other area of the market to see a fair amount of activity was the US
dollar sector.
Comunidad de Madrid launched a Dollars 250m, five-year issue, marking the
first time a Spanish regional government borrower has tapped the dollar
sector. The deal was priced to yield 59 basis points over the Treasury bond,
but the spread tightened to 55.5 basis points.
Kyushu Electric Power Co, the Japanese privately-owned public utility, also
tapped the Eurodollar sector with a Dollars 350m, 10-year issue. The deal,
which yielded 45 basis points over the Treasury bond at launch, was
described by dealers as 'fairly-priced'.
Wharf Capital International, the Hong Kong company, raised Dollars 350m with
a seven-year convertible bond issue, having increased the size of the deal
from Dollars 300m to meet strong investor demand.
The coupon was set at 5 per cent, with a conversion price of HKDollars
24.89, giving a conversion premium of 22 per cent. By late afternoon the
bonds traded at 100.75-101.25, having been launched at par.

restructure charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TAMBRANDS, the troubled US tampons manufacturer which earlier this month
ousted its chief executive, said yesterday it would take a Dollars 20m
charge against second-quarter earnings to cover cost-cutting and
restructuring moves.
The company also confirmed it had called in Russell Reynolds Associates, the
recruitment consultants, to search for a new chief executive.
The former incumbent, Mr Martin Emmett, was ousted by Tambrands' directors
at the beginning of June, as the company announced second-quarter earnings
would be 'significantly below' last time's 72 cents a share.
Tambrands also said that full-year profits would fall short of 1992's
Dollars 3.06 a share. It blamed competitive pressures, increased marketing
costs, and a reduction and liquidation of stores' stocks.
However, Tambrands said yesterday that directors had made no decision to
sell the company. There has been speculation in the US that the board was
considering seeking a buyer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, the drugs and healthcare
products group, has been named as a possible suitor.
'The steps we are taking reflect our determination to address operational
issues and to improve the company's ongoing profitability,' said Mr Howard
Wentz, Tambrands' chairman.
Shares in Tambrands fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 in New York
yesterday. The shares have slumped from around Dollars 65 at the beginning
of the year, and, although they rallied slightly on rumours of the
acquisition possibility, they are still close to the 52-week low of Dollars
39 1/2.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: O&amp;Y administrator resolves US
dispute
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE administrator of Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property company,
has resolved its bitter dispute with creditors of the US subsidiary,
enabling the Dollars 5.3bn debt restructuring of the US arm to go ahead.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the mediator between the warring US and Canadian branches of
O&amp;Y, informed a New York federal bankruptcy judge of an agreement between
the two sides, which looks to meet many of the demands of the US creditors.
The US subsidiary will answer to a nine-member board, on which will sit Mr
John Zuccotti, the head of O&amp;Y (USA), Mr Rob Lowe, the Canadian
administrator of O&amp;Y Canada, and seven outsiders. Mr Vance will mediate any
disputes over the Canadian parent's right to information on its US unit, in
which it owns a 80 per cent stake.
The US bankruptcy court will issue its decision on the proposed settlement
on July 9.
Mr Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman acting for O&amp;Y (USA), said: 'O&amp;Y and its
creditors hope to move very quickly to restructure their obligations.' He
was optimistic agreement could be obtained that avoided bankruptcy for the
US subsidiary.
O&amp;Y Developments, the Toronto-based parent, emerged from bankruptcy
protection last month, and is run by the court-appointed Mr Lowe, of
accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Secured creditors of the US arm are determined that efforts to have their
debt re-paid are not hampered by the Canadian parent's responsibilities to
its own creditors, and equity holders.
Creditors of the US arm thus backed Mr Zuccotti in his fight for
independence from the Canadian parent. The agreement announced yesterday
seems closer to the aims of the US creditors, in that the new board is
largely independent of its Canadian parent.
The seven outside directors will serve three years, and can only be removed
with agreement of US and Canadian courts. Mr Lowe had wanted power to fire
them.
Mr Zuccotti has also won his right to be indemnified from any lawsuits
arising from the US unit's debt restructuring.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Saturn profit poses funding
dilemma - A milestone in the history of GM's innovative sports car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 6,500 factory workers have been wearing big grins this month at one of
America's most innovative car plants, hidden amid the rolling hills of rural
Tennessee .
For the factory, set up by General Motors to prove it could match Japanese
quality and productivity by building from scratch a new car, called Saturn,
made its first ever monthly operating profit in May, after nearly three
years of production.
The celebrations have been enthusiastic not only because this represents a
milestone in Saturn's history, but also because the event has triggered a
Dollars 1,000 bonus payment to all employees under Saturn's innovative bonus
and profit-sharing pay scheme.
And the Tennessee workers can bask in the knowledge that the small, sporty
Saturn car has become one of the hottest-selling vehicles in the US,
renowned for quality which matches, or beats, that of its Japanese rivals.
They cannot make the cars fast enough to satisfy demand.
All this means the Saturn project, conceived in the early 1980s by Mr Roger
Smith, GM's former chairman, as a laboratory which would ultimately help
reshape sclerotic General Motors, has in many respects become the winner he
hoped it would.
That judgment, however, requires heavy qualification, for one month of
profits does not make a financial success.
It will be many years - if ever - before Saturn makes a respectable return
on the Dollars 5bn GM invested in the project before production began and
its two-and-a-half-years of operating losses, including an estimated Dollars
600m of red ink in 1992.
Saturn officials say the company seems on target to at least break even in
1993 as a whole. But that is partly because, in a highly unusual ploy, it
has persuaded the dealer network set up specially to sell the car to cut its
profit margin to ensure it reaches the black.
This combination of critical success and lacklustre financial performance
has brought the Saturn project to a crossroads and posed a dilemma for
General Motors: should it pour more money into the business to expand
production at a time when GM is strapped for cash and in the throes of a
radical restructuring of its lossmaking North American operations?
On the one hand, Saturn's popularity with consumers, and reputation for
quality, has given it a much more positive brand image than most other parts
of GM, and expanded production could be a first step for the group to
capitalise on this.
It would also bolster GM's 35 per cent share of the US car market, of which
Saturn contributes 2.8 per cent.
On the other hand, the US small car market is intensely competitive,
suffering from extremely thin profit margins and excess manufacturing
capacity.
GM could arguably deploy its capital more profitably by improving its model
range in the higher margin, large vehicle segment of the market.
The group has made clear that Saturn is extremely unlikely to get any
additional funding unless it does break even this year, and Mr Richard
'Skip' LeFauve, Saturn's president, says the subsidiary is preparing two
alternative business plans to present to the GM board.
One will put the case for expanded Saturn production, while the other will
show how the business can operate profitably at current capacity of about
300,000 vehicles a year.
But there are no plans to extend the Saturn range by producing a larger
vehicle, which many of Saturn's dealers would like to see.
Expanded production of the current model could either take place alongside
the Tennessee plant - where Saturn originally planned to produce 500,000
cars a year - or at an existing General Motors plant.
The GM board might favour the latter, since it would ameliorate chronic
over-capacity at the group's factories.
Saturn officials, however, would probably prefer the former since it would
help cement the unique, co-operative relationship between Saturn's
management and the United Auto Workers' union, which has been one of the
most important ingredients in building the car's reputation for quality.
Under this partnership, which presents a stark contrast to the traditional
gulf between US management and labour, union officials take part in strategy
planning and middle management jobs.
The workforce is made up of small, self-directed teams with control over
their own budgets, staff hiring, division of labour, workplace ergonomics,
relations with suppliers and quality inspection.
There is also a strong emphasis on continual training: some 7 per cent of an
employee's salary depends on him or her spending 5 per cent of working time
learning additional skills.
Why then, has all this not translated into quicker profitability?
Any brand new motor company - and Saturn was GM's first in over 60 years -
would face early losses and high costs to establish itself in the market
place. And Saturn had the additional problem of shaking off GM's reputation
for poor quality products.
When it began production in July 1990 it priced cars at lossmaking levels -
the base model cost Dollars 7,999, compared with Dollars 9,395 today - to
win market share.
And to ensure that Saturns have very high quality, the company has expanded
production extremely slowly.
As a result, the plant is only now reaching its full rate of 1,133 cars a
day, or 300,000 a year.
Only this month is it moving from a system of having two work crews, putting
in six-day working weeks, to a more efficient system of three crews, working
four 10-hour days a week.
As a result, Saturn's productivity still lags the best Japanese and US
rivals.
Mr Michael Bennett, who heads the UAW at the plant, says: ' We need another
year to a year-and-a-half before we can compare ourselves (with them), but
all our projections say we're going to be there.'
However, such calculations could be upset by friction between the local UAW
officers, who have co-operated with Saturn's management in unusually
flexible working practices, and their national union officials.
Union officials are pressing Saturn's management for extra overtime money
and other contract changes which would bring the plant more in line with
conditions elsewhere in GM.
Saturn's expanded workforce, moreover, is not quite as pliant as it once
was: Mr Bennett won re-election to his post last April by a narrow 52 per
cent to 48 per cent margin, in a vote which highlighted a degree of rank and
file dissent, particularly on the overtime issue.
So while some lessons from the Tennessee laboratory are being slowly applied
at other parts of GM - for example, in aspects of marketing - there is
little sign the company and the national UAW can find common ground to copy
Saturn's partnership.
The flower blooming in the Tennessee countryside may well prove an expensive
hot-house experiment, unable to survive the much chillier labour relations
climate of Detroit.

AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer which ranks among the 10 largest supermarket
groups in the US, is to seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in the
autumn.
The company, which has an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme in the
US, is still studying whether to move the ADRs to the stock exchange or to
make a listing of ordinary shares.
Ahold, with 25 per cent of the Dutch groceries market, operates over 500
supermarkets in 12 states in the eastern US.
The company, listed in Amsterdam since 1948, launched its ADRs on the NASDAQ
system in 1991.
Its first foray into the US supermarket sector came in 1977, when it bought
the Bi-Lo chain, which operated stores in the Carolinas and Georgia.
Since then, it has acquired several regional groups, including Giant Food
Stores, the First National Supermarkets business, and Tops Markets.

CORNING Inc, the US high-technology group, yesterday launched an agreed

Corning, which has reached an agreement to buy 30 per cent of the
Nasdaq-quoted company's stock from current shareholders, said the deal was a
logical expansion of its laboratory products business.
'Costar's marketing and technology strengths are in areas that complement
Corning's current plastic science products business,' said Mr Roger

Costar, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, makes a variety of disposable
plastic products, filters and filtration equipment and had 1992 sales of

<TEXT>
INCO, the international nickel producer, is considering a sale or merger of
its 62 per cent stake in TVX Gold, a Toronto-based gold and silver producer
with interests in six mines in North and South America.
At TVX's current share price of CDollars 4.90, Inco's stake is worth
CDollars 407m (USDollars 318m).
Inco has up to now shrugged off talk that it was seeking to unload its stake
in TVX. But in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it
acknowledged it would 'explore potential transactions, including a merger, a
public or private sale, or similar transaction'.
Mr Eike Batista, TVX's chairman, holds a 13 per cent stake in the company.
Inco said any sale 'may or may not' involve Mr Batista's shares.
TVX Gold was formed in 1991 when Inco merged some of its gold mining
interests with Consolidated TVX Mining. TVX Gold posted earnings of CDollars
10.4m last year on revenues of CDollars 152.4m.
Its strengths include long-life reserve, modern facilities and low operating
costs.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Terminborse sounds out
new products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures and options exchange, is
considering introducing some new stock index products, following the success
of its futures and options on the Dax 30 index of German stocks.
Mr Jorg Franke, chief executive of the DTB, said the exchange was sounding
out interest in futures and options on a larger index. The Frankfurt stock
exchange is currently investigating the possibility of starting a Dax 100
index, on which the DTB would then base futures and options.
One potential problem is the lack of liquidity in all but the largest German
stocks. In order for index futures to develop liquidity, marketmakers like
to be able to replicate the index in the cash market, which is difficult if
some of the stocks are illiquid.
The exchange is also considering launching futures and options based on
sector indices.
On the interest rate side, the exchange is still considering launching
futures and options on short-term German interest rates. Such a contract
would be based on the Frankfurt interbank offered rate (Fibor).
The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe)
already has a successful Euromark futures contract but the DTB is keen to
offer the full maturity range of German interest rate products, to encourage
spread trading.
A new UK derivatives trade association, the Futures and Options Association,
will begin soliciting membership on Friday, said Brian Williamson of the
association's formation group.
Michael Jenkins, chairman of the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox),
and the former chief executive of Liffe, has been appointed association
chairman, Reuter reports

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Genentech files hormone lawsuit
against Eli Lilly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GENENTECH, the US biotechnology company, said it had filed a suit against
Eli Lilly, the pharmaceuticals company, charging that Lilly's manufacture of
a human growth hormone, used to treat dwarfism, infringes a new Genentech
patent.
The move came after Genentech had been granted a patent covering basic
processes used in recombinant DNA technology or 'cloning'.
Genentech, a pioneer in the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce
pharmaceuticals, launched its first product, a human growth hormone, in
1985. Lilly entered the market two years later with its own version of human
growth hormone.
Since then, the two companies have been waging legal battles over patent
rights.
Eli Lilly said last night: 'This is yet another suit in the ongoing
litigation.'
Genentech said its new patent resulted from early biotechnology research
conducted by Dr Keiichi Itakura and Dr Arthur Riggs at the City of Hope
National Medical Centre.
'Their research led to the production of the first useful protein by
recombinant DNA technology, which is widely acknowledged as one of the most
significant scientific achievements of this century,' said Mr Stephen Rains,
Genentech's vice-president of intellectual property.
Genentech has already licensed its recombinant DNA technology, including
that covered by the new patent, to 28 other companies in the biotechnology
field.
In 1990, Roche Holdings acquired a 60 per cent stake in Genentech for
Dollars 2.1bn.
Separately, the Food and Drug Administration is set to review Genentech's
application for approval of Pulmozyme, a treatment for cystic fibrosis.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Prudential unit sues Goldman
Sachs
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US SUBSIDIARY of Prudential, the UK insurance group, has filed a lawsuit
against Goldman Sachs, charging the Wall Street securities house with
committing fraud over the 1988 leveraged buy-out of Bucyrus-Erie, a
Milwaukee-based manufacturer of mining equipment.
PPM America, the US fund-management arm of Prudential, is suing Goldman on
behalf of Jackson National Life, a Prudential-owned insurance company based
in Michigan which bought Dollars 60m of Bucyrus-Erie bonds through a private
placement in 1990.
The lawsuit, filed in New York, alleges that Goldman rendered Bucyrus-Erie
insolvent and incapable of meeting its debt obligations through a series of
'fraudulent conveyances, violations of the federal securities laws, common
law fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentations.'
Three months ago, the highly-leveraged Milwaukee company failed to meet
interest payments on its Dollars 191m of long-term debt. It is currently
attempting to put together a financial restructuring, which is likely to
involve a filing for bankruptcy.
The involvement of Goldman dates back to 1988, when the investment bank
organised a Dollars 300m leveraged buy-out of Bucyrus-Erie. The LBO left
Goldman, which is reported to have committed only Dollars 1m of its own
equity to the deal, holding 37 per cent of the newly private company.
PPM America alleges that the deterioration of Bucyrus-Erie's finances
following the 1988 LBO led Goldman to 'fraudulently misrepresent' the sale
of new bonds to Jackson National in 1990.
Additionally, PPM claims that the terms of the LBO 'placed the Goldman group
in control of (the company) so that they could realise all the benefits of
operating BE while BE's unsecured creditors assumed all of the financial
risks associated with such operations.'
A small group of investment firms and funds that invested in the
Bucyrus-Erie LBO with Goldman were also named as defendants in the suit.
A spokesman for Goldman was unavailable for comment last night.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bombardier near to pact on TML
contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BOMBARDIER, the aerospace and transit equipment group, hopes to reach an
interim agreement soon with Transmanche Link covering part of its CDollars
450m (USDollars 352m) claim for cost overruns on a CDollars 700m tunnel
wagon contract for the undersea tunnel between England and France.
Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, said Bombardier was near to completing the
interim pact with TML, the tunnel's prime contractor, but would not comment
on reports that TML might pay an initial CDollars 100m towards final
settlement of the claim.
Earlier this month, Bombardier won agreement on the approval process and
resumed shipments of wagons from its Bruges plant after a three-month halt.
The CDollars 450m claim covers extra work being performed because of late
design changes.
TML is locked in a long-running row with Eurotunnel, the tunnel's operator,
over the escalating cost of the project which has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to
about Pounds 10bn.( Dollars 15bn)
Eurotunnel is expected to tell shareholders at its annual meeting in London
today that negotiations with the contractors remain deadlocked.
TML has warned that the tunnel is unlikely to open before next summer unless
an agreement over costs can be reached. The project originally, had been due
to open this month.
Mr Beaudoin, speaking after Bombardier's annual meeting, said he wanted to
settle his company's claim by the end of this year. Bombardier will shortly
send full details of the claim to TML, to be followed by more negotiations.
'If we can't settle towards year end, we'll have to go to court,' said Mr
Beaudoin.
Bombardier has accounted for about half the claim which led to a CDollars
73m operating loss in its transit equipment division last year.
Overall, Bombardier's order backlog totals about CDollars 8bn, evenly
divided between transit equipment and aerospace.
Mr Beaudoin said 58 business jets would be delivered this year, against 49
in 1992. With Lear Jets' new Series 60 and the Series 45 to come and a new
version of the Challenger, Bombardier can compete fully with Raytheon and
its recently-acquired BAe business jet division.
New orders for the 50-seat Regional Jet are near signing. One prospective
customer is British and another German.
But Bombardier will move ahead with the long-distance Global Express only if
international risk-sharing partners can be found.
Besides North America, Bombardier has more than CDollars 2bn of transit
equipment orders in Europe, Indonesia, Morocco and Venezuela and its new
Mexican subsidiary will help it to enter the growing Latin American markets.
Short Brothers of Belfast continues to contribute profits to Bombardier and
has become the world's biggest metal bonding producer.
Bombardier has dropped plans to raise CDollars 150m with a new preferred
stock issue. Institutions objected to conditions under which the preferred
could be converted into common shares, with consequent dilution.
Analysts expect Bombardier to attempt a straight equity issue late this year
provided the market price of the common shares recovers.
It is now well below the 52-week high of CDollars 15 1/4 because of
uncertainties about the Channel tunnel claim and delays in Regional Jet
orders.

THE Canadian government will not overturn the National Transportation
Agency's ruling allowing American Airlines to buy 25 per cent of Canadian
Airlines International for CDollars 246m (USDollars 192m), according to
federal sources.
The agency, as Canada's air transport regulator, said last month that the
American Airlines investment was not contrary to Canada's public interest,
though Canadian Airlines would still have to find a way out of the Gemini
reservation system, owned jointly with Air Canada.
Later, Air Canada appealed to the government to overturn the NTA ruling,
saying that Canada would lose control over its domestic airline industry if
the American-Canadian deal went through.

SKANDIA, the Swedish insurance group, plans to collaborate with two foreign
insurers to enhance services for commercial and industrial clients outside
the domestic market, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
Under one accord, the group will jointly operate an international service
network with the leading Finnish insurer Pohjola from next January. The
agreement expands the two companies existing co-operation which is cemented
by cross-shareholding links.
Under the other agreement, the US insurer Wausau will provide a range of
insurance and claims services to Skandia's Nordic clients in the US and
Canada.
Skandia said it would develop a network of offices in continental Europe
which would eventually serve both Pohjola and Wausau clients. Pohjola,
meanwhile, is to build up a network of offices in the Baltic states and
Russia.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Privatisations wave sweeps
across Europe - Sara Webb asks whether there is sufficient investor demand
for Dollars 100bn of issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM the Baltic to the Mediterranean, the governments of western Europe are
preparing to launch a wave of privatisations with an estimated price tag of
more than Dollars 100bn.
The sale of shares in state-owned or state-controlled companies is driven
mainly by a desire to curb the growth in countries' budget deficits, so that
EC member-countries can meet the important criteria set out in the
Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary union.
However, with such an enormous amount of new issuance likely to hit the
international capital markets - albeit over a period of four or five years -
the question arises of whether there is sufficient investor demand for the
forthcoming barrage of stock.
'It is going to be a big challenge', says Mr Ludovico del Balzo, managing
director of the equity capital group at Lehman Brothers. He points out that
unless some effort is made between the various governments to co-ordinate
their sell-offs, through informal dialogue, 'there is a danger you will see
some bunching up of issues'.
Still fresh in the minds of many international investors - and a useful
warning for European governments - is the case of Mexico. Mexican companies
prepared a slew of international equity offerings early last year: but the
supply proved too much for the market to cope with, and some offerings had
to be put on hold over the summer months.
Mr Richard Davidson, analyst at Morgan Stanley (which compiled the
accompanying table of privatisation stocks), says: 'To finance this supply,
the international investor is key, interest rates must fall, and equity
investment will have to be made more attractive to bond-oriented domestic
investors.'
Investor interest in international equity offerings is already fairly
widespread, and investment bankers appear optimistic that investors can be
encouraged to increase their exposure to foreign markets still further.
'Increasingly in Europe we expect institutional investors to diversify
internationally,' says Mr Charles Stonehill, managing director at Morgan
Stanley International.
Mr Del Balzo points out that while there is relatively less scope for UK
investors to raise their investment overseas, given that it is high already,
there is room for US institutional investment overseas to increase.
But he believes that 'outside the UK and US, it would be unrealistic to
expect a major contribution from markets other than the domestic one. I
would expect the UK and the US to take the lion's share of an international
tranche.'
Mr Mark Newlands, director of equity capital markets at Nikko Europe, argues
that there is considerable scope for Japanese institutional investors to
increase their exposure to overseas equities. 'Pension funds are a huge
source of investable assets, but historically a relatively low percentage is
invested in non-Japanese equities because of a lack of familiarity and the
recent strength of the yen,' he says.
But he points out there is 'quite a lot of pressure on the Japanese
authorities to ease regulations concerning the asset mix of pension funds.
In addition, the Japanese are growing more yield-oriented which should
encourage them to turn to European markets where yields are 4 to 5 per cent,
against around 1 per cent in Japan'.
While there is scope for US and Japanese investors to increase their
exposure to overseas equities from the current rather low levels, investment
bankers and analysts argue that certain conditions may have to be met to
encourage a substantial shift.
Mr Davidson, of Morgan Stanley, says interest rates 'must fall to levels
where equities appear attractive compared with bonds and cash on an asset
allocation view and where equity investors can feel confident of economic
revival. This is the case in every market in Europe where privatisation is
planned, but particularly in the countries with the largest capital demands
for their privatisation programmes - ie France, Italy and Spain, where cuts
in interest rates are imperative'.
Obviously the companies which are put up for sale will have to be attractive
investments in their own right.
This means that, in some cases, companies might need to be restructured. At
the same time, governments will have to consider additional incentives in
order to make their privatisations attractive to a wider range of investors.
The incentives could be tax-related, such as the tax-free plans available to
private investors in the UK and France.
No doubt some governments will be watching the reaction to France's Balladur
Bond, which has the innovative feature of being convertible into shares in
French privatisation companies, to see whether this proves a successful
means of drawing in investors.
'I think we will see governments adopting a much more pragmatic approach to
selling off companies,' concludes one senior investment banker. 'But even
so, it is going to be hard work.'

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: RJR Nabisco abandons Dollars
1.5bn stock offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the US cigarette and food manufacturer, yesterday called off a
plan to raise around Dollars 1.5bn through an offering of shares pegged to
the performance of its food division. The decision to abort was made at the
11th hour - Wall Street had been anticipating that the new shares would be
priced after the market closed last night.
RJR Nabisco blamed the general weakness in food company stocks for its
decision, saying that a 'significant' fall in the market value of comparable
food companies since it announced the plan in March made it 'difficult to
complete successfully an offering at the price range stated in the offering
prospectus.'
RJR Nabisco, which had already revamped the share sale plan once because of
the problems faced by its tobacco interests, had planned to sell about 93m
shares - 25 per cent of the food division's equity. The parent company would
have continued to hold the remaining 75 per cent.
The indicated price range for the shares was Dollars 17 to Dollars 19 and,
had the shares been sold at the mid-point, the sale would have valued the
food division at around Dollars 6.7bn. Last year, the division made an
operating profit of Dollars 769m on sales of Dollars 6.7bn. Analysts had
suggested that, at Dollars 18, the shares would have been priced at about 14
times prospective 1993 earnings.
RJR Nabisco claimed share prices of comparable companies had fallen by some
5 to 15 per cent since March. According to the Dow Jones sector indices,
'worldwide' food shares have fallen by just over 3 per cent since the
beginning of March. However, in the US, the sector has declined by about 10
per cent.
Morgan Stanley, the investment bank in charge of marketing the issue, said
the sale could have been achieved but 'at somewhat below the indicated price
range'. It supported the decision not to proceed at a lower price.
RJR Nabisco had planned to use the sale proceeds to pay off its debts. These
stand at about Dollars 14bn - an overhang from the Dollars 25bn leveraged
buy-out of the group in 1989. However, Mr Charles Harper's, RJR's new
chairman, said that the company saw 'no reason to raise capital in an
unfavourable market environment.'
The failure to complete the offering is the latest blow for RJR Nabisco. Its
tobacco division has been hit by the cigarette price-war and mounting
restrictions on smoking in the US. The group also lost Mr Lou Gerstner,
chairman and chief executive of the group since the buy-out, to IBM,
although it recruited Mr Harper from ConAgra.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: 'Balladur bond' may exceed
FFr40bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday unveiled the final details of the 'Balladur
bond', named after the prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur, with which it
plans to finance its job creation plans. It confirmed that the issue would
be open-ended and be allowed to exceed the FFr40bn (Dollars 7.18bn) target.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said it was 'not impossible' that
the issue would attract more than FFr40bn.
The four-year bonds will have a face value of FFr1,000 and yield annual
interest of 6 per cent, just below the 6.15 per cent yield on four-year
government paper.
The government has devised the issue to appeal to individual rather than
institutional investors, in the hope of encouraging French savers to
withdraw money from SICAV money market funds to buy bonds as a precursor to
participating in the forthcoming privatisation programme.
It is offering tax breaks for people buying bonds through equity savings
plans and switching cash from SICAVs into bonds or equity plans. Individuals
will be able to convert the bonds into the shares of privatised companies.
They will also be entitled to preferential investment rights when the
privatisations start in early September.
The government is spending FFr25bn to advertise the issue in a campaign
which starts today.
The bonds will be sold through banks and post offices. The minimum
investment is FFr1,000 and there is no upper limit.
The issue is led by Credit Agricole, the co-operative bank, and Banque
Nationale de Paris, the state-controlled bank which is a candidate for
privatisation, together with Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the
public-sector financial institution.
Mr Alphandery said that he expected recent falls in French interest rates to
make the bonds more appealing to investors. The government also hopes the
issue will benefit from the buoyancy of the French bond market.
'The timing is good as the market is definitely on an upward trend,' said Mr
Jean-Francois Mercier, French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'The only
problem is that if the 'Balladur bond' is a success it suggests the French
are still more interested in saving money than spending it.'

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Danisco slides to DKr826m for
year
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DANISCO, the Danish food, beverages and packaging group, saw profits after
net financial items fall by 22 per cent in the year ending March 31, to
DKr826m (Dollars 127m) from DKr1.05bn in the previous year.
The result, which was at the lower end of analysts' forecasts, was affected
by last year's dry summer (which hit the sugar beet and pea harvest),
falling domestic consumption of spirits (which affected the distilling
division) and devaluations by other European countries (which hit export
competitiveness).
High Danish interest rates for much of last year helped lift net financial
costs to DKr322m from DKr182m.
Sales fell 3 per cent to DKr13.02bn from DKr13.46bn. Net profits dropped to
DKr809m from DKr988m, but the group will pay an unchanged DKr12 dividend.
Last year, Danisco bought the Swedish sugar refining company, Sockerbolaget,
from Procordia for DKr2.22bn, which together with the group's Danish and
German sugar production operations has made the group one of Europe's
biggest sugar producers, with output of around 930,000 tonnes.
Danisco also sold its machinery company Niro Atomizer and fan manufacturer
Novenco for a total of DKr1.03bn.
The group said it expected no change in the low level of activity in its
markets in the current year, and added that the strength of the Danish
currency was affecting competitiveness.
However, if external conditions did not deteriorate, there should be
moderate growth in operating profits this year, the group said.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Two banks finalise share-swap
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT NATIONAL of France and Germany's IKB Deutsche Industriebank have
finalised a cross-shareholding arrangement whereby each will take just over
5 per cent of the other's equity.
The two banks, both of which specialise in corporate banking, have for some
time operated on a partnership basis, but recently decided to formalise
joint activities through an exchange of shares.
The alliance is the latest in a series of similar deals between French and
German financial groups. Banque Nationale de Paris and Germany's Dresdner
Bank are finalising a 10 per cent cross-shareholding arrangement.
Credit National hopes to follow the IKB deal with similar partnerships
elsewhere in Europe. It said it was seeking partners with expertise in
specialist finance, capital markets and property finance.
The agreement makes IKB the second-largest shareholder in Credit National
after Assurances Generales de France, the French insurance group, which owns
a 5.7 per cent stake.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bollore plans asset disposals
after slipping into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOLLORE Technologie, the heavily-indebted French industrial group, will
remain in the red this year but says it is hoping to improve its financial
position by making asset disposals.
Mr Vincent Bollore, chairman, told a shareholders' meeting in Paris that the
group had been hit by the poor performance of SDV, its lossmaking shipping
division.
He warned that SDV was unlikely to return to profit before the start of 1994
because of the 'catastrophic situation in the international shipping
business'.
SDV made a loss of FFr500m (Dollars 87.5m) last year, dragging the group
into the red. Bollore made a net loss of FFr358m in 1992 against net profits
of FFr81m in 1991. The group hopes to sell the entire SDV fleet, which is
worth FFr2.5bn, to its banks.
Mr Bollore said that SDV's situation would continue to be 'bad' in 1993. The
group's other interests - in paper, transport, petrol and tobacco - had all
remained profitable in the first few months of this year.
However, Bollore, which made provisions of FFr900m last year, expects to
have to make further write-downs in 1993.
The group hopes to raise around FFr350m this year by selling other
non-strategic assets, having made FFr1bn from disposals in 1992.
Mr Bollore envisaged making sales in the paper division as well as in
shipping.
The proceeds of the disposals will be used to reduce Bollore's debt, which
stood at FFr7.5bn at the end of 1992, compared with shareholders' funds of
FFr3.8bn. by

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: BP deal enhances Statoil's
position in northern Europe

STATOIL'S decision to acquire 240 petrol stations in Sweden from British
Petroleum forms part of the Norwegian state oil company's plans for
expansion in the northern Europe/Baltic region.
The deal lifts Statoil's share of the Swedish market to 26 per cent from 18
per cent.
Statoil also acquired BP's 20 per cent shareholding in ODAB, a Swedish
petroleum storage and distribution company.
The deal marks the exit of BP from Scandinavian retail petrol sales,
although it will continue to sell aircraft fuel, lubricants and some
petrochemical products in Sweden.
It also propels Statoil to the position of Scandinavia's leading retailer,
with 2,000 petrol stations, and secures it a place among the biggest petrol
retailers in northern Europe, where Shell is market leader. In 1992,
Statoil's sales of petroleum products in Scandinavia reached NKr15.5bn
(Dollars 2.2bn). Yesterday's deal is expected to increase this by 6 per
cent, or NKr800 to NKr900m, according to Mr Staffan Riben, president of
refining and marketing.
Last year, Statoil acquired 260 BP petrol stations in Ireland, giving the
group an 11 per cent market share there. Statoil established itself in the
Swedish retail petrol market in 1986, when it acquired nearly 400 petrol
stations from Esso.
In the same year, Statoil bought 400 petrol stations in Denmark, also from
Esso, where it has a 20 per cent market share. It has a NKr2.2bn investment
programme to build a condensate plant adjacent to its Kalundborg refinery in
Denmark to double production of high-quality petrol for export to Baltic
countries.
In 1992, Statoil established subsidiaries in Germany, Poland and Latvia, and
opened two petrol stations in Estonia where it will soon open another.
'During the next few years we will be seeking to develop further our
presence in the Baltic states,' Mr Riben said.
In July, Statoil plans to open one station in Latvia, and has plans for
further expansion there. It is also considering establishing a presence in
Lithuania. This summer, the group aims to open three stations in
north-eastern Germany but has plans to establish a retail network there
comprising between 100 and 150 stations.
In July, Statoil will open one station in Poland and another soon after,
while in the autumn it will open one in the Russian port of Murmansk.

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Cash-rich Minorco still in the
hunt for assets - The departure of Sir Michael Edwardes is the end of an era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR MICHAEL Edwardes. former chairman of British Leyland and Chloride, was
in his element that day in September 1988, as he sipped mineral water and
munched smoked salmon sandwiches in a cramped office discussing his latest
venture - the small matter of a Pounds 3bn (Dollars 4.5bn) bid for
Consolidated Gold Fields.
His appearance, as the new deputy chairman and chief executive of Minorco,
to lead the charge against Gold Fields took everyone by surprise.
He promised Minorco, up to then the 60 per cent owned, sleepy offshore
investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, would
become one of the world's biggest natural resources group, and a dynamic,
'hands-on' operator of its assets. The first step was to be the takeover of
Gold Fields, which seemed a foregone conclusion because Minorco already
owned 29.9 per cent of the UK mining and industrial combine.
Sir Michael looked forward to three or four years of the kind of hectic
activity he relished - sorting out and making more efficient a large group
and then building on strengthened foundations.
But it was not to be.
Gold Fields executives fought the hostile bid like demons. Eventually,
Minorco had enough acceptances to take its holding to more than 50 per cent.
But the takeover was blocked by a New York judge who cited Minorco's South
African parentage and Anglo's liking for cartels. Minorco gave up the
battle, clearing the way for Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, to
snap up Gold Fields.
This left Minorco with Dollars 1.6bn cash for its Gold Fields stake, but it
was obvious it would take much longer than Sir Michael had anticipated to
reach its strategic objectives.
He stepped down as chief executive but still played an active role on the
Minorco board, providing a link with Charter Consolidated, the industrial
group where he is chairman and where a former British Leyland colleague, Mr
Jeff Herbert, is managing director.
Yesterday came the news that those links between Minorco and Charter are to
be severed. Minorco is to sell its 36 per cent shareholding in Charter back
to that company. At the same time, Sir Michael said he would resign from the
Minorco board, on which he had served since 1984.
'We will miss him. He made a major contribution - he helped to get us
started,' said Mr Hank Slack, the new Minorco chief executive.
There has already been a wide management shake-up at Minorco, which
effectively had three managing directors: the original trio that Sir Michael
dubbed his 'Young Turks,' who persuaded Anglo that Minorco should change its
style and mount the offensive against Gold Fields. Now Mr Tony Lea is being
recalled to Anglo's Johannesburg headquarters and Mr Roger Phillimore
resigned because he lost the contest to Mr Slack for the chief executive's
role.
Since the Gold Fields debacle, Minorco's progress has been steady, but too
slow for analysts looking for drama of the sort that bid created.
Minorco started promisingly, paying Dollars 705m for the US gold operations
of Freeport McMoRan but since then there has been nothing earth-shattering.
Things might have been different if Minorco had been permitted to buy 49 per
cent of the Olympic Dam copper-uranium mine in Australia from British
Petroleum, or if its offer for Gold Fields Mining Corporation, Hanson's gold
subsidiary in the US, had come off. Together these would have cost Dollars
1bn and catapulted Minorco towards its strategic goal of becoming one of the
world's biggest mining groups.
But Western Mining, the Australian group which owned the other half of
Olympic Dam decided to exercise its pre-emptive rights to the BP stake and
Hanson swapped its gold for the coal and aggregates business of Santa Fe
Pacific.
Nevertheless, Minorco has not been entirely unsuccessful in its search for
new assets. In the past nine months it has spent about Dollars 337 on four
deals: jointly with Anglo it paid Dollars 190m for one-third of the
Collahuasi copper project in Chile; on its own account it paid Dollars 66m
for a half-share in the Lisheen zinc deposit in Ireland; paid Pounds 55m to
buy Steetley Iberia from Redland and Dollars 90.6m to swap an indirect
interest in Johnson Matthey, the UK platinum marketing group, for a 10 per
cent direct stake.
Mr Slack said Minorco had three 'legs' of strategic interest: precious
metals, with the emphasis on gold; base metals with the emphasis on copper;
and industrial minerals. 'A number of significant investment opportunities'
were under consideration.
Minorco has spent well over Dollars 1bn since the sale of its Gold Fields
shares but, once the Charter deal is completed, it will still have Dollars
1.1bn, net of borrowings in Luxembourg where it is based.
Mr Slack said that this gave Minorco more flexibility to do a bigger deal in
the natural resources sector or to make more deals.
Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg, agreed the
Charter deal made sense from Minorco's point of view and that Minorco
negotiated a good price. 'The question is: can Minorco spend the money
wisely?'

FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: 'Balladur bond' could exceed
FFr40bn target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday unveiled the final details of the 'Balladur
bond', named after the prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur, with which it
plans to finance its job creation plans. It confirmed that the issue would
be open-ended and be allowed to exceed the FFr40bn (Dollars 7.18bn) target.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said it was 'not impossible' that
the issue would attract more than FFr40bn.
The four-year bonds will have a face value of FFr1,000 and yield annual
interest of 6 per cent, just below the 6.15 per cent yield on four-year
government paper.
The government has devised the issue to appeal to individual rather than
institutional investors, in the hope of encouraging French savers to
withdraw money from SICAV money market funds to buy bonds as a precursor to
participating in the forthcoming privatisation programme.
It is offering tax breaks for people buying bonds through equity savings
plans and switching cash from SICAVs into bonds or equity plans. Individuals
will be able to convert the bonds into the shares of privatised companies.
They will also be entitled to preferential investment rights when the
privatisations start in early September.
The government is spending FFr25bn to advertise the issue in a campaign
which starts today.
The bonds will be sold through banks and post offices. The minimum
investment is FFr1,000 and there is no upper limit.
The issue is led by Credit Agricole, the co-operative bank, and Banque
Nationale de Paris, the state-controlled bank which is a candidate for
privatisation, together with Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the
public-sector financial institution. Mr Alphandery said he expected recent
falls in French interest rates to make the bonds more appealing. The
government also hopes the issue will benefit from the buoyancy of the French
bond market.
'The timing is good as the market is definitely on an upward trend,' said Mr
Jean-Francois Mercier, French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'The only
problem is that if the 'Balladur bond' is a success it suggests the French
are still more interested in saving money than spending it.'
Mr Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, the luxury goods group, is
expanding his designer fashion interests by taking over Kenzo, the Paris
fashion house. The deal follows last month's transaction in which Mr Arnault
acquired Financiere Truffaut, a portfolio of luxury goods investments
including a 25 per cent stake in Kenzo, from Groupe Worms, the French
industrial and financial holding company.
He has agreed to acquire, for an undisclosed sum, the 65 per cent stake in
Kenzo held jointly by Mr Kenzo Takada, the Japanese designer who founded the
company, and his partner, Mr Atsuko Kondo. Mr Arnault is also purchasing the
10 per cent holding of Mr Francois Baufume, chairman of Kenzo.

<TEXT>
PROFITS before tax at Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems jumped from
Pounds 303,000 to Pounds 1.61m over the year to April 30, helped by
a rights issue in January which enabled the computing services group to
eliminate bank debt.
The City had been expecting slightly more, however, and the shares fell 17p
to close at 288p on little volume.
Turnover rose from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 23.6m, while development costs
were trimmed to Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 3.22m).
Earnings per share were 7p, against 0.7p, and the company has returned to
the dividend list with a single payment of 0.75p. The company now has net
cash balances of Pounds 2m and no debt.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: 12% fall to Pounds 13m for Hogg Robinson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOGG ROBINSON, the travel, transport and financial services group, saw
profits fall 12.2 per cent to Pounds 13.3m in the year to March 31, under
the pressure of cutbacks in consumer spending and heavy discounting in the
travel sector.
Mr Brian Perry, chairman, said the recently-announced Pounds 25m sale of the
group's leisure travel business to Airtours would ease the volatility of
Hogg's profit performance.
Turnover rose 12 per cent to Pounds 172.7m. Operating profit in business
travel fell to Pounds 2m from Pounds 3.3m in 1991-92. In the discontinued
leisure travel arm, profits were down to Pounds 47,000 (Pounds 1.1m).
The fall in the leisure travel business came despite an increase in turnover
to Pounds 30.4m from Pounds 28.8m the year before. Business travel turnover
was slightly down to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 31.4m).
Mr Perry said: 'Market structures are such that there was little prospect of
making acceptable profits from our leisure travel business.
The transport division saw operating profits rise to Pounds 6m (Pounds
4.7m). Mr Perry said transport was continuing to gain ground in Europe
despite the effects of recession in Germany. Financial services' operating
profits increased to Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 4.7m).
Earnings per share were 14p (14.01p). The final dividend is 4p (3.8p),
making 6.6p (6.3p).

Hardys &amp; Hansons, the Nottingham-based brewer, reported a marginal increase
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.23m to Pounds 3.32m for the 26 weeks to

line with trends in the east Midlands.
Turnover rose to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 14.3m).
However, net interest and dividends received were down at Pounds 338,000
(Pounds 488,000).
Exceptional profits, relating to the sale of fixed assets, were also lower
at Pounds 47,000 (Pounds 66,000). Comparative figures have been restated to

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Thriving exports help push Filofax to
Pounds 2.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THRIVING exports were behind growth at Filofax Group, the personal organiser
company, where pre-tax profits almost quadrupled to Pounds 2.2m in the year
to March 31 from Pounds 553,000 in the previous 15 month period.
Turnover improved to Pounds 14.4m, helped by Pounds 1.1m from acquisitions,
against Pounds 12.7m restated under FRS 3.
Sales improvements ranged from 37 per cent in continental Europe, to 22 per
cent in the US and 17 per cent in the UK.
Filofax said the acquisition of the assets of a former French distributor
and the establishment of a new marketing subsidiary in France in October,
were making 'good progress.'
Operating profit was Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 441,000). The year finished with
net cash of Pounds 3.35m (Pounds 2.62m), after the Pounds 1.2m acquisition
of Lefax.
Mr Robin Field, chief executive, said: 'We have got the product right. It
was too expensive and not what the consumer wanted. Now we are selling
Filofaxes into the emerging markets of Korea and Taiwan.'
The recommended final dividend is increased to 0.75p, making a total for the
year of 1.25p (0.5p). Earnings per share rose to 7.7p (2.7p).

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Downturn at Kewill Systems
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of a loss-making offshoot left Kewill Systems, a Surrey-based
computer software supplier, with retained losses of Pounds 5.69m for the
year to March 31, against profits of Pounds 1.92m.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 435,000 (Pounds 2.42m). Operating profits were
Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 3.12m) after losses of Pounds 2.28m from Weigang MCS, a
German subsidiary which was sold to its management earlier this year.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 5.6m relating to the sale
reflecting the implementation of an Accounting Standards Board requirement
about the write-back of acquired goodwill.
Turnover totalled Pounds 33.3m (Pounds 41.8m) including Pounds 2.34m (Pounds
9.09m) from discontinued operations. Losses per share were 0.6p (earnings
19.91p).
The Weigang episode has cast a pall over Kewill for the past 18 months but
Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman, was confident the worst was over with improved
sales in the UK and US and a better performance from Han Dataport, an
Austrian subsidiary.
Directors intend to apply to the court to approve a capital reduction to
eliminate the deficit on distributable reserves enabling the group to resume
dividend payments.
The shares rose 18p to 192p.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: John Foster losses widen to Pounds 5.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Foster &amp; Son, the worsted and mohair cloth manufacturer, reported
pre-tax losses up from Pounds 381,000 to Pounds 5.1m for the year to
February 28.
After having warned of losses in March, the company said the second half
results were in line with expectations.
Foster, based in Black Dyke Mills, Bradford, added that the advantage gained
from the pound's devaluation had been offset by the fall in the lira. Italy
is its main competitor.
In the present year sales were not encouraging. Although action was being
taken it was likely that there would be a further loss in the present year.
Turnover was Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 22.7m). There were exceptional debits of
Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 1.02m credits) for reorganisation costs.
Losses per share were 45.4p (3.5p) and the final dividend is passed. Last
year there was a single payment of 0.5p.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Water rises by 30%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol Water Holdings lifted pre-tax profits 30 per cent, from Pounds 5.24m
to Pounds 6.8m, in the year to March 31, maintaining the advance shown at
the interim stage.
Turnover increased 9 per cent to Pounds 52.1m, mainly reflecting a 7.3 per
cent price rise permitted for the core water supply business by OFWAT.
A proposed final dividend of 20.7p lifts the total to 31p (28p), covered 2.6
times by basic earnings of 82p (68.9p).

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Fenner offer talks terminated
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fenner, the Hull-based industrial group, said yesterday that discussions on
a possible offer for the company had been terminated.
The shares fell 9p to 73p.
The board said on April 29 it received 'indications of interest which might
or might not lead to an offer being made for the group'.
That was a response to a sharp rise in the share price, caused by City
speculation that Wassall, the mini-conglomerate, might be preparing a bid.
Wassall again refused to comment yesterday.
The termination comes a few months after Fenner had held merger talks with
another undisclosed group. The talks were aborted at a late stage, leading
to Pounds 1.2m of professional fees in Fenner's interim accounts.
Mr Colin Cooke, who takes over today as Fenner's non-executive chairman,
said: 'We want to remain independent.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
QUICKS, the Manchester-based Ford dealer is expanding its network through
the acquisition of Laidlaw, an offshoot of Goode Durrant, for Pounds 8.15m
cash.
Laidlaw operates five Ford dealerships in Scotland, Essex and Kent. The
enlarged group will have 10 Ford outlets, two more than the manufacturer's
current franchising policy allows. Quicks said, however, that 'Ford allow a
reasonable period for compliance . . . any action required will only be
taken following a detailed review of the Laidlaw business'.
The purchase, which excludes Laidlaw's leasing side, is to be funded by a
placing, through Noble Grossart, of 6.53m new shares, representing
approximately 28.6 per cent of the enlarged equity, at 145p to raise Pounds
8.78m. Existing shareholders may participate on a 2-for-5 basis.
Quicks shares rose 4p to 162p.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Learmonth Burchett advances to Pounds 1.61m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS before tax at Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems jumped from
Pounds 303,000 to Pounds 1.61m over the year to April 30, helped by
a rights issue in January which enabled the computing services group to
eliminate bank debt.
The City had been expecting slightly more, however, and the shares were
marked down 17p to close at 288p on little volume.
Turnover rose 10.5 per cent, from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 23.6m, while
development costs were cut by 3 per cent to Pounds 3.1m, against Pounds
3.22m.
Earnings per share were 7p, against 0.7p, and the company has returned to
the dividend list with a single payment of 0.75p. The company now has net
cash balances of Pounds 2m and no debt.
LBMS is a computing services company specialising in software 'tools' and
software programmes. Mr Rainer Burchett, chairman, said he believed the
company's tool sets for systems engineers and process management engineers
were well positioned for the expected market growth.
Overseas sales were now 40 per cent of turnover and growth in the US had
been particularly strong. Software product sales were 50 per cent of
turnover.
The principal brake on the company's growth and its efforts to reach a 10
per cent gross profit margin, however, was the depressed state of the UK
market.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Field valued at Pounds 148.4m in 250p main
market flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIELD GROUP, the folding carton maker, has priced its flotation at 250p a
share, valuing the company at Pounds 148.4m.
The issue involves a placing of 22.5m shares and a public offer of 12.1m
shares, raising Pounds 84.1m after expenses.
Of this amount, Pounds 71.9m will go to the company, cutting its gearing to
nil, and the rest will go to existing shareholders.
The issue price gives a p/e of 17.7 on pro forma earnings per share,
excluding exceptional costs, of 14.1p.
The pricing was pitched between the industrial sector and the packaging
sector which stands at a premium to the market.
A notional net dividend of 6.4p for the year to April 4, gives a gross yield
of 3.2 per cent, which is covered 2.2 times.
Field makes cartons for the food, drink, tobacco, toiletry and
pharmaceutical industries, with five plants in the UK, where it is market
leader, and one in Belgium.
It has expanded partly through acquisitions, such as the recently-agreed
purchase of the carton packaging activities of Boots, the pharmaceutical and
retail group.
It expects volume growth in the carton market in the medium term, partly as
cartons are seen as more environmentally friendly than plastic packaging.
It also has a record of increasing market share.
After the flotation CINVen, the venture capital group, will have 21 per cent
of the equity, after selling 4.3m shares in the issue, the maximum it is
allowed.
Directors and employees are selling 700,000 shares and will together have
15.2 per cent of the share capital.
The offer closes on June 30 and dealings in the shares are expected to start
on Wednesday July 7.
COMMENT
Field has plenty going for it. Having spent Pounds 50m over the last five
years it has the capacity to expand and the ability to pick up new business.
Trends in the industry favour larger groups, likely to benefit as customers
cut their lists of suppliers, which can offer the high-quality design which
now characterises much consumer packaging as a strong impact on the
supermarket shelves is vital. Further, there is scope for a number of deals
such as the one with Boots, due to complete next month, which will raise
gearing to a mere 8.2 per cent. A forecast of current year pre-tax profits
of Pounds 13.7m before one-off costs (operating profits of Pounds 12.6m
before exceptional costs) gives a prospective p/e of 14.7. After the
successful flotation of RPC Group, the plastic packaging company, there is
likely to be good demand for Field, although it is twice the size. The
shares are worth buying and holding.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: US folding cartons side boosts NMC to
Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NMC, the packaging group, lifted annual profits by 42 per cent, mainly
reflecting another buoyant performance from UPC, its core US folding carton
operation.
The pre-tax increase for the 12 months to March 31, from Pounds 5.01m to
Pounds 7.11m, was also helped by the strength of the dollar which
contributed some 6 per cent to the improvement. The company expected further
benefit during this year.
Mr Norman Gordon, chief executive, attributed UPC's strong showing to
'substantial new long term contracts with customers which have been
integrated into existing turnover without surrendering margins.'
US packaging turnover amounted to Pounds 109.6m (Pounds 69.4m), while the
smaller UK side produced sales of Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 24.2m).
The group has recently completed a private placement of Dollars 60m (Pounds
40m) of fixed term debt repayable over 10 years, which together with a new
revolving credit line will finance future growth. Plans for a public
offering of UPC in the US have been 'shelved indefinitely' Mr Gordon said.
Costs involved with the abortive offering amounted to Pounds 367,000 and
were taken below the line.
A further extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.88m related to the withdrawal
from the low margin point of sale flexible packaging business at Bristol.
Basic earnings per share were 6.15p (2.76p); a proposed final of 1.5p (nil)
brings the total for the year to 2p (1.25p).

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Wagon shares fall 40p on first half warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAGON Industrial, the materials handling and engineering group, comfortably
met market expectations with pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 up 43
per cent from Pounds 12.7m to Pounds 18.1m.
The shares, however, fell 40p to 377p after the group warned that results of
European subsidiaries would be under pressure, especially in the first half.
While relieved by the prospects of UK economic recovery and confident of the
strength of its balance sheet with Pounds 14.7m of net cash, shareholders
were told yesterday that 'the worst is not over for the European economies.'
'It is anticipated that for the year as a whole, results will be similar to
those achieved in 1992-93, prior to any further restructuring costs that may
become necessary at Forkhardt,' said Mr Paul Taylor, chairman, referring to
the German engineering subsidiary.
Such costs could amount to Pounds 3m, explained Mr John Hudson, chief
executive.
The absence of exceptional costs was one of two main reasons for the profits
increase in the accounts, prepared under FRS 3. The previous figures,
restated, carried exceptionals of Pounds 3.46m.
The second was the performance of companies acquired during the year. They
contributed Pounds 29.6m to total turnover of Pounds 248m (Pounds 230m) and
added Pounds 2.09m to operating profits, which, without their presence,
would have been Pounds 14.4m, against Pounds 15.6m.
Earnings per share were 29p (19.95p) on capital enlarged by a rights issue
to finance the purchase of Polypal, a Belgian materials handling company.
An increased final dividend of 11.175p lifts the total to 17.308p (16.484p).

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: The logic of building a bigger estate -
Philip Rawstorne examines Greenalls' planned Pounds 214m takeover of JA
Devenish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENALLS' Pounds 214.3m offer for Devenish aims to create an independent
national retailer with more than 2,000 pubs and a purchasing clout that will
ensure keenly-priced supply deals with the leading brewers.
It is a trend that began with the government-enforced disposal of 11,000
pubs by the national brewers and is expected to gather pace in the next few
years.
Even the smallest pub chains - many of them new entrants in the market  -
are securing discounts on beer supplies as the brewers fight for share in
the expanding free trade. Some beer is being sold at half the list price.
However, the battle will inevitably result in the closure of more breweries
and the restoration of balance between supply and demand. Small retailers
may then find the terms of trade turning against them. Only the big chains
are likely to be able to negotiate with the brewers on equal terms.
Greenalls' acquisition of Devenish would add 550 pubs to the group's present
estate of 1,450 - achieving in a single move a substantial increase that
would take years to build on a pub-by-pub basis.
Its beer sales would rise from an annual 650,000 barrels to about 850,000
barrels - a volume that any brewer would be eager to secure. The deal would
add other useful cards to Greenalls' hand. The combined estate would offer
brewers widespread national distribution of their brands. Greenalls strength
lies in north-west England and the Midlands. Devenish has a presence in
London and the southern counties as well as its base in the south-west.
Food sales have become an increasingly important contributor to profits of
Greenalls' 760 managed houses and of Devenish's 260 managed outlets. With
Greenalls' hotel interests, it is estimated that the combined group would be
buying Pounds 28m of food a year.
The enlarged group should also gain from cross fertilisation of retailing
ideas as well as the elimination of duplicate costs.
Altogether, the merger would take Greenalls a logical step further along the
strategic course on which it set out with the closure of its breweries in
1990.
The market after the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry would
offer better growth prospects as a retailer than as a regional brewer, Mr
Andrew Thomas, chairman and chief executive, and Mr Peter Greenall, group
managing director, decided.
The company's share structure - which had guaranteed the Greenall family's
control for 230 years - was revised the following year, and was followed
last year by an Pounds 86m rights issue to fund expansion.
For the Devenish board, which fought off a Pounds 120m hostile bid from
Boddington, another pub retailer, in 1991, the Greenalls' offer was one that
could not be refused.
The Devenish management, which dubbed the Boddington bid as 'undervalued and
opportunistic' has had to operate since with the predator, a 19.5 per cent
shareholder, still brooding in the background over another bid.
Talks with Greenalls have been going on for over a year. Mr John Clark,
Devenish deputy chairman and chief executive, said yesterday: 'The offer
represents a premium of 52 per cent to net assets and we felt it had to be
accepted for the benefit of shareholders.'
The price, according to industry analysts, was pitched generously enough to
freeze out any possible counter-bid from Boddington. Its decision yesterday
to take the cash, and a profit of about Pounds 15m on the deal, enables it
to emerge from the situation without loss of face.
However, there is little doubt that Boddington was bracing itself for
another bid. The disappointment at being outflanked must be acute - and
there is a danger now that the one-time predator may become the prey for
others in the market.

Cornwell Parker, the furniture and fabrics group, said that since its
interim statement in March, sales had been less resilient than expected.
As a result, unless there was a marked upturn in demand, pre-tax profits for

hoped to recommend an unchanged final dividend of 4p.

<TEXT>
Shares in Carpetright, the carpet retailer headed by Sir Phil Harris, closed
at 165 1/2 p yesterday, the first day of dealings after the flotation at
148p, writes Maggie Urry.
Turnover in the shares was heavy at 22.7m.
The basis of allocation favoured smaller investors, and it is thought that
some institutions were buying in the aftermarket.
A placing of 25.45m shares with institutions was said to have left many such
investors with fewer shares than they had wanted, and there were some large
institutional applications in the public offer.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Quality Care jumps by 78% to Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUALITY CARE Homes lifted pre-tax profits by 78 per cent, from Pounds
835,000 to Pounds 1.49m in the half year ended April 30, as the north-east
based nursing home operator continued its rapid expansion.
Mr Duncan Bannatyne, managing director, said that the early evidence of the
working of the new community care funding rules suggested there would be no
downward pressure on prices.
But admissions were taking longer, meaning occupancy rates could fall
slightly. At the end of the half year 96.2 per cent of beds were occupied.
Turnover rose 49 per cent, to Pounds 4.1m, with the full benefit of homes
opened last year and another 61 beds opened sincetaking the total to 601.
Another four homes are due to open in the second half, with bed numbers
rising to 799 by the year end. Another three homes are already under
construction.
The rate of expansion had been faster than expected and opening costs would
mean it would be difficult to repeat the first half performance in the
second half.
Operating profits rose 37 per cent to Pounds 1.54m. Net interest payable was
lower at Pounds 54,000 (Pounds 287,000) thanks to the Pounds 4.1m flotation
proceeds. Gearing, 15 per cent at the last year end, was 19 per cent at
April 30.
The shares, which have doubled since the placing at 136p in July, were down
2p to 278p yesterday.
Earnings per share were 7.67p (6p) and the interim dividend is 1.5p (0.15p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES of Pounds 3.27m from its discontinuing businesses contributed to a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.93m at YJ Lovell (Holdings) for the half year to
March 31. Losses last time were Pounds 1.61m, restated in accordance with
FRS 3.
Turnover fell to Pounds 124m (Pounds 137m). Operating losses from the
construction and plant hire side increased to Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 904,000),
UK residential property suffered losses of Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 17,000)
although there were profits of Pounds 112,000 (Pounds 1m losses) from the
US. The partnership housing division advanced from Pounds 2.18m to Pounds
3.23m.
Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, said the discontinuing businesses of Urban
Renewal, Spain and the commercial property side continued to be slow to wind
down.
Looking ahead, he said there were welcome signs of increased housing
activity although the recovery was patchy. The UK housing division was
gradually working its way through its high priced land and should return to
profitability next year.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Norweb rises to Pounds 157m but shares fall
17p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWEB, the Manchester-based electricity company, yesterday cut electricity
prices by 1.6 per cent from July 1 as it announced a 14 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 157.1m for the year to March 31.
A final dividend of 14.1p makes a 20p total, a rise of 13 per cent. The
total is covered 3.2 times by earnings of 64.6p.
The improvement came in spite of a 0.4 per cent decline in the number of
electricity units distributed, with the industrial sector 2.7 per cent down.
However, operating profit was up 7.4 per cent at Pounds 138.7m.
That was helped by improved efficiency in the regulated businesses with
staff numbers reduced by a further 197 staff, leaving 5,176.
The supply business made operating profits of Pounds 13.5m, compared with
Pounds 11.9m. The improvement was helped by the addition of 96 custom-ers in
the over one megawatt market, taking the total to 363.
Mr Ken Harvey, chairman, said the company had already signed deals with
customers who use above 100kW for the period after next April when the
market for medium sized users is opened up to competition.
COMMENT
Norweb fared worse than most of its competitors yesterday with its shares
falling 17p to 480p. It was not helped by Mr Harvey's comments on the
dividend race and retailing profits falling to Pounds 6m (Pounds 6.7m).
Norweb is heavily involved in retailing, a sector in which the industry has
failed to distinguish itself. Its refusal to rule out a bid for the
Clydesdale chain in Scotland may worry the market even though Norweb appears
better at selling electrical goods than other recs. Overall, there is little
to quarrel about in the management's strategy. Mr Harvey has been one of the
toughest negotiators with the government over coal and nuclear contracts and
the distribution business fundamentals are strong. The shares, trading
yesterday at a prospective yield of 5.8 per cent assuming dividends this
year of 22.5p, should recover yesterday's losses fairly quickly.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alexon calls for Pounds 16.4m to underpin
reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXON Group, the women's wear retailer, yesterday announced a 4-for-5
rights issue to raise Pounds 16.4m to underpin the reorganisation of its
business.
The 28.5m new shares are being offered at 60p each. The existing shares,
which were yesterday relisted after a temporary suspension at the company's
request, fell 13p to 65p.
Alexon, which is under new management, also restated its results for the 53
weeks to January 30, showing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12.2m. It made Pounds
11.3m pre-tax profit in the previous year.
The deficit is Pounds 11.2m greater than shown in the preliminary
announcement of unaudited results made on March 30. The loss has been
inflated mainly because of provisions made against old stock, which has been
written down by Pounds 10m.
The cash call has the support of Alexon's three biggest institutional
shareholders - Gartmore Pension Fund Managers, Scottish Amicable Investment
Managers and Mercury Asset Management. In April they took the unusual step
of forcing a change of management.
Mr John Osborn, a former director of Sears who took over as chief executive,
said he was confident of the support of most of his shareholders after
talking to 26 institutions. The rights issue is being underwritten by
Kleinwort Benson.
Mr Osborn said the Dash leisure wear brand would be replaced in the group's
shops with a ladies brand named Ann Harvey. Dash would return to a
concession-only brand. Alexon's US operations would close.
COMMENT
With new management installed at Alexon it was only a matter of time before
shareholders would be tapped for cash. Mr Osborn, who arrives at Alexon with
a good track record, is not prone to tinkering around the edges. Instead of
repositioning Dash in the group's shops he has effectively replaced it with
a new brand. He aims to get the old stock below Pounds 30m by the year end.
However, in a fiercely competitive market it still remains a high-risk
policy. The group's own brokers, Kleinworts, are forecasting a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 7m by the end of January 1994, followed by a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 4m the next year. This would put the shares on a prospective multiple
of 13.8 - a discount to the stores sector. That might be judged a good
enough return by the group's big shareholders, but it is unlikely to prove
attractive to anyone else.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged BTP in line with forecasts at
Pounds 20.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTP, the specialist chemical company which in April bought most of the
assets of the ailing MTM, made profits of Pounds 20.5m pre-tax last year, in
line with forecasts made at the time of its rights issue to fund the deal.
Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, said the current year had begun well. The
challenge was now to sort out the loss-making parts of the acquired MTM
assets and to raise the profitability of the rest of the group to the level
achieved by BTP.
Pre-tax profits in the year to end-March rose from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds
20.5m on sales up 19 per cent at Pounds 208.8m.
Earnings per share fell from 14.81p to 14.13p, following the issue of shares
at the start of the financial year, and the group is recommending a final
dividend of 6.05p (5.75p), giv-ing a total of 9.3p, up 5 per cent.
Gearing at the year-end was 2 per cent. The MTM acquisition cost Pounds
100m, only Pounds 72.2m of which was raised via the rights issue. As a
result, gearing is currently about 25 per cent, a level at which it is
likely to stay.
BTP's acquisition of most of MTM's assets was well received. From a level of
239p before the deal was announced, the share price has risen to close
yesterday up 2p at 259p.
Some Pounds 1.34m was charged to operating profit for bad debts, closure
costs and the write-off of obsolescent plant during the year.
Mr Buckley said that investment in new biocide technology and the
enlargement of process chemical capacity combined with the commissioning of
plant in Australia and the relocation of the Italian business augured well
for a year of progress in existing businesses.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Launch costs push loss at ERF to Pounds
4.12m - Sales growth points to recession coming to an end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVAGE competition and the worst UK market conditions since the 1950s
contributed to steeply increased losses at ERF, the truck maker, in the year
to April 3.
However, the biggest element in the pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.12m, against
Pounds 613,000 restated for FRS 3, was the Pounds 2.42m exceptional cost of
launching new trucks designed for Europe, and the setting up of a
continental network to sell them.
'We have taken all these costs as a single hit and are beginning this year
with a clean sheet', said Mr Peter Foden, chairman, who indicated that the
most severe recession in the industry's post-war history had turned the
corner.
Excluding exceptionals ERF, the UK's last quoted independent heavy truck
maker, would have made a small pre-tax profit of Pounds 77,000 in the second
half against losses of Pounds 1.78m in the first six months.
With total UK sales of trucks above 15 tonnes, the sector in which ERF
specialises, currently running 9 per cent above 1992 levels, 'there are
definite signs that the recession is coming to an end', Mr Foden added.
However, the length of the recession and heavy discounting, with some makers
selling Pounds 60,000 vehicles for as little as Pounds 38,000, has taken its
toll.
Debt-free until two years ago, ERF's gearing rose to 17 per cent last year
and now stands at 36 per cent, with borrowings reaching about Pounds 8.5m.
But with the bulk of its four-year, Pounds 14m investment programme now in
place, ERF maintains that its bankers are playing a very supportive role.
Unit sales last year totalled 1,942, down from 2,176 in 1992 and about 4,000
units at the peak of the last boom in 1989.
Mr Rod England, marketing director, forecast that the UK market would
recover by 10 per cent this year, to about 17,500 units, and to 20,000 in
the course of 1994. ERF also expects to benefit from 20 per cent
productivity improvements arising from a reorganisation of its assembly
operations and the introduction of flexible working practices.
It also claims to have picked up considerable orders during the period in
receivership of Leyland DAF.
However, ERF is launching its continental venture at a time when some key
target countries are experiencing sharp falls in demand. The French market
is plunging to an expected 18,000 units this year from 38,000 in 1990, and
the Spanish to an expected 7,000 from 17,000.
ERF also took a small loss on its interest in ERF South Africa, offset by
the first profits from ERF Leasing, a joint venture with Capital Charter.
Turnover fell from Pounds 117.6m to Pounds 111.7m. Losses per share came out
at 46.25p (13.26p). With no interim, the proposed final dividend of 2p
compares with a total of 4p for last year.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sale proceeds behind surge to Pounds 289m
at Charter Cons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARTER Consolidated, which yesterday announced plans to buy out Minorco's
36 per cent stake in the industrial group, also reported an 11 per cent
increase in annual operating profits from its existing businesses to Pounds
31.3m.
Under FRS 3, pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 85.5m to Pounds 289.2m in
the year to March 31, although they were distorted by the Pounds 218m profit
on the sale of Johnson Matthey.
Charter said: 'This improvement was creditable in a very difficult year when
many of our competitors struggled to stand still.'
The rail track equipment division increased its operating profits from
Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 12.5m on sales which expanded from Pounds 94.4m to
Pounds 116.1m. The strongest performance came from the British fastenings
business, which increased exports by 26 per cent.
The group said the rail grinding and track maintenance market was recovering
gradually as the US emerged from recession, but it had been a difficult year
for the track maintenance division.
Operating profits from building products and services rose from Pounds 11.3m
to Pounds 11.9m on sales which increased from Pounds 202.8m to Pounds
245.2m. Cape increased its overseas sales from 39 to 44 per cent, which
helped compensate for the effects of recession in the UK.
In mining equipment, operating profits increased from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds
3.8m on sales up from Pounds 110.4m to Pounds 118m. In spite of difficult
markets, Anderson had successfully developed its repair and rebuild capacity
and had won a further two-year contract from British Coal, putting it in a
stronger position to cope with its smaller domestic market for original
equipment. National Mine Service's profits were flat despite a 28 per cent
increase in turnover, as recession in the US cut the demand for coal.
Operating profits from quarrying and mining were flat at Pounds 3.1m (Pounds
3m) in spite of an increase in sales from Pounds 54.9m to Pounds 58.4m.
Underlying earnings per share, stripping out the impact of FRS 3, were flat
at 42.5p.
A final dividend of 15p gives a total for the year of 22p (21.5p).

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lucas issues release in move to avoid
criticism - 'Price sensitive' information available for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS INDUSTRIES, the engineering group, will issue a three page press
release this afternoon summarising information which will be given to 26
stockbroking analysts who are visiting one of the company's factories today.
By doing so Lucas hopes to avoid any suggestion that it is favouring
analysts with price sensitive information not available to all shareholders.
The move follows last month's Stock Exchange censure of London International
Group, the photo-processing and toiletries company.
LIG rang 13 analysts and four large shareholders advising them to cut profit
forecasts, and the share price fell sharply.
Since then the question of how companies should communicate with
shareholders has been hotly debated.
The Stock Exchange feels unable to issue any guidelines until the Criminal
Justice Bill, which contains new insider trading rules, is enacted.
Mr Bernard Carey, director of corporate communications at Lucas, said that
the company and its advisers had decided 'what we will be saying tomorrow
may be considered to be price sensitive'. He said analysts present would
also be told that Lucas would not answer questions on certain issues.
Lucas said the press release would contain 'all material provided and
discussed' and would be issued 'to ensure that all requirements are met in
line with the London Stock Exchange directives'. Mr Carey said that any
points raised by analysts which elicited answers considered to be price
sensitive would be covered in a release tomorrow.
However, the move may have backfired as analysts who heard about the planned
press release jumped to the conclusion that Lucas would be announcing bad
news, possibly that it would not be able to maintain the dividend.
Last week Lucas hosted a dinner at the Paris air show attended by some
analysts who reported that they had received a bleak view of current trading
conditions, causing share price weakness. Lucas issued the text of the
speech made at the dinner the following day.
One analyst who attended the dinner said yesterday, 'I got lots more out of
the meeting than from the synopsis given to the Stock Exchange. You need to
be there to get the tone.'
Lucas wrote to newspapers yesterday alerting them to the forthcoming press
release, which will be published at 3pm, at about the time the analysts at
the plant in Gloucestershire will be free to make phone calls back to their
offices.
Mr Carey said it had been the group's normal practice to alert newspapers'
stock market reporters of analysts visits, and today's press release 'was
planned weeks ago'.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Gestetner in the red after provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GESTETNER HOLDINGS, the office and photographic equipment distributor,
yesterday gave details of an extensive restructuring of its European
businesses.
The group also confirmed that it had taken a Pounds 48.3m provision partly
to cover the restructuring, which was flagged in May when Inchcape, the
international services and marketing group, took a 15 per cent stake.
The effect of all the provisions was to produce a pre-tax loss of Pounds
45.4m in the six months to April 30, compared with a profit of Pounds 7.8m,
restated in accordance with FRS 3. Gestetner's sales rose from Pounds 440m
to Pounds 498m. In constant sterling terms, the increase was 2 per cent,
from Pounds 490m.
Mr Greg Melgaard, Gestetner's new managing director, said the group's
workforce had been cut by 1,000 over the last two years to about 10,500, and
a similar number of jobs would go over the next 18 months.
Mr Melgaard said most attention would focus on the businesses in France and
Spain, where a high cost base had been exposed by the impact of recession.
In the UK, the group is also to stop manufacturing offset printing equipment
and cut its base capacity for manufacturing stencil duplicators from the
current level of 20,000 to about 10,000, although it will be able to make as
many as 15,000 to fulfil specific orders.
The group said trading conditions in both office automation and photographic
markets continued to be difficult.
Turnover in office automation increased by 3.9 per cent to Pounds 410m, in
constant currency. Trading profit fell from Pounds 23.3m to Pounds 14.5m.
There was a decline in overall gross margins, of which about half was
expected due to reduced sales of high-margin products. The rest was because
of recessionary pressures in its main European markets.
Turnover from photographic products was 5 per cent down at Pounds 84.4m.
However, improved margins and a low expense base allowed trading profits to
increase from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.8m. The photographic supplies
business had sales of Pounds 48m and trading profits of Pounds 2.2m.
Although the conditional contract to sell Gestetner's Vivitar and Hanimex
camera distribution businesses lapsed in January, the group said discussion
were taking place with another party.
In spite of losses per share of 22.2p, compared with earnings of 3.6p last
time, the interim dividend is held at 1.8p.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram issues fresh profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM, the maker of kitchens and bathrooms, has joined an infamous club
of companies, including Hartstone and MTM, that have made two profits
warnings in almost as many months.
The company, which had to delay publication of its 1992 accounts earlier
this year after a row with its auditors and whose fall from grace has been
almost as swift as its rise, said profits in the half year to July 4 would
be 'substantially lower' than last time.
Losses at Regency doors and Artisan Tiles had been greater than expected,
mainly due to technical and training problems during commissioning at the
new manufacturing sites.
The bathroom division's losses had also continued. And increased sales in
the kitchen division were 'being held back by necessary increases in
operating costs designed to support long-term profitability.'
Mr Ron Farr, main board director and chief executive of the special products
division, said advisers had reported that City expectations had been too
high.
At the time of the preliminary announcement in March, Mr Bill Rooney,
chairman, said that despite tough trading conditions the board believed
'business prospects for 1993 are better than 1992,' a message he repeated at
the AGM five weeks ago.
Mr Farr said he was still confident, after meetings yesterday with
divisional managers, that the second half would be better than the first.
But '1993 is no longer guaranteed to be better than 1992.'
The latest statement comes three months after a similar warning in March
concerning the 1992 figures, and followed last November's discovery of false
accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary.
Mr Farr said recently received figures for May revealed that the
'anticipated improvement in the first half did not happen.'
Spring Ram's shares fell 8 1/2 p yesterday to 52 1/2 p.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Frogmore joins cash queue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROGMORE Estates yesterday joined the queue of property companies tapping
the equity market when it announced a Pounds 42.9m rights issue to help
finance Pounds 58m of acquisitions which are agreed or under negotiation.
The 1-for-3 cash call, which involves the issue of 12.78m new shares at
345p, has been underwritten by Warburgs.
The shares lost 17p to 404p.
Frogmore has agreed two acquisitions subject to contract totalling Pounds
30m, while negotiations are in progress for another Pounds 28m of purchases.
The deals are in the retail and residential sectors, which Frogmore believes
will lead the recovery. It said it was possible to buy quality properties on
yields close to interest rates.
Group borrowings amounted to Pounds 68.2m by June 10.
A forecast final dividend of 12.4p will make a total for the year of 16p, an
increase of 6.6 per cent.
COMMENT
When yet another property company jumps on to the rights issues bandwagon,
it risks being charged with opportunism. The dangers are that if it fails to
find suitable acquisitions, it may simply dilute its net asset value and
reduce its gearing at the wrong stage of the cycle. But Frogmore is likely
to avoid the traps. Far from suggesting opportunism, its record demonstrates
strong organic growth; this is only the second rights issue in its 32 year
history. Moreover, it has shown unusual skill at reading the market's
cycles: it reduced its gearing by selling property in the late 1980s and
returned to the buying trail in the last 18 months. The issue is likely to
involve no earnings dilution and a relatively small dilution of asset value
of about 4 per cent. Although investors might prefer to know more about the
deals that Frogmore has lined up, the rights issue deserves to be well
supported.

SHARES in Courts (Furnishers) climbed 91p to 613p yesterday as the home
furnishings group reported a 53 per cent pre-tax profits advance in the year
to March 31.
The rise from Pounds 8.09m to Pounds 12.4m was struck on turnover ahead 22
per cent at Pounds 224m, compared with Pounds 184m. At the interim stage,
the growth in turnover had only been 4.2 per cent. When those results were
announced the shares rose 25p to 344p.
The bulk of the profits growth came from the 12 overseas subsidiaries, where
electrical appliances account for 60 per cent of sales. Overseas turnover
expanded by Pounds 35.6m to Pounds 117.1m, 52.3 per cent of the group total.
Of the Pounds 35.6m, organic growth accounted for Pounds 20.2m and
favourable currency exchange rates the balance.
Operating profits in the Far East were Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 5.9m), the
Caribbean Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 6.3m) and the Pacific/Indian Ocean Pounds 6.3m
(Pounds 5.1m).
Transfers to deferred profits in the group, the payments so far on hire
purchase sales, rose to Pounds 9m (Pounds 5.3m). This derived mostly from
increased volume overseas where most of the business is on credit. In the UK
credit accounts for only 15 per cent of sales.
Sales of the Trinidadian joint venture, treated as an associate, were up
from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 17.2m.
Mr Bruce Cohen, chief executive, said that over the year there had been a
certain amount of recovery, albeit 'slow and hesitant', but that Queensway
and ELS had gone bust and that Chestermans, the Argos experiment, had been
wound up.
In the UK, operating profits were up at Pounds 4.41m (Pounds 3.53m) on sales
ahead at Pounds 106.9m (Pounds 102.5m). Mr Cohen said that when the market
strengthens, an increase in turnover would immediately impact on the bottom
line.
Earnings rose to 31.6p (19.7p) per share and the dividend is lifted to 5.5p
via a proposed final of 3.67p (3.17p).

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: SFO looks into alleged advance fee frauds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SOLICITOR who received a controversial Pounds 2.1m payment from the
pension fund of Belling, the cooker manufacturer which collapsed last year,
has been declared bankrupt claiming debts of more than Dollars 250m (Pounds
167m).
It has also emerged that Mr Charles Deacon, a 51-year-old solicitor from
Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, is at the centre of a Serious Fraud
Office inquiry into alleged advance fee frauds which may extend to the US.
It is unclear whether Mr Deacon's debts relate to money which has actually
changed hands or funds promised. However, Mr Colin Davis of WH Matthews &amp;
Co, solicitors for Mr Deacon, said yesterday that the official receiver had
been made aware of claims by Mr Deacon against parties outside the UK -
involving both sums owed and indemnities given - which would exceed the
Dollars 254m debts.
Independent trustees were appointed by creditors last week to investigate Mr
Deacon's debt claims. If substantiated, the size of the debts would make
this one of the largest bankruptcies on record, approaching the Pounds 180m
owed by Mr George Walker, the former head of leisure group Brent Walker, now
facing charges of theft.
Mr Deacon appears to have acted on occasion as a broker for companies
seeking a refinancing. He played a key role in one deal with Belling
involving offshore family interests of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands
entrepreneur who has been linked to the flotation of several natural
resource companies. Events at two of these companies, Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and
Butte Mining, are being investigated by the SFO.
The solicitor agreed to hold an advance fee of Pounds 2.1m, paid by Belling
out of the pension fund, in return for a promised loan of Dollars 50m to be
arranged by Global Prospect Funding, where Mr Deacon was appointed a
director in 1990.
When the loan was not forthcoming, security for the fee was provided by
Finchley Investments, an offshore vehicle for Smith family interests. The
following month, Belling collapsed with debts of more than Pounds 28m.
The security - a stake in Western &amp; Pacific, a Canadian mining company which
was 57.4 per cent owned by Mr Smith and his family - is currently worth
significantly less than its original CDollars 1.75m (Pounds 910,000) value.
Last month, trustees of the Belling pension fund, The Law Debenture Trust,
won a court judgment against Mr Deacon for Dollars 3.5m.
Mr Deacon, who has not practised as a solicitor since December, was declared
bankrupt in April following a petition from Cheshire-based Monarch
Assurance. The petition followed a writ in 1991 against Mr Deacon, alleging
that he had undertaken to provide Dollars 35m for Mr Patrick Taylor,
Monarch's managing director, but failed to do so. Monarch won a judgment
against Mr Deacon for the Dollars 35m.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Simple logic, devilish detail for Richemont: The divorce of
tobacco and luxury brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRUCTURING the house of Richemont, the parent company for Rothmans
cigarettes and some of Europe's leading luxury brand names, has long seemed
simple in logic but devilish in detail.
The reorganisation announced on Tuesday, designed to separate the group's
tobacco and luxury goods businesses into two separately listed companies,
will simplify Richemont's convoluted group structure. It also appears to
dodge the detail of tax considerations for Richemont's controlling South
African shareholders and a tax liability on possibly the star in Richemont's
firmament, Cartier.
Terms of the restructuring are expected soon, possibly with Rothmans annual
results tomorrow. Ahead of that, analysts agreed that the move is a welcome
one. It should lead to operational and marketing benefits when sales of
cigarettes and luxury goods are being hit respectively by price cutting and
recession.
'There should be practical and cosmetic improvements, although underlying
valuations were recognised so there may not be a lot more extra value
created,' according to Mr Paul Beaufrere at James Capel.
Richemont was set up in 1988 as the Swiss-based vehicle for the overseas
assets of the South African Rembrandt group, founded by Mr Anton Rupert. His
son Johann, who trained as a merchant banker, helped devise Richemont's
share structure, which allows the Rupert family to retain control despite
holding only 10 per cent of the shares.
Richemont's main holding was its stake in Rothmans, which the Rupert family
had controlled since the early 1970s, and which in turn owned 57 per cent of
Dunhill Holdings. Throughout the 1980s, the group made a number of luxury
goods acquisitions, some of which were shared between Rothmans and
Richemont, and some of which were held directly by Richemont.
As luxury goods sales rallied in the late 1980s, the company felt its
structure was undervaluing assets because the main holding company for
luxury goods, Luxco, was unquoted.
From 1989, Mr Johann Rupert looked at setting up a quoted luxury goods
company to own all of Cartier. But the whole of Cartier had been bought for
about Pounds 160m in 1984, since when the company's estimated value has
soared to more than Pounds 1bn. Selling Rothmans' 47 per cent stake in
Cartier would therefore incur heavy capital gains tax.
Instead, under the planned reorganisation, tax should be avoided, according
to Mr Clive Richardson at Henderson Crosthwaite. 'Richemont is not floating
off any businesses, it's just shifting its shareholdings within different
structures,' he said. However, he pointed out that the structure still needs
approval from the Inland Revenue.
Rothmans, as with other tobacco companies, generates large amounts of cash
and has a net pile of about Pounds 1bn. Divorced from luxury goods, the new
tobacco company will be free to concentrate on developing its own
businesses. One analyst suggested that Rothmans had enough problems of its
own without having to worry about Dunhill's as well.
After losing market share in its important market of Europe in the 1980s,
Rothmans has concentrated on improving its margins through cost cutting. It
has also devised a strategy, under management installed by Mr Rupert, which
simplified its operations into four geographical regions, rather than a host
of semi-autonomous country managers.
But growth in cigarette volumes will come from new markets like China and
eastern Europe. In Asia, Rothmans' main weakness is that its brands are
Virginian rather than 'American'. To compete with brands like Philip
Morris's Marlboro, analysts argue that Rothmans faces an uphill and very
expensive struggle building brands.
Rothmans' dividend policy, constrained by advance corporation tax problems
in the past, may also be relaxed. The new tobacco and luxury goods companies
will be structured as twinned UK and non-UK holding companies. This is
partly designed to shelter Richemont and other overseas shareholders from UK
taxes, and is a similar structure to that employed by Reed International and
Elsevier, the UK and Dutch publishing groups which merged on January 1. That
merger enabled money to be remitted to Dutch shareholders without incurring
any ACT.
The new luxury goods company will combine some of the most glamorous
European brand names, including watches and fashion products made by
Cartier, Montblanc pens and Karl Lagerfeld, the designer.
There will be some immediate advantages - from cross marketing, for example.
In the past Dunhill used its strong position in Japan to improve Montblanc's
visibility. But the two parts of the group are also very different. Dunhill
mainly sub-contracts its manufacturing, its products are largely male
orientated, its operations are largely UK based, and its management -
including chairman Lord Douro, the future ninth Duke of Wellington - is
rather British.
In contrast, the companies within Luxco manufacture their own products,
which are largely female orientated. Their management style, and product
sales, are very European. 'One imagines there will be a hell of a culture
clash,' an analyst said.
Rothmans and Dunhill said on Tuesday they intend to distribute to
shareholders cash resources 'considered surplus' to the needs of the new
companies. Analysts estimated Rothmans had more than Pounds 300m cash
available for distribution, while Dunhill had net cash of Pounds 120m at its
March year-end. That would imply a cash distribution of 60p a share for
Rothmans and 80p for Dunhill.
If all this cash were distributed, Richemont would receive about Pounds
200m. The timing would be fortunate. The company is next year due to repay
Pounds 612m of borrowings taken on in 1989 to buy out Philip Morris's
minority stake in Rothmans.

FT  24 JUN 93 / LSE to look closely at dealings in Rothmans'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange will look closely at Tuesday afternoon's dealings
in Rothmans' shares.  The price started rising rapidly in mid afternoon,
prompting a holding statement that talks were under way.  By the time the
exchange had agreed with the various companies' financial advisers that
shares in Rothmans and Dunhill should be suspended, the market was closed
and the suspension cames into force yesterday morning.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Greenalls bids to expand its pub chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENALLS, the UK pubs and hotels group, yesterday made an agreed Pounds
214.3m offer for JA Devenish, the west country pubs group. The combination
would be one of the UK's biggest independent pub chains with an estate of
more than 2,000 outlets.
The offer comprises one Greenalls share and 394.5p nominal of convertible
bonds for every two Devenish shares. There is a cash alternative of 356.5p
per share.
The surprise move outflanked rival pubs group, Boddington, which had been
considering another offer for Devenish after an unsuccessful Pounds 120m
hostile bid two years ago. Boddington said it would accept the cash offer
for the 19.2 per cent stake it had acquired in Devenish. It will emerge with
a profit of about Pounds 15m on its holding.
Mr Michael Cannon, chairman, and other board and family interests, have
given irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer for their 26.4 per cent
stake.
Mr Cannon and his family will collect Pounds 26m. The Devenish chairman
started in the business with a Pounds 30,000 investment in one Bristol pub
in 1976. He later formed Inn Leisure, a small pub chain, floated it on the
unlisted securities market in 1982, and reversed into Devenish in 1986.
Whitbread Investment Company, which in 1991 backed the Boddington bid,
remains a Devenish shareholder with a stake of about 11 per cent.
Greenalls shares, reflecting analysts' views that its offer was generously
pitched at 21 times historic earnings, closed 28p lower yesterday at 358p.
Devenish added 85p to 367p; and Boddington gained 13p to 286p.
Mr Andrew Thomas, Greenalls chairman and chief executive, said: 'The
acquisition will strengthen the group's market position and provide it with
additional purchasing power, an increasingly important factor in negotiating
beer supplies from national brewers.'
Greenalls would gain greater geographical spread from the deal. Its 1,450
pubs, many of them specialist food outlets, are concentrated mainly in
north-west England and the Midlands. The Devenish estate of 550 pubs - 115
of them leased from Whitbread, the brewer - is largely based in the
south-west.
Greenalls pubs made operating profits last year of Pounds 56m; Devenish
reported 1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.2m.

FT  24 JUN 93 / BP nears complete withdrawal from nutrition with Dollars
425m sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum has sold Purina Mills, the largest supplier of animal
feeds in the US, to a management group for Dollars 425m (Pounds 289m) in a
move that almost completes BP's departure from the nutrition business.
The company has also sold its chain of petrol stations in Sweden and a stake
in the Swedish petroleum storage company, ODAB, to Statoil, the Norwegian
state oil company, for a price estimated by Swedish analysts to be Dollars
160m.
The sale of the 240 Swedish petrol stations marks BP's exit from
Scandinavian retail petrol sales and is in line with the company's strategy
of quitting petrol markets where it has not achieved a significant market
share.
BP has already made Dollars 1.5bn of disposals since January and these two
sales mean it has reached its target of selling close to Dollars 2bn of
assets in the full 12 months to reduce net debt, which stood at Pounds 9.3bn
in March. 'These sales will lead to a very definite improvement in BP's
balance sheet,' said Mr Nick Antill, industry analyst at Hoare Govett, the
UK stockbrokers.
BP is commited to continuing its divestment policy to the tune of around
Dollars 2bn next year as well, a move which will reduce its debt-to-equity
ratio to around 70 per cent from almost 100 per cent at the end of last
year.
The sale of the Missouri-based Purina Mills brings the proceeds from BP
Nutrition divestments to Dollars 1bn. The company announced it would sell
the division about 18 months ago and has now sold the largest parts of the
business. It is also in negotiations over the sale of its pet foods
business.
Five businesses remain in BP Nutrition, including: European seed and animal
products, fish-farming, grain trading, animal breeding and pre-mixed animal
feeds. The sale of Purina Mills was financed by the Sterling group, a
private financial organisation based in Houston.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Norweb warns of a 'dividend race'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWEB, the Manchester-based electricity company, yesterday criticised other
power companies for starting what it called a dividend race.
Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, warned that the increases would attract the
attention of Offer, the industry regulator.
The company outlined its stance as it unveiled a 13 per cent dividend
increase for 1992, the smallest rise granted by a regional electricity
company this results season, but way above the stock market average and more
than Norweb wanted to pay.
High dividend rises in the sector - 14 per cent at East Midlands, 15 per
cent at Manweb and South Wales Electricity - have fuelled the political
debate over whether the privatised companies make excessive profits.
Previously Norweb had one of the most bullish dividends policies, saying it
expected to make annual increases of 6 to 8 per cent in real terms for the
rest of the decade. However, Mr Harvey said: 'We have moved close to the
pack because it would have harmed the company otherwise.
'Every company reporting so far has claimed there is no dividend race but it
is difficult to come to any other conclusion. The regulator cannot just
stand aside and watch if companies pay rises of above 16 per cent as they
may yet do.'
Professor Stephen Littlechild, Offer director general, is likely to tell the
regional companies the results of his supply review shortly after the last
of them reports on July 6.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Charter Consolidated buys its independence for Pounds 236m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARTER Consolidated, the UK industrial group, has finally achieved its
long-held goal of gaining independence from Anglo American Corporation, the
South African mining group.
It will obtain this through buying out the 36 per cent stake held by
Minorco, Anglo American's Luxembourg-based investment company.
Minorco is selling the stake for a loan note worth Pounds 235.5m, equivalent
to 622p per share, a 1.9 per cent discount to Tuesday's mid-market price.
Charter Consolidated shares closed 14p higher at 648p.
Charter was able to fund the purchase from the Pounds 342m proceeds of its
sale in February of a 38.3 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey, the world's
biggest platinum marketing group, which is also part of the 'family' of
companies perceived to be influenced or controlled by Anglo American.
Mr Jeff Herbert, Charter's managing director, said Charter's development as
an international industrial group would be improved if there were no
dominant shareholder. 'These proposals will truly establish Charter as an
independent, industrial company which we will grow through acquisition and
disciplined management. It is a logical step, following the sale of our
stake in Johnson Matthey, and it will enhance earnings,' he said.
After buying out Minorco, Charter, which yesterday reported an 11 per cent
increase in annual operating profits to Pounds 31.3m, will have net cash of
about Pounds 200m.
The remaining Charter Consolidated shareholders will be issued with new
shares, on a one-for-one basis, in a new holding company, Charter plc, which
will listed in London and Johannesburg.
Charter Consolidated said the change would benefit earnings per share both
in the current year and the longer term. Shareholders in the new company
would have proportionately increased interests in the group's existing
businesses.
About 14 per cent of Charter's shares would be owned by South Africans after
the relisting. Mr Herbert was confident they would continue to support the
stock, because Charter would offer the only 'rand hedge' stock on the
Johannesburg exchange which was independent of other South African groups.

FT  24 JUN 93 / UK and US react angrily to annulment of Nigerian election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABUJA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S political crisis deepened last night as Britain and the US
responded angrily to General Ibrahim Babangida's decision to annul the
presidential poll held earlier this month.
The move, announced by Nigeria's military ruler yesterday morning, makes the
promised August 27 handover to civilian rule most unlikely and has left the
country in a political limbo.
Strongly worded statements from the Foreign Office and State Department made
clear that London and Washington have lost patience with Gen Babangida, who
has put back the handover date on three previous occasions.
The US described his move as 'outrageous' given that the elections were
considered 'free from any serious irregularities'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said the decision was 'bound to have
serious implications for Nigeria's relations with the international
community and the UK will have no option but to reassess its own bilateral
relations with that country'.
Gen Babangida's action is likely to have caused a loss of support for
Nigeria's efforts to reschedule its Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) external
debt, and the country's already grave economic plight is likely to
deteriorate.
Gen Babangida did not disclose the government's next move, but he is
expected to broadcast his plans to the nation later this week.
There was no official reaction from the Social Democratic party (SDP) or its
candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola, who is generally acknowledged to have beaten
his rival, Mr Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention (NRC), by a
clear majority in the poll on June 12.
The SDP's supporters in their Yoruba stronghold in the south-west will be
especially upset. Power has resided in the mainly Moslem and Hausa-dominated
north of Nigeria for most of its 33 years of independence and many
Christians and southerners - the driving force of the economy - saw the
polls as their chance to move the balance of power.
Gen Babangida's motives remain obscure, but many Nigerians believe he never
intended to stand down. The statement from his office says that the decision
was made 'to preserve the honour and esteem of the judicial system', which
ended last week in confusion.
A shadowy group calling itself the Association for a Better Nigeria, which
called on Gen Babangida to stay in office until 1997, won a court order last
week that halted counting. The chairman of the electoral commission
initially invoked a decree that made it possible to override the judiciary
in the election process.
But in an about-turn last Wednesday, the chairman accepted the court's
ruling, which had been contradicted in two other federal courts, and refused
to announce the winner.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Serbs and Croats outline Bosnia plan: Call for three ethnic
states to be linked by confederal government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of Serbia and Croatia yesterday submitted to members of Bosnia's
collective presidency their new plan to divide Bosnia into three ethnic
mini-states linked by a weak confederal government.
But Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, said President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia and Mr Franjo Tudjman, his Croatian counterpart, were
disappointingly vague about territorial boundaries.
'They rather disappointed us in terms of not coming up with anything very
specific on the map,' Lord Owen said, adding: 'But maybe that's a good idea
because some of the things we heard, we didn't like.'
In Paris, meanwhile, France said it would send 1,200-1,300 more troops to
the Sarajevo region to back up the EC pledge at the Copenhagen summit to
protect Bosnian Moslems.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said in Geneva that the Serbs were
ready to give up their stranglehold on Sarajevo in return for Moslem
enclaves in eastern Bosnia. 'We are ready to hand over the city proper to
the Moslems in return for very small towns like Srebrenica and Zepa,' he
told reporters.
But this seemed to contradict Mr Karadzic's earlier statement that Serbs
would keep part of Sarajevo. It also contradicted reports that Lord Owen and
his fellow international mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, were pressing
for Moslem enclaves such as Srebrenica, Gorazde and Zepa to be guaranteed
access to a river.
Sketchy details from the talks indicate Serbia and Croatia want to divide
Bosnia into five regions, with the Serbs having one contiguous area, and
Croats and Moslems two each. Moslems would have control of the Bihac pocket
in north-west Bosnia and an undefined area stretching north from Sarajevo.
The Croats are claiming much of the south-west and possibly an area in
northern Bosnia next to Croatia.
Further talks are expected to continue today. Yesterday's talks involved
seven of the nine-member Bosnian collective presidency. They amounted to a
rebuff for Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the intransigent Bosnian president, and his
deputy Mr Ejup Ganic, who both refused to go to Geneva.
Mr Izetbegovic argues that the presidency, which includes moderate Serbs and
Croats as well as Moslems, has no mandate to negotiate the division of
Bosnia on ethnic lines. Mr Fikret Abdic, an emerging rival to Mr
Izetbegovic, was the only Moslem at yesterday's talks.
In Sarajevo, Mr Izetbegovic said he believed force was the best way to
resolve the Bosnian crisis. 'Of course political solutions should be sought,
but after nearly 15 months of aggression we do think that force can only be
met by force,' he said.

FT  24 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Rothmans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rumpus surrounding the leaking of Richemont's restructuring plans raises
the vexed issue of when shares should be suspended. The general principle
must be that it is best avoided. Owners of suspended shares, such as Queens
Moat, can be locked in for months. A clearing price of any kind at least
enables them to release their capital.
But there are exceptions. Richemont's restructuring proposals were complex
and it was questionable whether they would go ahead. When they leaked into
the market, the Stock Exchange was asked to suspend the shares of Rothmans
and Dunhill, the two quoted companies involved. But while this was being
considered, Richemont released a statement outlining its demerger plans.
Astonishingly, given the suspension request, the Stock Exchange did not
approve the content in advance. It subsequently considered the statement
lacked clarity. After the flurry in the shares of both Rothmans and Dunhill,
it eventually agreed a suspension.
The onus is now on Richemont promptly to produce its full plans enabling the
two shares to be traded again. What disturbs, though, is the conspicuous
lack of co-ordination. The Stock Exchange liaised with Rothmans'
stockbrokers. The Takeover Panel dealt with its financial advisers.
Communications between them were clearly unsatisfactory. The Stock Exchange
would have done best to suspend the shares at the time of the announcement.
Such confusion and delay does it little credit.

FT  24 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Ferruzzi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison must be causing sweaty palms among
foreign banks which lent to the crumbling empire. But the episode looks less
damaging to Italy's reputation than the collapse of Efim last year, which
called into question the value of an Italian government guarantee. Ferruzzi
appears to be a cut-and-dried case of private sector mis-management, albeit
on a grand scale. In that case, other Italian companies should not find
themselves frozen out of the loans market. Nor should the government's
tentative return to the international bond market be jeopardised.
The caveat is that structural damage to the Italian banking system would
undermine both private and public sectors. The credit rating agencies are
not unduly worried. But until the full exposures of Banca Commerciale
Italiana, Credito Italiano and their peers are known, nothing can be taken
for granted. Even if an orderly work-out of Ferruzzi's L31,000bn debt can be
agreed, the affair raises questions about the management controls applied by
Italian banks, particularly during the lending boom of the past three years.
That will be an obstacle to the early privatisation of state-owned
institutions.
There is also a need for all the lending banks to be treated on equal terms.
Negotiations so far centre on a small huddle of lenders led by Mediobanca.
Foreign bankers will be as unforgiving as the stock market of a solution
which is seen to favour narrow self-interest.

FT  24 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Greenalls/Devenish
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks like drinks all round on Boddington, the pub retailer which tried
and failed to acquire Devenish two years ago. Devenish has now succumbed to
the Greenalls Group, but not without extracting a high price for its
shareholders. One of these is Boddington, which earns a profit of some
Pounds 13m on the 20 per cent stake it acquired at the time of its original
bid. Greenalls argues that it has gained critical mass in pub retailing.
Even if it is right that additional size matters, the benefits may prove
elusive.
Greenalls presumably felt a high price was necessary to pre-empt a counter
bid from Boddington. It is paying a historic multiple of 21, not much higher
than that of 17 attached to Boddington's earlier offer, which came close to
succeeding. Yet Devenish has since carried out much of the rationalisation
which made Boddington's price worth considering. Greenalls will now have to
rely mainly on synergy advantages. By dressing up its offer to include a
convertible bond, it has disguised what promises to be a mildly dilutive
effect.
Long-term supply agreements on both sides will limit the combined companies'
ability to squeeze price reductions out of the brewers. Indeed, it is
doubtful whether the addition of Devenish's throughput would make much
difference to Greenalls' purchasing clout anyway. Boddington, which could
easily have fallen into the same trap, thus appears to be doing the right
thing by opting for cash - especially since, having enfranchised its outside
shareholders, Greenalls has developed an unhealthy penchant for using its
new freedom to issue shares.

FT  24 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: A buyer's Charter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charter's disentanglement from Minorco leaves it free to pursue life as an
independent company. Without the spice of the South African connection,
though, the prospects for its diverse collection of engineering, mining and
building products interests look pedestrian. Charter's shares have kept pace
with the market in recent years, but largely due to the rising value of its
stake in Johnson Matthey. Since that holding - which accounted for around
half Charter's market value - was disposed of in February, it has notably
underperformed.
With Pounds 200m in the bank after buying back Minorco's stake, and a
balance sheet almost free of debt, Charter will doubtless look to add to its
empire. An acquisition for cash to complement its railway equipment
business, for example, would make strategic sense and improve earnings. But
once the cash pile is exhausted, Charter will find the going tough. Its
continuing business might be expected to trade on a price-earnings ratio a
shade below the market average. Unless that can be remedied, using paper to
fund acquisitions will be far from easy.
A further question is whether more seasoned conglomerates might take a shine
to Charter now the Minorco stake has gone. Hanson might value its interests
in US coal; railway equipment looks like a classic business for BTR;
Williams Holdings fancies its chances in building products and fire
prevention. Whether it is predator or prey, Charter will feel the pressure
to sustain a rating well up with the market average.

Motivation theory suggests CBI director general Howard Davies should respond

got from Thatcherite ministers, he's handing out a bit of same in return.
Witness his punchline after telling a Birmingham dinner party how, before
the Copenhagen summit, he and other business leaders had met Helmut Kohl:
'We'd seen John Major as well, of course, but we thought it better to see

Still on the subject of trappings of power, could it be that George will
also scrap the customary deputy-governor's committee meeting on Wednesday
afternoons?
Set up in Sir Kit McMahon's day as deputy-governor, the committee brings
together Threadneedle Street's top wallahs for private chats. But given the
new boy status of the incoming deputy, ex-Economist editor Rupert
Pennant-Rea, it wouldn't be a great surprise if the meetings where quietly
dropped.
True, that would remove one of Pennant-Rea's marks of status. But he
evidently means to compensate. He has already made it clear that on the
frequent occasions the Governor has to be away, it will be the
deputy-governor who runs the place.

More bad news for Rolls-Royce, motor-makers to the top-drawer. One of their
most valued corporate customers is trading down to a Jaguar. Observer
understands that Eddie George, taking over as Bank of England Governor next
week, has spurned the Roller that traditionally goes with the job.
Given that the cost of a new Rolls-Royce can range up to Pounds 167,000 in
the case of the Corniche convertible, his decision to stick with his old Jag
is a further sign that Britain's number one inflation fighter means
business. After all, he has already agreed to freeze his salary for five
years.
What's next for the chop, one wonders. Afternoon tea, perhaps?

Everything's 'new' under the rising sun with the fragmentation of Japan's
ruling Liberal Democrats prompting breakaway politicians to set up parties
of their own.
Earlier this week came the New Harbinger Party, and yesterday leading rebel
Tsutomu Hata brought the New Birth Party into the world. Or, at least, that
title is one possible translation of the party's homeland name Shinseito.
Thanks to the variable meanings of the constituent Japanese characters, it
could equally be rendered as the New Raw Party - exposing it to jibes that,
in contrast to the New Deal given to the US by Roosevelt, Hata is offering
his country the Raw Deal.
If Japanese-literate readers can come up with alternatives free of such
hostages to fortune, Observer will reward the best with a bottle of malt
whisky.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Observer: Chip off the old block

<TEXT>
Noting that top people in their field are referred to as 'the writer's
writer' and so on, an ambitious character in a novel by William Faulkner set
out to become 'the son-of-a-bitch's son-of-a-bitch'.
By the same token, the European Commission can have few rivals for the title
of 'the bureaucrat's bureaucracy'. It is certainly proving a worthy
successor to the labyrinthine former Soviet Union, not least in its handling
of attempts to help Russia to set up a proper stock market.
A blueprint - ironically including proposals to stop foreign aid from being
wasted by do-gooding agencies - was completed by consultants Garside Miller
and solicitors Norton Rose last November. The EC got around to approving it
in March but, although the report is keenly awaited by numerous outfits
working to develop the stock exchange system, the Commission has since
refused to make the document available.
True, Garside Miller thought it had made a breakthrough when it recently won
permission to release a single copy to the FT, plus the addresses of two of
the EC's branches which could distribute more. One was its co-ordination
unit in Moscow, which responded with uncharacteristic haste.
Why had its address been listed?, it demanded of the FT over the phone.
Then, on being told permission came from Brussels, it snapped: 'This has not
been approved by the Commission', and hung up.
Callers approaching it for copies have been given the same message, and told
to try again in 10 weeks - by which time the the weed-like growth of stock
exchanges in Russia may have gone too far for the blueprint to be of use. No
wonder Russia's finance minister has moaned about too much western aid going
into 'reports that never get read'.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Families under pressure: Italy's big companies are being
forced to undergo rapid change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectacular collapse of the Ferruzzi empire marks a turning point in the
evolution of Italy's big family companies.
It has turned a cruel spotlight on the running of large family groups,
making them appear an endangered species. The Ferruzzi affair is a warning
that, unless these large groups undergo a sea change in management attitudes
and business practices, they may not survive in their present form.
There are only a handful of families with companies in the big league - the
Agnellis at Fiat, Pirelli, Berlusconi's Fininvest and De Benedetti's
Olivetti. Arguably Ferruzzi has been the slowest to adapt to fast-changing
economic conditions. Olivetti and Pirelli have been forced to restructure;
Fiat is now aware of the challenges even if not the answers; Silvio
Berlusconi seems ready to pull in his horns and look for outside
shareholders.
But the reasons for Ferruzzi's serious difficulties are not exclusive to the
group, and the lessons are more general. The Ferruzzi family's fate raises
questions of company size rather than the durability of Italian capitalists.
It is not that Italians are poor entrepreneurs - there is a mass of
literature on how small businessmen have produced and sold the right
products. And Italy is home to the oldest industrial company in the world,
Beretta. Just as the banks were moving in to take over Ferruzzi, Mr Guiseppe
Beretta died, aged 87, heir to the small arms manufacturer which was making
swords under that name when Columbus discovered America.
One problem is that in the passage from small to large company the habits
and mentality of running a small operation continue to be applied -
paternalism, mistrust of outsiders, loyalty to family, short-term borrowing.
When companies reach a certain size, some owners' ambitions seem to be
influenced by an irresistible desire to imitate the Medicis or Viscontis of
old. Did the Ferruzzis need to possess the most expensive basketball players
in Europe? Did they need a newspaper, Rome's Il Messaggero, or a television
channel. Was it necessary to spend L150bn (Pounds 66m) sponsoring a
challenge in the America's Cup?
On balance-sheet and business considerations, No. But, when judged against
Ferruzzi's peers and public image, it was natural. The Agnellis, De
Benedetti and Berlusconi all have substantial media interests. Agnelli owns
Juventus football team, and Berlusconi has Milan. This suggests that a
traditional part of running a big company in Italy includes the cost - and
the distraction - of playing a protagonistic role in society and politics.
Few are keen to risk getting on the wrong side of large companies, given
their mix of political connections and media control. The result is that
these companies' problems are sometimes understated or glossed over. Comment
in annual reports often amounts to self-aggrandisement.
A second important trap for family-run companies, as they have grown, has
been their control of management. Usually, family attention to company
affairs is episodic, and often distracts professional managers. The
managers, in turn, often lack proper authority and are sometimes afraid to
report accurately up the chain of command. Alternatively, in a group such as
Fiat, top professional management has power but middle management has little
delegated responsibility. When things go wrong, the corrective mechanisms
are often inadequate.
The Ferruzzi family, now in the second generation, had been ambivalent on
whether it wanted merely to own the group or manage it as well. Mr Raul
Gardini (married to one of the three Ferruzzi sisters) ran the group for 12
years and gave it its current shape; but he left in a row in 1991. The
family then chose a professional manager, Mr Giuseppe Garafono (now wanted
on corruption charges), later opting to run things themselves with
questionable managerial back-up.
The Ferruzzi family's difficulties come as both the rules of business and
the climate in which it operates are changing fast. The frequently
incestuous link between businessmen and politicians that ensured protection
and mutual favours, and which many big private sector companies exploited,
is being eroded by the wave of corruption scandals.
Arguably, Ferruzzi could hush things up or avoid humiliations in the past
because the politicians could be relied upon - in some instances at least -
to exert the necessary pressure. It would have been unthinkable a year ago
that Milan magistrates would step in and warn the stock exchange, the
rescuing banks and the Ferruzzi family that they had better be on their best
behaviour.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Peace talks over Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bosnia peace proposals put forward in Geneva yesterday by the presidents
of Serbia and Croatia are a far cry from the principles embodies in the
Vance-Owen peace plan. Instead of a unitary state grouping 10
quasi-autonomous provinces, the plan advocated by Bosnia's neighbours would
produce a confederal state of three ethnically-based republics for each of
the warring communities, Serb, Croat and Moslem. This is an unhappy
solution. But the violence of this inter-ethnic war makes it difficult to
believe that the three communities can live in peace without some degree of
separation. Since even Lord Owen concedes that his original plan is probably
no longer feasible, the essential priority now is to press any opportunity
of a genuinely negotiated settlement which has a reasonable chance of
bringing an end to the fighting.
The key question of principle which will confront these negotiations will be
the relationship of Bosnia's constituent parts. The foundation of the
Vance-Owen plan was that Bosnia-Herzegovina should remain a unitary state,
so as to prevent it becoming a victim of expansion by Serbia and Croatia.
But it is no longer obvious, in today's circumstances, that the unitary
integrity of Bosnia as a centrally-governed country should be the absolute
priority governing these negotiations.
Moslem demands
The Moslem community will undoubtedly continue to demand a sovereign state
within existing borders. And that is what the outside world will demand as
well, since Bosnia has been recognised as an independent state. As Lord Owen
pointed out yesterday: 'There has been a lot of loose talk about partition.
That is not acceptable to the international community.'
Fortunately, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has
accepted this principle. He said yesterday in Geneva that he would prefer
three separate states, 'but if the international community wants us to stay
together, then it should be a confederation'.
But while it is an important matter of principle that the international
community should not accept a three-way settlement which is merely the
ante-chamber to partition and partial annexation by Serbia and Croatia, the
top priority is an arrangement which has a reasonable chance of providing
some peace and stability. These negotiations cannot avoid in some measure
being seen as offering rewards for the brutality of ethnic cleansing, but
any settlement must take due account of the facts of inter-ethnic civil war.
This may mean a relatively loose relationship between the constituent parts.
The over-riding requirement is that any negotiated settlement should provide
some promise of peace and security for the Moslems; none of the three
communities is an innocent by-stander, but in essence this has been a civil
war of territorial expansion by the Serbs and the Croats, at the expense of
the Moslems, and it is their security which must be safeguarded.
Serb conquests
It is not yet clear whether the proposals from the Serbs and the Croats can
be the starting point for a reasonable negotiation. The facts on the ground
are that the Serbs have effectively conquered over 70 per cent of the
territory. If the Moslems are to have the makings of a viable share of
Bosnia, the Serbs will have to surrender much of the ground they have
captured. Mr Karadzic claimed yesterday that, under the Serb-Croat plan, the
Moslems would be getting 'the best part of the country - over 30 per cent of
the territory'. But the devil will be in the details, and it will not be
easy to delimit a territory which is economically viable and self-contained,
and which commands reasonable and secure access to the outside world.
These negotiations will depend critically on continued pressure from the
outside world, starting with the European Community. On Tuesday the EC
summit in Copenhagen rightly resisted calls for a lifting of the arms
embargo. But it must now carry through with its declared intention to
provide extra troops to secure the Moslem safe havens. France yesterday
undertook to provide 800 more troops. Other European partners should follow
suit.

FT  24 JUN 93 / On a diet after an eating binge: Relentless expansion
triggered a cash crisis at Ferruzzi, but will the rescue plan work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wall of television screens across one side of Ferruzzi's Ravenna
headquarters has stopped responding to the instructions of the tourists it
is meant to serve. Instead of providing visitor information on the former
capital of the western Byzantine empire, the touch-sensitive screens are out
of control, flashing up a series of random facts and images.
In some ways their behaviour reflects the crisis at Ferruzzi itself. Italy's
second-biggest private company has grown feverishly since the mid-1980s
through ambitious takeovers. But increasingly, the relentless expansion
appeared to be proceeding without direction, triggering the group's cash
crisis.
It is now up to Ferruzzi's bankers, which have lent it almost L31,000bn
(Pounds 13.7bn), to take control at the request of management and the
Ferruzzi family. As a first step, Mr Guido Rossi and Mr Enrico Bondi have
been appointed as chairman and chief executive of the two main Ferruzzi
companies - Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the main holding, and Montedison,
its biggest industrial subsidiary.
The new management, which will be installed formally after Ferfin's and
Montedison's annual meetings later this month, will replace members of the
founding Ferruzzi family. The clan, headed by Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, son of
founder Mr Serafino Ferruzzi, and Mr Carlo Sama, married to one of the
founder's three daughters, has stepped down from active management and
handed over its controlling 48 per cent of Ferfin to the banks.
The company's overambitious growth was based on easy credit and buoyant
markets. A single, domineering figure was at the helm, (first Mr Serafino
Ferruzzi and later Mr Raul Gardini), while other talented managers were
spread thinly over a growing empire. Worse, Ferruzzi's complex structure
fostered opaque accounts and impeded bankers and shareholders in supervising
its dealings.
Such weaknesses were masked during the booming 1980s, when strong profits
created a mood of confidence. They emerged only when recession struck in the
1990s. Declining demand hit Ferruzzi's core chemicals business. Rising
interest rates accentuated the financial burdens on its cash flow.
Devaluation of the lira last September swelled the group's foreign debts in
lira terms. Although borrowing costs have eased in recent weeks, Ferruzzi's
financial position remains precarious. Ferfin lost L1,519bn last year, and
its earnings continue to be overshadowed by massive financial charges.
Plans for a rescue - shrouded in secrecy - are being masterminded by
Mediobanca, the merchant bank leading a committee of Ferruzzi's five biggest
bank creditors. Observers believe the proposals entail an urgent
acceleration in streamlining the group, a strategy belatedly put forward by
the Ferruzzi family.
Two years ago, Mr Sama announced Ferruzzi would turn its back on the
diversified acquisitions which have taken it into insurance, finance and
even broadcasting, in favour of its core agro-industrial, chemicals and
energy businesses. The aim was to cut borrowing costs and make the empire
more manageable. As a first step, Ferruzzi raised about L1,800bn by selling
its Erbamont pharmaceuticals subsidiary in March to Sweden's Procordia
group.
But the slimming process, which began in earnest only this year, was
sidetracked by family disputes (see below), delays in finding buyers in a
recession and a desire within the family to build an ever-bigger empire.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Party funding and the state
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TUESDAY'S ill-tempered debate in the Commons on Conservative party funding
presented the mother of parliaments in a poor light. The two leading parties
wrestled each other into the gutter over the issue, leaving the disenchanted
voter not much wiser about the ethics of the current arrangements. Yet
finding ways to finance political parties which do not expose them to
sectional pressures from backers is a problem which reaches well beyond
Westminster. Most democracies have struggled to ensure that parties are not
reliant for funds on business or special interest groups, without
conspicuous success.
In the UK, the Conservatives have been fending off accusations of handling
stolen money in the form of Pounds 440,000 donated by Mr Asil Nadir, the
disgraced tycoon. The party relies for much of its income on donations from
undisclosed sources, including overseas donors such as Mr John Latsis, the
Greek shipping tycoon, and two Hong Kong businessmen. These gifts give the
Conservatives a financial advantage in fighting elections, but also expose
the party to the charge that the donors are buying influence.
The Labour party is even more vulnerable to such charges. The trade unions
are fighting a fierce rearguard action to maintain their role in the party's
councils, backed by ill-disguised threats to cut off their contributions
which make up the bulk of Labour's income. The party also has its own
embarrassment in the support it received from the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
State funding
The opposition parties want state funding of parties to reduce what they see
as the Conservatives' unfair advantage. State finance would also reduce
party dependence on sectional interests, they say - the reason why most
European countries provide some form of public funding for political
parties.
However, public funding is far from foolproof in ending undesirable links
between parties, companies and special interest groups. Countries such as
Spain, Italy and France have all found that state finance does not stop
parties from becoming involved in dubious money-raising schemes. Even the
generous funding provided in Germany, the first European country to finance
parties publicly, has failed to stop over-close links between politicians
and companies. Providing state support appears to encourage political
parties to spend more rather than seek less from supporters.
And whatever the theoretical advantages of state funding for political
parties, public support for the idea is not strong. Opinion polls in the UK
reject it, for example, while an Italian referendum in April voted to end
it. The storm over the use of European parliament funds by Mr Jean-Marie Le
Pen's group of MEPs to pay for conferences in exotic locations will put
pressure on that form of public finance for party politics.
Political benefits
In practice, UK political parties already receive considerable support from
the state other than in general subventions. The opposition parties receive
help with their parliamentary expenses through the 'Short money' (named
after the minister who first negotiated it). Every MP can employ a
researcher at the public expense - a formidable policy resource if properly
co-ordinated. Parties benefit from free TV advertising, estimated by a
Hansard Society report to have been worth around Pounds 7m at the 1987
general election. There is also a free mailing to every voter and access to
publicly-owned premises for election meetings.
Such benefits in kind do much to ensure fair competition between the
parties, without undermining the UK tradition that parties are voluntary
bodies which should find their own funds. That does not, however, justify
the secrecy over the source of parties' income. Wealthy people, companies
and unions are fully entitled to make donations to the parties they support.
There may even be good reasons for wealthy overseas supporters to donate
large sums to UK political parties. But the source of party funds is a
matter of legitimate public concern to voters. Nothing less than prompt and
rigorous disclosure of donations over a modest limit will end the unhealthy
speculation that surrounds party funding in Britain.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Leave the green shoots alone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When an economy is at long last on the path of non-inflationary growth the
wisest course would be to leave well alone.
The worst act of folly would be to push interest rates down and tax rates
up, both of which have their advocates among the chancellor's forecasting
panel. Panicky and wrong-headed measures to tackle the notorious Pounds 50bn
public sector borrowing requirement would be worse than leaving it to be
eroded by recovery, and by the tax increases already put in place by Norman
Lamont before he was booted out at the prompting of the Tory party chairman
and chief whip.
It would have been astonishing if the extremely large reduction in UK
nominal short-term interest rates from 15 per cent to 10 per cent inside the
exchange rate mechanism and a further drop to 6 per cent outside it, had not
ultimately stimulated domestic spending. In spite of the prevailing
obsession with the debt overhang, interest payments have plunged as a
proportion of personal and corporate income.
Because they have been humiliated by too many earlier optimistic forecasts,
economic officials have been careful to downplay the strength of recovery.
But the evidence is pouring in, thick and fast, that for once growth is
faster than was expected. The most comprehensive indicator is real gross
domestic product, excluding the erratic oil sector. This was rising in the
first quarter at an annualised rate of almost 3 per cent - well above most
estimates of the growth of productive capacity.
In itself that could be erratic. But look at the most surprising indicator
of all, unemployment. Nearly all forecasters agreed it would continue to
rise for the first few months of recovery. Instead it has been dropping
since last January. This is too long a period to be explained away by
distortions such as end-year efforts by officials to get people off the
unemployment register.
The most popular explanation is that employers are now quicker to hire and
fire - which means that unemployment is now more of a coincident indicator.
This confirms the impression that output is rising faster than productive
capacity, and thus making inroads into unused resources both of capacity and
of labour.
The labour market turnround is occurring much earlier than after the last
recession, when output reached bottom in 1981, but unemployment did not turn
down until 1986. Another feature is that the recovery seems in part to be
export-led. This is remarkable, considering that the UK's principal
customers on the European continent are now moving into deep recession
themselves. There has been no comparable improvement in the balance of
payments, because after a devaluation import prices normally increase faster
than export prices. In any case we are back with a monster 'balancing item'
of unrecorded receipts.
In every upturn there will always be lagging sectors, where companies
'cannot see any recovery'. Even for the whole economy, we cannot rely on
present luck continuing quarter by quarter to the same extent. There could
well be periods of slower export growth, and thus slower overall growth.
Those who take the economic temperature every day will then no doubt join
those already urging the government to cut interest rates. But any resulting
sterling depreciation will risk stoking up inflation, and provoke beyond
endurance Britain's trading partners. The latter just about tolerated the 15
per cent devaluation of Black Wednesday, but would regard anything further
as beggar-my-neighbour policies with a vengeance.
On the external side, few realise quite how revolutionary the turnround in
UK competitiveness has been. British labour costs per unit of output have
been falling by some 2 to 3 per cent a year - due in equal measure to a
sharp slowdown in pay settlements and a rise in productivity.
On top of that has been what some regard as the bonus of devaluation. If you
look at the trade-weighted sterling index and not just at the D-Mark alone,
you will see that this has hardly been eroded in recent weeks. With luck
rather than foresight, the UK managed to devalue when there was a large
amount of slack in the economy, and domestic inflationary pressures were at
their lowest for decades.
There are always some mysteries about the British economy, The first mystery
now is: how much slack is there in the economy - or more accurately how far
is output below the equilibrium or sustainable rate? The second question is:
how rapid is the underlying trend rate of growth? (I suspect that it is
rather faster than the Treasury's estimate of 2 to 2 1/4 per cent a year.) A
third and related question is: how much of that Pounds 50bn deficit
represents recession? Fourth, how sensitive is the deficit to the business
cycle. These are not small questions.
If we take the common estimate that one third of the Budget deficit is
structural, this amounts to, say, Pounds 17bn. The sum is within the
Maastricht guideline of 3 per cent of GDP. But this is not the only way in
which the Pounds 50bn figure gives the wrong impression.
Letter after letter used to arrive saying that the Treasury did not know how
to run a whelk stall because it confused current and capital spending. Yet
since Norman Lamont promised to make this distinction in the November
Budget, there has not been a flicker of interest in the subject. Still, if
we take the distinction seriously the Treasury's attempt to separate the
capital from current spending - to which it is committed in the Budget due
in November - the current deficit comes down to about Pounds 30bn, or less,
as I stated on this page on May 27. If we put the cyclical and capital
spending corrections together the result is an adjusted current Budget
surplus.
If you want to criticise the Treasury for something, it is for the belief of
too many (although not all) of its high officials, that the UK is
under-taxed. This does not survive a second's scrutiny of the record. During
the 10 years of office of the supposedly anti-spending Thatcher government
from 1979 to 1989 the tax-burden rose from less than 35 per cent of GDP to
more than 37 per cent. The reduction of nearly 3 percentage points since
then is nearly all the result of recession. Taking national insurance and
consumer taxes properly into account, the marginal rate for most taxpayers
is still well above 50 per cent.
The last chancellor had to introduce phased tax increases, not because the
tax burden is too low, but because of discretionary increases in spending
which crept in when the government guard was down in the pre-election
period.
The main reason why Treasury officials itch to increase the tax burden has
nothing to do with wider political economy. It is because fundamental
'curbs' - rarely real cuts - have to be phased in a long way ahead to avoid
breaking previous commitments. Moreover, the effect of many expenditure
measures is difficult to quantify in advance. By contrast, under the British
apology for a constitution, the chancellor can get up and announce precise
tax changes which become law the same day, and with which Treasury computers
can get to grip.
Nevertheless if further tax increases are the best that the party which is
supposed to believe in holding down public spending can achieve, then the
long-term prospect is of handing more and more of the national income to the

'MERGER IN DAYLIGHT' By Damien Neven, Robin Nuttall and Paul Seabright
Centre for Economic Policy Research; Pounds 25/Dollars 37.50; 296 pages
The topic of mergers and takeovers is by its nature a contentious one. On
one view, mergers are a conspiracy against consumers and workers. On
another, they are a necessary response to a changing world. In reality, they
are very often both, which is why the competing claims need to be carefully
balanced.
In the EC, the argument goes further. Granted, the balancing is a job for
bureaucrats. But if subsidiarity means anything, why the devil should the
bureaucrats be in Brussels?
The question has a certain topical force. When the EC system of merger
regulation was set up almost three years ago, it was decreed that mergers
should be policed by Brussels - rather than by individual states - if the
resulting company would have sales of over Ecu5bn. It was also suggested
that the figure should be reduced to Ecu2bn in 1993. Mr Karel Van Miert, the
EC's competition commissioner, has until the end of this month to decide
whether to press ahead. Given that Germany, the UK and France seem flatly
opposed to further meddling, he is understandably leaving it a little late.
Then again, if he has read Merger in Daylight he may simply have decided not
to bother. The book - billed as the first independent review of the Brussels
merger regime - argues that size scarcely matters. This is because bigger
flaws in the system need to be addressed first.
Not that the book is anti-Brussels. The authors - three academic economists,
one French, two British - point out that when the system was set up, after
16 years of argument, there was deep disagreement on the likely results. One
school believed it would make mergers easier, since it would remove narrow
nationalistic barriers. Others believed it would make them harder, since the
EC appeared to have an ideological bias towards small and medium-sized firms
and against big ones.
The authors take the latter view, but on quite different grounds. The point
about the mergers now covered by Brussels is precisely that the companies
operate in a number of EC markets. In assessing such a merger, national
agencies such as the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission and Germany's
Bundeskartellamt will naturally put a higher value on the benefits to
domestic companies than on the damage to foreign markets, which they
probably could not measure. Thus, nationally based merger control is in such
cases both inaccurate - and hence economically expensive - and too tolerant
of market power.
When it comes to the flaws in the system, the argument is exhaustive.
Indeed, the lay reader should perhaps be warned that the book is aimed at
the professional, whether lawyer, economist or merchant banker. But perhaps
the most interesting objection has the widest implications - that the system
takes no explicit account of whether a merger will lead to greater economic
efficiency.
This takes us to the heart of an apparent ideological tension between two
powerful Brussels departments, those of competition and industry. In bald
terms, the argument runs as follows. The economic future of Europe, says the
industry commissioner Mr Martin Bangemann, depends on the international
competitiveness of its industry. The market against which European industry
must be measured is that of the world, not the EC. If the by-product of
creating world-class companies is allowing them to dominate the EC market,
so be it.
Under Sir Leon Brittan, Mr Van Miert's predecessor as competition
commissioner, this argument was stood on its head. The interests of the EC
consumer were paramount, and world domination took second place. Even for
Sir Leon, this may largely have been a matter of rhetoric. Mr Van Miert, a
man less given to precise formulations, takes a much more pragmatic line.
Thus, while the Commission is not supposed to give weight to questions of
industrial policy when ruling on mergers, it does so in practice. The
result, as the book points out, is an apparent inconsistency in some of the
Commission's published rulings. The findings of the bureaucrats point one
way, the decision of the politicians another.
In a particularly interesting experiment, the authors gave post-graduate
economics students copies of some reports with the conclusions left out, and
invited them to deduce from the internal arguments which way the ruling had
gone. In one contentious case, the merger of the German car component
manufacturers Bosch and Varta, every single student got it wrong.
The conclusion is obvious and sensible. If the Commission is going to take
industrial efficiency into account anyway, better do so formally in public
than intuitively behind closed doors. Other recommendations are equally
clear and closely argued. The bureaucrats should formally restrict
themselves to investigating proposed mergers, leaving the decision wholly to
the politicians. The haggling process by which companies modify the proposed
deal to get it allowed should be conducted in public, preferably with input
from competitors.
There is a perfectly good reason for the emphasis on transparency. The book
contains a striking survey of companies which had gone through the Brussels
process of merger scrutiny. The majority found the results satisfactory and
not too onerous. As the authors remark, it is not a good sign when the
poachers speak well of the gamekeepers. If anything, the system is letting
too many mergers through, chiefly because of a characteristically Brussels
penchant for compromise. If the rules were more clearly laid out and more
publicly applied, the European consumer, at any rate, might be better
served.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Letter: Minister defends science plans against 'caricature'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Sawers' article (Personal View, June 22) bears little
relationship to the Technology Foresight Programme or to the other policies
announced in the government's recent white paper. Mr Sawers claims the
government is adopting the methods of the central planner in relation to
government research expenditure. This is not the case. The purpose of
Technology Foresight is to bring together scientists and working
industrialists to share views about emerging generic technologies and market
opportunities. The results of the partnership will be a greater common
understanding of trends. Research councils will then be able to take
strategic decisions on their research portfolios, against the background of
the results of their programme. Individual firms and organisations will
decide for themselves what use they wish to make of the results.
Mr Sawers claims Technology Foresight usurps the role of the market economy.
But it is not concerned with the commercial exploitation of products, but
with generic technologies with wide applications across several sectors. It
is inherently unlikely that a technique introduced to the US by President
Reagan's administration would be inimical to the market.
Mr Sawers claims the government is sacrificing excellence in basic science
for utilitarian research. Not so. The research councils and Higher Education
Funding Councils will continue to look for excellence when allocating funds
for research. But no country can afford to fund all the basic research its
scientists would ideally like to undertake.
David Sawers describes technology foresight as a largely untried technique.
I doubt if colleagues in the US, Japan, Germany, France, the Netherlands,
and Australia would agree. These countries have found foresight useful in
helping them identify key generic technologies.
The government clearly has a majority role in funding basic research, where
the market will not necessarily supply what is needed. But circumstances can
arise in strategic or generic research where market forces do not work
satisfactorily and investments in research and development offering a good
return to the nation will not go ahead without some public support.
The policies set out in the white paper are far removed from those
caricatured in Mr Sawers' article. We accept the importance of basic
research, and the government's role as its main funder. There is nothing
prescriptive in the white paper - which has been widely welcomed - about the
emphasis on partnership between the science and engineering base and
industry. William Waldegrave,

FT  24 JUN 93 / Letter: Lloyd's reserves have been built up by shearing the
sheep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALFRED DOLL-STEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If J P Morgan and Marsh McLennan are planning to make significant
investments from their Dollars 1bn insurance fund in the Lloyd's market
('Dollars 1bn Morgan and Marsh fund will invest in Lloyd's', June 19), they
must think that despite the haemorrhage of cash that its Names are
suffering, Lloyd's is well-reserved. If so the source of these generous
reserves can only be that very haemorrhage. A proportion of the losses that
some Lloyd's syndicates are now reporting are no more than the counterpart
of the unearned dividends they declared in the early and mid-1980s to give a
false impression of profitability in order to suck in more Names. The
dividends were unearned because the syndicates were under-reserved. Had
reserves been debited to each year's revenue at prudent rates, then the true
position, that many syndicates had been trading unprofitably for years,
would have been revealed and there would have been no new members and an
exodus of existing ones.
By declaring swingeing losses now (using as 'cover' the well-publicised
catastrophe losses elsewhere in the market) these syndicates can build up
their reserves quickly by shearing the sheep who flocked to join or were
induced to stay by the illusory profits of the early and mid-1980s and who
are now resigning. In some cases the fleeces that they are leaving behind
consist of their homes and their life savings.
The magnitude of this build-up can be judged from the fact that at the end
of the 1987 year of account Lloyd's global reserves (measured by the
reinsurance to close the year) were Pounds 5.5bn; at the end of 1990, the
year that has just closed, the reserves had nearly doubled at Pounds
10.85bn. In 1990 itself on this measure the reserves grew by Pounds 1.75bn,
accounting for the largest part of the Pounds 2.9bn loss declared.
To the extent that these Names are recapitalising those syndicates with
their remaining assets it seems inequitable that the Lloyd's business plan
should make no provision to give them any benefit from it. By the same token
Lloyd's becomes all the more attractive to J P Morgan and Marsh McLennan.

Sir, John Major is doing Britain a big disservice in claiming low labour
on-costs are the route to competitiveness. Playing the poor relation is
totally against our interests. Your report on the analysis on world

FT  24 JUN 93 / Letter: Tinkering will not change how effectively the
Commission is run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms KATE JENKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lionel Barber is quite right to raise the issue of the way the
Commission is run ('The towering bureaucracy', June 21). His classic
solution - improve the quality of the people at the top - will not however
do the trick. In the past 30 years there have been many very able people
working in Brussels and the message from them has been almost universal: the
system prevents sensible and swift solutions to the issues facing Europe.
Anyone who has dealt with the Commission, at any level, and in its many
guises knows that there are fundamental problems, common to many
bureaucracies, of how work is done, who is responsible and what the
objectives are. It seems extraordinarily difficult to change the established
patterns of how things are done. And, of course, people tend to be too busy
with the immediate issue to look at the structural problem.
This is not a situation which will be put right by a few gestures, some
intelligent appointments and some high level training - however well
intentioned. A system designed for a smaller, simpler Commission is bound to
need some fundamental rethinking as the size and shape of the tasks change.
What is required is a planned, targeted and sustained approach to changing
working methods within the Commission. It will take time and determination.
It means changing how people work, not merely what they do - fewer rules,
more effective decision taking, a clearer sense of results and less concern
with processes.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Arts: Glyndebourne on the South Bank - Summer opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something rather odd is going on at the Royal Festival Hall. Glyndebourne,
heavily occupied with the building of its new theatre down in Sussex, is
this summer attempting to console patrons with three concert performances
each of three operas - Berlioz's Beatrice et Benedict and Fidelio this week,
The Merry Widow a month hence, all with (as usual) the London Philharmonic
Orchestra in attendance. The advertising and programme book have traded
liberally on the name of the festival. But what unfolded in the hall on
Monday and Tuesday evenings did so little credit thereto that I was tempted
to think I imagined the whole Glyndebourne connection myself.
Nothing wrong with the original idea. In the past, indeed, some of the most
rewarding examples of London operas-in-concert have derived from this
source. Glyndebourne visits to the Albert Hall Proms, with intelligently
potted versions of one of the season's productions, are justly prized. Even
in the less convivial surroundings of the Festival Hall I recall similar
triumphs: a few years ago Haitink's Nozze di Figaro company, having just
completed an EMI recording, gave so mercurial an account of the piece that
one was briefly moved to wonder why Mozart comic opera ever needed
theatrical rendition at all; and the 1991 Jenufa which brought together
Andrew Davis and three of his 1989 cast achieved a gut-wrenching summary of
what made that Janacek production great in the first place.
But all of those events sprang out of 'real' performances, reviving
live-wire ensembles already formed. The current choice of repertory - the
Berlioz opera has never been performed at the festival, the Beethoven not
for a decade - was not geared to striking such a re-creative spark.
Nevertheless, accurate casting and fine preparation might still have
achieved it. These are, after all, areas in which the festival is supposed
to demonstrate supreme expertise.
Alas, not much of that has been in evidence. Both casts have an 'all-purpose
international' look about them, with several principals previously unknown
in Sussex: the suspicion that they may have been tailored by suggestions
from EMI (who were rumoured to be recording all three shows) is doubtless
unworthy, but I cannot suppress it. Neither Andrew Davis's conducting of
Berlioz nor Roger Norrington's of Beethoven produced the impeccable,
'lived-in' orchestral playing that comes from long, purposeful rehearsal.
The reliance of the Berlioz cast on their scores was in some cases
worryingly intimate. But then, in artistic terms the whole evening veered at
times close to disaster. Berlioz's speech-song mixture can work very well in
concert (as in this hall Simon Rattle and Neville Marriner have already
proved), yet Glyndebourne has chosen to intersperse the numbers with a
narration of brain-numbing witlessness by John Wells, delivered by the
author himself in a uniquely embarrassing collection of schoolboy-comic
'funny voices'.
This cast a pall over the proceedings that only a company of Berlioz Titans
could have lifted. Andrew Davis is not that: too soft-edged. Neither - thus
far, at least - are Anne-Sofie von Otter and Jerry Hadley in the title roles
or Dawn Upshaw (Hero), though all three hinted at qualities to make one
optimistic about future development. Jean Rigby's Ursula showed her
experience and the sumptuous beauty of her mezzo. The guying of Somarone's
comic chorus by means of exaggeratedly bad tuning was shaming.
There was more life in the Fidelio. As we know from his Kent Opera
production, Norrington's conducting of it is original, energetic, exciting:
he seats the orchestra in correctly 'classical' figuration, and bright,
dramatically pertinent contributions from wind and brass were his (and our)
continual reward.
Unfortunately, his was not a view of the opera that sat comfortably on most
of the cast - routined, lacklustre heavyweights with (in some cases)
distinctly worn voices at their disposal. (The conductor was a late
replacement for Klaus Tennstedt, who had been forced by illness to withdraw
a few weeks ago.) Peter Seiffert's youthfully strong Florestan and the
appealing Marzelline and Jacquino of Barbara Bonney and John Mark Ainsley
were the exceptions to that disappointing general vocal rule.
Berlioz and Beethoven performances at Royal Festival Hall until Saturday;
Merry Widow July 18, 20, 22

FT  24 JUN 93 / Arts: Successful rustic intrigue at Garsington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR JACOBS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No, it is not quite another Glyndebourne, though the comparison inevitably
arises from the combination of opera with garden vistas and posh picnicking.
Garsington Opera, just outside Oxford, is a smaller enterprise, without the
heavy presence of corporate hospitality - and with less expensive and
therefore less lustrous casting. Spectators are seated almost in the open
air, with a tented overhang and a descant of bird song, and with the
stone-work of historic Garsington Manor forming the backdrop of the stage.
The new restaurant is decorated with wood panelling from the former
Glyndebourne theatre.
Garsington's surprising speciality is Haydn: following other operas in the
last two seasons, the current festival opened with L'infedelta delusa. It is
a triumph of modest yet clever opera production, thanks chiefly to the stage
direction by Anthony Besch: indeed, in 30 years of viewing Haydn operas, I
would rate this as the first to justify the composer as a master wholly in
command of his musical and comic material, rather than groping towards what
Mozart would achieve a decade or two later. A compliment to the librettist
Marco Coltellini would not be amiss.
With Peter Rice as scene designer, Besch's comic invention on stage falls
entirely within the opera's proper bounds. Even the serving and eating of a
three-course meal during the singing of a rapid duet - to the audience's
uproarious delight - follows on from the original stage direction. Vespina,
plainly a model for Despina in Mozart's Cosi fan tutte, is at the centre of
the rustic intrigue, dressing up in four differently absurd guises to bring
love, marriage and property into harmonious relationship. Claire Daniels was
mistress of this part and its impersonations, her thigh-slapping German
soldier helped by Sally Gilpin's choreography.
As Vespina's brother Nanni, David Mattinson was warm in character, rich in
voice; as Sandrini, in love with Nanni, Patricia Rozario added grace on
stage to her smallish but cultivated tone. Some roughness elsewhere arose
from Haydn's free use of very high and very low notes, but it was more
important that all the singing kept so well in character. The quietly alert
conducting of Wasfi Kani drew happily on the resources of the Guildhall
String Ensemble - which, with wind and percussion added, needs to change its
name.
Bilingual librettos being on sale and readable by daylight the decision to
perform Haydn in the original Italian was defensible. With Richard Strauss's
Ariadne auf Naxos, however, the language shipwrecked the comedy - especially
in the prologue, where the extensive role of the major-domo (Thomas Hemsley)
is entirely spoken and not sung. Far better to perform this prologue in
English even if the German is preferred for the opera proper. Damage was
also inflicted by the switch of the setting to a post-1900 period. Had
Strauss been confronted with that period, who could suppose that he would
have provided a score full of 18th-century musical pastiche?
Julie Gossage's voice sounded prematurely forced in the role of the Composer
in the Prologue, but Carol Smith had the true Strauss style as Ariadne,
though not quite sustaining the necessary force up to the end. The earthy
good-nature of Zerbinetta but not all the vocal brilliance of the part was
conveyed by Linda Kitchen. Aidan Crawley's direction helped to ease the
paralysis inherent in the last half-hour of the piece, and Ivor Bolton drew
expressive sonorities from the Glyndebourne Touring Opera Orchestra.

CLIFFHANGER (15) Renny Harlin
INNOCENT BLOOD (15) John Landis
THE OLD LADY WHO WALKED IN THE SEA (18) Laurent Heynemann
SOUTH CENTRAL (15) Steve Anderson
BORN YESTERDAY (PG) Loius Mandoki
Sylvester Stallone hanging from a precipice is a sight we have all longed to
see: possibly followed by a swift, dramatic demonstration of the laws of
gravity. What we would want to learn is this. Does the iconographic baggage
accumulated in a career playing serial Neanderthal folk-heroes - Rockys 1-5,
Rambos 1-3 - add significant weight to the plummeting victim?
Unfortunately Cliffhanger, having no interest in cultural science, allows
Sly to survive. And survive and survive: through an avalanche of plot
contrivances and lucky breaks as our rescue climber hero plays guerrilla
hide-and-seek with the villains who have aircrashed on a snowy Colorado
mountain with Dollars 3m in stolen Treasury loot. (How many monkeys working
at how many typewriters thought up that story premise?)
Stallone's girl (Janine Turner) helps him slosh through the deep-pile snow,
as well as ankle through caverns measureless to man and dangle from
Indiana-Jones-surplus rope bridges. And Stallone's longtime rival (Michael
Rooker), held hostage by the baddies, may use the occasion to get even with
the man who - we saw it in scene one before the 'X Years Later' caption -
once let Rooker's girl slip to her doom over a dodgy chasm.
The last time I met these characters was when they fell out of a cornflakes
packet. I was aged nine and I remember picking up the Intrepid Mountain
Guide (green plastic), his Friend (blue plastic), his Girl (yellow) and the
Wicked Fugitive From Justice (red). I then plotted their showdown on the
breakfast table. Tea pot equalled Mont Blanc; spilled sugar equalled
avalanche; sticky marmalade represented quagmire.
My plot was better than Stallone's, who co-scripted this twaddle with
Michael France. And my direction was more authoritative than Renny 'Die Hard
2' Harlin's, who flings action set-pieces at us with all the desperation of
a man trying to walk a semi-conscious overdose victim (us the audience)
around a room to keep him alive.
But the swelling snowdrift of questions keeps stalling emotional momentum.
Why do all the characters keep bumping into each other on this giant
mountain-top as if it was Time Square? Why does climber Stallone choose this
eminently resistible crisis to take himself out of semi-retirement? And why
does the villain (John Lithgow) speak with an unexplained English accent?
Perhaps Alan Rickman and Anthony Hopkins each turned the role down. The
British baddie has become a fixture in modern Hollywood and one sees why.
Maximum contrast being desired between hero and villain, the more gruntingly
primitive is the first, the more louchely cultivated must be the second.
While Sly and Arnie take the good guy ever further in the direction of
thicko-monosyllabic, suave Brits distil perfidy in the perfect epigram. The
world is set for a final Armageddon between action-man America and creepy,
cerebral old Europe.
Years ago Sylvester Stallone and director John Landis made a gangster comedy
called Oscar. It fizzled out at the box-office, causing commentators to
write the career obituaries of both men. But Hollywood celebrities never
die, they merely return in different shape. While Stallone comes back as a
mountain-climber, Landis is busy plumbing infernal depths in vampire-ridden
Pennsylvania.
Innocent Blood is a piquant idea for a Gothic comedy. Sexy French
bloodsucker Anne Parillaud bites Mafia capo Robert Loggia and soon the whole
of Pittsburgh's Italian quarter has turned into an exchange-and-mart for
bodily fluids. Add a romantic policeman (Anthony LaPaglia), an almost witty
script ('I was starved' voice-overs Parillaud; 'I thought, what about
Italian?') and Landis's best Gothic special effects since An American
Werewolf In London and it should go with a sanguinary swing.
Unfortunately it becomes lost in Michael Wolk's script as a stranger would
in a city with a power-cut. Peering through the benighted visuals, we seek
passers-by to ask direction. But all we get is Mlle Parillaud's thick French
accent, smothering the funny lines with glottal gaucherie; and cross-talk
scenes that begin with bright mimetic certainty before descending into
witless murk. The ghost of the once-gifted Landis waves to us with a few
good visual jokes - Christopher Lee's Dracula cross-cut with Dan Quayle on
late-night TV - but even he goes down finally in the engulfing night.
Jeanne Moreau in The Old Lady Who Walked In The Sea is a sight to behold.
Sporting dresses and hats that would cause blushes in a Fellini film, she
struts and flounces as a con-person concocting crimes in Guadaloupe and
points north. The face, with its downturned moue of a mouth and deepening
ravines, is a national monument turning into a national disaster area. And
the voice is a low contralto snarl, modulating from velvety caress (for Luc
Thuillier as the young scam artist she sets out to seduce) to broken-glass
bitchiness (for fellow Michel Serrault).
If Bette Davis had never existed, Jeanne Moreau would make up for the
deficiency. She is just about all we remember in this French caper about two
old scoundrels limbering up for a jewel heist, while a third young scoundrel
(Thuillier) must outwit them or be outwitted. Director Laurent Heynemann,
co-scripting with Dominque Roulet from a novel by San Antonio, seems
time-warped in some sub-Losey belle epoque: when chic sets and darling
locations were the corrupt icing on man's humanity to man, and great stars
were wheeled on to be beastly to each other.
The beastliness here is fair-to-good. So is the kinky eroticism. 'She's not
an ice cream, she's a Stradivarius]' cries Serrault - formerly chief
wrist-flapper in La Cage Aux Folles - before he takes over cunnilingual
duties on the blonde girl Thuillier is servicing on the living-room sofa.
But we have seen this epatant-le-bourgeois sexiness in French cinema before.
(Look under 'Blier, Bertrand.') It melts away by movie's end, leaving as
terra firma only the histrionic island of Docteur Moreau: a place where
strange experiments are made on the human form and voice, and where majestic
sounds can be heard of primal rage and spite and grandeur.
In the June release of South Central and Born Yesterday we recognise the
unmistakable silly season distribution policy: 'It's Wimbledon fortnight so
let us unload our rubbish on cinemas that will be three-quarters empty
anyway.' South Central resembles an escaped TV movie: 99 minutes of peaktime
moral improvement as an ex-gangland black (Glen Plummer) tries to hold his
head - and his young son's - above the flood of battle and bigotry in modern
Los Angeles. Steven Anderson wrote and directed this 'Clones N The Hood';
Oliver (JFK) Stone executive-produced; and each new scene brings a new
pietistic cliche.
In Born Yesterday, Disney raids the graves of star Judy Holliday, writer
Garson Kanin and director George Cukor to produce a danse macabre of the
none-too-grateful dead. Surely the old 1950 comedy, about a tough guy who
entrusted his dimwit moll to the educating talents of a journalist, was
funny? Here Melanie Griffith plays the high-fluting bimbo as if taking first
comedy lessons from a deceased Miss Holliday. And co-stars Don Johnson and
John Goodman seek similar necromantic inspiration from the late William
Holden and Broderick Crawford. As remakes go, this one fails to. Everything
is obsequiously carbon-copied; nothing lives.

Once upon a time alcohol and the common cold were famous as the horrors
visited by the white man upon the noble savages that he insisted upon
'civilising'. These days it is not so much the destruction of the shy
aborigine's liver or the challenge to his antibodies that we hear about, but
the undermining of his illusions. Under The Sun offers another example: the
dreams, rituals and myths of the Mehinacu, now only 125 strong, who live in
central Brazil, are said to be under threat from white man's knowledge (9.30
BBC2). Juris Podnieks was the cameraman/director who made the unforgettable
documentary series 'Hallo, Do You Hear Us?' about life in the Soviet Union
as it slid towards disintegration. In June last year, in what seems to have
been a genuine accident while scuba diving, the brave and talented Podnieks
 -who had so often stuck his camera in the most embarrassing places for the
state - was killed. C4's admirable commemorative season, Camera Of Courage
continues with 'Unfinished Business' which examines life after the collapse
of communism (9.35).

FT  24 JUN 93 / Arts: Tango Para Dos - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We know it takes two to tango. The torsos are glued together while the feet
go mad below, and the cutting rhythms of the band slice into the dance. Fake
passion and real bravura are the hall-marks of skill. The tango is a
fascinating expression of social and sexual attitudes, born in Buenos Aires
brothels, and tamed - relatively speaking - for the ball-room early in this
century. As performed by Argentinian artists it has an intensity and a
fervour that no other dancers can give it, and the memorable visit of Tango
Argentina a couple of years ago asserted how rich were its forms and its
potential in the theatre.
Sadler's Wells is now playing host to another troupe, Tango para Dos, rather
less sophisticated than Tango Argentina, and less polished, but at its best
still showing that combination of quick feelings and razor-edged footwork
that is so exhilarating to watch, and to dance. The show is devised by - and
features as its stars - Miguel Angel Zotto and Milena Plebs. There is a fine
tango orchestra, basic and unimaginative staging, a singer, and two other
dance couples. It aims to explore the tango's social history, and its
performers are adept.
Their steps have the bright flash and riposte of duelling - the tango can
look a dangerous encounter - and the orchestra whines and barks and charges
the movement with all the cheap emotion one could want. There is a brilliant
scene, inspired by a 1930s chanteuse who always appeared in men's clothes,
in which three couples, in fedoras and suits, dance, and one of the girls,
the beguiling Mora, also sings. (It is reminiscent of those naughty and
ambivalent botes photographed by Brassai, where the clientele's sexuality
was never quite what it seemed).
The evening, though, has a problem - the decision that we are to be treated
to a continuing homage to Carlos Gardel (1890-1935), a supreme tango singer,
and to Mr Zotto's willingness to 'realise' his songs, to mime to his
records, and to emulate his performances in films. This activity brings him
repeatedly on stage with patent leather hair and a broad and unrelenting
grin, in a series of laboured little numbers which may mean everything to a
Buenos Aires audience, but are bemusing to those of us not devotees of the
Argentinian cinema of the 1930s. (What would Buenos Aires make of the deadly
George Formby?)
Dressed as a gaucho, pour le sport, and in various other outfits, Mr Zotto
smiles interminably, and is very vital. Miss Plebs also appears with him,
once allegedly as Carmen Miranda, an attempt more probable as an
impersonation of Dame Barbara Cartland. There is something ineffably
amateurish about all this, and the programme suffers.
For tango-fans, the first half of the evening is rewarding: the verve and
virtuosity of the dances, the charming singing of Roxana Fontan, and the
admirable orchestra, are worth part of anyone's evening.
Tango para Dos is at Sadler's Wells until July 10

FT  24 JUN 93 / Technology: Closer to the paperless office - Software that
can store exact copies of documents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adobe Systems, the California-based software house whose Postscript font
technology played a crucial role in the desktop publishing revolution, this
week launched software that promises to be good news both for finance
directors and for the world's endangered forests.
Called Acrobat, the software is designed to make it possible to distribute
documents of all kinds across different computer systems. Nothing too
remarkable about that, you might think, but it has not been done before and
it brings closer the prospect of the 'paperless office'.
The important feature of Acrobat is that documents are received exactly as
transmitted. Fonts are accurately transcribed, full-colour photographs
reproduced exactly as in the original, diagrams rendered precisely as drawn.
According to John Warnock, the mathematician and computer engineer who
co-founded Adobe, the new software opens the prospect of companies' using
electronic storage and dissemination, rather than paper, for company
documents of all kinds.
Large companies that, for example, distribute corporate handbooks could save
the cost of buying Acrobat simply by storing the handbook on an optical disk
to be accessed by staff through their workstations.
'Paper,' Warnock says, 'imposes an artificially short lifespan on
information.'
Acrobat is currently available for Apple Macintosh and personal computers
using MS/DOS Windows but MS/DOS and Unix versions are expected to be
available in late 1993.
Adobe's special skill lies in mathematics and in the use of mathematical
equations to describe exactly what a computer screen should show or a
computer printer should print. The contents of a document are, after all, a
collection of straight lines and curves all of which can be represented by
equations.
Essentially, Acrobat is a translation device, a collection of software that
receives information about the way a page of a document should look and
formats it for the specific computer or printer on which it is to be
displayed or printed.
Acrobat is not designed so that several users can work on a document at the
same time like, say, Lotus Notes. It is a product for storage and
transmission. And the data compression it allows is striking. According to
Warnock, up to 100,000 pages of text can be stored on a single compact disk.
The key to Acrobat's antics is a special file format called Portable
Document Format. According to Adobe, it can describe a document of any
length, containing any combination of text, graphics and images in a format
independent of device and resolution. PDF uses Adobe's Postscript language
to describe not only the elements of the document to be viewed or printed
but also annotations, miniature views of pages and 'hypertext' links through
which the reader can explore further information about a topic.
The Acrobat product line comprises three products: Acrobat Reader, which
enables customers to view information; Acrobat Exchange, for customers
creating or exchanging documents; and Acrobat Distiller, which translates
Postscript files into PDF format.
Acrobat, obviously, does not work alone. Each workstation has to have its
own version of the software. Acrobat Reader is priced, Adobe says, so that
large companies can afford multiple copies. In volumes of 50 copies it costs
Pounds 36 a copy while in volumes of 500 copies, the price drops to Pounds

FT  24 JUN 93 / People: Low-profile choice for WDA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited successor to Gwyn Jones as chairman of the Welsh
Development Agency, probably the most public of public posts in Wales after
that of the Welsh secretary himself, was announced yesterday as David
Rowe-Beddoe, a 55-year-old businessman.
Rowe-Beddoe, a surprise choice who passes the first test by being born in
Cardiff, was for five years, until 1976, chief executive of Thomas de la
Rue, the security printing company. He has been a president of Revlon and
for 10 years was a board member of Morgan Stanley GFTA. At present he is
chairman of Cavendish Services, a financial and corporate consultancy which
is based in Monaco.
Of his new post, he said yesterday: 'It is very clear to me that the
overriding priority is the creation of jobs, and of quality jobs.' While he
admired the WDA's success in attracting inward investment, he envisaged an
increasing emphasis on business services and help for indigenous businesses.
He will take over the three-year post, which pays Pounds 43,455 for
two-and-a-half days a week, on July 1.
Rowe-Beddoe, a graduate of Cambridge and Harvard School of Business
Administration, has Welsh credentials which include involvement in Wales
2010, an upbeat report on the country's prospects recently published by the
Institute of Welsh Affairs, and vice-presidency of Crawshays Welsh RFC. He
also has a house near Monmouth.
The choice of Rowe-Beddoe, who hitherto has had a low public profile, is
likely to be seen as a further move away from the era of Peter Walker, who
when Welsh secretary appointed the entrepreneurial Jones as chairman in
1988. Jones, still only in his mid-40s, had wanted to resign in the new year
to pursue business interests, but was persuaded to continue until now
because the choice of a successor proved so difficult.
The post had been advertised and is believed to have attracted over 70
applicants but David Hunt, then Welsh secretary, apparently thought none of
them was the right calibre to run an agency with an annual budget of Pounds
171m. Speculation then began to run rife with such names as Sir John
Harvey-Jones and Neil Kinnock being put in the frame.
The WDA, which was set up in 1976, has enviable success in attracting inward
investment and in promoting public and private joint ventures, but it has
also drawn criticism for previous lax internal management. One of the new
chairman's first hot potatoes will be responding to what is expected to be a
withering report due to be published soon by the Commons public accounts
committee. Rowe-Beddoe, at least, will be able to say that that is all water
under the Severn bridge.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Risks of joint
ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clearly define the objectives, ensure that there is frequent consultation
between the partners, and make room for a 'collaboration champion'.
According a report* from the School of Management at the University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, companies that follow those
rules when setting up a product development joint venture have a better
chance of success.
The study, which draws on the experience of more than 100 UK manufacturers
of telecommunications systems and equipment, computer hardware and computer
software producers, points out that collaboration can often have a negative
impact on businesses.
Among problems that frequently crop up are the leakage of company
information not included in the original agreement, loss of control over
development and a lengthening of the product development process. Partners
can lose their early commitment, turn competitor, or leave high termination
costs in their wake.
Most companies in the sample, selected at random from national trade
directories, did not generally feel that collaboration improved
responsiveness to customer needs or market opportunities.
Umist's report, which comes at a time when there is evidence of renewed
interest in strategic alliances of all kinds, cites customer initiatives and
lack of expertise to exploit market opportunities independently as common
stimuli to product development collaboration. Respondents were also
motivated by the prospect of reduced risks and costs.
The most common yardstick of success was the profitability of the product,
though this was typically used in conjunction with other measures such as
meeting deadlines and cost targets. Respondents engaging in proportionately
more collaborative activity were more likely to measure success by whether
it led to a longer-term relationship.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Raising its glass to
a new niche - Holsten has spent three years on a new beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holsten, the German brewer, has launched its first new beer for 40 years in
the UK premium-packaged lager market - a market it helped to create and now
leads.
The Hamburg-based brewer, with UK sales of 160m bottles and cans of Holsten
Pils a year, aims to consolidate a position it has been building since the
1950s when its beer was marketed as a drink suitable for diabetics.
Competition has been growing rapidly. Imported lager brands were entering
the market at a rate of one every 19 days during the peak period 18 months
ago, and consumers have about 400 to choose from, says Carol Fisher, UK
marketing director.
Consumer familiarity with Holsten's established product made it vulnerable
to newcomers in the more fashionable bars and restaurants. Holsten Bier, the
new brand, is brewed in Germany and is targeted at this niche in the market.
Three years of research have gone into preparing the product, from its taste
to the acid-etched logo on the bottle.
Holsten's move reflects an immediate concern to secure its place in a market
that offers profit margins five times greater than those available in
Germany.
It also marks another tactical advance in a long-running export drive that
has enabled the brewer to double sales to 7.85m hectolitres (172.68m
gallons) and turnover to DM989m (Pounds 394m) in the past five years.
The German beer market is a difficult place in which to grow. Its consumers
have the biggest thirst in Europe, but over the past few years they have
reached their limit at a yearly 144 litres a head. That demand is being met
by 1,300 brewers catering for mainly localised tastes with more than 5,000
brands.
Holsten's response has been to mount a three-pronged attack on its domestic
market. It is promoting its pilsener as a national brand, supporting it with
television advertising, and sponsorship of soccer teams, tennis tournaments,
horse-racing, cultural events and environmental projects.
The Holsten brand has been extended to alcohol-free and light beers; and the
national portfolio has also been enlarged to include Foster's lager, brewed
under licence, and specialities such as Duckstein ale and Franziskaner white
beer, which is distributed for a Munich brewer.
At the same time, the company is strengthening its base in northern Germany
and pushing out the market boundaries of its regional brands. This process
was given a fillip by the razing of the Berlin Wall and reunification.
In 1991 Holsten bought the Lubz brewery in Mecklenburg, and with it a brand
of pils that dominates a sales territory stretching from the Baltic to
Berlin. Last year, Holsten acquired a brewery in Dresden that, like the
company's plant in Brunswick, produced a brand named Feldschlossen. Brewed
to one recipe, the brand is now one of the country's largest with sales of
1.1m hectolitres across Saxony.
But until these successes took Holsten's share of the German market to about
5 per cent, expansion at home was difficult and slow. Paul von Ostman,
Holsten's international director, says the brewer's early decision to seek
growth in overseas markets - it shipped its first beer to the UK from
Hamburg in the late 1890s - was one of its shrewdest moves.
Of Holsten's total German production of 7m hectolitres last year, 18 per
cent was exported - roughly 3 1/2 times the percentage for the industry as a
whole - to more than 70 countries.
Another 900,000 hectolitres are brewed under licence in the UK, Hungary,
Nigeria, Namibia and China, which supplies the Hong Kong market. That means
that 25 per cent of the company's beer - and 40 per cent of the Holsten
brand - is sold outside Germany.
The company continues to push strongly for further international growth. In
Europe, Italy was targeted last year, and production will be licensed in
Poland this year. A barter agreement has even gained entry to Vietnam. The
importer is paying for the beer with sisal matting.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Accountancy Column: Per Astra ad pyrotechnic auditing Ardua
/ A look at a probe related to arms for Iraq with explosive implications for
the profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The weighty tome published last week about the investigation by Department
of Trade and Industry inspectors into Astra Holdings, the munitions group,
makes explosive reading for the accountancy profession.
While many will be frustrated at the absence of commentary on the
sensational allegations linking the company to the British intelligence
services and the provision of arms to Iraq, the 550-page text is sober
reading for accountants.
Though couched in careful words, it is a depressing catalogue of the worst
excesses of 'creative accounting' in the 1980s. It also raises questions
about how far auditors and their firms serve directors at the expense of
shareholders.
In 1981, Astra Fireworks, a modest-sized firework manufacturer and
distributor, was bought by a management team and began diversifying into
military pyrotechnics. The team became the directors, and their advisers -
solicitors Baileys Shaw &amp; Gillett and accountants Stoy Hayward - remained
with them over the following years.
The company had a private placing of shares in 1985 and, as a result of a
reverse take-over of Sumner, it circumvented the requirements of the
Unlisted Securities Market to obtain a full listing in 1986, renaming itself
Astra Group in the process.
A meteoric rise in its performance then began, fuelled by acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 24,000 in 1984. They rose to Pounds 103,000 the
next year, Pounds 340,000 in 1986, Pounds 1m in 1987 and Pounds 6m in 1988.
By 1989, it had become a Pounds 200m turnover company with Pounds 80m in net
assets and Pounds 9.5m in profits.
Between 1986 and 1989 Astra bought seven companies, leaving little time for
consolidation between each. 'The ink was hardly dry on one acquisition
before the board diverted their attention to another,' say the DTI
inspectors. The purchases cost Pounds 115m, generated through Pounds 91.7m
in cash from shareholders, and borrowings of Pounds 53m.
It could not last. In September 1989, Astra bought PRB, a Belgian munitions
company, which 'proved to be a disaster'. The investment was a complete
write-off, generating losses in 1990 of Pounds 65.2m. The company limped on
until receivers were appointed in February last year. Secured creditors have
received 66p in the pound. Others are unlikely to receive anything.
After the DTI investigators began work in August 1990, their remit was
rapidly extended from the acquisition of PRB to a wide range of accounting
issues in earlier years. What emerges is a company determined to maintain a
strong profits record through hasty acquisitions and liberal accounting, at
the expense of consistency and fair disclosure to shareholders.
In 1986, Astra discovered an accounting error which would have led to a
profits shortfall sufficient to jeopardise its flotation. As a result, the
DTI inspectors conclude, a false invoice for Pounds 240,000 was raised
against Astra through an offshore company, Export Marketing International of
Guernsey, controlled by the group, and paid for by two directors through a
Swiss bank.
They do not criticise Stoy Hayward for failing to detect the false invoice.
But they highlight the failure to compare in detail two inconsistent lists
of sales prepared by the company; and lack of documentation to check that
the amounts invoiced had been included in turnover.
A second issue concerned the acquisition by Astra of Richard Unwin
International in time to include it in the 1987 accounts most favourably. It
was effected through what the inspectors call 'a manifestly artificial
scheme'.
Astra was keen to include a Pounds 729,000 contract with Unwin from the
Nigerian Ministry of Defence dating from July 1985. By using merger
accounting, Astra would be able to include the profits - including the
contract - for the entire year, regardless of how much had been earned after
the purchase.
A report from Stoy argued that Unwin was nearly insolvent and only showed
positive assets by revaluing its site and including sales prior to their
despatch. It also questioned how far the Nigerian contract was recoverable.
None the less, Stoy suggested a different approach, known as 'the Ashdown
scheme'. Unwin's owner would sell his shares to Ashdown Investments, an Isle
of Man company, which would then be bought by Astra. The structure of the
deal permitted Astra to bring in the profit on the Nigerian contract while
excluding the losses of the past.
In 1986 Astra also bought MFA International, which proved a severe drain on
cash. To avoid showing its losses in the group accounts, Stoy helped devise
a way to keep it controlled by the company but off-balance and hence not
consolidated in the accounts.
The vehicle was Doveshrewd, devised with four classes of shares and two
independent shareholders simply, according to a lawyer's note at the time,
'so that it did not really look like a sham  ... one may as well keep it as
much at arms length as one could]'
Over three years, the directors made interest-free loans totalling Pounds 4m
to MFA which were never disclosed in the accounts. The Stoy auditors
accepted minutes of a Doveshrewd meeting as evidence that the company could
be treated as off-balance sheet, and assurances from the directors that the
loans would be repaid so that no provisions were required.
No such repayments took place. MFA was finally consolidated in 1989, and
Astra happily used acquisition accounting, which meant previous losses would
not be consolidated. The goodwill on purchase of the company through
Doveshrewd was written off through reserves and not separately disclosed,
but instead subsumed with large write-offs from the acquisition of BMARC.
The BMARC purchase itself was also an ideal candidate for acquisition
accounting. This allowed for the creation of enormous fair value provisions,
which were then released from reserves to contribute 40 per cent to profits
in 1989 alone.
There was a provision of Pounds 7.2m 'established as at date of acquisition'
for the 5 months before purchase in May 1988. The figure was not considered
or calculated until June 1989. It included write-offs for all munitions for
which there were no orders in hand at the time of purchase, even though
substantial new orders were known of by that time.
Accounting on other issues was equally opaque. In 1987, for instance, all of
the remuneration of four directors was deferred and capitalised. Astra
argued that this was legitimate because their time had been spent on
acquisitions. The inspectors disagree.
In 1988, a note that 83 per cent of turnover was from the US was the only
indication that two acquisitions - Walters and Kilgore - were the only
profitable parts of the group. The directors report argued greater
disclosure 'would be prejudicial to the interests of the group'  - an
argument accepted by Stoy for which the firm is criticised by the
inspectors.
Stoy rejects the criticisms made by the DTI inspectors and argues that the
points raised are interpretational or judgemental. The DTI is considering
whether to begin disqualification proceedings against the company's
directors. The relevant legal, accounting and securities disciplinary bodies
are also mulling possible action.
The Accounting Standards Board has proposals for reducing flexibility in
acquisition provisions and merger accounting. The rules on off-balance sheet
vehicles have been tightened.
But the relationship between accountancy firms and directors remains
relatively unquestioned. And how many other companies given the same degree
of scrutiny for their accounting during the 1980s would emerge uncriticised?

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union boss attacks Smith's critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VIGOROUS attack on the union leaders opposing Mr John Smith's proposed
reforms to the links between the Labour party and the unions was launched
yesterday by Mr Paul Gallagher, leader of the electricians' sections of the
AEEU union.
He said support for Mr Smith's proposal to end direct union influence in the
selection of parliamentary candidates was not tantamount to 'breaking' the
links. Those union leaders who argued that it was, were 'stabbing him in the
back'.
He said at the electricians' conference in Blackpoool: 'It is time that some
union leaders decided what it is they want. Do they want influence in the
party of government or do they want power in a party of permanent
opposition?'
The electricians are likely soon to return to the Trades Union Congress
after being expelled in 1988. The union has long backed Mr Smith's reform
proposals, but Mr Gallagher's strong support will boost the Smith camp,
which has been under attack from many union leaders.
Also speaking at the conference, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy
leader, underlined the ties between the party and the union movement. She
attacked the government for trying to weaken those links, for example by
requiring ballots to be held on unions' political funds.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley spurns 'big bang' assault on
benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFECTIVE structural reform of the Pounds 80bn social security system must
involve either better targeting, more self-provision or both, Mr Peter
Lilley, social security secretary, said yesterday.
He added, however, that he favoured a sector-by-sector approach to reform
rather than a 'big bang' exercise.
Speaking less than a week after the cabinet agreed to set tough spending
limits for 1994-95 and to 'sing from the same hymn sheet' on tax and
spending, Mr Lilley used a lecture at the City University Business School to
spell out the basis on which he approached his department's budget in the
spending review.
He emphasised that there were ways other than means-testing to target
benefits. These included using categories other than income, such as age,
targeting on the basis of objectively defined needs, and attaching
conditions to particular benefits.
He made clear that no one would be allowed to 'opt out of contributing to
help those who cannot provide for their needs', but expressed strong
approval for the incentives to earn and save where people made private
provision for themselves.
He also argued that there was already some effective targeting within the
system, with about 70 per cent of benefits going to the 30 per cent of
people with lowest pre-benefit income.
Delivering the Mais lecture, Mr Lilley said that he planned to publish soon
an analysis and projection of DSS spending, in order to stimulate an
informed debate.
Apart from unemployment, trend growth in the cost of an unreformed social
security system is put at more than 3 per cent a year, taking account of
inflation.
Mr Lilley was very cool on the solution suggested by some, of a merged tax
and benefits system. He argued that the two systems fulfilled different
functions, and merger might result in less well-targeted and thus more
expensive benefits.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Extra tests plan worries teachers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS and educationalists yesterday were critical of the suggestion by Mr
John Patten, the education secretary, that five-year-olds should be tested
in schools.
Mr Patten said on the Sky News Target programme on Tuesday: 'If teachers are
worried that children are coming in at rising five at different levels,
different backgrounds and the rest of it - and it is therefore very
difficult to judge their progress at seven - what we need is something very
simple to measure what their standards are when they enter school.'
Under the national curriculum in England and Wales children must be tested
at the ages of seven, 11, 14 and 16, but boycotts by teachers meant very few
children took the tests this year.
Mrs Pat Partington, president of the National Association of Head Teachers,
said: 'If the tests were anything like the tests we now have for
seven-year-olds they would be even more inappropriate for five-year-olds. I
just can't imagine for the majority of children that standardised tests
would be appropriate.'
Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said: 'If children are tested
at five years old there's a real danger that they will be labelled for life,
and with a wholly inappropriate label.'
The Conservative-controlled London borough of Wandsworth said it supported
the idea, and had set tests for five-year-olds for the last two years.
The government is speeding up the process of devolving budgets from local
education authorities to schools in England.
Mr Eric Forth, schools minister, said authorities would be obliged to
devolve at least 90 per cent of potential school budgets to schools by April
1 1995 - one year later for inner London boroughs.
He said this would result in 'at least another Pounds 300m' being
transferred from education authorities to schools.
Potential school budgets will be redefined, so that they do not include
school meals, transport to school, premature retirement compensation costs,
and psychology and welfare services.
A new 'definitive' framework for the local management of schools is expected
in the autumn. The Association of County Councils said the new deadlines
could be met without difficulty.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rosyth's 'despairing cry' ruffles
MoD - The last-minute Trident refit bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPACT of Rosyth Royal Dockyard's last-minute bid to halve the
investment cost for refitting Trident submarines - and thus to stop the
business going to Devonport - came as much from its timing as from the
radical nature of the proposal.
Rosyth proposed in effect to carry out different parts of each refit in
different docks.
By doing that, it offered for Pounds 60m a facility for which the government
was once ready to pay Pounds 450m. That was the cost of the giant covered
dock complex originally due to be built for the submarines at Rosyth.
Defence officials grumbled that it was 'totally unreasonable' for such a
plan to be submitted out of the blue after months of discussion. Rosyth said
it started submitting details of the new plan drawn up by its project team
last week, and argued that it met all the requirements.
Captain Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships and a former nuclear
submarine commander, said: 'In theory it is feasible. In practical terms it
would certainly create huge organisational difficulties. It sounds like the
despairing cry of a lost cause.'
The Pounds 60m investment proposed by Rosyth would go on installations and
support for removing and replacing the nuclear fuel from submarines'
reactors at its existing emergency docking facility. This facility is in
effect a large lock, mostly left empty but sometimes used for tests and
other purposes. It was recently upgraded at a cost of Pounds 20m for Trident
vessels. These are much bigger than their Polaris predecessors.
Most of the work would be done at other docks. But, as there would be no
nuclear fuel on board, nothing would need to be spent to bring them up to
modern nuclear safety standards - a large part of the cost in other
proposals for using existing docks, put forward by both Rosyth and
Devonport.
The process would also allow greater use of nuclear refuelling facilities,
which are used for only a short part of the two years taken to refit a
nuclear submarine.
Rosyth said the plan capitalised on investment already made. 'We have had an
emergency dock for 25 years for Polaris, and it has never been used,' it
said.
Devonport has no equivalent, but one is included in its bid for Trident work
and it said it could produce a 'copycat' proposal if required.
Devonport said a fresh round of bidding based on these new premises could
delay a decision for several more months, jeopardising the target date for
refitting HMS Vanguard, the first of the submarines carrying Trident
missiles. The date is confidential, but Rosyth has said publicly its
proposal would enable the first Vanguard to start refitting in September
1999.
One question is the potential risk in exploiting the emergency dock. Taking
fuel out requires cutting into the pressurised hull to get at the reactor.
It also requires erecting special structures in and around the submarine to
handle the used fuel, the most dangerous part of the process.
Experts raised doubts whether Rosyth could guarantee being able to make the
dock ready to handle an emergency in the required time - believed to be
about two weeks - especially if problems arose in fuel-handling.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Backbenchers meet tonight on
defiant Mates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday refused to give unequivocal support to Mr Michael
Mates, as a leaked letter confirmed the minister's detailed representations
on behalf of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman.
The career of Mr Mates, the minister at the centre of the row over Tory
links with Mr Nadir, appears to hang largely on the verdict of Tory MPs, and
a meeting of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives tonight may
determine his fate.
Friends of Mr Mates suggested that the Northern Ireland minister had on
several occasions protested about the behaviour of the Serious Fraud Office.
Further evidence of his involvement emerged last night with the Daily Mail's
publication of a letter from Mr Mates to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, complaining about Inland Revenue investigations.
The newspaper said the letter showed Mr Mates was questioning the way the
police were handling the fraud investigation against Mr Nadir. The minister
also expressed his 'concerns about the injustice of the way this case is
being handled'.
Mr Mates's decision to meet Mr Nadir days before his flight to Cyprus was a
response to the businessman's 'suicidal' mood after the seizure of some of
his defence papers. There were also suggestions that the Greek security
services could have been behind attempts to wreck Mr Nadir's business
empire.
Mr Mates did not consult Mr Major before saying this week that he had the
prime minister's 'full support'. He was said to believe that the pressure
for his removal was starting to abate, and last night his friends indicated
that he was determined to remain in the government.
Downing Street, however, refused to endorse Mr Mates's choice of words -
signalling that the prime minister was still ready to accept Mr Mates's
resignation, although he was reluctant to sack him.
Mr Mates was said to have strongly denied reports that he believed that
British security services had been involved in a plot to destabilise Mr
Nadir's Polly Peck business empire. He had also not raised any complaints
about the conduct of the attorney general's office in the investigation.
The minister was said to have flatly rejected suggestions that he had
threatened to embarrass the government if forced to stand down.
Among Conservative MPs there remains disquiet at Mr Mates's gift of a watch
to Mr Nadir and the loan of a car by a public-relations adviser working for
the businessman. That could still harden into calls for Mr Mates to be told
by the 1922 exec-utive that he ought to resign.
Mr Mates is understood to believe that a full account of his relationship
with Mr Nadir - and his representations on behalf of the fugitive tycoon -
eventually would exonerate him from any wrongdoing.
Downing Street has consistently said that Mr Mates's gift of a watch was a
mistake, 'but not a hanging offence'. It described the loan of a car as 'a
trivial matter'. Neither incident had worried Sir Robin Butler, cabinet
secretary, who polices the official guidelines to ministers.
Meanwhile, some senior MPs were arguing that for Mr Mates to resign this
week would make it appear as if the press had hounded another minister from
office. It would be better for the Northern Ireland minister to leave
government in Mr Major's next reshuffle, they said.
But others were convinced that he should go immediately. 'There is no way we
are going to let him off,' said one. Some expressed concern that Mr Major
was failing the test of his authority created by Mr Mates's attempts to
brazen out calls for him to resign.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler rounds on Labour over Soley
claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR NORMAN Fowler, Conservative party chairman, last night challenged Labour
to disown the MP who named Mr Michael Heseltine as having met a Saudi prince
before the general election to discuss aid to the Tories.
Sir Norman said the comments by Mr Clive Soley, Labour MP for Hammersmith,
amounted to 'a baseless personal attack' on the trade and industry
secretary.
Mr Soley said yesterday that he had no details of when the alleged meeting,
referred to in a letter he read out in parliament on Tuesday, was supposed
to have occurred.
He confirmed that some information in the letter had been passed to The
Guardian before the newspaper published a report this week alleging a Saudi
royal family member contributed several million pounds to the Tories before
the last election.
The Guardian alleged that a meeting took place in March 1992 between 'a
cabinet minister' and Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, son of Sultan Bin Abdul
Aziz, the Saudi defence minister. But in a statement issued on his behalf
Prince Bandar has said no such meeting took place and that he was not in
England during March.
The Guardian story also has been angrily denied by Conservatives, with Mr
John Major saying no donations were accepted from foreign governments or
royal families.
Mr Soley said he did not tell The Guardian who his contact was and yesterday
said only that he was an Arab with good contacts in Saudi Arabia. The
contact had approached him during the general election and had sent him the
letter more recently.
The extract from the letter Mr Soley read, under parliamentary privilege, to
the Commons said: 'Prior to election time a meeting took place in the
residence of Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz in the Boltons, SW10, between
Prince Bandar, son of the aforementioned, and the ambassador of Saudi Arabia
to the USA, with Michael Heseltine and two other people unknown to me. The
subject of the meeting was to aid the Conservative party financially in
their efforts against the Labour party.
'As far as I have been informed by members of the embassy, this task has
been delegated to Mr Hattab Alonzi, press attache, via his supervisor,
General Ali Al-Shaaier, minister of communications and media.'
Separately, a former senior Tory fundraiser last night gave the first
confirmation the party had received money from Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong
businessman.
Sir Bryan Wyldbore-Smith, who was director of the party's board of finance
for 22 years leading up to the last general election, told Channel Four News
Mr Li had 'certainly' given a donation. He said he was 'not going to talk
sums.'

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ofgas cautious on energy saving
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UTILITY REGULATORS yesterday were cautious about the chances of
energy-efficiency measures at the heart of government plans for meeting
targets on global warming.
Sir James McKinnon, director general of Ofgas, the gas regulator, told the
Commons environment committee 'a lot of money' would be required if the
newly-formed Energy Saving Trust, set up to encourage households to save
energy, was to meet the targets.
The trust estimates that it would need to invest Pounds 400m a year in
household improvements by 1998 to make those savings. Sir James told the
committee that was 'at the top limit of what they might expect to get'. The
trust expects to spend only about Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m this year.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: EC cash sought for Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRADE and industry minister yesterday promised to go to Brussels if
necessary to plead Swan Hunter's case for eligibility for EC shipbuilding
intervention funds.
Mr Tim Sainsbury told MPs he had already approached the European Commission
to ask that the Tyneside shipbuilder be given access to the subsidy. He said
he believed that circumstances had changed sufficiently to justify the move.
Swan Hunter, which is in receivership, does not qualify for the 9 per cent
subsidy for merchant shipbuilding orders because it has been classified
since its 1986 privatisation as a warship yard. It has since built two
non-naval vessels.
North Tyneside council argued to the EC competition directorate that Swan
could be redesignated a 'mixed' yard, qualifying for the subsidy, without
setting a precedent.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour offers to identify big
donors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR IS prepared to take the lead in identifying individuals who provide
it with donations above Pounds 5,000, Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general
secretary, said yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
Mr Whitty said he looked to the Commons' home affairs committee - made up of
Labour and Conservative members - which is examining the funding of
political parties, to recommend a change in the law requiring the disclosure
of all substantial political donations made by individuals.
He undertook to recommend that the party's national executive should take
unilateral action in the event of the committee failing to make such a
recommendation, or the government failing to introduce the necessary
legislation.
He said that in the period up to last year's general election about 15
people had made individual donations of Pounds 10,000 or more to the Labour
party.
A proposal to increase the number of women for whom Labour MPs must vote for
in shadow cabinet elections fell at the last hurdle yesterday when the party
rejected a package of reforms to modernise its Westminster operations.
The move came less than a week after the PLP had backed a proposal to raise
the minimum number of votes that must be cast for women from three to four.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union chief attacks critics of
Smith reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VIGOROUS attack on the union leaders opposing Mr John Smith's proposed
reforms to the links between the Labour party and the unions was launched
yesterday by Mr Paul Gallagher, leader of the electricians' sections of the
AEEU union.
He said support for Mr Smith's proposal to end direct union influence in the
selection of parliamentary candidates was not tantamount to 'breaking' the
links. Those union leaders who argued that it was were 'stabbing him in the
back'.
He said at the electricians' conference in Blackpoool: 'It is time that some
union leaders decided what it is they want. Do they want influence in the
party of government or do they want power in a party of permanent
opposition?'
The electricians are likely soon to return to the Trades Union Congress
after being expelled in 1988. The union has long backed Mr Smith's reform
proposals, but Mr Gallagher's strong support will boost the Smith camp.
Also speaking at the conference, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy
leader, underlined the ties between the party and the union movement. She
attacked the government for trying to weaken those links, for example by
requiring ballots to be held on unions' political funds.
Mr Smith's proposals on changing the unions' role in the party have so far
failed to attract enough union support to be accepted at the party
conference in the autumn. But the Labour leadership believes there is still
all to play for, at least until the special meeting next month of the
national executive committee, the party's ruling body, which will decide how
to put the issue to the conference. A proposal to increase the number of
women that Labour MPs must vote for in shadow cabinet elections fell at the
last hurdle yesterday when the party rejected a package of reforms to
modernise its Westminster operations.
The move came less than a week after the PLP backed a proposal to raise the
minimum number of votes that must be cast for women from three to four.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on car companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE arrival of Japanese car companies as manufacturers in the UK has had a
big effect on upgrading the quality and productivity performance of some of
the larger players in the UK motor and components industry, Mr George
Simpson, chairman of the Rover vehicles group, told MPs yesterday.
But there is a danger that many smaller and medium-sized suppliers will
disappear unless the big components companies pass on the lessons learned
from their Japanese customers, he told the Commons trade and industry
committee, which is inquiring into the competitiveness of UK manufacturing
industry.
Most carmakers have sharply reduced the number of their direct component
suppliers, forging partnerships with them and expecting them to have strong
design and development capabilities. Smaller and medium-sized companies are,
in effect, becoming suppliers to the larger 'first tier' component groups.
Describing the overall impact as 'very much beneficial' to the UK motor
industry, Mr Simpson warned that as production by Nissan, Toyota and Honda
increases competitive pressures throughout the EC will intensify and that
'they will reduce everyone's market share'.
For that reason, the government should resist pressures to open the UK
market completely to Japanese imports while other EC member states kept
restrictions in place during the EC's transition to a completely open market
by the end of the decade.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Croatia sanctions may be backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN may back the imposition of economic sanctions against Croatia in an
attempt to force the pace of negotiations in Geneva to secure a Bosnian
peace settlement acceptable to the Moslems.
Underlining in the Commons his 'passionate' opposition to a lifting of the
arms embargo on the Bosnian Moslems, Mr John Major said yesterday the
sanctions against Croatia might 'indeed be necessary' to secure an
agreement.
His statement marked an acknowledgement that unless the settlement suggested
jointly last week by Serbia and Croatia is improved, Britain may eventually
be forced to concede to US and German demands for the arms embargo to be
scrapped.
Reporting on the outcome of this week's Copenhagen summit, Mr Major also
repeated his reluctance to commit any further British troops to the former
Yugoslav province Bosnia, arguing that the UK was already making a 'full
contribution'.
He confirmed, however, that the government would send 12 more RAF Jaguar
fighters to Bosnia 'very shortly' to support the British humanitarian aid
effort.
Mr Major said he had argued at the Copenhagen meeting 'that the lifting of
the arms embargo would jeopardise the humanitarian operation and provoke a
bloodier and perhaps wider war, with perilous consequences.
'We agreed that it was better to seek a peaceful settlement acceptable to
all sides in Bosnia-Hercegovina. But as the (EC) council made clear this
cannot be a solution dictated by the Serbs and Croats at the expense of the
Moslems.'
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, welcomed the decision not to lift the arms
em-bargo. But he added: 'Such proposals gain currency because of the total
failure to achieve the previously agreed policies in a number of crucial
areas.'

FT  24 JUN 93 / Councils chief denounces 'Shambleshire' reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCIL reforms proposed by the Local Government Commission risked creating
'monster-sized authorities that will savagely cut representation', Lady
Elizabeth Anson, Conservative chairman of the Association of District
Councils, said at the association's annual conference yesterday.
She condemned the commission's proposals for Derbyshire, Durham, Somerset
and 'North Yorkshire or is it Shambleshire'. The reforms would lead to
abolition of many councils represented by the association.
The association urged the government to change its policy guidance to the
commission, which has already recommended scrapping the counties of Avon,
Cleveland and Humberside.
It said the commission had been inconsistent, and called for policy guidance
which gave 'more attention to issues of democracy, accountability and
community'. Such a change would probably result in small unitary
authorities, in line with the association's own policy.
The Association of County Councils distanced itself from the district
association's stance. It said: 'Local authorities did have a chance to
influence the guidance before it was issued. We cannot see any reason at
this point for the wholesale amendment of the policy guidance to which the
commission is working.'

FT  24 JUN 93 / Telecoms infant rides on the back of Grid's pylons: Energis
will launch a strong attack on established operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION breeds competition, nowhere more than in today's
telecommunications industry.
Between them, British Telecommunications, Mercury and the electricity
distributors have spawned Energis, potentially the UK's most formidable
telecoms infant since the launch of Mercury a decade ago.
Energis, a wholly owned subsidiary of National Grid, last month gained a
government licence to erect a telecommunications network on National Grid
pylons across England and Wales.
It is staffed by experts from its main competitors. Mr Gordon Owen,
Energis's chairman, is the man who built up Mercury. Its chief executive is
Mr David Dey, a former BT director who helped spearhead its assault on new
markets in the late 1980s.
Mr Owen said: 'Between us, there isn't much we don't know about running a
first-class telecoms business.' Energis is erecting a fibre-optic network at
the rate of 50 miles a week - mainly by wrapping the fibre round the earth
wire on the National Grid pylons. It plans a nationwide launch next April.
It says by then it will have invested Pounds 100m, setting up nearly 1,500
miles of cable linking 17 of the 23 largest conurbations in England and
Wales.
Mr Owen said: 'At launch Energis will be within local call distance of 70
per cent of households in England and Wales. We will be marketing to
domestic customers, not just companies. We don't intend to be a niche
player, but the third force in UK telecoms.'
Energis intends to compete strongly on price. It is considering discounts of
between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on BT and Mercury tariffs depending
partly on what it will need to pay its competitors for connecting calls
locally and over trunk routes that its network does not serve.
Given the scale of profits in the industry, Energis is not short of
opportunities. In spite of the recession Mercury this week announced pre-tax
profits for the year to March 31 of Pounds 192m on turnover of Pounds 1.2bn
 -up 24 per cent on last year.
Nonetheless, BT and Mercury prices are falling fast. BT has agreed with
Oftel, the industry regulator, to reduce call charges over the next year,
using a formula that limits price changes to no more than the retail price
index minus 7.5 percentage points.
The former state monopoly is also cutting costs and sharpening its marketing
edge, with a massive redundancy programme, large price discounts for
heavy-user businesses, and a growing range of special offers for domestic
customers.
Mr Owen insisted that lower overheads would enable him to sustain
competition. 'We intend to outsource almost everything besides key strategic
operations,' he said.
Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment supplier, has
been appointed prime contractor. It has installed a team at Energis's
headquarters to design its network, which will use Nortel's advanced public
switching system to offer a range of new services.
Energis also intends to exploit growing competition in the local telephone
market. It is talking to cable TV companies, whose fast-growing subscriber
list - presently at 160,000 - could allow Energis to by-pass BT in much of
the country.
Energis has other assets. The electricity companies serve almost every
address in the UK, giving ample marketing opportunities, and Energis will be
fully integrated with their billing, servicing and retail outlets. The
company says its philosophy is to provide new services on existing
infrastructures. That also applies to its communications with customers.
British business is well attuned to telecoms competition - more than half
the City's outgoing traffic is routed via Mercury - and its determination to
flex its collective muscle is increasing. Banks and credit card companies
are demanding large discounts in return for the increasing volume of traffic
generated by 'on-line' verification of credit card transactions.
Mr Owen will have few scruples in attacking the established operators. Cable
and Wireless, Mercury's parent, is Mr Owen's alma mater. He joined the
company straight from school, was sent around the world to its various
outposts, including a spell in charge of the network on Ascension Island,
and eventually became group managing director and chairman of Mercury. A
power struggle with Lord Young led to his abrupt departure in 1991.
But Energis will not be the only new entrant seeking to break the duopoly.
Ionica, a private Cambridge-based company, is building a national radio
network, due to start operation in early 1995.
Several companies re-selling leased lines are also on the scene, offering
cut-price services to businesses with minimal overheads.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of former employees of a local authority whose severance scheme was
ruled unlawful are to be instructed to return much of their redundancy pay -
more than two years after leaving their jobs.
North Tyneside Council has decided it must ask 342 former employees to repay
the total of Pounds 1.4m they received in excess of their statutory minimum
redundancy entitlement. If the former staff - most of whom are believed to
have spent the money - refuse they will be treated in the same way as poll
tax debtors and could face legal action.
The Labour-controlled council introduced the scheme in September 1990.
A 1991 test case in the High Court ruled that the scheme was unlawful. This
was up-held by the Appeal Court last year.

A LARGE section of the coal industry could be saved by early privatisation

privatising electricity supply first and establishing just two generation

LOW INTEREST rates continue to be good news for the unit trust industry. Net
sales of Pounds 914m in May pushed funds under management to Pounds 73.8bn,
a historical high.
With base rates at 6 per cent it is possible for many equity funds to offer
competitive rates to UK private investors.
The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds says that retail sales
of UK equity unit trusts in the first five months of this year were Pounds
1.21bn compared with Pounds 140.7m in the corresponding period last year.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Timex offers 'loyalty' bonus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPLACEMENT workers at the Timex plant in Dundee are being offered a bonus
payment of Pounds 7 a day for every day they have worked at the factory
provided they stay as long as the company wants them to, James Buxton
writes.
The plant, the centre of a bitter industrial dispute, is due to close later
this year.
The payments are being made to ensure that replacement workers stay to
complete orders and ensure an orderly rundown of the factory. Timex said
yesterday: 'The company recognises that the replacement workforce had
expectations of longer employment than Timex has been able to offer them.'
Some replacement workers have been at the plant since February and would be
entitled to payments of more than Pounds 1,200 on top of their weekly wage
of Pounds 135 if the plant stayed open until December.
Last week Timex announced that the factory would close within six months.
The announcement came after the 343-strong sacked workforce overwhelmingly
rejected an offer. Under it 150 of them might be re-engaged on lower pay
than they had received before sacked and the rest would receive an ex-gratia
redundancy payment.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Turkey aids SFO in Nadir probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KYRENIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TURKISH authorities have granted the Serious Fraud Office access to
information to help with its investigations of Mr Asil Nadir.
Turkish officials yesterday accepted a letter rogatory, under which a court
in one country can seek the co-operation of a court under another
jurisdiction.
The move marks an important breakthrough for investigators, and follows
representations earlier this month from Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO lawyer
leading the inquiry, who was in Ankara last week.
Some responses to specific requests are believed to have been passed on to
the police already. The SFO has requested details on transactions related to
at least two banks connected with Mr Nadir, Impexbank and Turkiye Yatirim ve
Turizm Bankasi (TYTB).
Meanwhile, the identity of one of the Turkish businessmen who is connected
to loans made last year to Mr Asil Nadir during his bankruptcy emerged
yesterday.
Mr Iskender Tarsuslugil, a Leeds-based garment manufacturer, travelled to
Cyprus last month. It is believed he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim
several hundred thousand pounds from Mr Nadir. Mr Tarsuslugil was not
available for comment last night.
TYTB confirmed yesterday that Mr Tarsuslugil was the ultimate owner of an
offshore company which borrowed money secured against the house of Ms Leslie
Ellwood, a girlfriend of Mr Nadir.
Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy has taken legal action against Ms Ellwood -
who is now in northern Cyprus - over a transfer of money used to purchase
the house for her.
Documents at the Land Registry show TYTB secured a loan against the house on
July 13 last year. The High Court issued an order last November preventing
further transactions related to the property.
TYTB said the loan to Mr Tarsuslugil had been approved by the board and was
disbursed in a number of different foreign currencies.
Bank officials said their client had indicated the one-year pre-export
finance loan, which matures next month, would be repaid on time.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Hopes of revival in construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST signs of a revival in construction activity may have appeared,
according to figures for new orders published yesterday by the Department of
the Environment.
These show that contracts won by construction companies in Great Britain
rose 10 per cent in the February- April period compared with the previous
three months.
Orders were 1 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year.
The improvement is consistent with increased optimism reported in recent
workload surveys by the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Contractors say, however, that overall order books remain very depressed and
that it is far too early to talk of 'green shoots' in the sector.
Miss Joanne Cutler, economist at the Building Employers Confederation, said
yesterday that the improvement was very patchy. The rise in orders was due
partly to a rebound from exceptionally low order figures reported in
December, when there was a big fall in public sector and infrastructure
work.
Miss Cutler said: 'We are seeing some growth in the more cyclical housing
and private industrial sectors, but it is questionable whether a few months
of limited growth constitutes a recovery.'
She added that industry leaders were apprehensive about the possibility of
public spending cuts in the November Budget which 'could set the recovery
back a further 12 months'.
There is also concern that the big rise in house sales, seen earlier this
year, has slowed in recent weeks.
According to the department, private housing orders jumped 29 per cent in
February, March and April compared with the previous three months - and were
13 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year.
Infrastructure orders, including contracts placed by private water and power
generation companies, were 7 per cent higher than during the previous three
months but 2 per cent lower than a year ago.
Commercial orders, mostly offices and shops, although 7 per cent higher than
in the previous three months, were 17 per cent lower than during the
corresponding period last year.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Oftel to ease curbs on competitors to BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHIFT TO a lighter regulatory regime for competitors to British
Telecommunications is signalled by Oftel, the industry regulator, in its
annual report.
The change, which Oftel believes could lead to improved service and more
competition, concerns the 'service obligations' imposed on new
telecommunications operators in their licences.
These typically include requirements to build networks covering a proportion
of a licence area in a specified period, and to maintain minimum service
standards.
Mr Bill Wigglesworth, Oftel's deputy director-general, says in the report:
'Sufficient obligations are needed to ensure satisfactory services . . . but
improved services will otherwise generally be best secured by consumer
choice in a competitive market.'
Mr Wigglesworth makes a distinction between obligations on BT as the
dominant operator, and those on competitors. 'This was previously partly
obscured by the restricted number of players, all of whom could be regarded
as having a privileged position,' he says.
Although geared mainly to new companies, which have been encouraged to come
forward since the government abolished the formal duopoly between BT and
Mercury two years ago, Oftel says its ideas on 'regulatory simplification'
might also be applied to existing operators by amending their licences.
The Department of Trade and Industry, acting on Oftel's advice, has already
moved in this direction with recent licences. Those granted to Ionica and
Energis to build national networks contain far fewer obligations than does
Mercury's licence.
Mercury, as well as the cellular mobile operators and the cable TV companies
which are building phone networks in conurbations, stand to gain from the
reform. Although stressing their readiness to meet obligations, a number of
cable companies, in particular, might welcome a relaxation of 'staging post'
obligations to pass certain numbers of houses within a specified time.
Oftel's annual report shows the number of complaints to the regulator down
for the first time in five years. Last year 41,026 complaints were received
from consumers in England, down from 41,393 in 1991.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Delay may add Pounds 150m to plant costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels' estimate of the cost of delaying the start-up of the
Thorp reprocessing plant has risen several times since last year. At present
it stands at a total of Pounds 150m for a nine-month delay.
BNF originally expected Thorp, which is intended to extract reusable
plutonium and uranium from used nuclear fuel, to get the go-ahead in
January.
Its 10-page report bases its calculations on a hypothetical delay from
January to September. This could correspond to the timetable for a decision
if the government proceeds with a further round of consultation. The report
puts the total cost of delay over the 39 weeks at Pounds 150m.
The largest part of this, Pounds 90m, is the cost of labour and maintenance
for Thorp. BNF puts the cost of its 1,750-strong team - 660 contractors and
1,090 staff - at Pounds 5m a month, and the cost of steam and electricity to
heat the plant at Pounds 1m a month.
A further Pounds 13m is due to labour and service on the effluent treatment
plants connected to Thorp. Thorp's share of the Sellafield site's overheads
makes up an additional Pounds 18m, or Pounds 2m a month. BNF has also added
the Pounds 11m estimated costs of extending the life of the storage ponds
used to receive customers' fuel.
Postponement of operations also means that payment of some customer fees
would be delayed - the report puts the financing costs at Pounds 15m. Some
contracts also contain a penalty clause if reprocessing is delayed, which
could add Pounds 3m.
However, the report assumes that BNF can claw back some Pounds 53m of this
total from customers under the terms of its 'cost-pass-through' contracts,
which make up about 60 per cent of its order book.
It is understood that BNF has not yet opened discussions with foreign
customers on whether they would accept an increase in costs because of
delay. The earliest contracts signed with Thorp, including those with
Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the electricity generators, as well
as some with Japanese utilities, are at fixed prices.
Meanwhile, environmental groups want a public inquiry into the
environmental, economic and diplomatic issues raised by the plant.
Mr Clive Bates of Greenpeace, the pressure group, said yesterday that BNF's
UK customers 'might gain from the delay, so the true cost to the UK economy
could be lower than its figures suggest'.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Plan to shift News at Ten under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of the 15 regional ITV companies are to be asked by the
Independent Television Commission to explain why they are proposing to move
News at Ten to an early evening slot.
Mr David Glencross, chief executive of the ITC, wrote yesterday to a number
of companies asking why they have backed such a decision in spite of
proposing in their bids for new franchises that the flagship news programme
retain its traditional place.
The ITV Network Centre - the ITV programme commissioning organisation -
confirmed yesterday that at the ITV broadcasting strategy conference in
Sutton Coldfield this week there was a unanimous decision to move News at
Ten. A recommendation will go before the next ITV council meeting on July 5
with 6.30pm the preferred option.
At least eight companies backed the status quo in their bid documents, some
with qualifications. They are: Carlton, London Weekend, Anglia, Meridian,
Tyne Tees (now part of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees), Scottish, Westcountry and
Channel.
Carlton, one of the main supporters of a News at Ten at 6.30pm, suggested in
its application document that News at Ten should stay in place this year and
implied this would remain sensible in the medium term. In the long term it
reserved the right to change the schedule in the light of changing
circumstances.
BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC, is expected to announce
record profits next week.
It is believed that pre-tax profits for the financial year to April have
doubled to about Pounds 10m. More importantly for the corporation, BBC
Enterprises has been able to invest about Pounds 60m in programme-making.
This is an increase of nearly a third on the previous year.
Under the overall control of Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general,
all commercial activities of the BBC are being co-ordinated on a worldwide
basis to maximise profits.
Profits from the Enterprises offshoot, the businesses of which range from
programme sales abroad to publishing magazines such as the Radio Times, go
towards BBC programmes. Its successes include Michael Palin's Pole to Pole
series, with more than 500,000 hardback books and about 100,000 double
videos sold.

FT  24 JUN 93 / New review expected for Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is likely to announce in the next few days that the future of
the controversial Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria
will be assessed in a second round of public consultation.
The move, after months of deadlock, would almost certainly delay a final
decision on British Nuclear Fuels' Pounds 2.8bn plant until the autumn.
The question of whether to give the go-ahead to Thorp, which
environmentalists have labelled Britain's biggest white elephant, is one of
the most contentious environmental issues facing the government.
In a detailed report, commissioned last month, BNF claims that each week of
delay costs it Pounds 2.4m - its earlier estimate was Pounds 2m. It
originally expected to get a licence to start operating the plant in January
this year.
The report says a nine-month delay - to September - could cut more than
Pounds 90m off the total profit in the first 10 years of operation, which
BNF has estimated at Pounds 500m.
BNF adds in the report that if the government proceeds with a further
consultation it will cut the costs of delay by laying off some of the 1,750
staff who have been waiting to start up the plant.
BNF's figures assume that about a third of the costs of delay can be passed
to foreign customers under 'cost-pass-through' contracts. It is understood,
however, that this has not yet been raised with customers - if they
resisted, the costs of delay could be higher.
Ministerial backing for more consultation follows recent advice from the
attorney-general that the government would run the risk of judicial review
on its eventual decision, prompted by legal action from pressure groups, if
it were not seen to consider the economic case for the plant.
The Department of the Environment is preparing a report setting out the
environmental and economic case for the plant, which could be published by
August. Collecting public responses could take at least two months.
Any consultation appears likely to stop short of the full public inquiry
which environmental groups such as Greenpeace have demanded. BNF has said in
the past that it sees no need for further assessment, but last night it
declined to comment.
Energy economists such as the Sussex University-based Science Policy
Research Unit have criticised BNF's claim that abandoning the plant would
lose the UK Pounds 900m in the next 10 years.

A LARGE section of the coal industry could be saved by early privatisation
and by a government attack on the 'duopoly' exercised by the electricity
generators, says a paper published by the Institute of Economic Affairs
yesterday.
Professor Colin Robinson, writing in the Economic Affairs magazine
yesterday, says the government has taken virtually no steps to privatise
coal since the idea was first mooted in the mid-1980s.
The article comes amid growing concern that attempts by British Coal to
license off mines it no longer wants are unlikely to result in more than a
handful of pits being operated by private-sector companies.
Prof Robinson argues that any sensible form of privatisation has been made
difficult by the government privatising electricity supply first and
establishing just two generation companies out of the old Central
Electricity Generating Board.
The paper says the government's objectives should be to create competitive
coal and electricity markets.
It adds: 'Such steps are the key to coal privatisation and the survival of
an efficient coal industry in Britain. They will almost certainly happen one
day, for the protection of electricity consumers. But will they be taken in
time to save the British coal industry?'

FT  24 JUN 93 / Postponement will fuel plant's costs: Implications of
further public consultation for the reprocessing centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels' estimates of the cost of delaying the start-up of the
Thorp reprocessing plant have risen several times since last year, and
environmental groups want a public inquiry into the environmental, economic
and diplomatic issues raised by the plant.
BNF puts the cost of a nine-month delay at at least Pounds 2.4m a week,
hitting profits for the year to March 1993 by nearly Pounds 70m.
Mr Clive Bates of Greenpeace, the pressure group, said yesterday that BNF's
UK customers 'might gain from the delay, so the true cost to the UK economy
could be lower than its figures suggest'.
BNF originally expected Thorp, which is intended to extract reusable
plutonium and uranium from used nuclear fuel, to get the go-ahead in
January.
Its 10-page report prepared last month bases its calculations on a
hypothetical nine-month delay until September 1993. This could correspond to
the timetable for a decision if the government proceeds with a further round
of consultation, as appears likely.
Such a delay would cut more than Pounds 90m off the total profit of Pounds
500m expected in the first 10 years, it argues. The report puts the total
cost of delay over the 39 weeks at Pounds 150m.
The largest part of this, Pounds 90m, is the cost of labour and maintenance
for Thorp. BNF puts the cost of its 1,750-strong team - 660 contractors and
1,090 staff - at Pounds 5m a month, and the cost of steam and electricity to
heat the plant at Pounds 1m a month.
A further Pounds 13m is due to labour and service on the effluent treatment
plants connected to Thorp. Thorp's share of the Sellafield site's overheads
makes up an additional Pounds 18m, or Pounds 2m a month. BNF has also added
the Pounds 11m estimated costs of extending the life of the storage ponds
used to receive customers' fuel.
Postponement of operations also means that payment of some customer fees
would be delayed - the report puts the financing costs at Pounds 15m. Some
contracts also contain a penalty clause if reprocessing is delayed, which
could add Pounds 3m.
However, the report assumes that BNF can claw back some Pounds 53m of this
total from customers under the terms of its 'cost-pass-through' contracts,
which make up about 60 per cent of its order book.
It is understood that BNF has not yet opened discussions with foreign
customers on whether they would accept an increase in costs because of
delay. The earliest contracts signed with Thorp, including those with
Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the electricity generators, as well
as some with Japanese utilities, are at fixed prices.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Call for cuts shocks London hospital chiefs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG CUTS in the number of hospitals providing specialist services in London
and the south-east were recommended by a series of government-appointed
reviews yesterday.
Publication of the reviews - the latest move in a delicate government
strategy aimed at bringing about extensive bed closures in London - provoked
protests from hospitals threatened by the proposals.
Yesterday's specialist review reports added to doubts about the future of
famous institutions such as Harefield heart hospital In Uxbridge, the Royal
Marsden cancer hospital in south-west London and St Bartholomew's in the
City.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, stressed that no decisions on the
transfer of services or hospital closures would be made on the basis of the
review recommendations alone. She said they added a further perspective to
the forthcoming changes to London's health services, but 'they do not paint
the final picture'.
It is a picture that must have become deeply confusing for many Londoners.
Last October a government-appointed inquiry under Sir Bernard Tomlinson
recommended hospital closures and a shift of resources to family-doctor and
community services.
Mrs Bottomley accepted the thrust of the Tomlinson report in February, with
detailed decisions awaiting further work, including the specialist reviews.
But in some cases the reviews have reached contrary conclusions to Tomlinson
and since - unlike Sir Bernard - they extended their investigations to outer
London and the home counties, more hospitals have been drawn into the
restructuring net.
The overall message of the reviews - which examined cardiac, cancer, renal,
neurosciences, children's and plastics and burns services - is that London
and the south-east have an excessive number of relatively small units
providing specialist services.
On cancer services, for example, the review finds that many of the 15
specialist cancer centres within the M25 are only half the size of
comparable units elsewhere in Britain, often lacking a full range of modern
equipment and medical expertise. It envisages eight bigger centres.
The survival of individual hospitals in the market-based National Health
Service structure depends on income from contracts. So the loss of
specialist services envisaged in the review could affect the viability of
many hospitals - including some that survived the Tomlinson analysis intact.
Mrs Bottomley is aware of the sensitivity of the decisions that she and
London's four regional health authorities will have to start making later
this year. She quickly made clear yesterday, for example, that she did not
see any prospect of moving the internationally renowed Harefield hospital in
the near future.
The public expenditure climate presents Mrs Bottomley with an even more
fundamental problem. Developing new, high-quality specialist services would
be expensive, with little to be recouped from selling surplus hospital sites
in the present property market.
Professor Michael Besser, chief executive of St Bartholomew's, who is
opposing his hospital's amalgamation with the Royal London on the latter's
site, calculates that it could cost between Pounds 150m and Pounds 300m to
combine the two hospitals without undermining the quality of services.
Funding concerns were also expressed by Prof Sir Colin Dollery, pro
vice-chancellor for medicine and dentistry at London University. He said
that given the country's financial difficulties the lack of financial
analysis in the reviews was a 'matter of deep concern'.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Minister hints at M-way permits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTORISTS were yesterday given a strong hint that the government is shifting
away from electronic tolls towards annual permits as the best way of raising
extra money for motorway building.
Until recently Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, maintained that the
fairest method of charging for motorway use was through electronic tolls.
Yesterday he told a transport conference in London: 'Electronic tolling
offers much more flexibility in the long run, but probably won't be
technologically achievable until at least 1998.
'So if we are going to move fast to get the benefits that road pricing
offers, then vignettes (annual permits displayed in the windscreen) are the
most realistic option.'
Last month the government published a green paper exploring the options for
introducing motorway charges as a means of funding road infrastructure
expansion.
At a meeting in Luxembourg last weekend European Community transport
ministers agreed a package allowing countries to introduce annual permits
costing up to Ecu 1,250 (Pounds 979) for lorries using their motorways, with
the option of introducing permits for cars.
Pressure for the EC deal was led by Germany, which faces heavy costs in
providing infrastructure for transit traffic but receives little in return.
Nine member states including Britain are considering the introduction of
motorway charges to raise more money. Germany, Belgium, Denmark, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg plan to introduce vignette systems in January
1995.
Mr MacGregor said the introduction of vignettes to Britain would require
primary legislation, so it could not come quickly. The earliest feasible
date would be 1995.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Early Caxton book is shunned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIE'S held its best auction of printed books and manuscripts in London
for many years yesterday and suffered a grave disappointment when the two
star lots failed to find buyers.
Christie's expected bids above Pounds 400,000 for 'The Recuyell of the
Histories of Troy', the first book printed in English. It was produced by
William Caxton in Bruges in 1473, three years before he set up in
Westminster Abbey. There was no interest, however, probably because leading
British and US libraries have copies and continental European museums do not
take Caxton very seriously.
The book came from the collection of the Marquess of Bath, who was selling
18 duplicates from the library at Longleat House. All the rest sold - for a
total of Pounds 707,500.
A bigger disappointment was the failure to find a buyer for a copy of 'The
Chroniques de France', printed in Paris in 1493 by Antoine Verard, with
numerous woodcuts to increase its appeal. It is an excellent example of the
transition from manuscript to printed book. But the best bid was Pounds
460,000, well below the estimate of Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 700,000.
The auction totalled Pounds 1.87m, with a top price of Pounds 342,500 for a
1560 edition of Luther's Bible translated into German.
The demand for Impressionist and modern art was confirmed at Sotheby's
yesterday when 43 works owned by a Californian collector sold for Pounds
1.5m, with just 10 per cent bought in. 'Notre Dame' by the overlooked
'Orphic' artist, Kupka, beat its forecast at Pounds 238,000. The general
sale brought in Pounds 2.9m with 19.5 per cent unsold and a top price of
Pounds 139,000 for 'La Lecture dans le Jardin' by Henri Lebasque.
Sotheby's main Impressionist auction on Tuesday evening was its best in
London since November 1990 with a total of Pounds 20.35m.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Insurers win accounting exemption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE companies have been made exempt from some requirements of FRS 3,
the new accounting standard on the profit and loss account, through a change
published yesterday.
The action, the first modification of a published financial reporting
standard issued by the Accounting Standards Board, reflects the concern of
insurers that compliance would have forced radical changes to their accounts
twice within three years.
FRS 3 is imposing a fundamental change in many companies' accounts, but
insurance companies also face modifications as a result of new legislation
on their accounts to be introduced following a European Community directive.
The amendment for insurance companies and groups will exempt them from
calculating gains and losses on disposals of investments by reference to
their carrying amount in the accounts, and from showing any gains and losses
in the profit and loss account or statement of total recognised gains and
losses.
The change will be reconsidered once details of the new EC insurance company
accounts legislation - to be circulated by the DTI - are known. The
proposals were first highlighted in Fred 5, a draft accounting standard
issued in March this year.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Carmakers told to learn from Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAILURE TO absorb lessons from Japanese carmakers in the UK could lead to
the demise of many small and medium-sized suppliers to the vehicle industry,
Mr George Simpson, chairman of Rover, told MPs yesterday.
He said that the Japanese companies' entry into the market had had a big
effect on upgrading the quality and productivity performance of some larger
companies in the UK motor and components industry.
However, unless the big components companies passed on the lessons learned
from their Japanese customers, many suppliers could disappear, Mr Simpson
told the Commons trade and industry committee.
The committee is inquiring into the competitiveness of UK manufacturing
in-dustry.
The 'important role' which the larger companies had to play in passing on
their skills derived from the widespread restructuring going on in the
industry.
Most carmakers had sharply reduced the number of their direct component
suppliers, Mr Simpson said. Smaller and medium-sized companies were becoming
suppliers to the larger 'first-tier' component groups.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Wales wins Pounds 42m circuits plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correpsondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THOUSAND jobs are expected to be created in south Wales by a new Pounds
42m electronics plant being set up by Asat (UK), a subsidiary of QPL
International Holdings of Hong Kong, an electronic components maker.
The 110,000 sq ft factory, to be built on a greenfield site near Crumlin in
Gwent, will be on the same Pen-y-Fan industrial estate as Aiwa (UK), the
Japanese electronics company which this week announced a Pounds 27m
expansion of its plant, with a planned increase of nearly 500 in its
workforce.
Asat will base its European headquarters at the new plant, which will
assemble and test integrated circuits. Construction of the factory, on a
site owned by the Welsh Development Agency, is expected to start in late
summer with the first production about 12 months later. Mr Steve Byars,
chief executive of QPL in the UK, said yesterday Asat hoped that within two
years it would be half way to its target of 1,000 jobs.
The project is being backed by regional selective assistance from the Welsh
Office. The amount of aid has not been disclosed but Mr Byars described it
as significant.
The parent company QPL was founded in Hong Kong 11 years ago and the group
has grown rapidly to a worldwide workforce of about 3,700.
Another QPL subsidiary, Newport Wafer-Fab, was set up at Newport, Gwent,
last December with SGS-Thomson, the French-Italian semiconductor group. The
company saved the wafer fabrication plant of Inmos, the subsidiary of
SGS-Thomson, and the workforce there is expanding.
Asat said the two Gwent companies would be able to provide their customers -
based in the UK, continental Europe and the US - with a 'one-stop shop' for
wafer fabrication, assembly and integrated circuit testing.
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, yesterday described this week's
announcements as 'a sign that recovery is coming to Wales, and that Wales
remains an attractive place for investors.'

FT  24 JUN 93 / Coastal 'no-go' zones rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MILNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD DONALDSON, chair-man of the government's inquiry into marine pollution,
will not recommend banning oil tankers and ships carrying hazardous cargo
from Britain's most environmentally-sensitive coastal waters when he reports
later this year.
The former Master of the Rolls signalled his views when he faced calls from
environmental organisations for stricter ship routing and the designation of
a large number of shipping exclusion zones to protect the coast.
English Nature, the statutory body which advises Whitehall on wildlife
protection, has identified 28 candidates for 'no-go' areas.
Lord Donaldson said the idea of banning ships from long stretches of the UK
coast was 'desirable but not possible' after hearing evidence that most of
the British coast was vulnerable.
He conceded that the international community might agree to the wholesale
designation of exclusion zones in the future - but not for 30 years.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds told the inquiry shipping
lanes should keep tankers 20 km offshore from the Scottish and
Northumberland North Sea coasts.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH international sanctions against Haiti went into force yesterday as the
country's former president, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide (pictured above),
agreed to meet members of the military government that ousted him, Reuter
reports from New York.
The sanctions - aimed at pushing the government into restoring democracy and
returning the president to power - took force a minute after midnight. They
impose a global oil and arms embargo against the Caribbean nation and freeze
financial assets held abroad by the government and the country's ruling
elite.
However, hopes of a quick settlement of the political crisis hit a stumbling
block later in the day when Fr Aristide demanded that talks with the
military rulers should centre on his speedy return to power.
A statement from Fr Aristide's government-in-exile said he would only meet
military leader General Raoul Cedras, who led the September 1991 coup in
which Fr Aristide was forced into exile, if the general agreed the talks
would centre on the president's immediate return and the departure of the
military high command and the Port-au-Prince police chief.

FT  24 JUN 93 / US durables orders down 1.6% in May: Decline raises new
doubts about momentum of growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW orders for durable goods fell 1.6 per cent between April and May,
raising fresh doubts about the momentum of US growth, the Commerce
Department reported yesterday.
The decline was the third setback in three months and was broadly based,
indicating a distinct softening of the industrial sector - even allowing for
the notorious volatility of the figures. The consensus forecast on Wall
Street had been for an increase in orders of about 1 per cent.
The recent decline, however, has only erased a portion of earlier gains:
orders are still nearly 9 per cent higher than in May last year.
Business activity is set to expand sluggishly in most parts of the country,
according to the Federal Reserve's latest 'beige book' survey of regional
economic trends, also published yesterday. It says manufacturing was 'steady
or improving' in most districts in May and June; retail sales were
'generally higher'.
However, businesses surveyed by the Fed said uncertainty about federal tax
increases and healthcare reform was causing delays in investment and the
hiring of new workers. Reports from retailers indicated that fears about
higher taxes could also be inhibiting a more vigorous revival of consumer
spending.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department revised down gross domestic
product for the first quarter to show growth at an annual rate of 0.7 per
cent rather than 0.9 per cent previously estimated. This compared with
growth at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent in the final quarter of last year.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the figures were disappointing and
showed that the economy was 'still performing under capacity'.
Most forecasters continue to predict a modest rebound of the economy this
quarter with GDP growing at an annual rate of at least 2 per cent. In the
second half, growth is expected to rise to an annual rate of closer to 3 per
cent.
But the weak tone of some recent data and gloomy reports from many corporate
chief executives have raised doubts about the plausibility of these
relatively optimistic forecasts.
'Most of our sectoral analysts are telling us that the economy is not that
firm,' said Mr Ed McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs in New York.
Retail analysts were especially gloomy because recent advances in sales
seemed to depend on promotions and discounts. Residential housing was one of
the few sectors showing definite signs of improvement.
Speculation about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy plans continued
yesterday. The New York Times said the Fed was still considering a small
increase in short-term rates despite improved inflation figures in May.
Many analysts, however, predict that the Fed will not move in the near
future unless the economy shows more definite signs of strength.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Election brings hope of change for Guatemala
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ELECTION this month of Mr Ramiro de Leon Carpio as Guatemala's president
has raised hopes of a lasting change in the practice of politics in a
country plagued by corruption and decades of political violence.
Mr de Leon, 51, was brought to power on June 6 by a coalition of unlikely
bedfellows: conservative businessmen, political parties and leftist groups.
Together they forced the Guatemalan military to support a return to
constitutional rule, after the ousting of President Jorge Serrano, who had
seized authoritarian powers, and to reject Mr Serrano's vice-president as
his successor.
While some observers have seen the victory of civil society as an example of
Guatemala's growing political maturity, the coalition may prove to be
nothing more than an ad hoc alliance of self-interest that is unlikely to
hang together.
The business community was well aware of the lost aid, the removal of US
trade benefits and the probable difficulties with Guatemala's loan
programmes with the Washington-based international financial institutions
that would have ensued if Mr Serrano had stayed in power.
But, with high popular expectations and suspicious armed forces, and without
a political party behind him, Mr de Leon, a former human rights ombudsman,
faces enormous obstacles.
Until his election, he was a fierce and uncompromising critic of the armed
forces, which have one of the worst human rights records in the western
hemisphere. Now as commander-in-chief, he has quickly changed tack.
He sacked General Jose Domingo Garca Samayoa, the defence minister who
initially supported Mr Serrano's coup, but replaced him with another
hardliner, General Roberto Perussina. The powerful army was weakened by the
two weeks of political turmoil in which it backed Mr Serrano and was unable
to prevent Mr de Leon's election, but it still demands respect.
Nevertheless, finding a modus operandi with his old adversaries in the
military, while meeting the expectations of national and international
opinion, will be a central preoccupation for his presidency.
'He is in a difficult position. But what he does have is immense moral
authority,' said a European diplomat.
Mr de Leon will need more than this to implement policy and it remains
unclear how he will be able to operate with the Congress that elected him.
The political parties had pledged to purge themselves of corrupt
congressman, but there is little evidence that they have done so. 'He runs
the risk of being overwhelmed by the mafias in Congress which he needs to
approve legislation and make reforms,' says Mr Gabriel Aguilera, a political
analyst.
In a televised address last Sunday, Mr de Leon said his priorities would be
to fight corruption and combat poverty. 'In 2 1/2 years we will not be able
to solve all of the country's problems but we will be able to solve some of
the most urgent ones.'
Guatemalans will be looking for swift improvements. Eight out of 10 live in
poverty, and only four in 10 have access to electricity. 'If he does not
fulfil our needs, we will all be out on the streets.' says Mr Byron Morales,
a union leader.
As an opposition leader, Mr de Leon was frequently critical of increases in
the price of basic services, and the strictures of the government's standby
agreement with the IMF. But he will need the support of the international
financial institutions to restore confidence after recent instability.
Mr de Leon has so far been slow to put together a cabinet and vague about
what he proposes to do. But he is still riding a wave of popularity not seen
since the election of Mr Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo as president in 1986.
However, by the time Mr Cerezo left office his presidency was in disarray.
While few doubt Mr de Leon's integrity, he has his work cut out if he wishes
to be remembered as more than just another disappointment.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Senate gets down to debating deficit plan: President
Clinton's White House is fighting to hold the Democratic majority in line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate yesterday finally got down to the serious business of debating
and then, probably later this week, voting on its version of the Clinton
administration's deficit reduction plan.
The White House, more than conscious of the stakes both for the presidency
and for the credibility of its economic programme, has launched what is
known in basketball as 'a full court press' to hold the shaky 56-44
Democratic Senate majority in line.
Last week the administration allowed the Democrats on the finance committee
to work out their own compromise legislation to 'save' about Dollars 500bn
(Pounds 333bn) over the next five years by a combination of tax increases
and spending cuts, which, it claims, are now in roughly equal balance. This
week it has pulled out all the stops. President Bill Clinton and his wife
spent all Tuesday in White House meetings with Democratic senators,
interrupted only by a televised message to the US conference of mayors,
meeting in New York, and a quick lobbying excursion by Mrs Clinton to
Capitol Hill.
Over the last 48 hours Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, and Mr Leon
Panetta, the budget director, have delivered their own critiques of the
half-formed Republican alternatives, which seek deeper spending cuts and
smaller tax increases. Mr Clinton chipped in by saying the Republicans could
never forego tax breaks for the rich.
Yesterday, Ms Alice Rivlin, Mr Panetta's deputy, took to the New York Times
in an article headlined 'Where is the old Bob Dole?' She contrasted what she
said was the Senate minority leader's longstanding commitment to responsible
deficit reduction with his alleged current penchant for 'misleading
rhetoric' and 'nitpicking'.
The purpose of the attack on the Republicans is to reinforce wavering
Democrats. Although most of the more conservative among them have now been
squared, liberals such as Senators Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, Edward Kennedy
of Massachusetts and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota have complained about the
depths of the proposed cuts in social and health programmes. On a different
tack, Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin is disappointed that many of Mr
Clinton's original proposals to help small business have been gutted by the
finance committee.
Most experts believe the Senate will pass the committee bill, with perhaps
some minor modifications on the floor. The only certain Democratic defector
is Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, who has consistently opposed the
administration on almost every big issue. Even Senator Dole has conceded
that the Democrats 'have the votes'.
The whole issue would then pass to an even more contentious conference
committee, which would have to reconcile the considerable differences
between the Senate version and that already through the House.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, finance committee chairman, has
already predicted the outlines of a deal between the two chambers. He
envisages an energy tax compromise somewhere between the Dollars 72bn
BTU-based levy passed by the House and the more modest Dollars 24bn general
fuel tax increase preferred by the Senate. He thinks the difference in cuts
in Medicare and other programmes can be split.
But the devil is likely to lie in the details. For example, Senator John
Danforth, the Republican from Missouri - which has a heavy concentration of
civil aviation - is lobbying hard to have aviation fuel exempted from any
increases in energy taxes simply because, he argues, the industry is in too
parlous a shape to absorb higher costs.
The funding of prestige science projects like the space station and the
supercollider, both endorsed by the president last week in more modified
form, is already under intense scrutiny, as witnessed yesterday when the
space station only survived a House motion to kill it by one vote. Some
northern Democrats feel that rewarding Texas, where much contracting for
both is carried out, is perverse since the state now has two Republican
Senators.
Two editorials in the New York Times yesterday encapsulated the
reservations. One urged that the space station be jettisoned as it was
unnecessary and too costly, while the second complained the Senate bill
sacrificed investment in the social and business infrastructure on the altar
of simplistic deficit reduction. This, it said, was 'too close to (last
year's presidential candidate Ross) Perot's myopia and two-thirds away from
what Mr Clinton wisely promised'.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Brazilian tax on cheques approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government was yesterday savouring the first victory for its
new economic plan, having won congressional approval for a new tax on
cheques.
The tax is a crucial part of the 'Real Plan' announced last week aimed at
plugging the Dollars 12bn (Pounds 8bn) public deficit. The government
estimates that the 0.25 per cent levy on all financial transactions will
bring in an extra Dollars 600m a month in revenue.
Fearful that it would not pass, the government had mobilised the entire
cabinet to lobby deputies and approved the liberation of funds for the pet
projects of various state governors, such as the Braslia metro and the Red
Line highway in Rio. But after repeated failures at securing a quorum last
week, the tax was approved easily on Tuesday night, with 308 votes in favour
and just 87 against.
The real triumph was for new finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who
has been talking with politicians day and night since announcing the plan,
which requires Congress to approve 13 projects and decrees. Mr Genebaldo
Correia, leader of the PMDB, Brazil's largest party, yesterday described the
approval of the tax as 'a vote of confidence in Fernando Henrique and his
plan'.
In a further boost to Mr Cardoso, a group of musicians and intellectuals
will fly to Brasila today to offer their support for the plan as part of the
'Decola Brasil' or 'Take Off Brazil' movement.
The tax must now be approved by the Senate, where the government has a
comfortable majority. Mr Cardoso hopes to implement it in August to earn an
extra Dollars 3bn this year.
However, the victory may prove more of a political than a fiscal success, as
Brazil's creative banking sector is busily working out ways around the
unpopular tax. The business community complains it is already overtaxed and
what is really needed is a crackdown on evasion. Mr Joseph Couri, a leading
Sao Paulo businessman, says: 'This is a recessive and inflationary tax
transferring money from the productive to unproductive sectors.'

FT  24 JUN 93 / Mexico's road scheme takes its toll: A privately built
network is charging so much that traffic shuns it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government set out in 1989 to achieve what no other country has
managed; persuade the private sector to build 2,500 miles of four-lane toll
roads in six years at little or no cost to the taxpayer.
Since then, about 1,500 miles of private toll roads have been completed, and
another 1,200 are being built, for a final cost of about Dollars 8.5bn.
Whereas Mexico used to have a handful of four-lane motorways, soon there
will 36. Travel times between key cities - Mexico City-Acapulco,
Monterrey-Laredo, Merida-Cancun - have been cut by half or more.
But cars and especially trucks are shunning the new roads, put off by some
of the most expensive tolls in the world. Cars pay on average the equivalent
of 25 US cents a mile to use a toll road in Mexico, four times that in the
US.
With construction costs also way above forecasts, banks have been left with
hundreds of millions of dollars of under-performing loans, and construction
companies with toll-road equity worth far less than book value. Some roads
are so under-used that it has been suggested that capital may have been
better spent on other infrastructure projects, such as electricity, water or
ports, all vital to Mexico's economic growth.
Losses have also made domestic investors reluctant to finance the remainder
of the government's master plan of 8,000 miles of motorways, considered
vital for Mexico to benefit fully from the proposed North American Free
Trade Agreement. While the government hopes foreign investors will finance
the remains of the programme by buying up securitised highway bonds,
interest so far has been cool.
The blame is being put squarely on the government. It set tariffs too high,
made concessions too short, and was too hasty and casual when making
estimates for costs and traffic. The estimate for the 160-mile
Acapulco-Cuernevaca highway, due to open next month, has increased from
2.46bn new pesos (Pounds 520m) to 5.8bn new pesos. On the Plan de Barrancas
toll road in the east of Mexico, traffic has been 55 per cent less than that
planned.
The banks, state-owned until the past two years, readily accepted their
political masters' orders. Although Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, turned
down 19 of the 20 projects it was offered, others, such as Bancomer and
Banca Serfin, the second and third largest, were all too happy to oblige.
'There was a strong suggestion from the government to support the
programme,' says an official whose bank was involved in financing several
important toll roads.
Even since the banks have been privatised, government pressure appears to
continue. On a recent trip to Oaxaca, President Carlos Salinas announced
that Alfredo Harp Helu, joint head of Banamex, would finance the toll road
to Oaxaca - a deal that has still to be finalised.
Construction companies generally earned margins on building the roads - of
about 25-30 per cent - that exceeded or equalled the proportion of the
capital they were required to invest in the toll roads. Consequently, the
probable return on their equity was, for many, less important than the
immediate construction profit they could make and report from building the
road.
The construction companies would like to sell their equity but, given
current problems, this would imply taking a loss. Mr Jose Luis Guerrero,
vice-president of finance of ICA, which has stakes in some 1,000 miles of
highways, admits that 'so far revenues have not been sufficient to sell off
our stakes' (bar one). But he is confident with time people will warm to
using toll roads, traffic will increase, and that 'the possibility of a
write-off does not exist in our opinion'.
The government has agreed to extend concessions to the toll roads for up to
30 years from an average of less than 10, when its revenue and construction
forecasts have proved inaccurate, (as has almost always been the case).
However, in some cases toll road revenues are not covering interest rate
costs. Unless traffic picks up fast, investors in those roads will never
recoup their capital, whatever the length of the concession.
The unpopular roads tend to be the shorter ones, or city by-passes that save
lorry drivers little time. A Transport Ministry official says it will offer
concessions to build extensions to such roads in the hope this will increase
traffic on them and will also, by February next year, enforce rules
preventing heavy lorries using free roads. But if toll roads continue to
lose money, the private sector, namely banks, and not the government would
have to recapitalise the projects at its own expense, according to the
official.
For new roads, the government is changing the way of awarding concessions,
granting subsidies if the road would not otherwise be profitable. The
government is now telling the bidding consortiums to estimate the costs of
construction, and make traffic forecast demands. It is also thinking of
offering concessions for a fixed period, and selecting a consortium that
offers the lowest tariff for the road, rather than the other way round, as
now.

MEXICO'S ruling party has proposed a controversial political reform that
would establish democratically elected self-government in Mexico City over
the next seven years, but postpone the direct election of the mayor until
1997, writes Lucy Conger from Mexico City.
Direct elections in Mexico City are a sensitive issue for the government
following the party's defeat in the capital in the 1988 federal elections,
when it lost the presidential race and both Senate seats.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Ecuadorean assets unfrozen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW YORK court has ordered the freeing of some of the Ecuadorean
government assets frozen in the US as part of a Swiss creditor's attempt to
secure repayment of a debt.
Most of the assets frozen by the court nearly two months ago in a
pre-judgment order continue to be held. They are awaiting a judgment
expected in August on the validity of the creditor's claim against the
government for repayment of Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m) of syndicated loans.
The loans were bought this year at a discount in the secondary market by the
Zurich-based Weston Compagnie et Finance.
According to the company's lawyer in New York Weston is appealing against
the freeing of Dollars 160,000 in assets which the central bank was holding
for the state telephone company.
The court confirmed the temporary freeze of Dollars 92,000 held by the state
airline, and reserved judgment on a further Dollars 400,000-Dollars 500,000
in frozen funds. Some Dollars 900,000 of assets held for Flopec, the state
shipping company, are in escrow pending the August judgment.
According to bankers in London, Weston is also pursuing a claim in the
English courts for repayment of Soviet-era debt issued by the Moscow-based
International Bank for Economic Co-operation.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Press hits back at Menem over ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S press has attacked President Carlos Menem's plan to send a bill
to Congress next week banning companies from owning more than one media
outlet in each regional market.
On Friday Mr Raul Burzaco, Mr Menem's press officer, criticised
'manipulation of the news by an important holding company in the federal
capital' - an allusion to the mass circulation newspaper Clarin. He added
that although the government respected press freedom, this 'also implies the
duty of guaranteeing the plurality of information'.
Mr Burzaco later added the government was considering rescuing a bankrupt
newsprint company to break Clarin's and the conservative daily La Nacion's
hold on the newsprint market.
The statements follow Clarin's publication last week of an interview with a
leading cleric who criticised the government.
Commentators agree that Mr Menem has respected press freedoms and has
repealed laws curbing free expression. However, they say he has also
resorted to intimidation, such as cutting government advertising, in
retaliation for negative press coverage.
Mr Martin Granowsky, an editor of Pagina 12, a left-wing opposition
newspaper, said 'it will be impossible for the government to get this bill
through Congress. What Menem is trying to do is reduce the credibility of
the media at a time when the courts, prosecutors, opposition parties and
Congress are all questioned.' A way to reduce journalism's credibility was
to show it as a monopoly that only wanted to make money.
However, Mr Menem has touched a raw nerve. Recent years have seen the
emergence of powerful media empires, led by the Clarin group. Their growth
follows Mr Menem's lifting of restrictions on the concentration of press
power when he began privatising government-owned radio and TV stations in
1989.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Looking to a 'new Japan': A more assertive Tokyo is sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN planning the party launched yesterday, Mr Tsutomu Hata has talked grandly
of a 'new Japanese politics' and even of a 'new Japan'. But he has avoided
specific policy statements, arguing that the details must come later.
This has allowed Mr Hata and his associate, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the Liberal
Democratic party's former secretary-general and backroom boss, to be placed
at various points on the political spectrum and has raised doubts about the
direction of Japanese foreign policy.
There is talk of a Hata coalition government with the Social Democratic
party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, which, by most definitions, is
left-wing. However, Mr Hata's group is generally perceived to be friendly
with Komeito (the Clean Government party), as close as Japan comes to the
religious right.
Underneath the lofty visions, Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa have indicated that a
prime reason for political reform is to create a more assertive Japan, a
government less willing to capitulate to the US on trade issues and more
active in contributing funds and personnel to international peacekeeping
operations.
If Mr Hata gained power after the July 18 election, which would only be in a
coalition, and if he is able to exercise influence, over time, Japanese
policies could change. Japanese nationalism would also be up for
redefinition, and a 'strong, self-confident Japan' could be interpreted by
Asian neighbours as a 'threatening Japan'.
Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa see themselves as internationalists, and the brochure
explaining the philosophy of Reform Forum 21, the precursor to the party
launched yesterday, is adorned with a large picture of the globe and a quick
rundown on the collapse of the Cold War and the emergence of an
'international society'.
But the two have relatively little international experience. They enjoy
holding 'salons' with diplomats and foreign correspondents in Tokyo, and
have clocked up frequent flier miles on work-related travel, but have spent
most of their lives cultivating local constituents and convincing companies
to donate generously.
A sign of Mr Hata's navety in front of an international audience came in
1987 during an address to US Congress representatives, when he suggested
that Japanese have longer intestines than Americans - he was defending
Japan's closed beef market at the time - and still claims he was
misunderstood.
As finance minister, Mr Hata was in favour of deregulation of financial
markets, though deregulation slowed last year, which, he said, was
inevitable during a post-bubble period in which vulnerable financial
institutions are unable to cope with rapid change.
'We will do business here with the same international rules as elsewhere. It
is wrong to think the government looks after the Japanese banks and they get
along somehow. We are always keeping an eye on banks to make sure they do
business in proper ways,' he said.
On the Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks, as agriculture minister and,
more recently, as finance minister, which is more significant, he has
defended Japan's closed rice market. An agriculture minister is paid to
defend the rice market, but other ministers are more able to express
opinions on this sensitive subject.
'I have been saying for about five years that the importance of the rice
issue in global trade talks is negligible,' Mr Hata said late last year.
'The US and European Community have the largest number of issues to solve.
Export subsidies are a more substantial issue.'
On foreign policy, both Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa say the present political
system has ensured that there is not enough debate of important issues, and
complain that politicians are dependent on bureaucrats for policy direction.
They joke that coherent foreign policy cannot be made by incoherent
politicians.
Mr Ozawa has been the more aggressive on foreign policy, and is seen by some
Japanese as being far too aggressive. He strongly supported the sending of
military personnel to the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, and was
keen for Japan to participate, in some form, during the Gulf war, when
minesweepers were eventually dispatched.
For a country which has generally wanted a low military profile since the
Second World war's end in 1945, Mr Ozawa's ideas are controversial. He
claims that he is not a hawk, but merely wants Japan to play an appropriate
role in the maintenance of 'international security'.

MR Tsutomu Hata, Japan's former finance minister, yesterday launched a new
political party which will mount the most serious challenge faced by the
ruling Liberal Democratic party since it came to power 38 years ago.
Mr Hata and 43 fellow renegades from the LDP launched the Shinseito or
Rejuvenation party with the aim of forming a coalition with the opposition
parties to dislodge the LDP in a general election on July 18.
Mr Hata said his party would try to form the core of an anti-LDP coalition
which would reform the political system to rid it of corruption and equip
Japan to play a more active role in international affairs.
He said: 'Our party was born to expedite a new wind, a new voice and a new
system.'
The main opposition parties were welcoming. Mr Sadao Yamahana, chairman of
the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition group, said he wanted
'extensive talks with the Shinseito to seek a unified policy approach'.
Mr Koshiro Ishida, chairman of the Komeito clean government party, said
there was common ground on which the opposition could collaborate.
The LDP will seek to divide the potential coalition partners, but its
leadership appears ineffective in the face of the mounting revolt. Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the beleaguered prime minister, merely said he doubted whether
such a coalition was wise.
The opposition groups are expected to open talks soon on an electoral pact
to minimise competition among them which could split the opposition vote and
benefit the LDP.
Mr Hata and Social Democratic party leaders dismissed as irrelevant their
differences on foreign and defence policy, particularly Japan's security
treaty with the US, which the Socialists are formally opposed to. These
differences will complicate the task of constructing a stable coalition.
The election was called after the Hata group's rebellion led to the
government's defeat last Friday in a no-confidence motion over its failure
to enact political reforms. The Hata group resigned from the LDP on Tuesday,
the day after the desertion of a separate group of 10 members.
Business leaders, who traditionally back the LDP, nevertheless gave Mr
Hata's group a guarded welcome, reflecting their belief that political
reform is overdue.
However a poll of business executives published in the Nikkei financial
newspaper found a large majority expected the political turmoil would hinder
Japan's recovery from its long economic downturn.
