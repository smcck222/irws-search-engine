FT  21 APR 93 / Leading Article: Prison leaks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUP 4, the private security company, appears to have neglected the golden
rule of prison systems throughout the world - to hang on to the prisoners.
During the first two weeks of providing prison escort services in East
Midlands, Humberside and Yorkshire, seven prisoners have either escaped from
the company's custody or been wrongly released. Others have failed to turn
up on time for court appearances. This leakage has provided an embarrassing
start to the UK's first private contract for escorting prisoners between
prisons, police stations and courts.
For Group 4, one of the largest security organisations in the world, these
are particularly embarrassing events. The company already runs Britain's
first privately managed prison, Wolds, and is bidding to manage Strangeways
prison, Manchester. It has assembled a strong management team to provide
custodial services by recruiting senior police and prison officers and Home
Office officials. And it has provided extensive training for its carefully
vetted staff - many with experience in the police, prison service or armed
forces - in special facilities which include a mock courtroom and cells.
Yet the company can rightly claim that not all the problems with prisoners
were its fault. Mr Derek Lewis, chief executive of the Prison Service
Agency, has blamed design flaws in escort vehicles built to Home Office
specifications for two escapes. The responsibility for one premature release
has been accepted by the magistrates' court concerned. And the information
needed to organise the complex movement of prisoners between 20 prisons, 71
police stations and 82 courts has been supplied late to Group 4.
Nor do the police and prison service have an unblemished record in safe
delivery of prisoners. More than 30 prisoners escaped from prison service
custody last year in the region covered by the Group 4 contract. The figure
for escapes from police custody is not available. In any case, the use of
police and prison officers to escort prisoners is a waste of highly-trained
staff who could be deployed more effectively on their mainstream duties.
Ministers now accept that introducing such a complex contract on one day was
unwise. A phased switch would have allowed the contractor to deal with
teething problems and ensure a timely flow of information. It would also
have allowed the 400 staff to be trained on the job, rather than in the pale
imitation of a training centre. The next contract to be awarded, for prison
escort services in London, will be introduced on a phased basis.
However, Group 4 has still to prove its competence in providing this
essential and high-profile public service. Failure to do so would pose a
grave threat to further contracting out of prison escort services, since the
company is one of the strongest bidders in this new market. The government
must therefore be certain that it does everything possible, on its side, to
ensure that the contract runs smoothly.

FT  21 APR 93 / Letter: A role for all in UK economic forecasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M V POSNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There are three issues of importance raised in the letters from Jeremy
Bray MP (April 7) and Wynne Godley (April 14). First, should the Treasury
'farm out' (to non-public service suppliers) some of its present modelling
and forecasting activity? Here, I believe that government must retain, close
to senior officials, ministers and parliament, a small team of experts who
can understand, interpret and 'play' the model, above all for policy
analysis and simulation. Provided this is done, it may be possible to
contract out some of the underlying technical work.
The second issue is whether the UK should continue to maintain, outside
Whitehall, but largely on public money, a high-grade technical capability
for this sort of work, using what are widely regarded as state-of-the-art
'scientific' methods. This has always been a matter of some controversy, but
I believe a very convincing set of arguments can be adduced in favour. The
benefit is not only for proper public debate on issues of government policy,
but also for the advance of our scholarly understanding of the way modern
economies work.
Third, there is the question of the proper balance between orthodoxy and
heresy, between fairly large 'teams' and more traditional scholars in the
privacy of their own garrets. There is no doubt that the orthodox scientific
establishment can sometimes be as ruthless as its political counterpart in
the excommunicatory scorn they pour on non-believers; it is splendid that
Wynne Godley (and others of the wise men) have survived this experience, and
those who helped sustain them deserve praise. But heretics can sometimes
display the same undesirable zealotry as their orthodox opponents, and I
detect some flavour of this in Wynne Godley's letter.
Insight, experience, courage, originality are very valuable in this, as in
all fields of scientific investigation. But we also must pursue rigorous
testing, meticulous attention to detail, the normal rather dreary routines
of conventional scientific endeavour. We cannot afford to cultivate 'a
thousand flowers' in this field, but we should be able to afford substantial
contributions from both Wynne Godley and those he chose to attack.

FT  21 APR 93 / Letter: External threats to America's competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL CONNORS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse ('Revolutionary talk in Wisconsin', April 19) reports
John Diebold talking of the need for a new word: 'infostructure'. It is
perhaps a testimony to the truth of the adage that nothing can stop an idea
whose time has come, that I came to a similar conclusion, independently,
last year when writing The Race to the Intelligent State (Blackwell
Business, 1993). I use the word, perhaps in a slightly broader sense than
does Mr Diebold, throughout the book.
It is curious, as your article suggests, that the US government should have
taken such a laisser-faire approach to the issue of integrated broadband
networks, which is generally thought to be of great significance to
America's future competitiveness; however, such a resolutely
non-interventionist attitude in the face of a growing problem is hardly
unprecedented. It was only, for example, the launch of Sputnik in 1957 which
propelled America into the space race and, to paraphrase Admiral Isoroku
Yamamoto (commander in chief of the Japan's war-time combined fleet), some
external threat is often needed to awaken the sleeping giant. If Mr Al Gore
is seeking an external threat to justify government initiative, he need
hardly look further than Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's plans for a
nationwide broadband network to serve the whole of Japan by 2015. The
Japanese do not share the American aversion to co-ordinated planning and
seem likely to ensure that the competitive stakes will remain high.

FT  21 APR 93 / Letter: Trade minister cites exporting as weak link in
corporate chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From RICHARD NEEDHAM MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The latest six-monthly survey of the pay of executives immediately
below board level published by your Jobs Column (March 31) includes a wide
range of executive functions, but as usual excludes exporting. The work of
the export executive demands a high level of commitment, training,
experience and, of course, reward.
The Jobs Column will no doubt say that it is merely reporting on the latest
of a series of surveys by a consultancy, and is not responsible for the
categories. Those who conducted the survey, if taxed in the same way, would
probably reply that exporting is not treated as a separate function in the
organisation of the majority of the companies they looked at.
But isn't that where the Jobs Column should come in? Jobs are exactly what
exporting is about. Jobs can be lost by firms which leave exporting to be
done by marketing and sales staff as a kind of optional add-on to the home
market. They are likely to find their home market eroded by foreign
competitors who are more far-sighted than they are. On the other hand, jobs
can be won by companies which take a strategic approach to exporting, as a
way of securing a wide sales base and an increased market share at home and
abroad.

FT  21 APR 93 / Decade of the deep discount: The rapid growth of cut-price
chains may change the face of UK food retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Ed discount store in Maidstone, Kent, the message on the signs is simple:
'We've cut the frills to lower your bills.' But Ed, and hundreds of other
discount stores opening all over the UK, are part of a trend that could
change the way British consumers shop.
Discount food shops are the fastest growing part of the UK retailing sector.
From only two discount chains at the beginning of the 1990s, the number has
now increased to 14. All are expanding rapidly and pose a serious challenge
to the UK's established food retailers.
'This is a fascinating time in retailing,' says Mr Alan Treadgold, retail
consultant at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'In the next 18 months we are
heading for a real culture clash between the high-margin retailers of the
1980s and the new formats.'
Share prices in the food retailing sector have fallen, on average, by about
10 per cent this year amid analysts' warnings that discounters will
intensify competition and start grabbing market share from the UK's 'big
three' - J Sainsbury, Tesco, and Argyll, owner of Safeway. These three had
hoped that the end of the recession would bring a return to the rapid sales
growth they enjoyed in the 1980s.
Institutional investors, which paid out hundreds of millions of pounds in a
series of rights issues in 1990 and 1991 to fund expansion by the superstore
operators, are nervous about any sign that returns on investment may be less
than projected.
Mr Philip Dorgan, retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank,
said: 'Investors have been worried for some time about how much investment
is going into food retailing. Since the City began to think the discounters
might pose a threat to superstores' margins it has been pushing the sell
button on the shares.'
Both the established food retailers and the City have been surprised by the
rapid rise of the discounters. In the 1980s, although many had tried and
failed, the only successful discount chains of any size in the UK market
were Kwik Save and Argyll's Lo-Cost. But in 1990, their effective monopoly
was broken by the arrival of Germany's Aldi and Denmark's Netto.
In the same year, Shoprite, an Isle-of-Man based company run by sons of one
of the founders of Kwik Save, launched into the underdeveloped Scottish
market. Later, several of the large grocery chains hit on the idea of
converting older, underperforming superstores into discount outlets -
spawning Gateway's Food Giant and Solo, Co-op's Pioneer and Shopping Giant,
and Asda's Dales format.
In recent months, the discount chains have accelerated their expansion
plans.
In January, Carrefour, the French retail giant, opened its first Ed (an
acronym for Europa Discount) store in Maidstone, Kent. Costco, the
third-largest operator of the US ultra-discount format known as 'warehouse
clubs', signed up two sites in the UK, which it hopes to open by the end of
the year.
Kwik Save said in February it would expand into Scotland and increase its
opening programme from 50 to 70 new stores a year.
Aldi, having previously concentrated on the Midlands and north of England,
announced a search for new sites in the south.
In March, Netto said it was looking for 100 sites in Scotland.
This month, cash-and-carry operator Nurdin &amp; Peacock said it would open two
US-style warehouse clubs in the UK.
The expansion of discount chains marks a move away from the style of food
retailing that flourished in the 1980s. For nearly two decades after the
abolition of resale price maintenance in 1964, when manufacturers lost the
right to fix the price at which their goods were sold in shops, the UK
grocery sector was driven largely by competition on price. That changed in
the 1980s with the growth of 'value-added' retailing from superstores, as
practised by the likes of Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway.
These retailers do not claim to have the lowest prices, but do claim to be
highly competitive while providing the most attractive 'offer' - a concept
that encompasses choice, quality, convenience, service, and shopping
environment.
They make their money from healthy operating margins (broadly speaking, a
measure of how many pence, before tax and interest, retailers make on each
Pounds 1 customers spend) which average close to 8 per cent - among the
highest in European food retailing.
But the recession has fostered a new price-consciousness in UK consumers. At
the same time, the top end of the grocery market became so dominated by the
big three that would-be entrants had to find new ways of operating.
Enter the discounters, which work on the opposite principle. Typical
operating margins are 2 per cent or less, but the stores make money by
shifting large volumes of goods. Both start-up and operating costs are kept
to a minimum by buying or renting cheap sites, spending little on technology
and fittings - with goods often sold from cardboard boxes on warehouse
racking - stocking only a limited range, and employing few staff.
The formula can be a powerful one. Efficient discounters can turn round
their entire stock every 20 days or less, so they have often sold stock
before they pay their suppliers for it. That means their working capital for
expansion is effectively provided by their own suppliers.
City observers agree that discounters are likely to double their annual
sales from between Pounds 3.5bn and Pounds 4bn last year, to Pounds 7bn to
Pounds 8bn by 1996. Their share of the grocery market is forecast to rise
from about 9 per cent to 14 or 15 per cent during the same period.
That will have a big impact on the shape of the food market in the UK.
Shoppers are likely to benefit from increased price competition throughout
the sector.
They will also be able to choose from an unprecedented range of formats,
according to the relative importance they attach to price, choice and
quality. For there are several different types of discounters, from the
limited-range deep discounters which stock only 500 to 1,000 lines at the
lowest prices, to the discount supermarkets who offer 1,000 to 5,000 lines
at slightly higher prices but compensate by offering greater choice. Then
there are the discount superstores, usually conversions of conventional
superstores, which try to combine discount prices with the kind of range
offered by a Sainsbury or Tesco.
But increasing competition, limiting margin growth and damping food price
inflation spell problems for existing retailers. Significant casualties are
predicted as the discounters increase their market share  - although opinion
is divided on which companies will be worst hit.
Some believe it will be the big superstores. 'Discounters will have an
increasing impact on the big three within a year or two,' says Mr Robert
Clark, director of Corporate Intelligence Group, a retail research company.
'Even now there are individual superstores that are sweating badly.' The
crucial question is whether limited line formats can make their prices so
tempting that even committed superstore shoppers cannot ignore them.
Bigger losers may be what analysts have termed the 'soft targets': small,
independent grocers; the co-operatives; the struggling Gateway chain; and
John Lewis's Waitrose group, which, as a partnership, does not have the same
access to cheap money as quoted retailers on the stock market and is falling
behind in terms of expansion and new technology.
Mr Bill Currie, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, believes the toughest
competition, however, will be within the discount sector itself, as more
efficient limited-line operators continually lower prices in an attempt to
drive out higher-cost competition.
Whichever companies fall victim, the new focus on price is likely to shift
the balance of power in UK food retailing. If the 1980s were the decade of
the gleaming superstore and the delicatessen, Kwik Save, Shoprite and other
discounters may make the 1990s the decade of the Day-glo sign and the
warehouse rack.

FT  21 APR 93 / Letter: Definition of waste is impractical and costly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The dilemma highlighted for the scrap industry by Gillian Tett ('Waste
legislation that dealers want dumped', April 10/11) is only one of the
problems to be encountered with the Environmental Protection Act. The
Environment Department might well say that these regulations are being
introduced to ensure that Britain has the highest environmental standards.
But is this practical and can we afford the final cost?
Most reasonable people would expect waste to be useless and undesirable  -
unfortunately this is not so; waste is now defined as 'a substance which is
unwanted (by the producer) or surplus, or anything which is discarded as
being broken, worn out, contaminated or otherwise spoiled', etc. The fact
that the discarded material has a value and is to be recycled or reused does
not prevent it from being controlled waste.
Many items such as sub-soil, demolition hardcore, sawdust and shavings are
of value to farmers but it would be illegal for these to be provided if the
farmer does not hold an appropriate licence to hold or dispose of these
materials.
A shopkeeper providing a customer with an empty box to carry away their
purchases is now liable to a hefty fine.
It is of course quite legal for the demolition hardcore to be used as
landfill, but a farmer seeking hardcore would have to buy stone delivered
from a quarry. Does this help the environment?
In my view this legislation is ill conceived. It makes criminals out of
legitimate businessmen. It is causing an unnecessary increase in disposal
and other costs and will result in an increase in fly-tipping.
How can a government pledged to deregulation and to reducing red tape
consider introducing such legislation?

FT  21 APR 93 / While Bosnia burns: While Bosnia burns - The slowness of the
world's responses to the war is part of its tragedy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the worst thing about the Bosnian tragedy, for those who are not its
direct victims, is its agonising slowness. If only it were over. Of course
one would still feel bad when thinking about it, but that probably would not
be all that often, just as one no longer thinks all that often about Biafra
or East Timor.
The slowness of events is painful because it prolongs the moral and
political dilemmas. But actually that is a luxury. It means there are still
opportunities to act. Something might yet be saved, by a right decision now,
from the consequences of all those earlier wrong decisions.
The trouble is, the processes by which the so-called 'international
community' decides on any course of action are even slower than the war 'on
the ground'. Take the 'no-fly zone' for example. This was proposed in a
Turkish peace plan as early as last August. Other governments gradually came
round to it. After much discussion and hesitation it was adopted by the
United Nations Security Council in October. Then it turned out another
resolution was required before any action could be taken to enforce it. The
whole process had to be repeated with all the same hesitations. Only this
week have aircraft with a mandate to enforce the no-fly zone at last been
deployed.
A similar process has now begun for other measures: air strikes against Serb
artillery or other targets; lifting the embargo on arms supplies to the
Bosnian army. Last week, when Lady Thatcher came out with her clarion call
for the latter measure, British ministers dismissed it as 'emotional
nonsense'. Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said much the
same. By Monday, however, it was on a list of options being considered, or
at least 'not ruled out', by both governments.
Of course there are good arguments against this course of action, as there
are against every course of action in this abominable situation.
It would escalate, intensify and perhaps even prolong the fighting, without
guaranteeing a different end result.
It would, as Zoran Pajic, professor of international law at Sarajevo
University, has pointed out, 'almost certainly enforce rather than heal the
ethnic division of Bosnian territory, since better equipped Bosnian forces
could improve their share of the Vance-Owen map but little more'.
Some of the weapons would almost certainly fall into the wrong hands; while
even in the 'right' hands some of them might well be used for vengeance
killings or other atrocities.
By lifting the embargo on supplies to one side only the UN would abandon
neutrality, thereby exposing UN forces and other personnel now on the ground
to retaliation and so forcing them to abandon their current humanitarian
mission.
That last argument seems the weakest. The UN is already not neutral, as its
sanctions policy shows. Humanitarian relief work already requires military
protection - why else are UN forces in Bosnia? And the UN relief effort
could be kept clearly distinct from military intervention so long as all the
fighting on the ground is still being done by local forces.
The alternative urged by many idealists - notably Jane Sharp of the
Institute of Public Policy Research* - is a full-scale military intervention
to establish a 'UN protectorate' or another form of international
administration for the whole of Bosnia. The pros and cons are argued out in
the latest issue of the admirable War Report** - formerly Yugofax.
The strongest argument in favour of a protectorate is that such an
arrangement offers the only hope of putting Bosnia together again under a
regime which would allow all the survivors to return to their original towns
and villages and rebuild their homes in confidence and safety. That is very
attractive, but the arguments against seem to me overwhelming.
It is very unlikely that enough countries would be prepared to provide
enough troops, police and administrators for such a long and open-ended
task.
The force, even if welcomed initially, would almost inevitably encounter
resistance from Serb and Croat forces in some areas, and would thus find
itself dragged into a guerrilla war.
The states carrying out the intervention would not necessarily be as
idealistic or enlightened as those now calling for it. There would almost
certainly be confusion about the objectives.
If troops do go in, it will most likely be to enforce, not a UN trusteeship,
but a version of the Vance-Owen plan. In this case external forces will be
responsible for keeping people away from their original homes, or for
delivering them to the tender mercies of their ethnic rivals - policing a
mosaic of internal borders without being in a position to guarantee human
rights, or even human life, within the different provinces.
Lifting the embargo would be a better bet, if only it were not done
grudgingly and passively but as part of an active strategy to help the
Bosnian army, supplying it with the weapons it needs and using Nato air
power to assist its operations. (The more Nato is involved in planning and
carrying out the operations, the better the chance of controlling them,
averting fresh atrocities and a mass exodus of Bosnian Serbs.)
Fat chance. On past form it will be at least six months before any actual
weapons are delivered, by which time there may be no Bosnian army left to
deliver them to.

A commission set up by Channel 4's Dispatches to investigate the
effectiveness of prison as a deterrent has concluded that far fewer people
should be locked up. The six-strong group, including a judge, a chief
constable and the former chairman of the Bar Council, declares that for most
criminals 'prison is neither a remedy nor a deterrent; it is the most
expensive and least effective solution'. The commission not only studied
alternatives to prison but compared British and German experiences (9.00).
Let's hope Episode 2 of Living Islam is less packed and peripatetic than
Episode 1, otherwise we shall end up more confused than when we started
(8.10 BBC2). Today's programme looks back to the great Islamic empires of
the Ottomans and Moguls in the 16th century. Richard Hamilton made the
seminal collage 'Just What Is It That Makes Today's Homes So Different, So
Appealing?' (the man like Charles Atlas, the woman like Mitzi Gaynor, both
surrounded by consumer durables) in 1956. Today on QED Hamilton uses a
computer to make 5,000 laser prints of a 1993 electronic collage (9.30
BBC1).

FT  21 APR 93 / Arts: Welsh 'Tristan' in London - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh National Opera's Tristan und Isolde, staged by Yannis Kokkos and
conducted by Charles Mackerras, opened in Cardiff two months ago. Now at the
end of its tour it has arrived in London together with the company's La
Favorite, for two performances this week at Covent Garden. Tristan was last
seen in London (at the Coliseum) in 1985 and any performance is an operatic
event; the disappointment with Monday's, though, was very real.
Max Loppert's first-night review found this Tristan fine in parts,
unsatisfying elsewhere. In the larger expanses of the Royal Opera House one
fancies the gap between the good and the less good may have been emphasised.
Kokkos's sets, tailored for touring, fit well enough, though they echo just
a little too closely the same designer's Pelleas et Melisande so recently
seen there, definitely to the detriment of the Wagner. The details of his
production, though, seem negligible; an essay in the WNO programme may be
full of fine words and all the right theatrical references, but very little
of that has been translated into stage action. Despite Kokkos's talk of a
'spiritual choreography', of creating 'bodily Leitmotifs which form a
counterpoint to those of the music' most of the gestures and movements would
hardly seem de trop in a concert performance.
The emphasis then is placed even more firmly than usual in Tristan on the
music, standing or falling by the durability of the principals and the
coherence of the conducting. For long stretches in the first two acts on
Monday, however, that coherence was lacking. There is no doubt that Jeffrey
Lawton's Tristan is the most potent dramatic force, building from
unprepossessing beginnings in the first act, gaining in authority through a
distinctly tepid second-act love duet to a concentrated and intensely moving
monologue in the third. The sound was never beautiful, nor did it pretend to
be, but Lawton's concentration and his expressive honesty were much more
than adequate compensation. His vividness gave an unusual tilt to the final
act, with the Liebestod quite overshadowed; Anne Evans's Isolde was always
carefully sung and painstakingly phrased, yet small-scale and unexpectedly
detached, lowering rather than raising the emotional temperature in the
majority of her interventions.
Though Della Jones's Brangane was certainly committed dramatically she
always sounded inappropriate in that role, while Richard Paul Fink's
Kurwenal was strongly sung, without ever becoming eloquent. Peter Rose's
Mark took the prize for German diction, and his firm delivery gave a lift to
the end of the second act after the limpness of its climax. What the
performances demanded was a corporate sense of purpose, yet Mackerras's
account of the score seemed generally piecemeal and excitable with only an
approximate sense of line. The lack of a convincing Wagnerian sonority in
the strings and wind blending, and the uncertainty of some of the solo
playing undermined stability yet more; watching such a music drama unfold
while holding its audience at arm's length was altogether a troubling
experience.

FT  21 APR 93 / Arts: Goehr's 'Colossos or Panic' - Music in Boston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Goehr is certainly not the only visitor to the Prado to have been
struck by Goya's image of a gigantic male figure, naked and burly, striding
through the air to the great consternation of travellers he seems not to be
noticing. Nor is Goehr alone, surely, in wanting to release this painting
from its frozen time and from its silence: to see, as it were, the film from
which it is a still. But where most of us might think of massive chords for
the walking giant and an uproar of shrieks and whinnies for the terrified
people below and behind him, Goehr's response to the vision is a 'symphonic
fragment' that preserves a glimmering gentleness throughout most of its 25
minutes. Commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the piece was given
its first performance by them under Seiji Ozawa in Boston's Symphony Hall
last week.
Goehr's title, Colossos or Panic, perhaps provides a clue, in suggesting a
viewpoint beyond the obvious. To react to the painting with hugeness and
screams would be to align oneself with the scattering crowd, to share in the
panic. Goehr, with characteristic care and calm in his voice, chides us for
joining the sheep. No, we must remain alert and questioning. There will be
moments of awesomeness, when the sky visitor seems real and a threat -
moments like the sinister intrusion of Fafner-like music towards the end of
the piece - but more generally the view will be from outside the frame,
observing the scene and trying, through music and in music, to comprehend
what it may mean. Unfreezing the image's time would be useless if it yielded
only a Hollywood epic; better to listen to its implicit questions about mob
behaviour, and to hear them voiced by a mob of another kind, one of
orchestral musicians.
If hysteria is thus the subject rather than the manner of the piece, it is
altogether appropriate that the journey should be by way of earlier sites of
musical delirium. Judiciously, because composers cannot pretend to be
prophets any more, the music implies Skryabin in its flights of repetition.
At one point there is a close encounter with Schoenberg's E major Chamber
Symphony. And repeatedly the first of the two movements hovers towards a
waltz rhythm that suggests the mania of Ravel's La Valse. Yet all the time
we are being quiet. We are watching and waiting. The music seems to be drawn
in strokes of light, playing over the instruments. The ideas are usually
brief, often pregnant, and yet nearly always surprising - surprising by a
change of colour, an unexpected interval, a luminescence of harmony.
What is also surprising, even puzzling, is the form of the piece. Goehr
tells us that his first idea was of a single movement that dissolves, but
that he then added a shorter, more continuous extension, in a more settled
tempo and in a different colour, marked especially by the entrance of the
celesta in a recurrent motif of toy oscillations. The wondering and the
wandering go on, until there is another dissolve. The enigma is redoubled,
because the opportunity for a solution is taken and also courteously
declined.
Colossos or Panic is made with a typical generosity to musicians and to
listeners: it plays well (the loose scoring provides splendid opportunities
for musicianship, as many of the Boston players showed) and it sounds well.
If, nevertheless, it is an elusive piece, that may be because of Goehr's
wariness of the colossal, the imposing, as an ideal for himself or for his
music.

FT  21 APR 93 / Arts: Lion in the Streets - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Canadians are coming. Now, Judith Thompson's perplexing play Lion in the
Streets replaces Brad Fraser's thriller Unidentified Human Remains and the
True Nature of Love at the Hampstead Theatre. Both are fractured works, high
on impact and low on plot. Thompson's play presents civilisation and its
discontents; it makes strange, compelling drama.
Lion in The Streets comprises a series of linked, loosely interrelated
contemporary scenes set in Toronto, that clean city by the lake so polluted
it never freezes. But this is not the Toronto of Bay Street commerce, Younge
Street style or Oakville money. Thompson creates basic neighbourhood feel,
and then fashions scenes of unmediated emotion from instinctual reactions.
Her characters are animal then rational, flickering between both.
The play develops themes of violence and personal identity from her 1989
collection The Other Side of the Dark. It holds its secrets until the final
scene. Isobel, a portuguese girl, has been searching throughout the play for
the man who killed her, the lion in the streets.
She finds him: 'I love you, you took my last breath . . . give me back my
life,' she says, then to the audience, 'I came back. I want you all to take
your life, I want you all to have your life.' She acts throughout the play
as a chorus, speaking to characters who sometimes hear, a voice warning
about the need to live a connected, consistent life and the pain of not
doing so.
Each scene contains within itself its own genesis, like a course in Freudian
psychotherapy. Thompson takes her characters back to primal scenes of
childhood, forward to fantasies of sex and death, and sideways into the
rational world. The result is a disjointed play which stresses the gaps and
processes that operate between people in all relationships.
Here are characters pushed to the side of their own lives: a broken
marriage, a father's death, or a local Parent Association meeting which
accuses the teacher of fostering 'lifetime sugar addiction.' Another
character discovers she has leukemia and dreams of being Ophelia, floating
away down the Humber; a priest receives absolution from a gay confessee
('You can be honest with me, father, I'll forgive you . . .'); a journalist
is so taunted by the sexual fantasies of a cerebral palsy interviewee that
she beats her up.
The six actors (Shirley Henderson, Beth Goddard, Julie Legrand, Kerry Shale,
David Sibley and Sonia Ritter) play 26 characters; the action is given
purpose and shape by Matthew Lloyd's intelligent direction, which makes
sense of each scene, as a good psychotherapist does. Jessica Tyrwhitt's fine
design can be a park, nightclub, office or construction site, crammed onto
the Hampstead stage.

FT  21 APR 93 / Arts: Period drama by the yard - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doesn't your heart sink as yet another pristine steam locomotive fills the
screen, and yet another cast of superbly professional British actors in yet
another wardrobe load of period costumes begins to push yet another
expensive collection of oh-so-accurately dated luggage around the platform?
So does mine. Aren't your nerves at twanging point waiting for the first
showroom-condition drophead coupe? Mine too. Can you take even one more
cigarette case being loaded from a scrupulously contemporary Players' packet
without screaming? One more Fair Isle pullover? One more spotless milk float
which manages to appear in every street shot throughout 55 minutes of drama
even though the action switches from London to Bristol? Nor me.
The appearance on BBC2 of The Second Heimat (reviewed last week) serves to
show how depressingly uninspired, restricted and uninspiring most British
television drama has become. The overwhelming proportion is either old
fashioned, cosy, whimsical or nostalgic, and much of it is all four. Even
those of us scarcely into middle age would seem to have reason for wondering
whether the golden age of British television drama is now over. Remembering,
as we do, a time when the BBC drama department alone was using a great crowd
of creative people including David Mercer, William Trevor, James MacTaggart,
Jack Gold, Michael Frayn and Dennis Potter (while he was still writing about
the present day) we do wonder whether yet another 1940s' detective series,
or yet another '50s series laced with early rock-and-roll, is a fair
substitute - however authentic the enamel advertisement hoardings or the
paper petticoats.
Of course The Second Heimat is itself a period piece, even though the period
happens to be the 1960s, but no one could accuse author Edgar Reitz of being
old fashioned, cosy, whimsical or nostalgic. More important, it was not
ordered up by the yard, or the hour, by a crowd of shoulder-padded
executives whose marketing men had used their lap-tops to decide that what
was really needed for the ratings was another period detective series.
Heimat is the inspiration of one man who has a passion to tell us the story
of his time and his life and the way he feels about it. In dispiriting
contrast, Britain's home-produced series look as though they are being
produced in a factory using a formula from a text book, with quantities of
ingredients calculated down to the last gram.
Take Westbeach, BBC1's new Saturday evening saga about family competition in
the seaside leisure industry. Can you imagine anyone saying 'What I really
want to write is a series just like Howard's Way and Trainer but set in
Eastbourne, I want it to feel like an anaemic sort of Dallas-on-Sea' ? There
is the obligatory teenage greenie college dropout whose concern for the
planet is going to teach the grown ups a thing or two. There is high-class
Hannah who cannot wait to drop her Janet Regers for the golf pro (or
anything else in trousers). There is - but you could write the thing
yourself. This is hamburger drama where you can be sure that every serving
will be exactly like the last: just as limp, just as ersatz, yet always done
up in fashionable packaging.
Then take BBC1's new Sunday night sleuth series The Inspector Alleyn
Mysteries. Can there really be anybody in a drama department who, after
Poirot, Dalgleish, Maigret, Marple and Morse says 'I know what we need - a
period detective series, but with some terrific twists: he doesn't drive a
Citroen, he rides around in a Wolseley] He doesn't wear spats, he wears a
homburg] He's not keen on opera, but on art]' In Episode 1 an awful cad at a
weekend house party was killed with a jewelled dagger shortly after the
lights went out while the clock was striking eight. Bad show, what? The
programme started at 7.30. The first steam train appeared at 7.36, the first
drophead coupe at 7.40, the first phoney German accent at 7.49, the first
oak panelled study at 7.52 . . .
Some might argue that ITV's Thursday night series Body And Soul is
different, being about a beautiful young nun who comes out of her enclosed
order to help straighten out her family's affairs after her brother commits
suicide. Indeed, it is different: it is not every day that you see a nun
driving an Aston Martin (luckily she learned to drive a tractor at the
nunnery). But, as with Mr Wroe's Virgins earlier in the season, any idea
that drama might be used to explore the relevance of religion to society has
gone by the board. Yes, there are a few 'wry' observations about the
materialism and overt sexuality of the modern world impinging on the
emergent virgin, tapped into the script with a sledge hammer. But generally
speaking this is more drama-by-the-yard.
Doctor Finlay has been different, of course: as they clamber from the steam
trains to manoeuvre the period luggage into the vintage cars they speak in
Scottish accents. And House Of Eliott was different because, whether dodging
some blasted milk float on foot or travelling in the back of a vintage
motor, one of the young stars spoke something awfully like the 'Estuary
English' of Ken Livingstone and Norman Tebbit. This seemed a teeny bit odd
in a nice gel working in haute couture in the 1920s. Head Over Heels was
different because it was set in the 1950s, but otherwise it was just more
formula drama: the only thing it had to say to its audience was 'Please
watch this, we need the ratings'.
True we have had ITV's sad little early evening serial September Song with
Michael Williams and Russ Abbot as a pair of ill-assorted, ageing drop-outs
and BBC2's Goggle Eyes which gave a clear and often funny account of how it
feels to a 13-year-old girl to have a new man coming into her mother's life.
But however good they may have been (and you would no more compare them to
The Second Heimat than compare Nevil Shute to Joseph Conrad) they were
little more than miniatures.
Above all we have, running now on BBC1 on Friday nights, The Riff Raff
Element by Debbie Horsfield. In its favour, this is not a period piece,
there are no steam trains, it is not old fashioned, cosy or nostalgic. The
Belchers, a family of thieves and layabouts, have moved into the servants'
wing of Tundish Hall. Roger Tundish, a third rate diplomat, has lost his job
but none of his social pretensions: he still orders everyone about and tows
behind him a besotted American aide named Phoenix who hangs on his every
word and calls him 'Excellency'. The characters tend to be stronger than the
stories, which are almost non-existent, and there is, yet again, some
wonderful acting from a cast which includes Ronald Pickup as Tundish and the
ever watchable Celia Imrie as his daughter in law.
It is full of amusing moments and some of the characters are pleasingly
unpredictable (the grungiest of the Belchers, with ring in nose, turns out
to be a marvellous cook). Yet even here there is more a feeling of
contrivance, of material being produced to fill slots, than any sense of an
author fulfilling an urge to communicate. Maybe Debbie Horsfield really does
have a chip on her shoulder about the English class system - her work on
Making Out suggested she does - but, if so, she has little to say about it
that is new.
Perhaps those who warned that there would never be enough talent to fill
more than a couple of television channels are being proved right. Perhaps
there are very few people in the world like Edgar Reitz. Perhaps the public
prefers the consistent extrusion of predictable serials to the peculiar work
of individualistic craftsmen. Perhaps we were lucky in Britain to have 40
years of weird and wonderful television drama before being overtaken by the
age of market enterprise and spreadsheets. The fact remains that my spirits
droop every time another steam loco puffs monotonously into sight indicating
that we are in for another hour or two of 'production values' in place of
dramatic inspiration.

Sir Christopher Benson, the property developer, is to become the new
chairman of Sun Alliance, one of the country's biggest insurance companies.
Sir Christopher, now 59, takes over from Henry Lambert, who will retire at
the company's agm next month. Lambert, who is 67, has been a director since
1972 and chairman for the past eight years - a period of mixed fortunes for
the group.
Sun Alliance saw spectacular growth in its financial strength in the late
1980s, as a result of the boom in the UK equity and property markets, to
which the group was heavily committed as an investor. More recently,
however, the company has been hit badly by losses from mortgage indemnity
insurance as a result of the slump in the housing market.
Sir Christopher, who has been a director since 1988 and who recently retired
as chairman of MEPC, the property group, retains his chairmanships of Boots
and The Housing Corporation, and less happily, his membership of the Lloyd's
insurance market, where, like many other Names, he has been hard hit
recently.

FT  21 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: Waiting for the next Chernobyl
 -Fresh research shows that more radiation was released than previously
thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most Ukrainians, the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident was the final
indictment of Soviet rule. Kiev citizens are still bitter about the infamous
May Day parade, in which their children were required to march outdoors
while the reactor core still burned less than 150 km to the north.
'The Chernobyl accident shattered my final illusions about the totalitarian
system,' says Iuri Kostenko, Ukraine's reformist minister of the
environment. 'Now, independent Ukraine has been stuck with the bill for
Chernobyl.'
According to new scientific research, that bill may be even higher than was
previously thought. Ukrainian officials recently estimated the death toll
related to Chernobyl at 8,000 so far, and Kostenko estimates that the health
of two-thirds of Ukraine's 52m people has been harmed by the accident.
But Ukrainian and western researchers scientists claim that more radiation
was released than previously believed and that ineffective clean-up measures
pose grave dangers. According to their findings, thousands of tonnes of
material dropped by helicopters over the burning reactor core during the
first 10 days after the accident was off target. Consequently, the fire was
not extinguished but simply burnt itself out.
Alexander Burovoi, head of the permanent team researching the accident, and
Alexander Sich, a student of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, say that because the core burnt freely for 10 days,
more radioactive particles were released than previously thought.
'The material dumped by helicopter could not have extinguished the fire
because visual evidence and chemical analysis of the melted core show that
it did not get into the reactor shaft,' Sich says.
Sich and Burovoi estimate that at least 35 per cent of the radiocaesium and
50 per cent of the radioiodine in the core were released. These figures are
double and in some cases triple those reported by the Soviet government in
1986.
The new conclusions drawn by Sich and Burovoi have particularly worrying
implications for the 600,000 people involved in the clean-up. They were
close enough to the reactor core as it burned to have been affected even by
those released radionuclides which have relatively short half-lives.
Moreover, the new research undermines a central tenet of the official
version of the Chernobyl clean-up campaign: the cult of the brave
'liquidators' who took action to put out the fire and whose youthful deaths
are honoured at a museum in Kiev. 'Saying the materials dropped by
helicopter did not land in the reactor shaft has a great psychological
significance,' Burovoi says. 'Think about all the radiation those firemen
and pilots were exposed to and all of it for naught.'
Scientists also point to two potential dangers caused by measures to contain
the accident. One is the steadily rising ground water around the Chernobyl
complex. To prevent radioactive particles from seeping into the Prypiat
river, an immense concrete wall, known as the Casa Grande, was built 30
metres into the ground between the reactor and the riverbank.
The unpredicted result, according to Sich, is that the Casa Grande is acting
as a sort of dam for the ground water, which has already climbed into the
bottom of the damaged fourth reactor and is only 1.5m from the melted core.
The second danger is the concrete sarcophagus built around the core.
Constructed at a distance while the core still emitted large amounts of
radioactive particles, it is a shaky, haphazardly built structure.
According to Mykola Steinberg, head of Ukraine's atomic energy regulatory
agency who was chief engineer at Chernobyl for the first 10 months after the
accident: 'From an engineering stand-point, no one can tell you what will
happen to the sarcophagus in the next half-hour.'
Despite these revelations about the effects of the accident and the
continuing danger Chernobyl presents, Ukrainian legislation calling for a
total shut-down of the reactor by the end of the year is increasingly being
questioned by the local nuclear lobby.
One objection, raised by Mykola Sorokin, director of the Chernobyl complex,
is that it is dangerous to close down a reactor in haste. 'It takes five
years to properly prepare a nuclear reactor to be shut down,' he says.
Sorokin raises another issue which strikes a more populist chord. In 1991
the three reactors at Chernobyl unaffected by the accident produced 5.2 per
cent of Ukraine's electricity, the equivalent of 6m tonnes of oil.
At a time when Russia is raising oil prices and restricting supply,
Sorokin's argument has growing force, but the Ukrainian leadership is still
committed to shutting down Chernobyl by the end of this year.
While many Ukrainians still cross-examine vegetable sellers to ensure their
food comes from nowhere near Chernobyl, at the nuclear power station - where
reactors one and three still hum along in the shadow of the sarcophagus - it
is business as usual.
The Chernobyl management has even created a special pennant bearing the
Chernobyl logo and commemorating the 15th anniversary of nuclear power in
Ukraine.
Typifying the peculiar world view of the Chernobylites, Sorokin pays his
workforce what the uninitiated might take for a back-handed compliment. 'Our
technicians are much better than their western counterparts,' Sorokin
boasts. 'Our personnel need to compensate for problems with our technology
through their own additional skills.'
Sorokin insists a second Chernobyl is impossible at any of the reactors of
the same type in the former Soviet Union, citing 3,400 modifications since
the accident. Oleksandr Berezin, chief operator at the third block,
disagrees. He says only 70 per cent of the flaws have been corrected.
Still, he believes fatalistically that the Chernobyl reactor should be kept
running because 'you cannot make the ecological situation worse than it is
already'.

FT  21 APR 93 / People: More power for Sir Colin Southgate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman and chief executive of Thorn EMI, is adding to
his already full agenda by accepting the chairmanship of PowerGen, the
smaller of the two privatised electricity generators, where he has been a
non-executive director since the company was formed in 1990. He succeeds Sir
Graham Day, who steps down at the agm in September.
Sir Graham, who is steadily reducing his many other commitments at the top
of British industry, had intended to leave PowerGen in March, according to
chief executive Ed Wallis. 'But he held on until the uncertainties over
recontracting quietened down a bit.'
Wallis goes on: 'It was always our wish that his successor would be someone
already on the board with whom we knew we could work and who knew the
business.' Indeed, the board of PowerGen has been quite a tight-knit circle,
with Sir Graham on the board of both Thorn (since 1990) and of Laird, whose
chairman and chief executive John Gardiner is in turn on the board of
PowerGen.
Wallis says that Sir Colin will probably spend a bit more time with the
company than did Day who, among his many commitments, was chairman of
British Aerospace until last May. 'We would welcome that.' In order to do so
Sir Colin will probably have to reduce other outside commitments. As well as
combining the top roles at Thorn, he is a director of the Bank of England (a
position he has no intention of relinquishing), and has a number of other
non-executive directorships and educational and charitable posts.
'We are entering a different phase,' Wallis points out. 'Until now we have
been much concerned with recontracting and relations with government in
general. Now the priority is on diversifying the business.' Sir Colin is
generally seen as having done a good job in disposing of non-core businesses
at Thorn, though at least one of his purchases, that of Virgin Records where
he was criticised in some quarters for paying too dearly, was more
controversial.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor D E N Davies, vice-chancellor of Lough-borough University of
Technology, is to take over from Sir Ronald Oxburgh as chief scientist at
the Ministry of Defence.
Davies, who is known universally as Den, has a background in electrical
engineering research, with particular interests in radar, antennae and fibre
optics - subjects with important defence applications. Oxburgh, in contrast,
is a geologist.
The MoD post is the second most important chief scientist's job in
Whitehall, after the prime minister's scientific adviser, because defence
still consumes more than 40 per cent of all government spending on research
and development. Davies is already familiar with this, as chairman of the
Defence Scientific Advisory Council and a member of the Defence Research
Agency Council.
Loughborough University has enjoyed strong growth in student numbers and
research income during the five years in which Davies, 57, has been in
charge. Its reputation for excellence has spread well beyond physical
education and sports science.
Davies will move from Loughborough to Whitehall at the end of September.

FT  21 APR 93 / People: Succession settled at Hammerson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sydney Mason, the most notable survivor of the post Second World War
generation of property tycoons, yesterday announced that he would relinquish
the chairmanship of Hammerson this summer, after 44 years with the group.
He is being succeeded by Geoffrey Maitland Smith (right), chairman of Sears
and deputy chairman of Midland Bank, who has been a non-executive director
of Hammerson since 1990.
The company also announced that Ronald Spinney (far right) has been
appointed as chief executive from May 1. He will take over from John Parry,
the group's managing director, who will retire at the agm in June. Spinney
was a founder of Greycoat, a development company that specialises in London
offices, where he was deputy chairman and joint managing director until he
resigned in February 1992. He is a non-executive director of the London
Docklands Development Corporation.
Mason, 72, said he was stepping down at a time when the group was
experiencing the worst property downturn he had seen. 'After 40 years when
we have had a a sustained growth in value, dividends and share prices, to go
out at the bottom is sad.' This property recession was 'much more severe and
much tougher in duration' than any that had preceded it. The scale of the
collapse had been 'totally unforeseeable', he said.
Mason, who will become a non-executive director and life president of
Hammerson, began his career as a manager at Land Securities in 1943. He
joined Hammerson in 1949 and succeeded Lew Hammerson as chairman in 1958.
Mason took the company into overseas markets in the 1960s, making Hammerson
the most international of the UK property groups. The company's best-known
project is Brent Cross, in north London, which became the UK's first
regional shopping centre when it was opened in 1976.

FT  21 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: A source of future conflict on
the Nile - Worldwide water / Growing need could lead to war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1978, the late President Anwar Sadat of Egypt warned that if anyone, at
any moment, thought to deprive Egypt of its 'life' the country would not
hesitate to go to war.
He was referring to the Nile, the world's longest waterway, which provides
Egypt with more than 90 per cent of its water requirements. The country is
now using every last drop of water available to it and the prophecies of war
still loom.
Only recently, Boutros Boutros Ghali, former foreign minister of Egypt and
now secretary general to the United Nations, said the next war in the Middle
East would not be over politics, but over the waters of the Nile.
'In the next few years the demographic explosion in Egypt, in Kenya and in
Uganda will lead to all those countries using more water; unless we can
agree on the management of water resources we may have international or
inter-African disputes,' he said.
The one existing treaty on the allocation of Nile waters - the Nile Waters
Agreement - was signed in 1959 and binds only Egypt and Sudan. According to
engineers in the region, both countries stick to its stipulations which
allocate 55.5bn cubic metres of water to Egypt a year and 18.5bn cubic
metres to Sudan, although Egypt regularly borrows water from Sudan. The
official allocation is based on estimations of a mean annual discharge of
84bn cubic metres, with about 10bn reckoned to be lost in evaporation and
seepage from Lake Nasser, behind the Aswan dam in Upper Egypt.
Ironically, internal conflicts in Sudan, Uganda and Ethiopia have probably
done more to forestall inter-state conflicts over the Nile waters than the
NWA. Peter Moszynski of Africa Confidential, the respected African
newsletter, says that 'political settlements in these countries are likely
to lead to much increased demands on the basin's water, especially in
Ethiopia, and without a general regional agreement on water usage, conflict
is almost certain to increase'.
Understanding the source of potential conflicts in the Nile basin requires a
look at the route of the waterway. The Blue Nile, which flows from Lake Tana
in the Ethiopian highlands, contributes, together with other tributaries,
about three-quarters of the main Nile flow. The rest of the water comes from
the White Nile which flows through Uganda and southern Sudan.
Civil war in Ethiopia means that extensive irrigation and hydro-power
generation plans, which could involve damning the Blue Nile, have gone back
to the drawing board. Such plans require vast quantities of water and, if
implemented, could threaten Egypt's well-being.
Exacerbating tensions is the steady increase in the populations of the Nile
basin states. The combined populations of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan alone
are expected to be about 170m by the end of the century. This will
necessitate increased food production and agricultural expansion, which in
turn will require more water. But in Egypt the needs of the growing
population are already damaging water quality. A plan to increase the output
of the Nile has been on hold for almost 10 years, also as a result of civil
war, this time in Sudan.
Completion of the Jonglei Canal, designed to drain the Sudd swamps of
southern Sudan, has been prevented by political instability. The project,
while angering conservationists, would have lowered the large amount of
water lost through evaporation, opened up the area for agriculture and
released more water for irrigation in northern Sudan and Egypt. There is no
hope of the project being completed until after a settlement between the
north and south of Sudan.
At the same time, Moszynski points out that settlement of the war will
invariably lead to greater demand for water in Sudan, particularly if the
south separates from the north, another source of concern for downstream
areas.
Meanwhile, a shortage of water in Egypt would intensify the environmental
problems the country faces as a result of the frequency with which the
existing water supply, particularly groundwater, is reused.
John Hennessey, president-elect of the International Commission on
Irrigation and Drainage, says the sustainability of recycling irrigation
through the aquifer is questionable. 'Water that gets into the ground has
been through the irrigation system so it is laced with fertilisers and
nitrates. There is very little rainfall which would normally have a
cleansing effect on the aquifer,' he says.
The sensitivity of water supply in the Nile basin is not an issue that is
going to go away. Only last week it was reported that Sudan was threatening
to eject Egypt's water management team, based in Sudan to check on the flow
of the Nile waters.
Talk of war may, for the moment, be far-fetched, but as long as the
populations of the Nile basin keep growing, the present accords governing
the allocation of the Nile waters may not be sufficient to keep the peace.

FT  21 APR 93 / Management: Self-styled hero in a kipper tie - Sir John
Harvey Jones is popular with the punters, but is his reputation justified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'HOW shall I describe you in the picture caption?', the FT photographer asks
Sir John Harvey Jones.
Ex-ICI boss? Troubleshooter? Philanthropist? Best selling author? Showbiz
personality? One man think-tank for Britain plc? Protector of wildfowl?
Chairman of the Economist?
'Businessman,' he replies. 'It's a title of honour, and it's all I want to
be. But if you want to be really nice you could call me manager as well.'
Looking quite at home with the pony-tailed media set at London's Groucho
Club, Sir John is being modest. Yet such modesty seems out of place from
perhaps the best-known manager Britain has had.
Every week Sir John gets letters from hundreds of 'poor buggers' wanting
advice on how to run their businesses. Companies clamour to have him on
their boards: there was a time when he felt insulted if a day went past
without a fresh invitation. Next week he publishes yet another business
book, described by its publisher as a 'bible of 90s management'.
But how good has his record really been? Does it justify so much fuss? Sir
John foils all such inquiry by complaining that he has never set out to
solve everyone's business problems. He insists that he is no management
consultant, and when it comes to his own record - well, he has made 'every
mistake in the book'.
In any case, to criticise Sir John's past adds grist to his mill: the
problem with the British, he never tires of saying, is that they hate
business and hate success. He might further argue that any examination of
his own history misses the point: he is not setting himself up as a perfect
businessman, but championing a cause.
'Bad management lies at the root of all this country's problems,' he says.
'We need management heroes to make it seem exciting and glamorous.' He
reckons that at the moment he is doing the job almost single-handedly, with
a bit of help from Richard Branson.
And as management hero he is superb. More than 3m people watched him deliver
painful home truths to companies in his Troubleshooter television series.
The British may hate businessmen, but they love a character, and Sir John,
with his wayward appearance and even more wayward vocabulary, has made sure
he is that.
At ICI, the long-haired ex-boss is remembered by the top people with mixed
feelings. Indeed, Cecil (now Lord) Parkinson once said that the best way to
cause a silence at an ICI lunch was to say something nice about Harvey
Jones.
Much of that antipathy is jealousy. ICI is a grey-suited organisation whose
retired directors are meant to grow dahlias quietly, not to take on the
problems of British manufacturing single-handed. Sir John quotes with glee
his successor, Sir Denys Henderson, prudishly telling someone that appearing
on the Wogan chat show was not how he saw the duties of the head of ICI. 'My
peers think there is something disreputable in what I do,' Sir John says.
They also feel resentment that he received the credit for a turnround in
profitability at ICI that was not altogether his doing. Sir John became
chairman in 1982, close to the bottom of the cycle, and left five years
later, just before the top. His predecessor, Sir Maurice Hodgson, had done
the hard part first, and had made a third of the workforce redundant without
losing a single day's work. One rarely hears of Sir Maurice now.
With the firing done, Sir John had a head start in one of his main tasks at
chairman, to get costs under control. In this he was largely successful and
some argue that ICI's cost competitiveness has slipped a little since he
left, although Sir Denys might well blame the cycle again.
Not being responsible for the lay-offs also helped him become a hero with
the workforce. One analyst recalls a visit to ICI on Merseyside in the early
1980s and being told by the workers that the new chairman came on to the
shop floor to talk to them and that they would follow him to the ends of the
earth.
Sir John will also go down in history as the man who took on ICI's
bureaucracy. Before his rule, almost a year might pass between an investment
plan being put forward by a divisional chairman and the board taking the
final decision. He cut out many layers, halved the number of directors on
the board, simplified committees and decentralised the organisation, passing
power down the line.
Some argue that the process, although desperately needed, went too far. 'The
board began to lose touch with what was going on. Denys Henderson has had to
push the pendulum back the other way,' says Stuart Wamsley, a chemicals
industry analyst. A new tier has subsequently been set up beneath board
level to provide a stronger link to the divisions.
Sir John also took a hard strategic look at ICI, boldly moving the company
out of oil and out of some polymers. He also embarked on a Pounds 2bn-plus
spending spree on speciality chemicals companies - which recently has been
judged a mistake and has been partly undone. The idea was that speciality
chemicals would offset the cyclical commodities business, but ICI found its
management style clashed with that needed to run smaller entrepreneurial
companies, and the new division saw its profitability fall to nothing. The
experiment casts doubt on whether ICI really knows how to modernise itself -
the latest scheme being to cut itself into two.
What does Sir John make of all this? As ever, he professes ignorance about
what has happened at ICI since his departure, but his refusal to comment
smacks more of disapproval than of a desire to let the present management
get on with it. 'Companies always have a tendency to add levels,' he says,
shaking his head.
As far as his acquisitions go, Sir John is unrepentant. 'The alternative was
to have invested more in heavy chemicals,' he scoffs, as if any fool should
have been able to see he had done the right thing. And on the bisection of
the company, well, he thought of it himself.
He does admit to some mistakes at ICI, though these were mainly of timing:
'There were a number of things that we did, but did too slowly,' he says.
'We should have got out of oil sooner.'
Sir John is a little quicker to own up to shortcomings as a non-executive
director. Despite the hundreds of posts offered and despite the lengthy
advice he gives on the subject in his first book, his record is middling.
Three of the four positions he has taken up since leaving ICI have been
fraught with problems.
He was non-executive chairman of the now bankrupt Burns Anderson, overseeing
a master plan of expensive acquisitions in recruitment and financial
services, carried out at the top of the market. He sat on the board of GPA,
the aircraft leasing company, during its spectacular journey from a proposed
Pounds 1.5bn listing last summer to its present struggle for survival. At
Nimbus records, the idiosyncratic maker of CDs, Sir John's directorship
lasted only a few months. 'The best thing he did for us was introduce us to
Peter Laister, who took over from him,' says Nimbus joint founder, Gerald
Reynolds.
In the case of both Burns Anderson and GPA, Sir John says he joined the
board 'primarily because I knew and liked the people'. At Burns Anderson he
admits that 'we were caught by trying to expand too fast'. At GPA the
problem was putting off for too long its transition to a public company. For
this Sir John accepts no responsibility: 'I was urging it to go earlier than
it did.'
At Grand Met and The Economist his non-executive jobs have been happier.
From the time when he tap danced on the table during a stuffy Economist
dinner - under the uncomfortable gaze of the editor Rupert Pennant Rea - he
has been welcomed as a rejuvenating force.
Meanwhile, most of the Troubleshooter companies which subjected themselves
to a televised flogging seem to have enjoyed and benefited from the
experience. Their reports on him share common themes: he is long on charm,
long on charisma and common sense. He is short on detail, short on
understanding of small business concerns and hard to shift once he has made
up his mind.
'He drew quick and intelligent conclusions - although things were not always
quite as simple as his projections,' says Bob Wales of Tolly Cobbold, the
Suffolk brewery. According to David Sugden of Double 2, the shirtmaker, Sir
John 'didn't quite get to grips with what our business was about. But he was
good for us. He didn't tell us anything we didn't know, but he laid a
challenge'.
Only the Morgan Motor Company refused to follow his advice to expand - a
course of action which Sir John cites as evidence of the poverty of ambition
of small and medium-sized British companies.
Whether successful or not, his Troubleshooting days are over, and his
corporate days are also numbered. Seventy next year, Sir John plans to
retire all his posts. That will leave him more time to do what he is really
good at - selling business to the greater public and writing clear books on
management.
This makes him no management guru in the traditional sense. As John Kay of
London Business School, says: 'He is not a Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. In
this country there is no serious science of management, but in the absence
of that a sensible person offering sensible views is the best you can hope
for.'
But Sir John is more than that. The same team who produced Troubleshooter
have just made an equally sensible lookalike series called The Adventurers
without Sir John, but the result was dull. There was a great vacuum where
the kipper tie and the boys' comic expletives should have been.

FT  21 APR 93 / Management: Ford's new 'Asset'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opportunity to obtain a university degree by demonstrating a number of
practical abilities, such as developing a new wiring system, is being
offered by Ford UK.
The BEng degree - developed as part of the 'Asset' initiative funded by the
Department of Employment - is part of a wider joint effort to make education
more relevant to industry.
From this year the degree in engineering will be awarded by Cheltenham-based
Anglia Polytechnic University (APU), based mainly on a Ford employee's
portfolio of work experience.
John MacDonald, a senior lecturer at APU who has been on secondment to Ford
for several years, says APU has offered combined technology courses to Ford
engineers for some years.
Participants, who took up to four years on day-release to gain a degree
traditionally, had to have some formal qualifications, such as a Higher
National Diploma.
Under the new scheme the work-experience of the student is accredited. A
degree is made up of a total of 360 credits with up to 240 of these allowed
to come via the accreditation route. 'We would expect an individual to study
on day-release for at least two years,' says MacDonald.
About a third of the 3,500 engineers at Ford's research and development
plant at Dunton, near Basildon, have an engineering degree. The company
hopes that by 1997 this will have risen to 50 per cent.
This is all part of a wider upgrading of workforce skills by Ford, says
MacDonald. 'Ford is now becoming a company that helps to educate its
employees - rather than just offering them training.'
The Asset initiative is funding 12 projects, all - except Ford's - developed
by universities or polytechnics. The projects are all pilots but many of the
ideas are likely to be taken up by the government which is intent upon
extending vocational routes into higher education.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Environmental Achievement 1993:
Boilers that make the air less noxious - FKI Babcock Robey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FKI Babcock Robey, based at Oldbury in the West Midlands, won an
environmental achievement award for developing the Euronox range of
low-emission high-efficiency boilers.
The boilers, which can burn gas or oil, are designed for general industrial
and commercial purposes in the 1 MW to 30 MW range. They cut emissions of
nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 55 to 60 per cent, while improving operating
efficiency by 2 to 3 per cent.
NOx is one of the main ingredients in industrial air pollution. Along with
sulphur dioxide, NOx causes acid rain. In damp winter conditions it can lead
to a corrosive acid fog such as London experienced in December 1991,
aggravating asthma and other respiratory conditions. And in summer sunshine
NOx undergoes a photochemical reaction with hydrocarbon pollutants, which
lead to Los Angeles-style smog - a toxic mixture of ozone, NOx,
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and other pollutants.
Although vehicle emissions have become the largest source of NOx in most
industrialised countries, steam and hot water boilers such as those made by
Robey are an important contributor.
Robey, boiler manufacturing subsidiary of the FKI engineering group, started
developing its low NOx technology about three years ago, says Andy Michel,
managing director. The Euronox range was launched 18 months ago.
'We don't know of any other manufacturer in Europe that has anything like
our performance figures for NOx and for efficiency,' Mr Michel says. The new
boilers are working better than Robey engineers had predicted, he adds, 'and
we don't yet know why'.
But in general terms the reason why Euronox boilers produce less pollution
than their conventional equivalents is that their combustion conditions are
less intense. In technical language, they use a two-stage temperature
reduction system to cool the recirculated gas prior to its injection into
the burner fan inlet.
As a result, Euronox boilers are larger than normal, with more elaborate
pipework and controls. 'There is a price premium for the technology of about
15 to 20 per cent,' Mr Michel says. 'But if you look at the customer's
actual cost of ownership he will get a pay-back in about a year as a result
of the increased efficiency.'
A typical Euronox system with three 5 MW boilers has been running for six
months at Nottingham University, where it supplies all hot water for the
main campus. Its gas-fired operating efficiency is 82 1/2 per cent -
compared to 80 per cent expected for the best conventional boilers. And its
NOx emissions are 35 parts per million, rather than 100 ppm.
Robey engineers are now working to extend the Euronox technology, both
upwards to the huge boilers required to make steam in power stations and
downwards to the household boilers used for domestic hot water and central
heating.

Little worms that commit insecticide - Agricultural Genetics Company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TINY worms which kill insect pests have won a joint environmental
achievement award for Agricultural Genetics Company, an independent
biotechnology company based in Cambridge, and Horticulture Research
International, the state-backed agency responsible for fruit and vegetable
research, writes Clive Cookson.
AGC's MicroBio subsidiary has been working for six years with HRI's
Littlehampton research station in Sussex to develop natural pesticides based
on nematode worms. The first two products were launched in 1989/90: Nemasys
against glasshouse sciarids and Nemasys H against vine weevils. Both insects
are important horticultural pests, particularly of nursery stock.
The Nemasys products are in the forefront of what is likely to be a huge
wave of biopesticides introduced over the next decade. Their environmental
advantage is that, unlike synthetic chemical pesticides, they do not leave
harmful residues in crops and water supplies.
Worldwide sales of biological pesticides were worth about Dollars 120m last
year - only 2 per cent of the figure for chemical pesticides. Industry
predictions put the biopesticide market in 2000 in the Dollars 500m to
Dollars 2bn region.
So far the emerging market has been dominated by products based on Bacillus
thuringiensis, a naturally occurring bacterium that makes an insect-killing
toxin. The AGC-HRI partnership has lead the way on nematode-based
insecticides, though a Californian company, Biosys, is about to launch a
competitive product.
The achievement of AGC and HRI researchers has been to identify nematode
strains with specific activity against their target pests and then develop a
technique for mass-producing the microscopic worms by large-scale
fermentation.
Nemasys is sold in packs, each containing at least 50m juvenile worms in a
moist, inert carrier which is applied to the compost or soil around the
plants. There the nematodes seek out and kill insect larvae (to be precise,
the actual killing is done by symbiotic bacteria that live inside the
worms). The nematodes reproduce inside the dead insect as it decomposes and
release a new generation of juveniles which move off into the compost in
search of more prey.
The next target for the AGC-HRI nematodes will be the flies that feed off
cultivated mushrooms, the most valuable horticultural crop in the UK. A new
Nemasys product is being introduced this year for biological control of
sciarid flies in mushrooms. If it is adopted instead of chemical
insecticides, it will remove the environmental problem of disposing of
650,000 tonnes a year of spent pesticide-laden mushroom compost.
AGC is also working with the Agriculture and Food Research Council's Long
Ashton Research Station to develop biopesticides to control slugs and
snails.
Production of the slug control nematode has reached the pilot plant stage
and it is expected to reach the market in two to three years, after
extensive field trials.
'We are confident that our natural product will be as effective as chemical
control methods at a competitive cost to users,' says Peter Innes, AGC
MicroBio director.

Filter-tipped cars - Johnson Matthey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON MATTHEY, the world's largest manufacturer of autocatalysts to remove
pollution from car exhausts, has won two awards: for exports and
environmental achievement, writes Clive Cookson.
The company used its background in precious metals to develop catalytic
converters in the early 1970s, in anticipation of legislation in the US and
Japan to limit exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxides (NOx). These gases are important contributors to acid rain
and photochemical smog and they exacerbate health problems, especially
respiratory disorders.
Autocatalysts contain a cylindrical honeycomb coated with precious metals
(typically platinum and rhodium) which convert the pollutants, by means of
chemical reactions on the metal surface, to a relatively harmless mixture of
carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen. Johnson Matthey won a Queen's Award for
Technological Achievement in 1977 for its autocatalyst research and
development.
Since then researchers at the Johnson Matthey Technology Centre near
Reading, Berkshire, have considerably improved catalytic performance, so
that today's autocatalysts typically reduce harmful exhaust emissions by 90
per cent.
The company has steadily geared up its marketing and manufacturing
operations since the 1970s, to build on its technological expertise and the
sales opportunities presented by the ever-tightening pollution controls
around the world. Since January 1993, autocatalysts have had to be fitted to
all petrol-engined cars manufactured in the EC.
Johnson Matthey now makes 20m autocatalysts a year at five factories:
Royston in the UK (world headquarters of the catalytic systems division);
Brussels in Belgium; Pennsylvania in the US; Sydney in Australia; and
Johannesburg in South Africa. The company says it has about one third of the
world market - ahead of Engelhard, the US precious metals company which is
its closest competitor. Last year Johnson Matthey's worldwide sales of
catalytic systems amounted to about Pounds 210m.
Although Johnson Matthey sells autocatalysts to Japanese car manufacturers
for their plants outside Japan and for export production, it has not really
succeeded in penetrating the Japanese domestic market, which is supplied by
local catalyst companies. 'In an effort to work more closely with the
Japanese manufacturers, we're opening a technical centre in Japan for the
first time next October,' says Mr Rob Searles, market development director
of Johnson Matthey Catalytic Systems.
Many further improvements in catalyst technology are in prospect. One is
simply durability. US regulations will soon require autocatalysts to have a
proven lifetime of 100,000 miles rather than the 50,000 miles required
today.
Another big research effort is to make catalysts that will work more quickly
when the car starts from cold. Johnson Matthey has developed prototype
autocatalysts incorporating an electric heater which enables them to operate
efficiently within a few seconds.
Johnson Matthey expects catalysts for diesel exhaust to be a further growth
area. An increasing number of diesel cars are fitted with autocatalysts in
Europe although they are not required by EC regulations, 'because
manufacturers have decided they are a good part of their environmental
marketing package,' says Mr Searles. 'They are now spreading to larger
diesel vehicles including buses.'

Glass that keeps the heat in - Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the giant UK glass manufacturer, claims also to be the country's
largest maker of energy saving products. One of those products, K Glass, has
won the Merseyside company an award for environmental achievement, writes
Clive Cookson.
K Glass is an energy saving glass which reduces heat loss through a single
glazed window by 70 per cent. In a double glazing unit it gives better
insulation than triple glazed ordinary glass.
In addition, because K Glass is such an efficient insulator - equivalent to
a brick wall nine inches thick - architects can specify larger areas of
window, to make full use of daylight and save more energy.
Domestic heating is the biggest polluter in terms of carbon dioxide
emissions, which are the prime cause of the greenhouse effect and global
warming. Buildings as a whole (commercial and residential) account for half
of UK primary energy use, and 60 per cent of this is in houses.
Pilkington calculates that if all the country's single glazed homes were
double glazed with K Glass, Pounds 1bn worth of energy would be saved every
year. This would reduce CO emissions by 11m tonnes - or 6 per cent of all CO
emissions associated with buildings.
K Glass can be made directly on a float glass production line. Previously,
low-emissivity glasses had to be coated in a secondary process, which added
greatly to their cost and reduced their performance. K Glass has a
colourless scratch-resistant coating and is virtually indistinguishable from
ordinary glass; no special handling is required.
Ordinary window glass is an excellent radiator: in a warm room it absorbs
heat and radiates it from the colder outside surface. The low-emissivity
coating on K Glass converts the window into a poor radiator: instead the
heat is reflected back into the room.
But the coating does not reduce the amount of short-wave radiation coming
into the room from the sun. This energy is absorbed by the walls and floors
and re-radiated in long-wave form - which is reflected back by the K Glass.
The technical achievement of K Glass is reflected by its success in the
market. Sales have increased by 50 to 100 per cent a year since its launch
in 1990 and are expected to be about Pounds 30m in 1993. One of four float
glass lines at Pilkington's St Helens factory is now devoted full time to K
Glass production. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, was an early
user of K Glass for its London offices. Many local authorities are
specifying it.
Pilkington has also licensed the low-emissivity technology to PPG and St
Gobain, the largest glassmakers in the US and France respectively.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Environmental Achievement 1993: A
wide cross section of green themes / Examining the quality - and the paucity
 -of the first recipients of environmental awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE inaugural winners of the Queen's Award for Environmental Achievement
represent a good cross-section of current green themes. They include
products or processes to clean up industrial effluents, reduce air pollution
from cars and boilers, fight the greenhouse effect by saving energy, save
the ozone layer by replacing CFCs, and cut the use of chemical pesticides.
All 12 winners clearly meet the main criterion laid down for the new award:
'a significant advance' offering 'major benefits in environmental terms
compared to existing products, technology or processes'.
They have also achieved commercial success - most spectacularly in the case
of Johnson Matthey's autocatalysts, which are world leaders in a global
market worth hundreds of millions of pounds a year.
Pilkington's energy-saving glass is also likely to be selling more than
Pounds 100m a year by the late 1990s.
The contribution that biotechnology can make to environmental improvement is
illustrated by the joint award to Agricultural Genetics Company and
Horticultural Research International, for developing biological alternatives
to chemical pesticides. It will be disappointing if future lists do not
include the direct application of biotechnology to clearing up toxic wastes
through 'bio-remediation' - developing microbes to convert pollutants into
harmless chemicals.
The awards also recognise environmental achievement in less glamorous fields
than biotechnology. For example Foseco's Foundry Division, based in
Tamworth, Staffordshire, has developed a portable, pollution-free foundry
for use by the aluminium industry. Metals feature too in the award to BEWT
(Water Engineers) for systems that recover metals from effluent solutions.
Replacement of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons which are responsible for the ozone
hole in the upper atmosphere) features in two awards. The UK subsidiary of
Ricoh, the Japanese electronics group, has eliminated CFC cleaning fluids
from the production of selenium drums for photocopiers, by using ultra-pure
water at high pressure before coating the drums.
At the same time, Ricoh UK, based in Telford, Shropshire, is recycling
selenium (a toxic semi-metal) from used drums.
Kerry Ultrasonics of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, has developed a water-based
cleaning system to replace CFC solvents. The process, which covers all the
main industrial cleaning applications, uses ultrasound (at 40 KHz) in a
cleaning tank. This enables the fluid to reach small crevices in both sides
of a surface.
Sericol of Broadstairs, Kent, also won its award for moving to a water-based
system from organic solvents. Sericol, a subsidiary of Burmah Castrol, has a
range of water-based screen printing inks which avoid the emission of
volatile organic compounds associated with conventional screen inks. Screen
printers in the UK alone use 5,000 tonnes a year of organic solvents, almost
all of which end up in the atmosphere.
Two of the awards are for improving the environmental performance of cars -
the largest single source of air pollution in many countries. One is to
Johnson Matthey for autocatalysts. The other is to Ricardo Consulting
Engineers of Shoreham, West Sussex, for developing the practical application
of 'tumbling air motion' in mass-produced car engines.
The effect is to achieve more complete combustion than other systems,
leading to improved fuel economy (especially when starting from cold) and
reduced emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.
Edwards High Vacuum of Crawley, West Sussex, wins an award for its 'dry'
mechanical pumps which have no lubrication or sliding parts. They eliminate
at source the contaminated water or oil traditionally associated with vacuum
pumps in the chemical industry.
In contrast, solvents can easily be reclaimed from the vapours drawn off
from the new dry pumps.
Last year Edwards (part of the BOC group) won a Better Environment Award for
Industry from the Royal Society of Arts for the same products. The RSA
prizes were the direct inspiration for the new Queen's Award.
Since 1983 the RSA has operated three successive environmental awards
schemes, which illustrate the changing attitude toward industry's
environmental responsibilities over the last 10 years.
The pioneering Pollution Abatement Technology Awards concentrated on the
urgent need for end-of-pipe technology to clean up process industries. Then
came the more comprehensive Better Environment Awards for Industry.
That disappears this year, with the launch of the new Queen's Awards. In its
place the RSA has started Environmental Management Awards, 'to be given for
a significant initiative by British management in the pursuit of
sustainability which seeks to eliminate the negative impacts of business on
the environment while maintaining the long-term viability of the business.'
'We wanted to stay ahead of the game,' says Mike Harrison, who runs the
RSA's environmental awards, 'and we decided that the strategic thinking of
management at the board level was going to make the impact in future.' The
first RSA Environmental Management Awards will be announced in June.
The attitude of the environmental group Friends of the Earth to the new
Queen's Awards is summarised by Andrew Lees, campaigns director, as 'great,
but ..' He sums up his reservations: 'They don't go far enough, they are too
narrow in scope and they could be misleading.'
Mr Lees thinks the public could be misled - inadvertently or deliberately -
into thinking that the shiny Queen's Award emblem was an official
endorsement of a company's overall environmental achievement, based on an
audit of all its activities, whereas it is actually limited to one specific
product, technology or process. In fact, according to Mr Lees, some of this
year's winning companies leave a lot to be desired in their attitudes and
action on the environment.
On the whole, however, the extension of the Queen's Awards to the
environment will be welcomed as another symbol of the greening of the
government.
The organisers hope that they will be able to make more than 12 awards next
year, without compromising the strict standards that are essential for the
credibility of the Queen's Awards.
Privately, they were disappointed that only 5 per cent of this year's 240
applicants were judged to be worthy of an award.
The government will certainly want a better geographical distribution in
1994.
This year's list has a southern orientation with no winners at all in
north-east England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
Nor are there any awards to environmentally important industries such as
bulk chemicals, oil and gas, paper and pulp, mining and quarrying, batteries
and energy storage, consumer goods and packaging.

Mapping by computers - NextBase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE multi-million pound software company which began life in a suburban
garage is both the biggest cliche in the computer world and the stuff of
Hollywood movies. Fortunately for the four friends who set up NextBase, it
is still the stuff which wins awards.
Established in late 1987 with funds of just Pounds 32,000, NextBase
specialises in mapping software, which can be used for planning routes or
analysing geographical areas. The original idea for the software came from
Mr Simon Anthony, now marketing director, who perceived a market for a
consumer mapping product.
'The only available maps in computer form were very, very expensive,'
explains Mr Anthony. 'But these sort of maps are most useful when you are
travelling around in your car, so you can't spend Pounds 5,000 to Pounds
10,000 on them.'
Once the concept was defined the software was written by fellow founder Mr
Mark Atherton in a 'rather untidy bedroom in Esher'.
The company's first official premises were in a converted linoleum factory
in Staines. In 1991, NextBase moved into offices in Ashford, Middlesex.
Today the company sells a Pounds 50-Pounds 60 consumer mapping package for
the travellers with an IBM personal computer at home. At the other end of
the scale NextBase sells sophisticated analytical maps for businesses which
want to plan mailshots, television advertising campaigns or where to put
their next retail store. More than 900 of The Times Top 100 companies use
NextBase products, as well as 20,000 smaller companies.
For these more sophisticated systems NextBase sees its software as a 'front
end' to extract information from existing databases. 'What many people don't
realise is that most databases already actually have addresses, which could
be postcodes or postal addresses,' points out Mr Anthony.
Data compression is used to minimise the space needed to store the map
information and mathematical techniques are used to store data on roads and
coastlines.
Moving on from the UK, NextBase also now sells mapping software for France,
Germany and Italy and has a pan-European package. Its software, all written
in the UK, has also proven a hit in the US. Mr Anthony believes NextBase is
unique in being the only British software company to have a product - a
computerised map of the US - in America's top 10 selling PC products.
NextBase set up a joint venture called Automap in the US to market its
products, and this approach has been central to the company's success.
The royalties NextBase accrues from its US sales account for 10 per cent of
its annual revenues of some Pounds 4m. Over the past two years revenues have
increased by more than 55 per cent and 85 per cent respectively, and have
been achieved without the need to raise extra capital.
Building on this success, the company's next products will be detailed
street maps of London and 100 US cities.
The need for a continued influx of new blood has not been lost on the four
original founders of the company. At 35 years old, Mr Anthony acknowledges
he is now one of the oldest people in the NextBase team of 25. The average
age of staff in the company is just 25.

jet fighters that streak through the skies may not be apparent to most
people, but they are clear enough to Smiths Industries which has won two
Queen's technology awards for products serving these sectors.
Its Kelvin Hughes subsidiary, the group's naval and marine equipment
specialist, was awarded one of them for its river radar system, which was
designed to meet the tough new specifications laid down by the Rhine River
Authority.
These were introduced in 1990 and since then, the company's RSR1000 river
radar has taken a quarter of the market for new equipment on vessels
operating on the Rhine and Danube.
The other award went to Smiths Industries Aerospace - Integrated Display
Systems for its multi-purpose colour display used on fighter aircraft. The
MPCD provides a full colour moving map display which is visible in cockpit
conditions ranging from direct sunlight to total darkness.
The MPCD functions with a re-designed cathode ray tube which is considerably
brighter than on previous models and has sharper definition. Infra-red
emissions are suppressed by a new optical filtering technique and colour
contrast is thus improved and light reflection reduced. The system is also
more reliable, with a fourfold improvement to 1,600 operating hours in time
between services. The US Navy has selected the MPCD as its standard display.
Kelvin Hughes' river radar system uses a spiral scanned display on its
cathode ray tube which gives much better resolution at the short distances
where clear vision is vital to safe navigation. It can be mounted on the
bulkhead, in a console, or on a table. The picture presents a continuous 150
degree view ahead and a full view astern.
Around 1,000 river radar units have been sold since the product's
introduction, says Mr Barry Morgan, Kelvin Hughes' marketing services
manager. Most of these are for German and Dutch vessels. The company also
hopes to sell into eastern Europe. Now that the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal has
opened up inland waterway traffic in central Europe, boats can enter the
Rhine from the Danube and thus have to accord with the new rules. Already,
there are some 10,000 vessels on the Rhine and those with older radar
systems will have to upgrade these at their next refit.

Cutting and grinding - Holroyd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLROYD, a Rochdale-based company of 250 people, is so well entrenched in
world markets that the UK recession has left it happily unscathed. It makes
specialised equipment for the compressor industry and sells more than 90 per
cent of its products overseas.
The company, owned by Renold, won the Queen's award in the technological
section for its development of a new generation of CNC (computer numerically
controlled) automatic cutter grinding machines. These sharpen the cutting
tools which are fitted on to special milling machines - also made by Holroyd
 -to make compressor rotors.
Mr Ronnie Kershaw, the company's managing director, says that it took five
years to develop the new range, which can control the accuracy of cutter
profiles to less than 5 microns (a micron is one millionth of a metre). The
previous accuracy level was 20 microns. Not only are the components and the
compressors made more efficient, but cutting times are reduced by
three-quarters and tool life increased fourfold.
This is not the first time that Holroyd has won a Queen's award. In 1967, it
gained one for its high precision rotor milling machine, the first of its
kind. This sustained level of technological skill has left Holroyd as one of
the few surviving machine tool companies left in Britain, which once was a
world leader in this sector.
Holroyd's market includes some of the big names of international industry.
Among Its domestic customers are Compair, Howden, and the UK operation of
Ingersoll Rand, a company to which it also exports in the US. Atlas Copco of
Sweden (which has a compressor division in Belgium), Kobe Steel of Japan,
and GHH of Germany are among its foreign buyers. It recently won a Pounds 3m
order from China, one of its largest ever, and also exports to Scandinavia,
South Korea, and South America. It has also won large orders in Russia.
The equipment manufactured by the air compressor companies on Holroyd
machines has a variety of uses. They include mining, construction, food
refrigeration in large cold stores and on fishing vessels, and ice freezing
for skating rinks.
Holroyd's competition is in west Germany, where it is up against several
manufacturers. The company's new CNC machine, for which it also designed the
electronics, allows new designs of compressors to be produced which perform
far better than their predecessors. It also enables very high accuracy
profile forms to be ground on a wide range of cutter materials ranging from
the traditional high speed steel and carbides to newer advanced tool
materials which are now available.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queen's Awards for Technological Achievement 1993: A key
to the pace of recovery / Assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of UK
industrial technology

NEW ideas, technologies, and products are at a premium as Britain emerges
from recession at long last. In a harsh and fast-changing world economic
environment, it is innovation and flexibility which will largely determine
who the future winners are in international markets.
As the list of companies in the technological achievement section of the
Queen's awards shows, there are successes to cheer about in the performance
of British industry. The 25 awards range from advanced computers and
software to more humble manufacturing products. They include products in the
medical, farming, machinery, and chemical sectors.
Among those singled out this year are large and well-known organisations
like BT, Smiths Industries, ICL, Castrol, and Land Rover, as well as smaller
operations like pneuPAC, Tronic Electronic Services, NextBase, and
Pitman-Moore. Zeneca, ICI's bio-sciences subsidiary, is also honoured in the
list, which contains fewer technology awards than in each of the previous
eight years.
But inspiring as the awards may be - they are only given for innovations
which have achieved commercial success - there is a strong sense within much
of industry, the academic and scientific world, and parts of the government
that Britain lacks a strong enough technological impetus to compete
effectively with rivals in the US, Japan, Europe and elsewhere.
However much the top UK industrial companies spend on research and
development, foreign competitors spend much more. ICI, the chemicals group,
is Britain's top R&amp;D spender, but only 35th in the world. Glaxo, the
successful pharmaceuticals concern, is in 49th place, Shell Transport and
Trading in 50th, and General Electric at 55.
Topping the list is General Motors of the US, followed by two German groups,
Daimler-Benz, whose activities include vehicles, areospace, and electronics,
and Siemens, the electrical and electronics manufacturer. IBM, the US
computer giant, is in fourth place, and Japan's Hitachi is fifth.
Altogether, the top 10 comprise four US companies - the others being Ford
Motor and AT&amp;T - four from Japan (Toyota, Matsushita, and Fujitsu are also
there) and the two German corporations. As the recent fortunes of some of
these make clear, though, a high R&amp;D budget does not guarantee success. IBM,
in particular, has been brought painfully down to earth by market pressures.
In Europe, Daimler is having to struggle as competition hots up and its high
German cost base is mercilessly exposed.
Yet this is small comfort for British industry, however successful and
thrusting some of its members may be. For it is not only in absolute terms
that UK industry's R&amp;D spending lags behind. In Britain, corporate R&amp;D
expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product has fallen over the
past decade. The picture is very different in the main competing countries,
with rises in Germany, Japan, the US, France and Italy.
The winning examples in the Queen's awards are proof that new ideas and
processes can make it to the forefront of British industry. But making a
success of technological breakthroughs and advances is tough. As innovation
experts inside and outside industry stress, the management of technology is
by no means easy. Innovation is a process that includes not just science and
technology, but also management, marketing, and educational expertise.
The companies that come up with the best ideas are not always the ones that
reap the rewards. There are numerous examples around the world of companies
which pioneered new products only to fail in the market. Often it is those
which come along in second place who earn the profits; they can learn from
the mistakes of the ones which went before and refine the original ideas or
processes.
In the UK, many executives bemoan the lack of priority given to industry
both by the government and the general public. This is certainly in strong
contrast to, say, Germany, where industry has a weight and influence
superior to that in Britain and where quality of product and workmanship is
highly prized, as are educational and training qualifications.
Such differences cannot be narrowed rapidly, at least not significantly. But
the Confederation of British Industry and Department of Trade and Industry
are both concerned to ensure that the flame of innovation burns more
brightly in the UK. Thus they have jointly embarked on a programme aimed at
enhancing the awareness of the need for innovation within industry.
The need is certainly there. The world competitiveness scoreboard compiled
by IMD, the Lausanne business school, and the Geneva-based World Economic
Forum, puts the UK only in 13th place, behind not only such industrial
powers as Japan, Germany and the US, but also smaller countries like
Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, and Belgium; the UK is ahead of France and
Italy, however. A technological ranking of the top 25 world companies, based
on US patenting data and published by Business Week last year, included none
from the UK.
League tables certainly do not tell the whole story. But they provide enough
evidence to demonstrate that action is required to encourage UK companies to
become more innovative. The question is: how can they become so? A study by
the DTI and CBI found that only one in 10 of the companies it surveyed could
be called truly innovative; three in 10 had grasped some aspects of the
innovation process, while half showed 'elements of good performance'.
The answer does not just lie in spending money. Attitudes and organisation
are just as important. Companies which are prepared to open themselves to
new ideas - from their own staff or from outside - to communicate
effectively, and to enter into alliances and exchanges of ideas with other
firms have a better chance of success than those which remain closed to new
influences.
Often, it is marketing or management failures rather than any lack of
technological skills which doom products to failure in the market. This
certainly applies to individual inventors or small companies, who find it
difficult to push their ideas through the tangle of regulatory, financial,
and market requirements to the end user. Most inventions do not succeed, but
a number of those which fail could probably be made to succeed, at least
partly, with the right sort of help at an early stage.
For companies to be able to exploit new ideas effectively, a stable economic
environment is required. This has been lacking in recent years, as the UK
has gone from boom to recession and back to slow recovery. Successful
innovation also demands a longer term approach than is common in much of
British industry, where dividend payments tend to be higher than abroad.
Yet the ending of recession at last gives companies the chance to shake off
the survival culture with which many have become fixated in recent years.
With a more favourable economic climate and a louder blowing of the
innovation trumpet by those concerned with the health of industry, Britain's
technological future could be much brighter. But technology on its own is
not enough. As the Queen's awards recognise, the practical and commercial
elements are vital to success.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: Welsh steel
hits Japan - Europressings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIVATE Welsh company formed five years ago has won the export award for
sales which are almost exclusively to Japanese companies.
Europressings, based at a Cardiff industrial park, was formed by a group of
Welsh businessmen all involved in steel. They realised that there was a
potential market from Japanese electrical goods manufacturers which had set
up plants in Europe and needed casings for their products.
'The Japanese wanted to purchase more in Europe to comply with the EC
directive on local sourcing and because it was very expensive to ship from
Japan,' says David Horrocks, commercial director of Europressings and
formerly joint managing director of a steel stockholding company.
'But they found there was a shortage here of pressworkers for particular
parts - the metal casings. We thought we could supply the components
ourselves and the best thing we could do was to go to see for ourselves in
Japan. In October 1987 we went on a two-week study tour there around the
manufacturers. When we got there we blew our minds because the technology
was not available in Europe, and not even really known about in Europe.'
The businessmen agreed to take a gamble that, if they started making the
right product - which is described as 'cosmetically and dimensionally
critical metal pressings' - the Japanese would place orders with them. 'We
decided to start a new company with the Japanese as a target market. We
needed to set up a new operation and weld the Japanese technology to
European ways.' The chairman of the new company, Nick Williams, a Cardiff
entrepreneur, owns 80 per cent and the other directors the rest.
'We decided to build a factory on a greenfield site and to buy the equipment
from Japan. We made an outlay of Pounds 1.5m with no order. But we were very
bullish that the Japanese would come to see us and give us business.'
The 50,000 sq ft factory was completed in April 1988. 'We didn't produce a
part until June 1988, the first was a top cover for a video recorder for NEC
in Telford, Shropshire.' Other orders followed for such products as
microwave ovens, desk-top computers, video tape recorders and compact disc
players.
In 1989 Europressings won its first export order, to Sony in France. Today,
about half its output is exported. In the UK, it is now supplying Sharp in
Wrexham, north Wales, and Hitachi and Panasonic in south Wales, and on the
continent Japanese companies in France, Germany and Spain. In the last year,
ending April 1993, its sales were 4.6m and it is even more confident for
this year.
The factory already employs 52 people, mostly women, and expects to expand,
creating another 20 jobs, in the next three months. 'We've been held back by
the world recession - we've grown because we've increased our customer base
and the number of products we make,' says Horrocks.
'The Japanese,' he adds, 'are superb to deal with.'

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: Europe's
pacemaker - UK builds more cars for export
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK is set to be the fastest growing centre for car production in Europe
during the 1990s supported by rapidly expanding exports.
The awards for export achievements made to three of the leading car makers
in the UK, Ford, Vauxhall and Nissan, reflect the resurgence in the fortunes
of the motor industry in Britain, which is being driven both by the greatly
improved quality and productivity of the traditional carmakers, and by the
wave of inward investment that has come from leading Japanese carmakers.
The industry is expected to wipe out its chronic trade deficit of the last
10 years and to move into surplus during the second half of the decade,
helped too by the expansion of the automotive components sector, which has
received a substantial boost from the arrival of the Japanese car
operations.
The export award to Caterham Cars, the small maker of the Super Seven two
seater roadster (successor of the Lotus Seven), also illustrates the
strength of the specialist and motor sport sector of the UK automotive
industry, which has become a world leader in the development of racing cars.
While the motor industry trade deficit has inevitably fallen during the
recession, there have also been encouraging signs of a structural
improvement in the UK motor industry's competitiveness.
Car production has held up much more strongly during the last three years
than might have been expected given the plunge in domestic demand.
After the pain of the 1970s and the 1980s the motor industry in Britain is
again producing cars at a quality level that is competitive with plants
elsewhere in Europe, and UK automotive industry labour costs are the lowest
among the leading car producing countries of west Europe.
As a result car exports have risen strongly and UK output of 1.29m cars in
1992 was less than 1 per cent below the 1.3m level of 1989, despite the 31
per cent fall in new car sales in the same period.
Car output for export markets accounted for 45.6 per cent of total UK car
production in 1992 and for 48.9 per cent in 1991 compared with only 21.6 per
cent in 1989.
The three volume carmakers that win the Queen's award for export achievement
in 1993 have all opened up significant new export paths in recent years.
VAUXHALL, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of Europe, only began to
export vehicles again in significant volumes in 1990 after an absence of
several years from foreign markets.
By last year, however, exports were already accounting for 37 per cent of
its total output of 301,857 cars and car-derived vans. The volume of exports
rose by 8 per cent to 111,700.
Vauxhall's two UK assembly plants at Luton, Bedfordshire, and at Ellesmere
Port, Cheshire, were both able to operate at full capacity last year thanks
to the size of the export programmes. The outlook is less favourable for
1993, however. Despite improved demand in the UK, both plants have been
forced to introduce short-time working in the face of the sharp downturn in
demand in continental European markets.
Mr William Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman and managing director, warned recently
that market conditions in Europe 'are worsening overall' and that there was
'little hope of being as productive and profitable' in 1993 as last year.
The strength of its export performance helped Vauxhall to achieve record
operating profits of Pounds 269.1m in 1992 despite the continuing weakness
of the UK market.
Productivity at Vauxhall rose by 8 per cent last year, and its two assembly
plants currently have a cost advantage of more than 15 per cent against GM's
continental European plants and are achieving the same quality levels.
While its vehicle export volumes are set to fall this year Vauxhall will
gain some compensation by the start-up of engine exports from its new Pounds
193m top-of-the-range V6 engine plant at Ellesmere Port, where it will have
a capacity to produce 135,000 engines a year. Initial small volume
production began late last year.
Vauxhall still has a significant trade deficit in the UK, but the new engine
plant is expected to cut the UK trade deficit by around Pounds 100m a year
with 80 per cent of production being exported to GM assembly plants in
continental Europe.
NISSAN has come rapidly to the fore in the last couple of years to challenge
Britain's traditional carmakers for the position of leading UK car exporter.
At its Sunderland plant, the spearhead of the Japanese drive into the UK,
where Nissan has invested more than Pounds 900m, production has expanded
rapidly in the last 12 months, and there will soon be capacity to produce up
to 300,000 cars a year across two product ranges.
Output rose by 43.5 per cent last year to 179,000 from 124,700 in 1991, and
the company is aiming to raise output by a further 51 per cent this year to
270,000 cars with around 84 per cent of production being exported.
Nissan's car exports from the UK, which began modestly in 1988 at 11,080,
have climbed sharply to reach 112,700 in 1991 and 157,234 in 1992. Exports
accounted for 88 per cent of its UK production last year.
With the addition of new products by Nissan at its Spanish subsidiary,
Nissan Motor Iberica, the UK company has also begun to export petrol engines
from Sunderland to Spain for assembly into the Barcelona-built Nissan Serena
multi-purpose vehicle.
Nissan first began to export left-hand drive cars to nine continental
European markets in September 1988. It began to export cars from the UK to
eastern Europe in 1991 and in the same year became the first Japanese
carmaker to start shipping cars from Europe to Asia. It has planned to
export around 10,000 cars a year from the Sunderland plant to Taiwan and to
Japan.
The big boost to Nissan's output came last August with the start-up of
production of its second range of UK-built cars, the Micra small car. Output
of the Nissan Primera large family car, which began in May 1990, is expected
to fall by 8 per cent this year to around 130,000 from 141,800 in 1992,
while production of the Micra is forecast to rise to 140,000 from the 37,200
produced in the last five months of 1992.
The UK-built Micra is particularly important for Nissan in its drive to
increase its penetration of the southern European markets, such as Italy,
France and Spain. Traditionally these markets have operated very restrictive
policies against direct vehicle imports from Japan. At the same time small
cars of the Micra-class represent the biggest segments of these new car
markets.
FORD continued as Britain's leading motor industry exporter in 1992 with
shipments of vehicles and components worth around Pounds 2.2bn.
Its exports are much more wide-ranging than those of either Vauxhall or
Nissan with the UK serving as one of its principal locations for engine
production in Europe and a source for other components ranging from
radiators to plastic mouldings, instrument clusters and engine castings.
In 1992 it exported 159,000 vehicles from its assembly plants in Dagenham,
Essex, Halewood, Merseyside, and Southampton despite repeated periods of
short-time working caused chiefly by the continuing UK recession. It also
exported 770,000 engines from its two engine plants at Bridgend, South
Wales, and at Dagenham.
Ford reacted more slowly than General Motors to integrate both its UK car
assembly plants into its overall European production network. For the first
part of the UK recession it was unable to cushion its car production at
Halewood by increasing exports, but it finally overcame this hurdle at the
beginning of January 1992.
The Merseyside plant began shipping its Escort/Orion cars to continental
European markets at the start of 1992 and exported more than 30,000 vehicles
last year. It exported around 17 per cent of its total output including
20,000 Escorts. The Dagenham plant continued its strong export performance
in 1992 with more than 50 per cent of its output of 213,192 Fiesta cars and
vans and Courier vans being shipped abroad. Dagenham is Ford's sole
production source for the Fiesta Courier high roof van, and in the first
full year of production in 1992 more than 46,000, or 93 per cent of output,
were exported.
More than a third of the output of the Ford Transit panel van at the
Southampton plant was also exported last year, amounting to 21,000 vehicles
in 1992. Light commercial vehicles are an important element in Ford's UK
exports with volumes rising significantly last year to 82,654 from 63,900 a
year earlier.
The Dagenham engine plant is Ford's sole source in Europe for diesel
engines, and last year the Essex plant exported 395,000 engines or 75 per
cent of its output of 567,000 engines. Bridgend, which produces Ford's new
range of Zeta multi-valve petrol engines, exported 374,000 engines or 74 per
cent of output to Ford assembly plants on the continent.
Despite its position as the UK's leading motor industry exporter, Ford of
Britain has still recorded a UK trade deficit for every year since 1981 with
its exports overshadowed by the volume of its vehicle imports (excluding
Jaguar since its takeover in 1989).
The development of Ford of Britain's trade deficit has followed closely the
performance of the overall UK motor industry. The deficit ran close to
Pounds 1.4bn a year in 1988 and 1989, but fell to Pounds 1.297bn in 1990 and
to Pounds 214m in 1991. No figure is yet available for 1992.
Ford of Britain first moved into deficit in 1981 having previously been a
significant positive contributor to the UK trade balance.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: With a
little help from Mozart - Academy of St Martin in the Fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Britain's only non-subsidised orchestra, winning royal recognition of
its export effort is like the crescendo of a symphony as the music rolls
towards the final chords.
'It's that feeling of achievement you get - that's what we feel like
today,', says Ms Monya Gilbert, general manager of The Academy of St Martin
in the Fields, as she savours its award for export.
The orchestra, set up in 1959, took its name from the central London church
where one of the founder members of the group, Mr Jack Churchill, was then
musical director.
The Academy's first audiences were office workers who attended lunch time
concerts at St Martin in the Fields.
The title Academy is a reference to the older literary and medical
academies. Sir Neville Marriner, the orchestra's founder, rejected the title
of 'orchestra' on the grounds that there were then only 13 players. He also
ruled out 'chamber group' because of its stuffy, elitist connotations and
'ensemble' because it 'bungs up your nose'.
Today the Academy has a regular core of about 35 to 40 players but can
expand to 85. It earns about two-thirds of its roughly Pounds 2m annual
revenue from overseas tours and sales of its recordings.
It began recording in 1960 and now has more than 1,000 recordings, all of
which it says still sell well. While the orchestra is not subsidised it has
qualified for public funds from time to time, when the government has
matched the money it has won from new sponsors.
The Academy admits to luck as part of the explanation for its success. Long
famous for its Mozart interpretations, in the 1980s the orchestra was chosen
to record the soundtrack to Amadeus, the successful film of the composer's
life.
It was then well-placed to capitalise on the bicentenary of Mozart's death
in 1991 which helped consolidate its already broadening audience.
The orchestra's biggest market is America where it has become well known
through public service broadcasting.
It also tours and sells records to a German audience and is building a new
market in Japan.
Ms Gilbert believes the orchestra's success has a widersignificance than
simple recognition of The Academy's particular contribution.
It is a significance which she says fits in with the increasingly higher
profile and broader appeal of classical music. 'This is a recognition that
will mean something not only to people in the arts, but also to ordinary
people involved in industry who will turn around and say 'My goodness, an
orchestra has qualified for an award for its contribution to exports'.'
The Academy's award will also, Ms Gilbert believes, illustrate how the arts
can act as attractive ambassadors for Britain in overseas markets.
'It shows how the arts can give a focus of publicity to England and Great
Britain. This is a wonderful way to publicise the country.'
It was this belief which guided the orchestra's decision to apply for the
award.
'We applied for a form, filled it in, kept our fingers crossed and hoped
something would happen.'

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: Who said
pigs don't fly? - Breeding for the table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS something irresistibly comic about the idea of flying pigs. But
when British pigs go to market abroad, they do fly - by jumbo jet.
The UK leads the world in pig breeding, and two of the three leading UK
companies have won Queen's Awards for Exports. The Pig Improvement Company
(PIC), the world's leading supplier of breeding pigs, has used jumbo jets to
send stock out to China and the US, among other destinations. The National
Pig Development Company, which hit the headlines last year with its
introduction of a Chinese line into its stock, last year sent a jumbo jet
containing more than 800 pigs to the US every six weeks.
PIC, based in Fyfield Wick, near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, last year celebrated
the 30th anniversary of its foundation by a small group of Oxford farmers.
The company was bought by Dalgety in the early 1970s, and now employs 170 in
the UK and more than 1,100 worldwide.
It won its first Queen's Award for Exports in 1975 for a pioneering project
to re-equip the Bulgarian pig industry.
Turnover this year is expected to reach Pounds 120m. The company has 25 per
cent of the UK market for breeding gilts (sows that have not yet borne a
litter), but also has a network of worldwide outlets and expects to sell
around 1m animals in 29 countries this year. World sales are claimed to be
as big as the next five competitor companies combined.
Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive of Dalgety, said that PIC had increased
its exports of breeding stock from the UK steadily year by year.
Among recent successes has been a three-year programme to improve production
in the Ukraine. This involved not only the export of 2,000 breeding stock,
but also an exchange programme which sent company staff out to the Ukraine
while Ukrainians were trained in the latest techniques in the UK.
The company also secured a Pounds 1m deal with Cuba by agreeing to accept
sugar in return for pigs.
But in addition, said Mr Clothier, PIC had seen strong growth in earnings
from its overseas subsidiary companies, which account for 80 per cent of
turnover.
PIC has wholly-owned subsidiary companies in the US, Germany, Mexico, Spain,
Portugal, France and Holland as well as 14 franchise companies. The US
subsidiary is the single largest pig breeding company in the world.
Mr Clothier believes the world market for breeding stock has the potential
to double and possibly treble over the next 10 years. The US has been slow
to develop improved pig breeding, but demand now far exceeds the industry's
capacity to supply. China, another huge potential market, has not yet
started to improve its pig farming.
He believes the UK has become the world leader because it made an early
start in the application of the principles of genetics in pig breeding. UK
breeders had 'devised a commercial approach which worked much more
innovatively than government breeding schemes,' he suggested. Competition
was pushing the technology ahead.
One of PIC's competitors is the National Pig Development Company (NPD), of
Driffield, East Yorkshire. NPD was founded in 1969 by Mr John Curtis, who
was anxious for his two sons to be able to earn a living from farming.
The company now employs 250 people and has an annual turnover of about
Pounds 20m, of which nearly half is accounted for by exports. However, the
company has launched a franchise agreement every year for the past six
years, and now has deals in the US, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines,
Holland, Italy, Spain and South Korea.
The search for a better pig is a high tech business. NPD claims to have the
largest computer record for breeding pigs in the world as statistics are
collected not only from the 24 farms it owns, but also from the franchise
operations. Mr Stephen Curtis, managing director for production, said that
computers had increased the accuracy of breeding selection by 15 per cent.
Last year the company was the first to produce a commercial hybrid from the
Chinese Meishan (pictured), which has long been admired for its
astonishingly high reproduction rate.
The sow has up to 20 teats, compared with 12 to 14 in a British breed, and
regularly delivers 16 piglets.
But when fully grown the Chinese pig is all fat and bone with little lean
meat - hence the Chinese passion for sucking pig. Mr Stephen Curtis believes
that NPD's 20-year drive to produce pigs with a high lean meat content are
behind its success in harnessing Meishan blood.
The Manor Meishan hybrid was launched on to the UK market in some style at
the Cafe Royal in London last May. Its heirs should be airborne within a
couple of years.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: An
authority on women's bodies - A E Arthur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Albert Edward Arthur started importing artificial flowers at Covent
Garden, London, nearly 100 years ago, he unwittingly laid the foundation of
a family company which is one of this year's more unusual award winners.
A E Arthur, the family company which still bears his name, is one of only
two in the world which supply dressmakers' dummies (the second, Adjustform
of Ashford, Kent, is also British). About 20 years ago A E Arthur moved from
Lambeth, South London, to Kings Lynn, Norfolk, where it now employs about 60
people.
With a turnover of nearly Pounds 1.7m a year, it makes 70,000 lifesize
female dummies of which 85 per cent are exported.
Mr Eric Arthur, the present managing director and grandson of the founder,
explains the evolution from imported artificial flowers to the present
business: 'Initially we made wire frames for floral wreaths. In 1919, my
grandfather widened the business to include foundations for dressmaking.'
The artificial flowers still flourished - at one point the family had 15
shops in London. But the last closed 15 years ago when the Covent Garden
fruit and vegetable market moved out of its historic site and dummies became
the company's mainstay. They retail at about Pounds 120 and are sold for use
in the home rather than in dressmaking salons. The original wire foundation
has now been replaced by plastic.
Thanks to its worldwide contacts, A E Arthur speaks with authority about
global variations in the female form. 'In Australia we cater mainly for
slender women', says Mr Arthur. But in Japan, the differences are even more
pronounced - Japanese ladies' breasts, he says, 'are smaller, lower and
further out'.
This judgment is based on fieldwork carried out by A E Arthur's export
agent. 'He went out on the streets and persuaded 1,000 women to let him take
their measurements. He then sent us a papier mache model, on which we based
our Japanese dummy.'
For the names of its non-Japanese dummies, (which vary according to their
adjustment mechanisms) A E Arthur turned to Greek legend: they are Diana,
Venus and Athena.
Not all its customers are nimble-fingered housewives, however. The company
supplies dummies for exhibitions, such as that staged by the BBC a few years
ago to display the spectacular costumes used in its drama series on the
wives of King Henry the Eighth.
Appropriately, they were all headless.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: Against the
coal tide - Powell Duffryn International Fuels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID THE controversy surrounding the government's pit closures programme
during the last six months, there was near unanimity about one thing:
without subsidies of a scale never likely from a Conservative government,
the UK's exports potential is small and declining.
However, one company is showing that it is possible to make a success in a
small market by exploiting niches. Powell Duffryn International Fuels is
today rewarded with a Queen's Award for Export Achievement. This is the
first time that the company, a subsidiary of Powell Duffryn, the diversified
industrial group, has won a Queen's Award, although in more than 100 years
of existence in various forms, it has acquired a considerable reputation
and, according to at least one industry analyst, the company is currently
the most efficient coal trader in the UK.
Mr Barry Hartiss, chairman of Powell Duffryn's fuel distribution
subsidiaries, says one key to the company's success in recent years has been
PDIF's seven members of staff.
Mr Hartiss is, however, less informative with numbers involving PDIF,
declining to supply figures for turnover and profitability or even for the
proportion of purchases which the company makes from the UK. 'The company
generates a healthy flow of income from abroad but I cannot go into details
because this is such a competitive market,' he says.
The effects of the rivalry were demonstrated graphically last month in the
government's white paper on coal. This showed that exports by British Coal
amounted to 1.4m tonnes in 1991-2, against 2m in recent years. (Coal
imports, at nearly 10 times that level, are increasing at a similarly
speed.)
The white paper said British Coal expected to export only 700,000 tonnes in
1992-3, reflecting the corporation's decision to withdraw as quickly as
possible from loss making business first hand. 'There may be limited scope
for profitable export of larger size of coal and of anthracite, which are
effectively niche markets, but readily accessible UK supplies are limited.'
PDIF, however, buys coal from many other sources than British Coal. One
source is private UK producers whose number is expected to grow in the
privatisation process of the next few years. The company also buys coal from
Australia, the Americas and South Africa among others.
Most of the coal is sold in Europe, outside the UK, mainly to industrial
customers including electricity generators, cement and steel makers. The
company, which specialises in short sea movements of cargoes throughout
north west Europe, processes as well as handles coal. Mr Hartiss says it is
committed to being active participants rather than 'paper transaction
traders'.
Mr Hartiss says the company operates in markets dominated by large trading
houses and low cost mass producers. 'Our skill is in identifying niche
overseas trading and export markets for mainly specialised coal and
anthracite products. We are looking at uses to which customers put coal and
matching them with what we buy.'

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queen's Awards For Export Achievement 1993: Strong tail
winds from Canada - Short Brothers of Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT BROTHERS of Northern Ireland, which has won its 16th export
achievement award, has staged one of the most remarkable comebacks in the
aerospace industry during the last five years.
After more than 40 years in government ownership, the Belfast-based company
and oldest established aircraft manufacturer in the world, was acquired in
October 1989 by Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transport group. From
a loss of Pounds 47m in 1988 it has returned to profit with earnings in its
last two financial years of Pounds 26.5m and Pounds 28.5m respectively.
Exports have doubled from Pounds 110m in 1988 to Pounds 224m last year while
overall turnover has also doubled since 1988 to Pounds 392m last year.
Since the company's privatisation and acquisition by the Bombardier group,
about Pounds 200m has been invested in plant, machinery and facilities to
improve quality and productivity as well as to reduce costs. The company
says it has saved so far Pounds 35m as a result of its total quality
programme launched six years ago.
Shorts has now become the European arm of Bombardier's aerospace division
which also includes Canadair, de Havilland and Learjet. The link with the
Canadians has enabled Shorts to win new business on Canadair and Learjet
regional and corporate aircraft.
However, the latest export award was won by the company's Fokker division
which manufactures and exports wings for the 100-seat Fokker 100 regional
jet built by the Dutch group. Shorts' Fokker export business almost trebled
over the past three years.
Shorts has worked with Fokker and Deutsche Aerospace, which is acquiring
this year a majority stake in the Dutch aircraft maker, for the past 28
years: first on the Fokker F-28 and since 1983 on the Fokker 100. The
Belfast group has seen the delivery rates for Fokker 100 wing sets increase
from 12 in 1988 to 61 last year.
The company expects to expand its business with Fokker with the delivery of
wing sets for the Dutch manufacturer's latest programme, the Fokker 70, a
70-80 seat derivative of the Fokker 100.
Shorts, Northern Ireland's largest manufacturing company, also does
extensive commercial aerospace business with Boeing of the US, Rolls-Royce
and the International Aero Engine consortium. On the defence side, it has
developed new products including the Starburst close air defence missile
system and the S-1 multi arms trainer.
Following the general trend in the aerospace industry, the company has also
expanded its international partnerships.
However, Shorts has not escaped the general slump in the world aerospace
industry. The company, which currently employs about 8,500 people, announced
last March plans to shed 665 jobs largely because of production cuts at its
two big civil aircraft customers, Boeing and Fokker.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: There's
many a slip .. - Catherine Milton considers the judges' criteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW CAN a company which qualifies for a Queen's Award for Export go bust
just weeks after accepting the accompanying invitation to tea at Buckingham
Palace?
In 1991 two of that year's 849 winners are known to have gone under. Mint &amp;
Boxed, once a leading antique toy dealer, called in the receivers little
more than a month after accepting the award.
A fortnight before, the English Provender Company, an Oxfordshire-based
preserves and pickles business, had gone into receivership.
Mr Robin Ebers, deputy director general of the Institute of Export, is
broadly supportive of the scheme which he acknowledges as the UK's most
prestigious. He said: 'An award of this kind enables companies to show they
are doing their best for the economy and expanding trade.'
The employers organisation, the Confederation of British Industry, echoes
this view: 'A lot of companies apply and are very unhappy when they don't
win and delighted when they do. That must mean companies value the award and
therefore it is a success.'
Only a small number of the more than 2,500 companies which have won the
award are known to have failed in the 27 years since the scheme began, but
some industrialists have long raised questions about the criteria that award
winners are required to meet.
They say it is not surprising the judges failed to spot potential company
failures. The scheme's literature says it is designed to recognise a
'substantial and sustained increase in export earnings to a level which is
outstanding for the products or services concerned and for the size of the
applicant unit's operations'.
This basic criterion is then qualified by requirements for the applicants to
explain fully how they achieved this. The judges require figures for three
years and applicants are compared with their competitors' and the general
export trend.
Against this apparently comprehensive evaluation, critics cite the example
of one small technical company, once an active part of a profitable
conglomerate.
The company, they say, won the export award in the middle 1970s partly on
the strength of at least one deal which improved export figures but on which
the company actually made a loss.
'It shows that any fool can get business on the other guy's terms. In the
end the award was simply a nice warm glow', said an insider. Even the
supportive Mr Ebers tells of a woman who became angry when he offered
congratulations on her company's winning an award last year. She subjected
him to a tirade about how the export team had been harried by the company's
executives to meet orders and produce figures.
'There was no support for the export team and no training. They were
virtually put in a room of darkness and told to get on with it. Some
companies seek the status of the award without sustained improvement in the
quality of their operations', Mr Ebers said.
He believes that in general an emphasis on turnover figures can lead
companies to over commit themselves, find themselves unable to deliver on
time and then see overseas orders dry up with what can be catastrophic
results.
Mr Anthony Pierce, senior lecturer in international trade and finance at
London's City University, agrees: 'The key criterion seems to be the
incremental increase in exports the company achieves and that's just daft.
It's such a fudgeable number.'
Mr Pierce, who also runs his own consultancy, Export Risk Control, believes
companies who make little effort to win export orders can win the awards if,
for example, they have a new product and no competitors, or if competitor
suppliers of the product dry up elsewhere.
The department of trade and industry rejects these criticisms. It said: 'We
are certainly entirely happy with our criteria. The sheer number of
companies who apply, and the extension of the scheme to environmental awards
shows that it is a success.
'Of course you can find companies that have won an award and gone bankrupt.
You can also find MBE and OBE winners who end up with criminal records.'
And a spokesman for one of this year's winners, the Really Useful Group,
said: 'It's a great morale boost. It does give the workforce a nice warm
glow and that is something a lot of companies place a very high value on.'

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: Valuable
paper-chase - Harrison &amp; Sons / high security printing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HARRISON &amp; Sons, one of the world's oldest high security printers, has been
literally cashing in on the death of communism.
The firm, whose roots go back to the 16th century, has been putting its
skills at the disposal of newly freed countries which want passports,
currency and other sophisticated documentation both for practical purposes
and to flaunt their independence.
Harrison, based at High Wycombe, never names its customers unless its
clients want them to do so. But Jeff Stuart, chief executive, confirms the
receipt of orders from 'about four' of the 15 former Soviet members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, including the newly emergent Moslem
countries of Central Asia.
These and other new orders have underpinned the 70 per cent of its Pounds
65m a year turnover which is accounted for by exports to about 150
countries.
Harrison, part of Lonrho since 1979, is one of two British firms, and one of
only eight in the world, which supply the full range of high security
printing, including bank notes, travellers cheques, passports and identity
cards.
Delarue, the other, is the biggest in the world - it recently won the
contract for the new Estonian passport. Canada too bosts two high security
printers and there are one each in the US, Germany, Holland and France.
These eight companies compete to supply the 10 per cent of banknotes not
produced by the world's 69 State printing works. The market for the private
firms has expanded due to the freeing of the countries of Eastern Europe,
previously reliant on state printers in the Soviet Union, East Germany and
Hungary. Developments in the east added 3.5bn banknotes to the 7.5bn
previously supplied by private printers.
The US Banknote Company is supplying the new Lithuanian currency. The German
firm, Devrient of Munich, has taken over the former East German state
printer.
Harrison has won orders in Poland and is believed to have already supplied
currency to CIS countries which want their own alternatives to the Russian
rouble, still widely circulating in the former USSR, and the new Russian
Federation Rouble.
Harrison's expanding sales, says Stuart, are due only partly to the collapse
of Soviet communism. In the early 1980s it embarked on a strategic expansion
plan as a result of which it had the capacity to meet the new demand once it
materialised.
This capacity includes not only sophisticated machinery but the skills of
its designers and engravers, which are the creative spearhead of its
750-strong workforce.
In spite of the economic difficulties in the post-Communist countries,
Stuart has no concern about doing business with them. All Harrison's new
customers had been scrupulous in backing their orders by international
letters of credit confirmed on a European bank.
Harrison &amp; Sons was founded in 1750, but traces its ancestry to a 16th
century bible printer, whose original imprint is still used. Soon after it
was established, Harrison &amp; Sons was entrusted to print the London Gazette
for the British Government, in which, fittingly, its latest Queen's Award
was published.
It no longer prints the Gazette, but still works for the Government as the
supplier of more than 90 per cent of all postage stamps. One of its presses
consumes 30,000 miles of paper a year.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export, Technology and The
Environment 1993: Suddenly the tables are beginning to turn - After a dismal
decade, the climate for British exporters has brightened, thanks to new
finance facilities and a more competitive sterling exchange rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A DECADE of complaints from British exporters that the government ignores
their needs has quietly ended.
In recent months, an array of policy reforms have not only answered
exporters' demands, but in some cases have been drawn up by the exporters
themselves. They range from cheaper export credit insurance premiums and
larger sums available for cover in promising markets in developing
countries, to a new approach to export promotion campaigns and the
appointment of 'national champions' to advise the government on strategy in
sectors of export strength.
Combined with a devaluation of sterling which has greatly enhanced British
export competitiveness, and interest rates that are among the lowest in
Europe, they have given exporters a fillip that competitors in many other
countries can only envy.
'If a company can't export now, then you have to question whether it should
be in business in the first place,' commented a senior official at the
Confederation of British Industry.
Behind the government reforms is an emerging consensus that the only route
to non-inflationary growth, and fresh job creation, is through exports.
At a less abstract level, many industrialists talk approvingly of a new mood
created by Mr Michael Heseltine and his terrier-like minister of trade, Mr
Richard Needham.
First signs of a change of heart in government came in autumn last year,
when export insurance cover was boosted in a number of 'concentrated
markets' - developing country markets such as China, Indonesia or Malaysia
where export success had led to the Export Credits Guarantee Department
banging its head against country lending ceilings. This was followed early
this year by two new export promotion campaigns, one in the European single
market, and the other targeted at the US. These were distinctive not just
because they included some novel features but because they were the direct
result of close consultation between government and industry.
Most original was the three-year 'North America Now' campaign, launched
early in March, and intended to boost the UK share of US visible imports
from 3.8 per cent at present to 5 per cent by 1995. This would boost exports
in money terms by about Pounds 3bn a year from the current level of Pounds
12.2bn.
Among its innovations are the targeting of 20 US sectors, including
services, giftware, mail order, food and drink, airport equipment,
construction and clothing - all areas of UK export strength. A total of 50
events are planned in North America over six months focused on export
opportunities in these sectors.
For major exporters, the campaign will involve discussions intended to
pinpoint where the government can best assist in overcoming trade barriers,
or define overall trade and investment strategies. For small and medium
sized companies, the campaign includes a 'strategic alliances' initiative
under which Price Waterhouse has been appointed to work with about 50
companies a year with the aim of introducing them to a prospective US
partner. The aim will be to forge between 10 and 15 successful partnerships
each year, generating a Pounds 30m contribution to the UK balance of
payments.
A third fillip for exporters came in the budget, when Mr Norman Lamont
announced an average 7 1/2 per cent cut in export credit insurance premium
rates, and added Pounds 1.3bn to the credit cover available in 'concentrated
markets' over the next three years.
Exporters now generally accept that the cost of export insurance premiums
has fallen back into line with those offered to competitors in Germany,
France, Italy and the US. They continue to complain that high rates over the
past two years - often three of four times higher than rates available to
competitors - have cost them dear.
The most recent reforms intended to aid exporters involve the reorganisation
of the Overseas Project Board inside the DTI, the job of which is to ensure
close links between the government and industry in bids for big export
projects.
The government is to appoint 'national champions', mainly drawn from the
private sector, who will head 'sector groups' inside the OPB focused on
power, water, airports, transport, and oil and gas. They will aim to
pinpoint UK export strengths, identify priority export markets, seek joint
ventures in infrastructure projects, and look for opportunities for
collaboration in developing countries, particularly as they privatise
sectors of their economies.
Most radically, these 'national champions' will aim to prevent UK exporters
competing against each other in efforts to win a foreign contract - a
potentially controversial and anti-competitive move which matches practices
in countries such as Japan and France which have been fiercely criticised in
the past.
The aim of the initiative is highly specific - to boost the annual export
earnings of large contract exporters from an expected Pounds 10bn this year
to Pounds 20bn by the end of the decade.
With the specific exception of 'strategic alliances', these changes appear
to address the complaints of Britain's 'big industry' much more directly
than those of small and medium sized companies - in spite of the fact that
the Confederation of British Industry, and other industry organisations,
often complain that too few companies account for too large a proportion of
British exports. Last year, Britain's top 20 exporters accounted for
overseas sales of Pounds 29bn - almost one third of all exports.
Changes of greater importance to small and medium sized exporters, such as
capital investment write-downs, cuts in corporation tax, an exporters' loan
guarantee scheme and bankers' export guarantees, have so far been resisted.
Exporters also complain that some of the potential benefits from these
various reforms will be lost because of government refusal to reverse plans
to withdraw from reinsurance of exporters' political risks, and because of a
continuing squeeze on interest margins provided to banks to enable them to
remain active in engineering financing packages for exporters.
On the reinsurance issue, which leading short term credit insurers such as
the Cardiff-based NCM say is forcing them to turn down requests for cover
worth about Pounds 4bn a year, negotiations are likely to begin this summer
with the ECGD.
The dispute over bankers' interest margins - called 'fixed rate export
finance', or 'frefs' - is also likely to be settled soon - whether for good
or ill. Bankers say the paring of margins demanded by the Treasury in 1987
has led to many banks withdrawing from the export finance field, and put
profits under pressure among the dozen banks which remain active.
They insist that a further paring back would lead to fresh withdrawals, the
main casualties being exporters, who will no longer be able to find bankers
on the ground in developing countries to arrange the finance that often
forms a critical part of any contract bid.
One area where exporters and government are likely to remain at loggerheads
is the use of aid to boost export efforts. Britain's own 'Aid and Trade
Provision' (ATP) remains small by international standards, with increasing
pressure to use limited aid funds for clear-cut aid purposes - like disaster
and famine relief.
Vigilance has been sharpened at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development against the use of 'mixed credits' - the dilution of
commercial loans with grant aid - to help exporters to the developing world.
OECD governments agree that the competitive use of aid to provide exporters
with subsidised finance is a costly and self-defeating process which
ultimately neither helps exporters nor channels aid effectively to
developing countries. But exporters continue to press for ATP to be
increased, referring constantly to instances where foreign competitors have
allegedly tapped aid finance to sweeten the financing of strategic
contracts.
These efforts to sharpen the export competitiveness of 'UK Inc' face the
constant danger of becoming over-simplified and counter-productive. For
example, it is becoming increasingly clear that foreign investment is a
critical precondition for enhanced trade flows. A policy that aims to boost
exports without paying close attention to foreign investment and the option
of foreign joint ventures is likely to be flawed. There is also a bemusing
problem in defining 'UK Inc', such as when GEC, through its partnership with
Alsthom, is as well placed to manufacture in France as in the UK, or where
Trafalgar House can use a subsidiary in the US to bid for a contract in a
foreign market.
It is notable that in 1991, 37 of Britain's top 100 exporters were
foreign-owned. They include Ford, IBM, Nissan, Kodak and Rhone-Poulenc.
Government help for such exporters will help to secure jobs and skills in
the UK, but will at the same time boost the profits of these foreign
companies. The gains from visible exports are in part offset by the
invisible drain of profits and dividends remitted to the parent company, and
to investors overseas.
The simple lesson is that the interests of multinational corporations do not
coincide with those of national governments, and that earnings from
invisibles cannot be wholly ignored in the quest for visible exports.
These are conundrums that neither UK exporters, nor a government
newly-converted to the cause of boosting the nation's exports, care to
ponder - at least for now.

FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown scorns 'hyped' recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives were 'over-hyping' signs of economic recovery to win the
Newbury by-election, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said
yesterday, as the Tories sighted not just green shoots but 'a green branch'.
Mr Ashdown later accused the Tories of reviving their general election
campaign pledge of 'Vote for us on Thursday and the recovery will start on
Friday'.
He said the Tories' 'irresponsibility' in talking up the prospects for
economic recovery could lead to a 'catastrophic decline in confidence' after
the by-election on May 6.
'Britain may have been conned last April by the Conservatives saying the
recovery would begin tomorrow. I don't believe Newbury will be conned
twice,' Mr Ashdown said.
Mr Julian Davidson, the Tory candidate for the seat which the party held
with a 12,000-plus majority in the election last April, urged the Liberal
Democrats to 'look recovery in the face'.
He said: 'It is not so much green shoots but a green branch which is
currently coming forth.'
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, added: 'What is absolutely
obvious is that as the recovery takes root and becomes a shoot and a branch
then we are going to see real jobs, real increases in employment prospects.'
Labour was quick to ridicule the upbeat Tory message. Mr Gordon Brown, the
shadow chancellor, campaigning in support of Mr Steve Billcliffe, said
unemployment figures published tomorrow would show that Britain was entering
a summer jobs crisis.
The Liberal Democrats did not deny there had been encouraging indicators but
Mr David Rendel, their candidate, said signs that a recovery was on the way
were 'not yet firmly established'.

FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cuts sought in housing benefit
budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING BENEFIT has emerged as a main target for savings in the government's
fundamental review of the Pounds 80bn social security budget.
Two of the most likely changes are increasing the rate at which housing
benefit is withdrawn as someone's income rises above eligibility for the
maximum benefit, and making tenants who receive some housing benefit bear
some of the cost of rent increases.
The government estimates that making the 'taper', the rate at which the
benefit is withdrawn, 80 per cent rather than 65 per cent would save Pounds
240m a year.
It is, however, unlikely that people who are eligible to have all their rent
paid through housing benefit would be required to make a contribution.
Changes to the subsidy payable to housing associations to 'claw back' some
money from that quarter also look less likely, especially given the
increased emphasis since the Autumn Statement on housing associations
raising private-sector funding.
High-level officials from the Department of Social Security, the Department
of the Environment and the Treasury are examining ways to cut spending on
the benefit.
The group was set up last year but has become part of the Treasury's
public-spending review, which is intended to yield savings as early as next
year's expenditure, as well as setting a longer-term path for curbing
departmental budgets.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said yesterday that no area
of his department's budget would be ruled out of the review, but said that
changes would be introduced gradually.
'There will be no big bang,' he told the Commons social security committee.
He said officials were examining the increased take-up in benefits, and
studying how long people were drawing benefit and comparing this with
previous years.
Ministers' decisions would be focused on targeting benefits to those most in
need - encouraging personal independence, withdrawing state benefits where
they were no longer appropriate, improving incentives to work and reducing
the scope for fraud.
Mr Lilley said that the most scope for radical reform lay in the
streamlining of the delivery of benefits. Eventually, this could lead to
changes in the structure of benefit with people being assessed for all their
needs at one time.
Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said that Mr Lilley's
evidence to the committee about departmental spending had left millions of
low-income households still in the dark about how the government planned to
compensate them for the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel.

FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rights of passage queried in Braer
inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RULES governing ships' rights of passage in foreign waters were described as
'very odd' by Lord Donaldson on the first day of his inquiry into the Braer
disaster.
The former Master of the Rolls, investigating the incident in January in
which the Liberian-registered tanker spilled 85,000 tonnes of crude oil
after breaking up in storms off Shetland, was seeking clarification of the
rights of passage of ships in another country's territorial waters.
He was told by Foreign Office international law experts that ships do not
necessarily have to tell the sovereign state when they are passing through.
Lord Donaldson said: 'The idea that you can go through territorial waters
without saying who you are or what you are does seem to me to be very odd.'
He then asked if the British government would have the right, for example,
to send a warship through French territorial waters.
When told that the government could do this, Lord Donaldson replied: 'I
would have thought a destroyer dredging along one mile off the French coast
might cause some excitement.' Lord Donaldson has already considered
substantial written evidence submitted in advance of today's yesterday's
opening of the inquiry.
He was appointed by John MacGregor, the transport secretary, 'to advise on
whether any further measures are appropriate and feasible to protect the UK
coastline from pollution from merchant shipping', and to give 'due
consideration to the international and economic implications of any new
measures'.

FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour faces Maastricht turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WAS last night scrambling to sustain its hopes of forcing the
government to embrace Maastricht's social chapter after a motion censuring
Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, was accepted for early debate.
The move came as Lord Healey, the former Labour chancellor, said it was
'quite possible' the House of Lords could vote for a Maastricht referendum.
Lord Healey said government manoeuvrings had made him more inclined to vote
for a referendum. 'A lot of people . . in the Lords . . will be tempted to
vote for a referendum if the government is denying the House of Commons the
right to decide on a major issue,' he said.
With the tortuous line-by-line consideration of the Maastricht bill entering
its final lap, MPs are set to start their own referendum debate later today
after the motion of censure has been considered.
With government and Labour front benches opposed to the idea, there seems to
be no prospect that MPs will vote for a referendum to be held. But with
feelings running high, the debate could provide a dress-rehearsal for its
Lords counterpart, where the outcome may be less clear-cut.
Although yesterday's motion of censure was triggered by MPs' disgruntlement
at Mr Morris's decision not to allow a vote on the amendment widely thought
to have the best chance of cornering the government on the social chapter,
Labour has been forced on the defensive by predictions that it might
actually lessen the chances of such a vote.
If the motion were heavily defeated it could suggest MPs were content with
Mr Morris's ruling, weakening the argument for voting on the amendment
during the report stage.
Labour sought to underline its view that the motion of censure was
counter-productive by arguing there could not be a vote on the amendment -
known as amendment 27 - before the report stage even if the motion were
carried.
Its remarks came as the government said it would accept another Labour
amendment - known as new clause 74 - thought by some to give Labour an
outside chance of achieving its aims.
Labour will oppose the motion of censure, the first such motion to be
debated for 21 years, and so far signed by 64 MPs including three Tory
Euro-sceptics; Mr Richard Shepherd, Mr Roger Knapman and Sir Richard Body.
Mr John Major will use a speech to the Conservative Group for Europe
tomorrow to spell out the UK's positive vision for the EC.
His argument is that by moving to shape the agenda for the next
inter-governmental conference in 1996 at an early stage, the UK can avoid
the sort of difficulties it found over the Maastricht treaty.

FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM urged to act over Timex row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour party leader, yesterday called on the prime
minister to intervene in the Timex strike by referring the conflict to Acas,
the independent conciliation and arbitration service, 'without delay'.
Mr Smith told the annual conference of the Scottish TUC in Glasgow: 'I call
on Mr Major to exercise his responsibility as prime minister to help bring
the dispute to an end.'
He added: 'He does not need to prejudge the merits of anyone's case - all he
needs to do is to put into action a process which could lead to a fair
resolution and a just settlement. I hope he can, at the very least, manage
to do that.'
He said the Timex dispute concerned 340 workers who had been 'sacked for the
audacity of challenging compulsory lay-offs and the imposition of poorer
working conditions'. He criticised a system of industrial relations that
allowed workers to 'lose their livelihood at the whim of a reactionary
employer'.
Mr Smith said workers needed 'the protection of labour laws which guard
their right to work, their right to be represented and their right not to be
dismissed unfairly and capriciously'.
In a debate about Timex at the Scottish TUC Mr Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU
national officer, said a rally against the company on May 15 should 'shake
Timex to its roots'.
The row expected to erupt in the Labour party over proposals that it back
proportional representation for Westminster elections was last night
postponed, Ralph Atkins writes.
Labour's National Executive Committee had been due to discuss next week the
proposal for electoral reform drawn up by Professor Raymond Plant of
Southampton University, following a debate among the parliamentary party
today.
But after pressure from Labour MPs the party's leadership agreed that the
PLP should instead debate Bosnia today and PR on May 12. The delay will come
as temporary relief for some Labour MPs who fear a damaging split over the
Plant report.
Mr Smith will set out his views on the Plant report at the NEC meeting of
May 19. Party officials were last night stressing that the delay would not
stop a final decision being taken by the Labour conference in October.

FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten rallies Tory backbenchers
over policy on school tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY MPs rallied behind Mr John Patten, the education secretary, in the
Commons last night when he insisted that schools should proceed with the
tests they are legally required to stage this summer.
He described the attempt made by the National Union of Teachers to promote a
boycott of the tests as 'absurd' and forecast that the 'committed
professionalism of teachers' would result in the law being obeyed.
The government secured a majority of 54 (317-263) to defeat a Labour motion
calling on the education secretary to withdraw the compulsion on schools to
carry out key stage three tests in English and tech-nology.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, had again emphasised the importance of
ensuring that the tests took place.
He said: 'I believe any attempt to sabotage our reforms could damage our
long-term ability to compete, and damage the education of our children.'
Mr Patten rejected a suggestion by Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education
secretary, that parents should be balloted on whether they wanted the tests
to take place in the summer.
Challenged by Tory backbenchers on whether she backed calls for a boycott,
Mrs Taylor said she supported the professional and educational case made by
the teachers.
She said the actions teachers took in support of their cases 'must be for
their decision.'
Mr Patten argued that tests enabled parents to establish the progress their
children were making at school, and also helped ministers when deciding the
resources that needed to be allocated to education.
Mrs Taylor acknowledged the value of 'good and appropriate' tests, but
maintained that those which Mr Patten had devised were 'high on
administration and low on educational value'.
Sir Malcolm Thornton (C Crosby), chairman of the cross-party education
committee, said he could understand teachers' frustration but cautioned that
a boycott would do nothing but harm.
He advocated improved consultation procedures for teachers and suggested
that an agreement to make the tests voluntary rather than statutory for the
present year offered a way forward.
Mr Patten assured him that teachers would be able to make their views known
to Sir Ron Dearing, the chairman of the schools curriculum and assessment
authority.
Earlier in the day the Liberal Democrats broadened their campaign for the
local elections with the launch of a paper promising new approaches in
education instead of the current 'division and chaos'.
Mr Don Foster, the party's education spokesman, predicted that there would
be a widespread boycott of the tests by parents as there had been in
Scotland. Agreeing with the concerns that teachers had voiced about the
tests, he added: 'They are the professionals, they are the ones that must
make the judgment about what is best for their particular children - I will
support the judgment they come to.'
The government was defeated by 34 votes in the House of Lords when peers
approved a Labour amendment requiring that people with experience of special
educational needs should be appointed to the funding agency established
under the education bill.

FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs warned on aerospace R&amp;D funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING aerospace and defence equipment manufacturers have warned MPs that
Britain will be squeezed out of international markets unless the government
provides adequate resources for technological research and development.
GEC-Marconi and Dowty, two of the leading companies in the sector, have told
the cross-party Commons trade and industry committee that the British
government's support for the sector still lags well behind that of European
companies.
Their stance will increase the prospect that the committee will endorse a
report from the DTI's aviation committee, which includes civil servants and
industry representatives, for Britain to develop a national strategic
technology acquisition plan (NSTAP). The companies are still waiting for the
minister's response to the plan.
The committee, which is conducting an investigation into the future of
British aerospace companies, will hear evidence from executives of the two
companies later today.
GEC-Marconi suggests in a written submission that Britain risks losing the
technological lead it enjoys in several areas of electronics.
The company says a dialogue between government and industry is needed to
identify clearly the 'core technologies' which are vital both to defence and
to Britain's overall economic well-being.
It adds: 'British industry is already invited to participate in several
European collaborative technology programmes but has to find its own share
of the funding with little or no help from the government . . . Other
European companies receive substantial financial support from their
governments.'
The same theme is taken up in the evidence submitted by Dowty, which says
that government support is required to bridge the gap between the City's
preoccupation with short-term performance and the much longer-term view
necessary in a high-technology industry.
Dowty says that a partnership between government and industry is essential
to ensure the competitiveness of UK companies.
It calls for more government finance for research and development,
particularly through so-called demonstrator projects and improved help for
exports through credits and defence support activities.
The company adds: 'Dowty fully supports the NSTAP as offering a constructive
joint government/industry approach which can provide vital underpinning for
a revival of the UK aerospace sector.'
The MPs will also hear evidence today from the Manufacturing Science Finance
union, which warns in its written evidence that on current trends
structural, financial and competition difficulties 'will almost certainly
see the UK replaced by Germany or France as Europe's leading aerospace
nation'.

FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith calls for Serb ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday increased pressure on the
government for military action against the Serbs in Bosnia by urging the
threat of air strikes to check further Serb advances.
He called for 'a clear ultimatum' to be issued to the Serbs 'that they will
not be allowed to continue with their aggression unchecked - and that if
they do so their lines of supply within Bosnia will be subject to air
attack'.
Mr Smith's comments followed his call last week for an ultimatum threatening
air attacks on Serb communication and supply lines if they did not comply
with a ceasefire. Labour MPs will today debate policy on Bosnia amid
evidence of growing pressure on the leadership for a still more aggressive
stance on Bosnia. Some Labour MPs are demanding the sending of ground
troops.
Mr John Major responded to Mr Smith's call by saying moves such as air
strikes were being 'seriously considered' in talks with allies. But he
warned that 'the road to further action, particularly if that road leads to
military action . . . is a road that is fraught with perils'.
The prime minister feared British humanitarian aid efforts would have to
stop if military strikes began.
Mr Smith said he appreciated the risks, but they had to be set against 'the
possibly greater risks' of inaction.
Mr Major sought to calm Tory MPs' fears about UK troops being sucked into a
prolonged conflict in Bosnia by setting firm parameters for British troops'
involvement in combat. He said the 'only circumstance' in which he could
foresee Britain becoming part of a military operation was if it were under
Nato command, with US participation and backed by a new United Nations
resolution with Russian support.
An escalation of outside military involvement was not yet the policy of any
leading UN government, he added.
Downing Street said cabinet ministers kept policy on Bosnia under constant
review, but officials rebuffed suggestions that Britain would necessarily
fall into line if President Bill Clinton backed air strikes.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, urged Britain to back the UN High
Commission for Refugees' proposals for 'safe havens'.
Earlier, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the government had
'extreme reservations' about the use of military force.
He also said he was satisfied that the 2,300 British military contingent was
the right size for the humanitarian tasks required and that he was
discussing with the UN the future of the British Field Ambulance unit,
deployed in Croatia since last May.

<TEXT>
THE BBC World Service fears it may have to close a number of its
foreign-language radio services because of threatened cuts to its funding.
The Foreign Office, which funds the BBC World Service, has confirmed a
Pounds 5m cut in budget for each of the three years from 1994 to 1997.
More than 220 MPs from both sides of the Commons have signed an early day
motion opposing the cuts, expressing 'grave concern' at potential damage to
Britain's reputation 'as the fount of accurate and unbiased news.'
The World Service, which broadcasts in English and 38 other languages to an
audience of more than 1.2bn, has also been asked to draw up contingency
plans for further cuts of 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent.

FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew seeks US backing on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is to visit the US early
next month in an attempt to win backing for British policy on the province,
Ralph Atkins writes.
His trip comes amid continuing anxiety in Whitehall about how US policy on
Northern Ireland will develop under President Bill Clinton.
Sir Patrick will concentrate on explaining Britain's 'neutral' role in the
province but also its commitment to keeping the province as part of the UK
so long as that is backed by a majority of its population.
Visits to the US by Northern Ireland Office ministers in recent years have
tended to concentrate more on promoting investment in the province. Sir
Patrick hopes to re-start political talks after the local elections in the
province on May 19, involving Unionists, nationalists, and the British and
Irish governments. He is opposed to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' as
mooted by President Clinton but would accept a delegation with a less
specific role.
Britain is concerned about the adoption of the so-called 'MacBride
principles' for company investment polices by US state and city governments.
The principles are meant to promote employment of Catholics but Britain
argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently tough.
On his visits to New York, Washington and Boston Sir Patrick will meet
members of the government, Senate, and churches as well as the media.
As the government steps up efforts to bring the participants back to
negotiations, Mr John Major, prime minister, yesterday met Mr James
Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, last night called on Unionist
politicians to enter unconditional talks on the future of the province. He
also made it clear that any proposed political solution for Ulster based on
purely internal arrangements would not secure support in Dublin.

FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Election reform debate delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW expected to erupt within the Labour party over proposals that it
back proportional representation for Westminster elections was last night
postponed for a month, Ralph Atkins writes.
Labour's National Executive Committee had been due to discuss next week the
proposal for electoral reform drawn up by Professor Raymond Plant, professor
of politics at Southampton University, following a debate at the
Parliamentary Labour party today.
But after pressure from Labour MPs, the party's leadership agreed that the
PLP should instead debate Bosnia today and proportional representation on
May 12.
Party leader Mr John Smith will now set out his views on the Plant report at
the National Executive Committee meeting of May 19. Party officials were
last night stressing that the delay will not stop a final decision being
taken by Labour conference in October.
A consultation period with Labour members had been promised over the summer
but this will now be truncated.
Last night the Plant committee of senior Labour figures was still finalising
their report. Hopes that damaging splits can be partly ameliorated were
raised after the committee decided there would be no 'minority report' - in
spite of the opposition to proportional representation of several Plant
committee members.
Last month, Plant members agreed to recommend the supplementary vote system,
similar to that used in France.

FT  21 APR 93 / TUC cheered by the promised return of prodigal sons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADES Union Congress has something to cheer about at last, after
yesterday's overwhelming vote by members of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union for affiliation to the TUC.
AEEU officials were taken aback by the strength of support for the proposal.
They had expected that a significant minority would see no reason why the
union should pay about Pounds 1m a year in affiliation fees. There was also
the danger that apathy would produce a low turnout, but the 37 per cent
participation was high for a postal ballot.
After 13 years of decline, which has seen the TUC's affiliated membership
fall to 7.7m from 12.1m and trade union penetration to 38 per cent of the
workforce from 56 per cent, the knowledge that workers are ready to back the
TUC in a ballot is seen as cause for celebration.
During the 1980s the EETPU electrical union was a spiky and controversial
force inside the TUC. Under Mr Frank - now Lord - Chapple and then Mr Eric
Hammond, it pioneered 'new unionism' based on single-union and no-strike
deals. Expelled in 1988 for defying TUC rules over poaching of members from
other unions, its return as a section of the AEEU could sharpen debate about
the future of the union movement.
Even if the electricians' achievements were less impressive than they had
hoped, they forced more hidebound unions to follow suit at a time of falling
memberships.
Mr Paul Gallagher, head of the electrical section of the AEEU, is as
rightwing as his predecessors but seems less sure of his position in the
wider world of the AEEU. It is likely that the engineering section will
shape the union's ethos and direction.
In spite of the public joy at the prospect of the electricians' return to
the TUC family, not all is sweetness and light beneath the surface.
Mr John Aitkin, general secretary of the 5,500-strong Electrical and
Plumbing Industries Union - established after the electricians were expelled
from the TUC - welcomed the AEEU but emphasised that it must stick to TUC
rules and not seek to destroy his union. He said AEEU officials had last
week walked out of a meeting at which it was outvoted by other big unions on
whether the EPIU should join the National Engineering Construction Council,
a union body.
Lengthy and possibly difficult negotiations still lie ahead before the AEEU
returns to the TUC. As many as 16 unions have lodged complaints with the TUC
alleging poaching of members by the electricians while they were free of TUC
rules.
Even Mr Aitkin is optimistic that this will not hinder the AEEU's arrival in
the TUC in time for the September annual congress. The final word will come
from AEEU executive committee members, more than three quarters of whom have
to agree on the terms of TUC entry.

FT  21 APR 93 / PowerGen chief adds to fears over pits' future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executive of electricity generator PowerGen yesterday set the tone
for talks which will be crucial for British Coal's 12 reprieved pits when he
said his company would need a 'very attractive offer' to buy extra coal.
Mr Ed Wallis's comments will add to the gloom surrounding the 10,000-plus
miners employed at the dozen pits.
British Coal executives believe they will have difficulty in keeping the
mines open for more than a year even if they can sell 10m tonnes annually to
PowerGen and National Power, the other big generator, in addition to
contracts already agreed.
Executives at the generators have indicated privately that the figure of 10m
tonnes may be optimistic.
Mr Wallis said at an Institute of Energy conference in London yesterday that
with 16m tonnes already sitting in PowerGen's stockyards, additional
tonnages 'would effectively preclude me from reducing those stockpiles to
economic levels'.
He added: 'In fact they would probably rise, incurring significant further
financial penalties in stocking costs and capital. So if British Coal would
prefer us to burn their coal rather than our stocks we will need to see a
very attractive offer.'
Mr Wallis also indicated a strong reluctance to ease back on the use of
orimulsion, the bitumen-based fuel, which he said was the cheapest suitable
fuel and 'other than its sulphur content, the cleanest'.
He said: 'I can assure you that we will do our utmost within the constraints
determined by the Department of the Environment during licence discussions
to convert orimulsion from being a development fuel to a strategic one.'
Neither PowerGen nor National Power has started serious discussions with
British Coal on additional coal tonnages since the government's white paper
on the coal industry. Negotiations depend on the level of subsidies that the
government is prepared to provide. Regulation of utility companies in the UK
is working as intended to deal with the problems of monopoly, and is not in
a state of crisis, Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator,
said.
Prof Littlechild was responding to an article in the Financial Times by Mr
Dieter Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates, in which he
said the regulatory framework 'is in crisis and in urgent need of reform'.
British Gas has changed its interruptible supply contracts to try to
encourage competition in the market. The company says interruptible
customers - which have access to cheap supplies of gas in return for being
cut off at short notice during periods of peak demand - will be able to
switch suppliers with seven days' notice.

THREE POLICE officers 'manufactured and put forward false evidence' against

yesterday.
The Guildford Four were released from 15 years' imprisonment in 1989 for the
Guildford pub bombings after the Court of Appeal overturned their
convictions.
Mr Julian Bevan QC, prosecuting, said former Detective Chief Inspector
Thomas Style, 59, former Detective Sergeant John Donaldson, 57, and former
Detective Constable Vernon Attwell, 52, were principally involved with
interviewing Mr Armstrong. 'The Crown's case is that these three
manufactured and put forward notes of interviews at the trial of Armstrong,
which they falsely asserted were contemporaneous notes of interviews.'
The officers deny conspiring together to pervert the course of justice.

Mr Lamont, launching a Treasury booklet drawing together details of the

one in five of the labour force was covered by at least one scheme. PRP
schemes have increased substantially since the tax benefits were increased
in 1991.
The number of employees covered by PRP schemes rose 20 per cent to 1,167,400
in the first quarter of this year, while the number of schemes rose 11 per
cent to 4,615.

FT  21 APR 93 / Homes policy seen to create high-crime estates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT rules on financing affordable homes for rent may turn housing
association estates into neighbourhoods with a high crime rate, the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation says.
In a report published today, the social research organisation warns that
government policies are forcing housing associations to create a new
generation of large estates with heavy concentrations of formerly homeless
people and disadvantaged families.
The report says cuts in government grant mean that housing associations are
increasingly building large new estates to maximise value for money.
Social problems are concentrated on these estates by government regulations
which require associations to allocate 70 per cent of new homes to homeless
families. Associations sometimes give 100 per cent of allocations on new
estates to local authorities in return for cheap land.
Larger estates therefore end up with a high proportion of unemployed and
single-parent families.
The Rowntree report says three out of four new tenants on recently-built
estates are unemployed, and half depend on social security. The average
income of tenants has declined from 73 per cent of the national average in
1981 to 33 per cent on large new housing association estates.
Half the families on such estates are headed by a lone parent, and the
number of children per adult is up to three times higher than the national
average. That makes adequate supervision and control by parents harder, and
increases vandalism, litter, graffiti and more serious crime, the report
says.
'The combination of unfavourable dwelling mix and very disadvantaged new
tenants has produced a seriously unbalanced population mix on new estates,'
it says.
Most housing associations have little experience in managing such large
estates, according to the report. Families with serious social problems on
such estates need additional resources such as estate offices and community
facilities.
The report concludes that smaller schemes, traditionally used by

FT  21 APR 93 / Receivers revive half of companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY HALF of all com-panies entering receivership emerge asviable
businesses, a survey by the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency shows.
More than two-fifths of employees whose companies enter insolvency
proceedings retain their jobs, providing evidence that the practitioners can
help save businesses.
The survey, released yesterday, covered 1,686 corporate insolvencies handled
from April to September last year by 168 practitioners who are members of
the society, the leading trade body.
'We are corporate surgeons and not undertakers,' said Mr Mark Homan,
president of the society and head of corporate reconstruction at accountancy
firm Price Waterhouse.
The survey showed that of all companies entering receivership, 53 per cent
ended up with a break-up sale of assets.
The figure was 33 per cent for companies in administration and 19 per cent
for those in company voluntary arrangements. The rest of the companies were
divided between full survival, and full or partial sale as a going concern
to their management or third parties.
Most insolvencies related to smaller companies, with 81 per cent accounted
for by those with between one and 14 employees. Just 4 per cent were
companies with more than 50 employees.
For companies with more than 400 employees, 93 per cent of jobs were saved
following insolvency procedures, compared with 17 per cent of jobs for
companies with up to 14 employees.
Based on the assessment of the insolvency practitioners, more than a third
of company collapses were the result of management failures.
A further 31 per cent were the result of the loss of markets.
Just 4 per cent resulted from the loss of long-term finance and 19 per cent
from a lack of working capital or cashflow. Fraud accounted for 2 per cent
of cases.
Mr Homan said the insolvency profession needed to study how to increase the
survival rate for smaller companies.
He said insolvency procedures needed 'fine tuning', by finding ways to make
them cheaper and less tied to court proceedings.

FT  21 APR 93 / Nissan UK executive denies Pounds 97m fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE DIRECTORS of Nissan UK, the former British importer for the Japanese
carmaker, cheated the Inland Revenue out of almost Pounds 97m corporation
tax in a fraud of 'truly massive proportions' that lasted 17 years, a court
heard yesterday.
Mr Peter Rook QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey in London that the fraud
centred on the use of false invoices to increase freight costs charged in
the company's accounts, so reducing profits on which corporation tax had to
be paid.
He said that to conceal the fraud an international money-laundering network
was set up involving bogus shipping agents in The Netherlands and Norway and
ending at two Swiss banks - Credit Suisse and BFG.
Mr Rook was opening the prosecution of Mr Michael Hunt, the assistant
managing director of Nissan UK, who is charged with four counts of
conspiring to cheat the Revenue and making use of false documents. Mr Hunt
denies all the charges.
Mr Hunt was at the centre of the conspiracy, the court heard, with Mr Octav
Botnar, Nissan UK chairman and chief executive, and Mr Frank Shannon, the
company's former finance director. Mr Botnar was the 'prime mover' but Mr
Hunt, as his 'number two', was party to the fraud from start to finish, Mr
Rook said. A warrant for Mr Botnar's arrest was issued last year but could
not be served because he had moved to Switzerland.
Earlier this year Mr Shannon pleaded guilty to cheating the Revenue of
Pounds 17m corporation tax. His admission was evidence of a fraud against
the Revenue, Mr Rook said.
In 1971 Nissan UK won the British franchise to import cars from the Nissan
Motor Company. Until 1975 it paid for the cars with a single 'cost,
insurance and freight' payment. In 1975 it varied this agreement, allowing
it to arrange its own freight charges. The intention was to enable the fraud
to take place, Mr Rook said.
In the years that followed a total of Pounds 219m was extracted from Nissan
UK by fabricating invoices which increased the genuine freight charges by
between 40 per cent and 60 per cent on each occasion.
The conspirators set up an international laundering operation to cover their
tracks.
Mr Rook said: 'The trail leads to two Swiss banks where the conspirators
would divide the spoils of the fraud.'
Mr Walter Schmicki, a Credit Suisse banker, and Mr Kurt Vogelsang, a manager
of BFG in Basle, were party to the fraud, he continued.
The trial continues today and is expected to last at least three months.

FT  21 APR 93 / N-plant ruling sought from attorney-general
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ATTORNEY-general will be asked to step into the controversy over British
Nuclear Fuels' new Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, in a move
that could further delay the plant's operation.
The Department of the Environment has been advised by lawyers that it may
need to consider the wider economic and social case for the plant, as well
as environmental implications, if it is to avoid the risk of judicial review
which could be prompted by legal action from pressure groups.
It has emerged in the past few weeks that the government's legal advice
about which factors it should take into account conflicts with that received
by BNF and may conflict on other points with that received by pressure
groups. The environment department is preparing to ask the attorney-general
for an opinion on which is strongest.
Greenpeace, the pressure group, said last night: 'We have got a legal
opinion that there must be a wide-ranging government inquiry looking at all
the issues.'
Whitehall observers believe the government is determined to avoid the risk
of judicial review, even though formally weighing up the overall case for
Thorp could delay a decision about whether to give it the go-ahead until
autumn.
BNF said yesterday: 'We are waiting for the pollution inspectorate to
deliver its report (on the recent public consultation) to the Environment
Department. We believe that all necessary issues will then have been
covered.' It added: 'If there is another delay it will be expensive.'
The inspectorate's report, which is expected to go to Mr Michael Howard,
environment secretary, in the next two months, addresses only the
environmental and health questions about the plant's operation.
Separately, the cabinet office has been co-ordinating meetings between
senior civil servants from the environment, trade and industry and
agriculture departments and the Foreign Office to look at the wider economic
and diplomatic issues.
Pressure groups have criticised the lack of open ministerial participation
in the debate so far. An environment department decision that these wider
discussions need to be brought formally into the Thorp decision would pave
the way for ministerial-level meetings on the issues.
However, environment ministers would have to erect a 'Chinese wall' during
those meetings between their judicial role in evaluating the inspectorate's
report and their views on the wider questions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1993 David Thomas Prize was presented to Mr Nicholas Clegg at a ceremony
at the Financial Times's London headquarters last night by Ms Jenny Rossiter
(both pictured left), who chairs the trustees.
The prize was established in memory of David Thomas, the Financial Times
journalist killed on assignment in Kuwait in April 1991 together with Alan
Harper, a Financial Times photographer in whose memory a photographic
bursary has been established.
Candidates for the 1993 prize wrote on the topic 'What are the limits to
privatisation' and submitted a proposal on how they would use the Pounds
2,000 award. Mr Clegg, a political consultant aged 26, will travel to
Hungary to examine the impact of foreign ownership on Hungarian industry,
and popular reactions to it. He will also research the course of
privatisation in the Czech Republic and Poland.
The 1992 prize, whose theme had an environmental bias, was won by Dr Olga
Speranskaya, a Moscow ecologist.

FT  21 APR 93 / Law firm set up with links to accountant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW law firm with close connections to Arthur Andersen, the international
accountancy network, is to start operations this summer.
The link between Garrett &amp; Co and Andersen could pave the way towards the
creation of the first multi-disciplinary partnership between lawyers and
accountants if professional rules - which are under review  - are relaxed.
Mr Colin Garrett, managing partner, said he was sending job offers this week
to four or five senior lawyers and expected to start taking on clients in
two or three months' time.
Two of the professionals would be partners and the remainder senior
associates. Three would specialise in commercial law, one in property and
possibly another in employment. Advertisements placed in February said each
post would pay up to Pounds 120,000.
Garrett &amp; Co is independent of Andersen but based in its offices in London,
and expects much of its work to come through Andersen referrals.
Andersen has already established a number of associations with law firms in
other EC countries, including SG Archibald in France and Friehalter, Kruger
&amp; Co in Germany.
The 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act removed a statutory ban on mixed
practices but left professional bodies free to make their own rules, subject
to scrutiny by the Office of Fair Trading.
A proposed European Commission regulation that would establish a new form of
association for the professions has brought the issue back to the top of the
agenda.
Law Society rules prevent solicitors from entering into multi-disciplinary
partnerships with other professionals, but it is consulting on relaxing the
rules.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales allows mixed
partnerships if 75 per cent of the partners are accountants. The Law Society
is thought to favour a similar condition for solicitors.

FT  21 APR 93 / Single union deal at Scotch plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST single-union agreement in the Scotch whisky industry has been
signed between William Grant and Sons and MSF, the general and technical
union.
Workers at the Glenfiddich plant in Paisley, Strathclyde, voted
overwhelmingly that the MSF should have sole negotiating rights at the
company.
Seventy four per cent backed the MSF although the union has only 19 per cent
membership among the workforce. Fewer than 7 per cent of the workers chose
the TGWU general union and 11 per cent the AEEU engineering union.
The MSF said: 'The result suggests an overwhelming endorsement of MSF's
negotiating skills and support services.' But it brought strong criticism
from local officials of the TGWU and AEEU.
The ballot was held by the company with the support of all the unions at the
plant, which agreed to abide by the verdict of the workforce.
Mr Roger Lyons, MSF general secretary, said: 'This deal is important because
the terms are not being dictated by management.'
William Grant insisted it wanted a single-union agreement at the new whisky
plant being opened at Strathclyde Business Park 30 miles from the Paisley
site.

FT  21 APR 93 / All-day rail peace talks end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between British Rail and the RMT, the main rail union, to resolve the
conflict that has closed the railway network for two one-day strikes in the
past fortnight ended last night after nine hours of intensive negotiation.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said that he intended to
reflect on BR's final position overnight and report to his executive today.
BR described the position last night as 'delicately poised'.
'We believe we have done enough. There has been a flexibility on both sides
but the situation remains in the balance,' BR said.'
The RMT's leaders have been seeking a guarantee from BR that none of their
members will be made compulsorily redundant and that there should be a
moratorium on the future use of contract labour.
After protracted discussions yesterday evening it appears the two sides have
moved much closer together. Details of any final settlement of the dispute
were not released last night but BR is hoping that the RMT's executive will
agree to what it is proposing. Much depends on how the union's executive
responds to what Mr Knapp will tell them today.
Pressure for a settlement of the increasingly bitter dispute has grown more
intense since Monday's deal between the rail drivers' union Aslef and BR
over the issue of the future of the national agreement.
The RMT leadership is aware that public opinion - which has so far been
sympathetic to the union case over redundancies - could turn hostile if the
union does not display a willingness to make a compromise.

FT  21 APR 93 / Fraud squad warns of loan scam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND YARD'S fraud squad is warning businesses about the activities of
confidence tricksters who promise to arrange large loans but disappear with
the advance fees.
The latest twist in a long line of cheap-loan frauds involves bogus forms
purporting to show that US Treasury bearer bonds are available as security
for loans which will never be advanced.
It is estimated that 50 or 60 advance fee fraudsters are operating in London
and that perhaps a dozen have switched to the US bearer bond mode of
operation.
The fraud squad says advance fees for arranging the financial packages may
amount to 1 per cent to 2 per cent of the loan involved, or a flat rate of
Pounds 250,000 or Pounds 500,000. After the fee has been handed over the
loan - which may run into tens of million of pounds - never materialises.
The fraudsters have targeted business people who are desperate to raise
finance but have failed to do so through more conventional channels such as
banks or venture capital institutions.
The fraud squad's warning is also directed at professional advisers. The
fraudsters have taken in the lawyers and accountants advising their victims
with the help of bogus evidence that US bearer bonds are available as
security.
Bearer bonds are a popular vehicle for this type of fraud because they do
not show the owner's name.
As evidence that they own or control such bonds the fraudsters have been
producing copies of US Treasury PD 1832 forms. Among indications that the
forms are bogus are that they would have been used for registered
securities, not bearer bonds, and that they have expired.
One characteristic of these frauds is that the victim may be led to believe
that overseas lenders have been found who charge abnormally low interest
rates. Another is that the package involves the fraudster promising to
invest the loan overseas, apparently in order to provide a strong income
stream.
Another inducement offered is that having this secured loan will help the
victim obtain other finance.
The fraud squad is investigating two cases of fraud using PD 1832 forms. It
says these latest variants of advance fee fraud are reminiscent of the ICC
290 and 292 frauds perpetrated in the mid 1980s.

FT  21 APR 93 / Manufacturers lift investment in innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH manufacturers started to increase investment in innovation last
year, before the latest signs of economic recovery started to emerge, a
survey by the Confederation of British Industry and National Westminster
Bank has found.
The more encouraging picture for UK corporate spending on innovation and
research and development, which companies expect will continue this year,
was welcomed as further evidence of an increase in manufacturing confidence
and activity.
Between 1989 and 1991 companies had cut spending on innovation and R&amp;D but
there was a marked upturn last year. Dr Bryan Smith, chairman of the CBI's
research and innovation committee, said the survey - conducted among 425
companies in October and November last year - said the findings were
consistent with evidence of improved business conditions found in other
surveys.
He said: 'We hope the results also reflect a fundamental recognition of the
importance of innovation to companies if they are going to compete
successfully in increasingly tough world markets.
'The prospects for sustaining economic recovery in the medium term hinge on
the competitiveness of manufacturing industry and its ability to develop new
products and processes. That is what makes these results so encouraging.'
Although the survey showed a significant balance among companies reporting
increases in capital investment to support innovation last year, most did
not expect spending to rise substantially this year. Most non-manufacturing
companies expected to reduce innovation investment.

FT  21 APR 93 / Northern recovery 'well under way'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence in the north of England is at its highest for two years
and the region's recovery from recession is well under way, the latest
Business Survey North says.
The report, published yesterday by the Northern Development Company and the
Tyne and Wear and Teesside chambers of commerce, is based on responses from
885 companies in north-east England and Cumbria. It sees improvements in
every main indicator for the second successive quarter.
Results for the first quarter of the year are the best for two years, with
export sales and orders reaching new highs. Domestic orders have moved after
two negative quarters to a positive balance - the number of companies
reporting an improvement has outnumbered those reporting a decline and the
positive balance on domestic sales has doubled.
The balance on profits is in the black for the first time in nine months -
36.6 per cent reported increased profits in the previous three months, and
35.5 per cent reported a fall.
Increased turnover for the next 12 months was forecast by 59.1 per cent,
with 55.2 per cent expecting higher profits.
Investment in plant and machinery reached levels not seen for more than two
years.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRAIN driver was yesterday blamed for the rail crash in which he and three
others were killed and 22 were injured at Newton, near Glasgow, last year.
Sheriff Brian Lockhart, said in his report on the crash that it could have
been avoided if ScotRail had not converted the Newton to Kirkhill line from
double to single track weeks before the accident.
He said Reg McEwan, 61, caused the crash by passing a red signal, taking his
train on to the single-line where it met another suburban electric train
coming in the opposite direction. The crash was the highest-speed collision
in British Rail history.

MORE THAN 1m people are participating in profit-related pay schemes, Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday, Philip Coggan writes.
Mr Lamont, launching a Treasury booklet drawing together the details of the
various schemes - such as PRPs and share options - for promoting the
financial participation of employees, said one in five of the labour force
was covered by at least one scheme. PRP schemes have increased substantially
since the chancellor increased the tax benefits in 1991.
The number of employees covered by PRP schemes rose 20 per cent to 1,167,400
in the first quarter of this year, while the number of schemes rose 11 per
cent to 4,615.

the conference to express his support for the principle of PRP, provided it
did not comprise too large a proportion of workers' pay.

FT  21 APR 93 / Businesses lack computer failsafe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR IN five British businesses and public-sector organisations do not have
viable contingency plans for computer failures, a survey published yesterday
revealed.
In spite of the critical role computer systems play in most of the
organisations surveyed, barely half had so much as a written contingency
plan to cope with serious computer malfunctions.
The findings come from a survey of 421 UK organisations conducted this year
by Loughborough University for International Business Machines.
Excluding users - notably in the financial and public-services sectors  -
obliged by law to have plans, only 42 per cent were found to have adopted
formal plans. One in five had an untested plan, while a further 15 per cent
of plans were held to be 'doubtful' as they had not been recently updated.
The researchers say: 'With the pace of technological change, it is doubtful
if any plan will remain completely viable for more than six months. Yet only
27 per cent of the organisations had completed plans that recently - nearly
a third of plans were more than two years old.'
Ironically, computer services companies were among the worst performers  -
only 39 per cent had a plan, and 14 per cent a viable one. Local authorities
and research companies also performed badly - only 18 per cent of councils
had a tested plan.
Only in the financial services and utilities (gas, water, electricity and
power generation) sectors were more than a third of plans deemed to be
viable.
A recent survey sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry said
British business losses through breaches in computer security and physical
damage to systems were running at more than Pounds 1.6bn.
More than eight in 10 of the organisations claimed to have computer
insurance, but the report says cover tends to apply to hardware even though
'greater damage usually results from corruption of data or consequential
losses'.

FT  21 APR 93 / World Trade News: EC and US will make last try to block ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan today will make one final attempt to head off a US ban,
scheduled to go into effect tomorrow, on EC companies bidding for US
government procurement contracts.
After two days of meetings in Washington, the EC Commissioner yesterday said
he and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, had failed to reach
agreement. The latter insists the sanctions will be imposed tomorrow, unless
the EC agrees to waive discriminatory provisions in its new utilities
directive.
The two trade officials, who were clearly weary, briefed journalists after
meetings had run for four hours longer than expected. They said that,
although Sir Leon was returning to Brussels late yesterday, they would speak
by telephone once more - at noon today Washington time (4 pm GMT) - in a
last effort to settle.
Sir Leon is due today to report on the talks to a full meeting of the
European Commission in Strasbourg. EC member states are divided over whether
to retaliate against the US if Washington implements sanctions tomorrow.
The UK, Germany and the Netherlands are concerned about a possible trade war
with the US, while France is more inclined to take an aggressive stance if
confronted by sanctions. A senior EC official said it was likely that
France's hand would be strengthened if the US were to go ahead with
sanctions.
Despite their failure so far to reach agreement, Sir Leon and Mr Kantor seem
to have achieved a comfortable informal relationship. They bantered with
each other and the press, while laying out a schedule for a series of
bilateral and quadrilateral meetings designed to achieve agreement on a
comprehensive pact over tariff cuts, in time for the July summit of the
Group of Seven industrial countries.
The two said they had 'exchanged views' on various issues, including steel
and Airbus, but they were vague about the details. Mr Kantor expressed
satisfaction that the EC was 'nearing completion on all the steps it needs
to take' towards an earlier agreement on oilseeds.
Sir Leon insisted that substantial progress had been made on the Uruguay
Round of trade liberalisation talks.
The two will meet again on May 7, when Mr Jacques Delors, EC Commission
president, will be in Washington to meet President Bill Clinton. The
Brittan-Kantor meetings will broaden, possibly to include Canadians and
Japanese, at the end of May, and in Paris on June 1-2.

FT  21 APR 93 / World Trade News: EC pessimistic about Japan's trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC Commission yesterday expressed doubts about the impact of Japan's
economic stimulus package in correcting its huge trade surplus with the
west.
It also said that the EC would keep a close eye on the public procurement
programme of the package to ensure that European companies get their fair
share of orders.
Mr Horst Krenzler, director general for external economic relations at the
Commission said it was 'doubtful' whether Japan's Y13,200bn (Pounds 76.7bn)
economic package would increase imports substantially as it did not call for
tax cuts and was therefore unlikely to stimulate consumption.
Mr Krenzler's remarks come at the end of a two-day high-level meeting with
Japanese officials on the EC's Dollars 31.2bn trade deficit with Japan
His comments reflect the growing frustration within the EC about Japan's
seemingly intractable trade surplus as well as a more concerted effort on
the part of the EC to try to get Japan to open its markets further to
European products.
The two sides had agreed to monitor the impact of the package on imports and
the EC would pay particular attention to whether Japanese public procurement
was fair and transparent.
In addition, the EC expects the joint exercise with Japan to analyse the
causes behind the trade imbalance - which it calls the Trade Assessment
Mechanism - to show substantial progress by the time of the summit in July
between Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president and Japanese Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa.
The exercise, agreed between the two sides in January, aims to compare the
performance of specific EC products in the Japanese market with their
performance elsewhere and with that of other competitors.
The summit will be 'an important political deadline,' when discussions will
move on to policy measures designed to remedy the situation, Mr Krenzler
said.
On specific issues Mr Krenzler said that if progress is not made in
harmonising Japan's discriminatory liquor taxes the EC would apply to Gatt
for a solution. Japan reformed its liquor taxes in 1979, in line with Gatt
recommendations, but has kept taxes on certain imported liquor much higher
than those on comparable domestic liquors.
The EC is also unhappy with the Japanese offer regarding the Gatt talks,
which Mr Krenzler said was 'totally insufficient'.

FT  21 APR 93 / Clinton supports Reno over Waco siege tragedy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, WACO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday reaffirmed his confidence in Ms Janet Reno,
US attorney-general, and said he had no intention of asking her to resign
because of the tragic ending to the siege of a religious cult at Waco,
Texas.
Mr Clinton said he took full responsibility for the government's actions on
Monday, when more than 80 cult members died in flames after Federal Bureau
of Investigation officials had started to pour teargas into the buildings
which the cult's adherents were occupying.
The ultimate responsibility for the deaths, however, was placed by the
president with Mr David Koresh, the cult leader, who was believed to be
among the dead and whom Mr Clinton described as 'dangerous, irrational and
probably insane'.
'I was surprised, (which) would be a mild word, that anyone would suggest
that the attorney-general should resign because some religious fanatics
murdered themselves,' Mr Clinton said.
The possibility that the disastrous end to the Waco siege might damage
politically Mr Clinton or Ms Reno seems to have occurred more to television
interviewers seeking an intelligent question to ask than to politicians or
the general public.
Members of Congress say they are likely to hold hearings on the incident but
congressional aides say they have received little reaction from voters so
far.
Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, dismissed
the suggestion that Ms Reno should resign. 'God, I hope somebody like her
sticks around a long time in government. This is a woman who makes hard
decisions and takes responsibility for the decisions,' he said on television
yesterday morning.
Even so, the siege may provide new impetus for efforts to pass tougher gun
control laws. Mr Clinton has already said that, if Congress were to pass a
bill to impose a waiting period for background checks before anyone may buy
a gun, he would sign it.
AP adds from Waco: The FBI yesterday denied responsibility for the Waco
deaths and said Mr Koresh deliberately had his followers start the fire that
killed them.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BEIJING is to build a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 659m) shopping and commercial
complex only a few hundred metres from the compound where China's communist
leadership lives in seclusion, symbolising the growing clout of the urban
Chinese consumer.
Under a Beijing municipality plan the state-controlled Hua Yuan Real Estate
Company will head the redevelopment of Xidan street. Construction is
expected to start on the 20 hectare site in June.
The English-language China Daily reported yesterday that foreign companies,
including Jing An Investment of Hong Kong, would participate in the project
which involves building a 585,000 square metre complex just north of Chang
An boulevard, Beijing's main thoroughfare.
Foreign investors are rushing into China's consumer market enticed by the
lure of millions of cash-rich and product-starved consumers as Chinese
living standards continue to rise. According to a recent survey by the
management consultants McKinsey, China has already outstripped many other
Asian consumer markets.
'With China's huge population even a small overall percentage of high-income
consumers (with Dollars 1,000 plus of officially reported income) adds up to
a real consumer market of some 60m people, a reservoir of wealth equivalent
to all of Thailand and greater than all of Malaysia,' said the report.
The Xidan street project, to be known as Xixi, will include six high-rise
buildings, two car parking towers and a number of office and apartment
buildings.
Mr Ren Zhiqiang, president of Hua Yuan, said the Xixi project would 'make
Xidan a multi-purpose commercial centre for shopping, entertainment and
sightseeing'.
Hua Yuan is one of Beijing's largest property developers with assets of
about Dollars 200m.

FT  21 APR 93 / Greyhound ends bus dispute with union
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREYHOUND Lines yesterday finally made peace with the Amalgamated Transit
Union, three years after a bloody and bitter strike by the union against the
US bus company began.
The ATU, which in 1990 represented about 8,500 drivers, clerks and mechanics
at Greyhound, signed a tent-ative six-year pact with Greyhound.
Under this agreement, Greyhound would pay Dollars 22m (Pounds 14.5m) in back
pay to striking workers and recall a minimum of 550 strikers.
The deal must still be ratified by union members, the National Labor
Relations Board, and the bankruptcy court which oversaw Greyhound's Chapter
11 reorganisation.
During the bankruptcy reorganisation, Greyhound set aside a pool of assets
to meet the potential back-pay liability. The pool has recently been
reported to be worth about Dollars 24m.
Greyhound was subject to a leveraged buy-out in 1987 and although management
was able to secure substantial wage concessions at this stage, its
subsequent efforts to negotiate a new contract with ATU members proved
fruitless.
The strike which followed was particularly bruising, even in the context of
US labour battles, and Greyhound filed for bankruptcy shortly after it
began.
It also recruited non-union drivers, and claimed to be running almost 90 per
cent of its pre-strike service within weeks.
Since then, the company has reorganised its operations and capital
structure, emerged from bankruptcy and floated its shares on the stock
market.
The settlement, however, may help restore the group's image with the public.
The timing may also be advantageous, since the company usually adds drivers
in the summer season.

FT  21 APR 93 / BNL sends special team to Argentina

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the state-owned bank whose branch
in Atlanta made billions of dollars of clandestine loans that helped to fund
Iraq's military build-up, has sent a special team of executives to Argentina
in the wake of suspected irregularities that could involve a loss by BNL of
as much as Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m).
Separately, US investigators from Congress and government agencies have told
the Financial Times that they are also looking at BNL's Argentine operation,
partly to see whether any of the bank's funds in Buenos Aires, the Argentine
capital, were used to help finance the nuclear-capable Condor 2 missile
project undertaken by Iraq.
The BNL affair has focused so far on the bank's Atlanta branch. It is the
first time there has been any suggestion of a possible link with its
operation in Buenos Aries.
Between 1987 and 1989, letters of credit handled by BNL Atlanta provided
funds for the Condor missile and other Iraqi weapons projects.
In Rome yesterday, the bank said it was unaware of any links between BNL's
operations in Atlanta and Buenos Aires.
In Buenos Aires, meanwhile, a magistrate yesterday asked his Rome
counterparts to help him investigate relations between the Italian foreign
ministry and several Italian companies that did business in Argentina. One
of the companies took part in the Condor 2 missile project and benefited
from Iraqi loans made by BNL Atlanta.
Among the BNL executives despatched to Argentina are some of the people who
were sent by BNL in 1989 to the US to investigate the Atlanta case. The
Atlanta trial of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL manager indicted in
connection with the Iraqi scandal, is expected to begin in September.
Mr Davide Croff, a senior BNL executive in Rome, said the present focus for
the team sent to Buenos Aires is on the restructuring and management of the
branch network and related insurance businesses. The BNL network includes 88
branches in Argentina acquired in 1987 and once owned by Banco Ambrosiano,
the bank that crashed in 1982 in a scandal involving the Vatican bank.
The precise nature of the suspected irregularities in Argentina has not been
disclosed but Mr Croff said the work in Buenos Aires included the parent
company in the US making a BNL capital injection to cover potential losses
which he could not quantify and which he said he preferred to describe as
'restructuring costs'.
He added that the Rome bank had no evidence of possible links between funds
from BNL Argentina and com-panies that worked on Iraq's Condor 2 missile
project.

FT  21 APR 93 / World Trade News: Cuba makes progress in regional trading
links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cuban government's attempts to broaden trade links with its neighbours
in Latin America and the Caribbean have been given a fillip by a series of
joint venture agreements with several privately-owned Brazilian companies,
following a visit to the island by Brazilian businessmen.
The agreements coincided with a decision by the heads of government of the
Caribbean Community (Caricom) to establish a joint commission with Cuba to
improve trade and other relations with the island, following statements by
some Caribbean leaders that it was time the US ended its 30-year trade
embargo on Cuba.
The Brazilian businessmen ended five days of talks in Havana with agreements
in principle on 10 ventures which will be further studied by both parties.
The island's struggling nickel industry, troubled by inefficient plants and
insufficient fuel, is of particular interest to the Brazilians, who want to
buy the product from Cuba.
The agreements also cover Brazilian-funded citrus plants in Cuba, production
of sugar cane harvesters in Brazil, and the creation of a shipping line to
operate between the two countries.
The decision of the Caricom heads of government to establish the joint
commission with Cuba follows the island's application for the status of an
observer to the 13-nation community.
Several of Cuba's Caribbean neighbours have been upset by the implementation
of legislation six months ago by the US to prevent foreign subsidiaries of
US companies from trading with Cuba and penalising shipping companies
calling at Cuban ports.
Dame Eugenia Charles, the prime minister of Dominica, and traditionally
among the more conservative of the region's leaders, has argued in favour of
an end to the trade embargo.
Privately-owned Dominica Coconut Products has become a leading exporter to
Cuba, and is planning the construction of a processing plant in Cuba.
Cuba's attempts to develop economic ties with its neighbours have also
benefited from the island's admission to the Caribbean Tourism Organisation
after three years of trying.
There is, however, likely to be US objection to Cuba's growing trade links
with Brazil and those it is developing with its neighbours in the Caribbean
archipelago. The island gained entry to the regional tourism body over the
objections of two members, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands,
both US possessions.
Caricom countries have been warned against closer ties with Cuba by Ms Sally
Cowal, US ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago.

FT  21 APR 93 / World Trade News: Mexico reaps benefits of trade
liberalisation - A Gatt report which finds much to praise but sees some
dangers in Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO's trade policies have won a generally glowing testimonial from the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In a report published yesterday
which stresses the worth of open trade in promoting economic development and
social welfare, Gatt says Mexico is already benefiting from economic and
trade liberalisation combined with tough fiscal discipline.
Gatt economists expect the still-to-be-ratified North American Free Trade
Agreement with the US and Canada, due to come into force next year, to give
the Mexican economy a further boost. However, they warn that Nafta may lead
to some diversion of trade and increase Mexico's vulnerability to economic
fluctuations in the US, which already accounts for more than two-thirds of
exports and imports.
The report documents the transformation of the economy since the debt crisis
erupted in 1982. The structural adjustment programme started in 1983 and
accelerated since 1989 has turned Mexico from an inward-looking
state-dominated economy to 'a largely open economy driven by private sector
initiative'.
Tariffs have been halved from 27 per cent in 1982 to 13 per cent today. Only
2 per cent of imports are covered by import licensing, down from 100 per
cent. Dependence on oil exports has fallen from 67 to 32 per cent of total
merchandise exports, while manufactures - notably vehicles, machinery and
chemicals - now account for 59 per cent.
Mexico is by far the leading exporter and importer in Latin America, the
report says. Foreign trade now enables Mexico to import goods and services
needed for development and to finance its Dollars 75bn (Pounds 49.6bn)
foreign debt.
The structural adjustment programme has already borne fruit in a resumption
of economic growth, rising incomes and lower inflation, Gatt says. 'The
performance of the Mexican economy in the last five years demonstrates how
the liberalisation of international trade and investment regimes and a
comprehensive macro-adjustment programme can be mutually supportive.'
Growth has averaged 3.5 per cent over the past four years and inward
investment is now running at record levels. Inflation has been brought below
12 per cent in 1992 from an average 86 per cent in 1981-88, while state
finances have swung from large deficit in the early 1980s to a surplus of
over 3 per cent in 1992.
Meanwhile, Mexico's privatisation programme - 'one of the most extensive in
the world' - has reduced the number of state-owned enterprises from 1,239 to
221 in the past 10 years.
The transformation has not been without pain. Mexico's GDP did not regain
1981 levels until 1989 and real per capita incomes overtook 1980 levels only
in 1991. Inflation is higher than in leading trading partners and since 1989
Mexico has run a big merchandise trade deficit - nearly Dollars 16bn last
year, Dollars 11bn of which was accounted for by trade with the US.
The Gatt report estimates that Mexico's five export processing zones
(maquiladora) - manufacturing mainly electronic products and automotive
parts - may account for up to half the country's total goods exports.
Exports from the zones, located mostly along the US frontier, rank second
only to petroleum as foreign exchange earners. However, the relative
importance of the maquiladora sector is diminishing, Gatt says. The report
also notes that over time maquiladora industry has moved from cheap
labour-based assembly to more skilled-based activities with higher value
added.
The report is critical of some aspects of Mexico's trade policies. It says
tariff escalation - higher tariffs as the degree of processing of imports
increases - is common. Effective tariff protection continues to be higher
than average in cars, computers, iron and steel, metal manufactures, basic
chemicals and electrical machinery. In particular, Gatt attacks protection
for the motor vehicle industry as 'incompatible' with Mexico's trade
liberalisation policy.

BRAZILIAN voters are expected to reaffirm the country's presidential system
of government in a binding plebiscite today. The result should signal the
unofficial start of the 1994 presidential campaign, making President Itamar
Franco 'a premature lame duck', in the words of one political analyst.
Opinion polls have shown that 55-60 per cent of voters favour keeping a
presidential system, while less than 30 per cent appear to prefer
parliamentary rule. Voters will also be asked to choose between a republic
and a monarchy. Polls show the republican option likely to take more than 60
per cent of the vote.
Voters are showing little enthusiasm for the plebiscite. The Ibope polling
firm reported 52 per cent not understanding why they are being asked to
vote, and that 65 per cent would prefer not to. A study by the electoral
court predicted up to 15 per cent abstentions (10 per cent being usual),
although voting is mandatory for Brazil's 90m electors.
The plebiscite is required by the 1988 constitution. Pro-parliamentary and
pro-monarchy legislators sought it after the assembly re-writing the
constitution voted for a presidential republic. The plebiscite was moved
forward from September because pro-parliamentary legislators successfully
argued that a later vote would be coloured by the 1994 presidential race.
Brazilians are more concerned with the country's dismal economic outlook and
its social problems. Inflation is at 27 per cent a month and unemployment in
March grew to 15.8 per cent in greater Sao Paulo, the country's industrial
hub, according to Dieese, a labour-supported think-tank.
Attacks on the Franco administration by potential presidential candidates
are expected to increase after the plebiscite.
Polls show front-runners for the presidency, to be contested in late-1994,
to be Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the left-winger who was runner-up to Mr
Fernando Collor, Mr Franco's disgraced predecessor, in 1989, and Mr Paulo
Maluf, the conservative mayor of Sao Paulo city. A strong centrist
candidate, perhaps from the pro-parliamentary coalition, is likely to
emerge.
'The campaign has already begun,' said Mr Eduardo Graeff, a political
scientist at the Institute of Social Research in Sao Paulo.
The presidential campaign will influence the overall revision of the
constitution, due to begin in October as mandated by the charter itself.
The revision will determine important issues of foreign investment rules and
privatisation of the telecommunications and petroleum sectors, and tackle
such inhibitors of fiscal stability as public employee job stability and
federal revenue-sharing with states and cities.
Some politicians hope to postpone the revision until after the new president
has taken office in 1995, but most analysts expect Congress to begin the
revision on schedule.

FT  21 APR 93 / US housing starts fell by 4.6% last month

SEVERE winter storms on the east coast contributed to a 4.6 per cent fall in
US housing starts in March, the commerce department said yesterday.
The decline followed a small increase in February and an even sharper drop
in January. Starts are now running at their lowest level since last July and
14 per cent below the level registered in March last year.
The figures, however, were distorted by bad weather: starts fell 26.8 per
cent in the northeast, the region most affected by storms, by 13.9 per cent
in the Midwest and by 5 per cent in the south.
Starts rose 17.9 per cent in the west.
Even allowing for bad weather, analysts are puzzled by the weakness of
starts, given that fixed-rate mortgage rates have fallen to about 7.5 per
cent, the lowest level in two decades.
Most are predicting a strong recovery in housing in the spring and summer.
The disappointing figures for starts are the latest in a series of economic
reports - including a sharp drop in retail sales last month and flat
industrial production - that appear to indicate a recent slowing of the pace
of economic recovery.

FT  21 APR 93 / Change of strategy sought on reform in Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and international organisations seeking to restore constitutional
government in Haiti are reconsidering their strategy so as to force Haiti's
military leaders to step down and allow the exiled president to return.
The re-think - by the United Nations, the Organisation of American States
and the US - follows the rejection by the Haitian army leaders of proposals
that they accept an amnesty, leave office, and permit the reinstatement of
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown in a coup 19 months
ago.
Diplomats in Washington and in several of Haiti's Caribbean neighbours have
decided that the UN's options are limited, but that the first move will be
discussions with the European Community aimed to tighten economic sanctions
against Haiti.
The sanctions, imposed just after the coup, have been sieve-like.
There is also likely to be increased pressure on the Dominican Republic,
which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, to end cross-border trade,
much of it controlled by the Dominican military and providing a supply line
for the Haitian military and the rich elite which supports it.
General Raoul Cedras, leader of Haiti's army and de facto ruler of country's
7m people, had suggested that he was willing to accept UN proposals by which
he and other senior officers would step down and receivee an amnesty,
clearing the way for Father Aristide. But Mr Dante Caputo, a UN envoy
seeking a resolution of the crisis, has reported a hardening of position by
the army leaders.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the leaders of the
Haitian military had indicated that they understood the 'importance' of a
prompt return of constitutional government and the return of Father
Aristide.
'It is time for the military leaders of Haiti to indicate firm agreement on
the key points of a settlement of the political crisis,' he said.

CHINESE officials face some unenviable decisions before mid-year following
the release this week of economic data indicating that China's economy is
overheating.
While China's leaders show no sign yet of 'hitting the panic button',
officials are saying privately that growth rates of 14 per cent - the figure
for the first quarter of 1993 - are unsustainable.
Western economists expect the leadership will want to monitor developments
in the second quarter before taking more decisive measures to restrain
economic growth and cool pressures on prices; but at the same time they
believe China's economic managers cannot afford to delay too long.
Mr Ross Garnaut, professor of economics at the Australian National
University and a former Australian ambassador to Beijing, said yesterday
that if measures adopted late last year, including credit restrictions, did
not bite soon then 'heavier controls' on investment, as well as 'strong
action' on monetary policy would be required.
'Present economic growth is not sustainable,' he said. 'The big question is
whether it can be brought back into a sustainable range or whether a hard
landing may be required.' Growth rates of 9 to 10 per cent were probably
manageable.
Among fears in the foreign business and investment community is that the
worrying inflation figures of nearly 16 per cent and higher than expected
growth will panic China's leadership into reverting to the 'stop-go'
economic policies of the 1980s that slowed reform and contributed ultimately
to political unrest.
In 1988, China's economy grew by some 12 per cent before brutal credit
restrictions and other measures brought growth down abruptly to 3.9 per cent
in 1989. China's economy grew by 5 per cent in 1990; and 7 per cent in 1991
before rocketing ahead by 12.8 per cent last year.
Efforts by the authorities to introduce a mild credit squeeze have failed,
judging by figures showing credit for 1992 grew by 21 per cent, much the
same as the year before. The broader M2 measure of money supply also
continued to gallop along with growth of 30.6 per cent last year.
Western officials caution inflation figures for the first quarter are
generally higher than for the rest of the year. They say wage increases are
more than keeping pace with price rises that have been fuelled partly by
structural reforms such as abolition of subsidies. Some argue that as much
as 60 per cent of increases are attributable to the freeing of prices on
basic items like rice and fuel.

FT  21 APR 93 / Pakistan to review Sharif commitments

   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN'S new government, which has taken power following the dismissal of
the administration of Mr Nawaz Sharif, yesterday pledged to honour the
country's international financial commitments.
However, the new administration promised to examine Mr Sharif's extensive
public spending plans with a view to reducing public borrowing.
Diplomats took this to mean the government would honour existing contracts
for road-building and other projects but that future schemes could be
delayed, or in some cases scrapped.
Mr Sharif's government was sacked on Sunday and the national assembly
dissolved by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan after a protracted power struggle.
Among the charges levelled by Mr Ishaq Khan were economic mismanagement,
including corruption and overspending.
Mr Farooq Leghari, the newly-appointed finance minister, said that 'all
contractual obligations shall be met' in response to questions about
infrastructure projects which were a central feature of Mr Sharif's
government. But he added: 'We will go into a much greater degree of
financial discipline.'
The new government is faced with a budget deficit for the year to the end of
June which private sector economists estimate will be 7-8 per cent of
national output. The new administration will seek an increase in foreign
development aid to Pakistan.
Officials this week postponed a meeting with donor organisations in Paris
this week, pleading for time to review the economy and public spending.
Diplomats in Islamabad said yesterday the meeting was now unlikely to be
held until after elections which Mr Ishaq Khan plans to hold in July.
However, the election may be delayed by a suit, filed in Lahore High Court,
contesting the legality of the president's dismissal of Mr Sharif's
government and the national assembly.
The new government promised not to reverse Mr Sharif's widely-praised
economic liberalisation programme, which included privatisation, customs
duty cuts, and foreign exchange deregulation. Mr Leghari said:
'Market-oriented concepts will continue to apply. We will continue to work
towards further liberalisation of the economic system and we are going to
work towards even greater deregulation.'
The government is trying to form a multi-party cabinet to support its claim
that it represents a wide range of national interests. Mr Balakh Sher
Mazari, the new prime minister, comes from the Pakistan Moslem League, Mr
Sharif's party, and Mr Leghari is a member of the opposition Pakistan
People's party led by Ms Benazir Bhutto.

FT  21 APR 93 / ANC plays down national protest prospects

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE African National Congress yesterday played down expectations of big
national protest actions following the funeral of slain black leader Mr
Chris Hani, but said regional rallies and sit-ins would take place to try to
force the pace of constitutional negotiations.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's chief negotiator in the multi-party
constitutional forum, held out hopes for early progress in the talks. He
said he believed the forum could agree on a date for multi-racial elections,
an interim constitution, and the installation of a Transitional Executive
Council (an advisory body to oversee the ruling National party government)
before the middle of June.
'Most of what we have to deal with has already been on the table for quite
some time,' he said, and fellow negotiator Mr Joe Slovo noted that the
election dates proposed by the government and the ANC were separated by only
six months. 'After 350 years, these six months are not going to be a
stumbling block between any of the parties,' he said.
However the ANC's optimism looked unrealistic in light of comments yesterday
from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of the Inkatha Freedom party,
who called the ANC's campaign of mass protest action 'ridiculous' and said
it was a setback for negotiations. The ANC 'cannot ram their demands down
the throats of the other parties.'
Mr Slovo made clear that Inkatha would not be allowed to impede progress at
the talks. 'If there are any parties that want to stand in the way they
should not be allowed to hold the process to ransom,' he said, an obvious
reference to Inkatha.
A senior British policeman, Commander George Churchill-Coleman of the London
Metropolitan Police, is to assist in the investigation of the Hani murder.
Cmdr Churchill-Coleman is a former head of Britain's anti-terrorist squad.

In its annual report for last year, the bank said it had suffered a MDollars

transactions. A special reserve and contingency funds had plunged from more
than MDollars 10bn at the end of 1991 to MDollars 753m a year later. Mr
Jaffar Hussein, Bank Negara's governor, said a stronger Malaysian dollar,
containing inflation and sharp value changes in reserve currencies had been
mainly responsible for the fall in the special reserves. He said most of the
losses were book losses only.

KENYA devalued the shilling yesterday and took action to clean up
mismanagement and corruption in its financial sector, Reuter reports from
Nairobi.
Bankers and economic analysts welcomed a 30.7 per cent cut in the official
rate of exchange against the US dollar and the recent central bank takeover
of a number of lending institutions, but doubted they represented a big
shift in government policy.
Yesterday the central bank posted its daily mean rate at 59.0072 Kenyan
shillings to the dollar compared to KSh45.160 previously. It gave no
explanation for the move.
Private banks yesterday quoted between KSh72 and KSh75 for the dollar.
Most analysts said the government had been forced to take action to try and
contain a looming economic crisis, spurred by huge unpaid loans to so-called
'political banks', high interest rates and a shortage of hard currency.
'These measures may well have been taken for all the wrong reasons.
Nevertheless they are to be welcomed if they lead to more of the same,' said
one World Bank official.
In March, the government, angered by an International Monetary Fund refusal
to recommend a resumption of critical balance of payments support of some
Dollars 40m a month, abruptly reversed economic liberalisation policies.
Foreign currency controls were reimposed in agriculture and tourism and
President Daniel arap Moi accused the IMF of trying to impose 'dictatorial
and suicidal policies' on the east African country.
Bankers said Mr Moi and his closest supporters had expected an effective
flotation of the currency on February 19, which saw its value halved in
barely five weeks, and the creation of an interbank market to be sufficient
to win back IMF approval.
But money supply surged 35% last year and the IMF urged tougher action.

FT  21 APR 93 / Mayor of Tehran prompts bitter debate over taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BITTER public controversy has erupted in Iran this week over the policies of
the mayor of Tehran, a close associate of President Hashemi Rafsanjani who
will be seeking re-election in June.
Ayatollah Abolqassem Khazali, a member of the Council of Guardians which
reviews parliamentary legislation, has accused Mr Gholamhossain Karbaschi,
who was appointed mayor in 1990, of behaving like a tyrant. In a speech he
said the mayor should be tried and jailed for raising taxes unjustly and
wasting public money.
'He charges people exorbitant sums which he uses to build water fountains
and plant flowers in squares', said the ayatollah. 'The nation will one day
bring him to trial and jail him for 10 to 15 years.'
This is not the first time Mr Karbaschi has been under fire for his efforts
to improve living conditions in the capital. He is one of the few senior
Iranian officials to admit having enemies, not least among the city's
powerful bazaar merchants and industrialists.
Most of the criticism centres on his tax collection methods, ranging from
levies on property development to charges on shops advertising foreign
products. Merchants complain teams of assessors impose arbitrary fees.
The mayor has also sought to check the population growth of Tehran by
forcing companies to relocate factories some distance from the capital.
Asked during a recent interview how he achieved this when companies were
reluctant to move, he responded: 'We simply cut off the water and
electricity.'
The most visible results of Mr Karbaschi's efforts has been the improvement
in traffic flows by banning private cars from the commercial area during
business hours and the building of fountains and creation of green areas
around the edge of Tehran. Mr Karbaschi's success in riding out earlier
criticism appears to have owed much to the political support of Mr
Rafsanjani who is almost certain to be re-elected as president by a massive
majority.
But with inflation rising and a shortage of hard currency resulting from a
heavy programme of imports in the past two years, opponents of the
government's economic reform programme will step up their attacks during the
election campaign.

DR Hiroshi Nakajima, director-general of the World Health Organisation, has
transferred a fellow Japanese from a key management post after a special
audit showed WHO funds had been misused.
The move, which comes just two weeks before WHO's 183 members vote on
whether to confirm Dr Nakajima's appointment for a second five-year term, is
clearly designed to defuse the simmering row over the circumstances
surrounding Dr Nakajima's renomination last January.
The special audit, carried out by Sir John Bourn, Britain's auditor-general
found financial irregularities in five contracts approved by Dr Yugi
Kawaguchi, who was director of planning in the UN agency. WHO denied his
transfer to the new post of head of inter-agency affairs, was a demotion or
a punishment.

FT  21 APR 93 / Rising yen may not cut Japan's surplus
</HEADLINE>

THE yen's rapid rise against the US dollar could damage the Japanese economy
without helping to reduce its trade surplus with the US, Mr Yasushi Mieno,
the Bank of Japan's governor, warned yesterday after the central bank had
intervened for the second successive day to slow the yen's rise.
The yen ended the Tokyo trading day at a post-war high of Y110.25 against
the dollar, in spite of the BoJ's inter-vention.
The currency's rise in the past two days, in the wake of weekend comments by
US President Bill Clinton that a stronger yen was one factor which would
help to reduce the Japanese trade surplus, has spread consternation through
the ranks of Japan's policymakers and politicians.
Not only does the yen's rise threaten to choke off export growth, prolonging
the deepening downturn in the Japanese economy, it is seen by many officials
as the first tangible sign of greater friction in Tokyo's relations with a
more assertive administration in Washington.
Mr Clinton, speaking after meeting Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime
minister, said a stronger yen was one among several factors which would help
to correct the trade imbalance between the two countries.
The US pressure on Japan to reduce the trade surplus will set off a fierce
political battle in Tokyo over Japan's response.
Mr Mieno yesterday gave notice that he would oppose any policy to make Japan
the locomotive of international growth.
The US is expected to push for such a global growth strategy at the
forthcoming summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations in
Tokyo in July.
Mr Mieno said international policy co-ordination was not meant to give any
one country the role as a locomotive of growth but that each country should
pursue non-inflationary, stable growth within the context of the health of
their respective economies.
The governor attempted to play down the significance of Mr Clinton's
remarks. He said they did not indicate the US wanted a higher yen. However,
many senior Japanese officials believe the US has embarked on a deliberate
policy of talking up the Japanese currency.
Mr Mieno said the Japanese economy had yet to hit the bottom of its long
decline over the past two years.
However, he predicted that growth would pick up at a moderate rate during
the second half of the financial year which began this month.
Mr Mieno said the Japanese financial system and its industrial companies had
only just begun the drawn-out task of restructuring, with banks dealing with
their bad debts and industrial companies cutting their fixed costs.
He also warned against a re-regulation of the Japanese economy, through
government measures to support the financial system for instance, which
would delay restructuring through competitive, market forces.

FT  21 APR 93 / Tokyo gingerly embraces Russian bear: According to Japanese
opinion polls, people still do not trust Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN hosting a Group of Seven ministerial gathering last week, Japan
unveiled a fresh aid package for Russia, heralded a planned Tokyo visit by
President Boris Yeltsin, and steered around a territorial dispute that has
soured relations with Moscow for four decades.
Having drawn praise from an international audience last week, Japanese
officials are now playing to a less approving domestic audience and the
carefully measured tones are giving way to blunt opinions. Mr Seiroku
Kajiyama, secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic party,
suggested that he 'distrusts' Russia and doesn't understand 'why we should
help such a country'.
And Mr Kabun Muto, the foreign minister, who had indicated that he would
travel to Moscow to finalise details of Mr Yeltsin's visit, expected in late
May, now says there is no reason for him to go. Behind the schedule change
is the belief that Japan has done enough to prepare the way for the Russian
president, who abruptly cancelled a planned trip late last year.
After convincing G7 members of the Japanese commitment to supporting Russian
reform, the government must convince its sceptical citizens that not too
much has been given away. Mr Kajiyama is not the only LDP politician to
reach for pejoratives when it comes to Mr Yeltsin, seen as not much more
sympathetic to Japan than his predecessors in Moscow.
In trying to explain what happened last week, various ministers at varying
times have suggested that nothing much had changed in Japan's official
policy on Russia, that a great deal had changed, or that a bilateral dispute
takes on a different meaning during a multilateral meeting.
But, as one finance ministry official said yesterday, the meeting itself was
part of the education process for Japanese, whose perceptions of Russia are
coloured by sentimental and selective textbook accounts of injustices and
indignities their country has suffered during the last century.
Aware of that deep feeling, a foreign ministry official warned that the
government must be careful to address popular concerns when dealing with
Russia: 'If you look at the public opinion polls, Russia does not rate very
highly. People do not trust Russia.'
The visiting G7 ministers assisted the education process by emphasising
Japan's growing international responsibilities and giving a sense of the
costs that may follow the collapse of a reform-minded Yeltsin
administration. Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, said the
'world will be a considerably more dangerous place.'
However, Japan still waits for Russia to return four disputed islands, the
Kuriles, occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the Second World War and
known to Japanese as the Northern Territories. And while Dollars 1.82bn
(Pounds 1.18bn) was promised in aid last week, Mr Koko Sato, the LDP's
executive council chairman, said further aid must be limited until Moscow
opens negotiations.
'If Yeltsin falls, I don't think that Russia will revert to socialism or
communism. I cannot accept the view that the world will be turned upside
down without Yeltsin,' Mr Sato said.
Business leaders echoed the reservations of Japanese politicians about
embracing Russia. The Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry said assistance
to Russia was 'unavoidable' and the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations said the country had 'no choice.'
Japanese companies' wariness of Russia was reflected in trade figures for
the fiscal year ending in March. Exports to Russia were down 35.8 per cent
on a year earlier and imports from Russia fell 21.5 per cent.
Until last year, Japan had insisted Russia would not get significant
economic aid until the islands were delivered, but that policy became
unsustainable after Japan became chair of the G7, which gave priority to
supporting Russia's reforms.
In attempting to explain the change, Mr Yohei Kono, the chief cabinet
secretary, said the policy of directly linking aid to the islands was 'only
intended for a Communist government in Moscow,' and that a reformist
government should be treated differently.
But Mr Muto said the link remains and that Russian policy, officially called
'expanding equilibrium,' remained the same. To keep that equilibrium
expanding, the foreign ministry expects Mr Yeltsin to give ground on the
Kuriles during his May visit.
The Russian representatives were aware last week that their country has an
image problem in Japan. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, took time to
make a well-publicised visit to Mr Michio Watanabe, the former foreign
minister, who recently resigned because of ill-health.
And Mr Yeltsin's offer to visit Tokyo was welcomed, although he invited
himself before the Japanese government had the chance to invite him
formally, causing mild irritation. A miffed but polite official explained:
'We are pleased that Mr Yeltsin is coming, even if he is unaware of
diplomatic etiquette.'

Mr Safwat el-Sherif, Egypt's minister of information, narrowly escaped an
assassination attempt yesterday in which his driver and bodyguard were both
wounded, writes Roger Matthews, Middle East Editor.
Gunmen with automatic weapons opened fire on the minister's car as he was
leaving his home in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis. Mr el-Sherif escaped
with a cut hand in what appears to be the latest attempt by Islamic
extremists to destabilise President Hosni Mubarak's government. Mr
el-Sherif, the longest-serving minister in the cabinet, is responsible for
efforts by the official media to counter the growing influence of Islamic
groups.

BANK NEGARA, Malaysia's central bank, has defended itself against criticism
that it has gambled on foreign exchange markets with resulting massive
losses in its special reserves, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
In its annual report for last year, the bank said it had suffered a MDollars
2.7bn (Pounds 686m) contingent liability on forward foreign exchange
transactions. A special reserve and contingency funds had plunged from more
than MDollars 10bn at the end of 1991 to MDollars 753m a year later.
Mr Jaffar Hussein, Bank Negara's governor, said a stronger Malaysian dollar,
containing inflation and sharp value changes in reserve currencies had been
mainly responsible for the fall in the special reserves. He added that most
of the losses were book losses only.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, had called on Bank Negara to
provide some answers about the state of its accounts.

FT  21 APR 93 / Central Bankers' Verdict On Europe's Economy: Lack of
competition stoking inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE squeeze on inflation has still to penetrate much of Europe's economy
which is protected from international competition, the central bankers said.
Many services, in particular, are shielded from the price-reducing pressures
of international trade. This could create a further hurdle for economic and
monetary union, which many economists believe should be conditional upon low
inflation in both production and service industries.
Inflation in the non-traded goods sector of the EC economy - being services
and products mainly for domestic sale - registered a year-on-year rate of
6.6 per cent last year. This was significantly higher than the 3.2 per cent
recorded for merchandise sold across national boundaries.
The difference of 3.4 percentage points between the two figures was 'around
the highest level for 10 years'. In 1991 the difference was 3.2 percentage
points and in 1990 3.1 points.
The high levels of inflation in the non-traded part of many countries'
economies was partly responsible for the 'relative resilience' of
consumer-price inflation last year across the EC. The governors express
disappointment that the consumer price index for the EC as a whole was a
year-on-year 4.3 per cent last year, even though this was down on the 5.1
per cent recorded in 1991 and 5.7 per cent in 1990.
The large differences in many countries between inflation for traded goods
as opposed to that for non-traded items 'suggests the presence of structural
problems which are hampering the reduction of inflation'.
'Policy measures to strengthen competition and raise productivity in the
more sheltered (economic) sector' are required to tackle the problem, the
governors believe.

FT  21 APR 93 / Central Bankers' Verdict on Europe's Economy: Tough action
urged to cut government borrowing - State indebtedness threatens growth
prospects / More turmoil on foreign exchange markets forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS across Europe should take tough action to reduce state borrowing
despite the strains this might cause on already weak economies, central
bankers said yesterday.
According to the annual report of the committee of European Community
central bank governors, measures either to reduce state spending or increase
taxes are required to avoid the risk of an 'overburdening' of monetary
policies which may reduce growth prospects over the longer term.
The committee, in only its second annual report since it was set up in 1964,
is far from upbeat about economic prospects. It forecasts EC growth of less
than 1 per cent this year, even less than the subdued levels of 1991 and
1992.
While inflation has fallen generally across the community in the past two
years, 'a significant moderation in wage increases is still needed where
labour costs rise at a rapid pace,' the governors warn.
In the light of the strains since last autumn in the European exchange rate
mechanism, moves towards pruning high budget deficits are needed to
strengthen confidence in government policies in financial markets, the
report says.
Ultimately such fiscal tightening should permit lower interest rates and
hence allow a resumption of stable growth across the continent.
The recent ERM changes - Italy and Britain have suspended membership while
Ireland, Spain and Portugal have devalued - 'should have helped to correct
the effects of past (economic) imbalances', the governors say.
However, they warn that the series of exchange-rate movements, which have
helped the competitiveness of specific countries and permitted Britain to
cut short-term interest rates by 4 percentage points, 'should not be
construed as having eliminated the constraints on domestic economic
policies'. The ever-closer integration of EC countries leaves 'no
alternative' to close co-ordination of economic policies.
Across the EC, public finances have seen a large deterioration, with the
ratio of overall government borrowing to economic output rising to 5.3 per
cent last year from the 'already unsustainably high' 4.7 per cent in 1991
and 4.2 per cent the year before.
The economic outlook for the EC this year is relatively gloomy, after the
poor performance last year in which growth across the community fell to 1.1
per cent from 1.2 per cent in 1991. During 1993, economic activity in the EC
'is likely to receive only a modest stimulus from external demand' from big
trade partners such as Japan and the US. Consequently growth may dip below 1
per cent.
Inflationary pressures are expected to fall slightly.
But even with the likely fragility in the European economy in the coming
months 'sight should not be lost of the need for fiscal consolidation'
because of the long-term need to bring down borrowing to the level envisaged
in the Maastricht treaty of 3 per cent.
While increases in borrowing are to some degree explained by higher social
security spending and a reduced tax take caused by the economic slowdown, EC
countries should take steps to ensure increases in deficits go no further
than the 'normal automatic effects' of a slowdown in growth.
The report says the increase in the budget deficit in the UK, from 2.7 per
cent of GDP in 1991 to 6.1 per cent in 1992, was 'particularly striking'.
The only other EC nations with higher deficit to output ratios last year
were Belgium with a ratio of 6.9 per cent, Greece with 9.1 per cent and
Italy with 10 per cent.

BELGIUM has enacted a law guaranteeing the independence of its central bank

Ministry announced yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The law was passed as part of Belgium's efforts to meet the conditions for
economic and monetary union. Belgium is one of the few EC states to have
enacted the legislation.
'This law guarantees notably the autonomy of the National Bank of Belgium
(the central bank) and prevents all possibility of monetary financing by the
Treasury from the BNB,' the ministry said.
Germany already has such legislation and France has said it intends to move
to an independent central bank.

FT  21 APR 93 / Central Bankers' Verdict on Europe's Economy: Burden of debt
holds back UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'less healthy' state of household finances in Britain compared with
other European nations has put the UK at an economic disdvantage.
This conclusion emerges from the annual report of the governors of the 12
European central banks. It says interest payments as a proportion of income
rose threefold in the UK during the 1980s, significantly more than in other
major EC nations. In 1990 interest payments were at least twice as high in
the UK, relative to income, as in other large European nations.
'It appears that efforts by households in the UK to strengthen their balance
sheets by restraining expenditures and reducing debt have contributed to the
weakness of (recent UK economic) activity,' the report says.
According to the report, people's interest payments as a proportion of
income in the UK came to about 10.5 per cent in 1990, up from 3.5 per cent
in 1979.
Ireland showed the next biggest rise in such payments, which rose from about
1 per cent to 2 per cent of income.
In Germany, the equivalent ratio rose from 2 per cent to 3 per cent during
the same period, while in France it went up from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent.
In Italy the ratio came down from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent.
The EC nation with the next highest payments level after Britain in 1990 was
Spain with a ratio of personal sector interest payments to income of about 4
per cent.
The level of indebtedness by UK citizens, together with the prevalence in
Britain of lending according to variable rather than fixed interest rates,
'suggests that household expenditures are likely to be relatively more
responsive in the UK to changes in (official) interest rates,' the governors
say.

FT  21 APR 93 / Central Bankers' Verdict on Europe's Economy: Spanish
governor warns on currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE faces further exchange rate instability because of the combination of
weak growth prospects and high German interest rates, Mr Luis Angel Rojo,
governor of the Bank of Spain, said yesterday.
In unusually frank comments, Mr Rojo said European governments had been two
years too late in efforts to head off recent currency market instability.
They had also made important technical mistakes in drafting the Maastricht
treaty.
Mr Rojo said it 'was not easy' to suggest how Europe might address its
mounting economic difficulties. 'We will just have to wait and see if the
elements of disturbance are overcome,' he said.
The remarks by Mr Rojo underline worries in financial markets that Europe
might soon experience another period of currency strains, after the run of
realignments in the European exchange rate mechanism which saw the peseta
devalued twice and forced Britain and Italy out of the system.
Mr Rojo said 'possible problems' were piling up, including the second Danish
referendum on European integration on May 18, the June 6 Spanish general
election and the impending decision in Britain on ratifying the Maastricht
treaty. Meanwhile, high German interest rates were making it harder for ERM
countries, including Spain, to cut interest rates to head off economic
slowdown.
Mr Rojo, a highly-regarded former economics professor who took over as Bank
governor last July after a spell as deputy governor, said Spain had little
option but to keep short-term interest rates at around 13 per cent even
though output growth this year is likely to be less than 1 per cent.
Europe should have had the foresight two years ago to revalue the D-Mark
upwards because of the inflationary pressures sparked by German unification,
Mr Rojo said. It also should have omitted from the Maastricht treaty any
numerical definition of the convergence limits for fiscal policy which
'created confusion' and were a 'restrictive element'.
The governor was referring to the goal of keeping government deficits to
less than 3 per cent of GDP and state borrowing to less than 60 per cent. He
said he thought the Bundesbank would 'make substantial cuts' in German
interest rates later this year. 'But the problem is the timing. It seems the
cuts will be quite slow and as a result there will be further difficulties
for some months.'

UNITED NATIONS forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday formally asked for
more time to disarm Bosnian Moslem troops in the besieged town of
Srebrenica, but the request was rejected in advance by the Bosnian Serb
army.
Failure to disarm the Moslem troops by today's noon deadline could wreck the
ceasefire negotiated by Bosnian Serb and Moslem military commanders last
weekend.
The UN Protection Force (Unprofor), which has asked for a 72-hour extension
of the limit, has admitted that only a few of the town's Moslem defenders
have so far surrendered their weapons. However, General Milan Gvero, deputy
commander of Bosnian Serb forces, has insisted the disarmament pact be
carried out to the letter.
An Unprofor official said the peacekeepers, who were due to meet
representatives of the warring parties at Sarajevo airport yesterday, would
also renew efforts to persuade the Serbs to withdraw from the perimeter of
Srebrenica to beyond gunfire range.
The UN said it had not yet determined the parameters of the 'safe zone' to
be established around the town. It has also proposed the creation of similar
safe havens around Gorazde and Zepa, the last two remaining Moslem
strongholds in eastern Bosnia.
The Bosnian Serb army protested yesterday to UN peacekeepers against the
flights of two Nato F-16 jets, which 'buzzed' the Bosnian town of Banja Luka
for the second consecutive day, the Tanjug news agency reported.
Meanwhile, Britain is expected to press the case for caution over any new
military initiatives in Bosnia during two days of talks in the US between Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and his US counterpart, Mr Les Aspin.
Mounting pressure for more forceful western action is expected to dominate
the talks.
The talks follow a brief meeting in London on Monday night between Mr
Rifkind and Mr Francois Leotard, French defence minister, who agreed that
military action to try to stop the fighting in Bosnia would jeopardise UN
humanitarian efforts and endanger the lives of British and French troops
protecting aid convoys.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton yesterday summoned his top foreign and
military policy advisers for briefings on what the White House called the
'very serious' situation in Bosnia. The US Senate armed services committee
was told by General John Shalikashvili, supreme allied commander of Nato,
that air strikes against Serb forces in Bosnia would be difficult and
probably would not force a peace agreement.
Serb guns were often hidden in populated areas so they could not be hit
without civilians being hurt, he said.
The intensified talks between western allies coincided with preparations by
Lord Owen, the European Community's peace mediator, to fly to Belgrade. He
is expected to have a frosty reception today when he meets Serbia's
President Slobodan Milosevic.
With only five days to go to a UN deadline imposing new sanctions on the
rump Yugoslavia unless Bosnian Serbs agree to sign the Vance-Owen peace
plan, Lord Owen will warn the Serbian people they face extended isolation
unless they help end the conflict.

ITALIAN political leaders yesterday began the complex task of trying to
forge agreement on a new broad-based government in the wake of Monday's
overwhelming referendum vote for quick reform.
The eight referendums, all of which were approved, will have to be converted
into law within 60 days. This involves a large amount of legislation and
considerable consensus in a parliament where party loyalties are badly
frayed.
The sheer size of the referendum victory has caught politicians by surprise
and complicated the replacement of the four-party coalition headed by Mr
Giuliano Amato, who on Monday informed President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro that
his government, formed last June, had ended its useful life. The Socialist
prime minister is expected to spell out his strategy and the timetable for
his resignation when he addresses parliament tomorrow.
Most political commentators agreed yesterday that parliament had to decide
on two broad options for the next transitional government. The 82 per cent
vote to change the electoral system for the Senate - and by extension to the
Chamber of Deputies - pointed strongly towards a government headed by a new
face or at least a figure above party politics.
Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement, is the most obvious new
face. However, he will not be easily backed by the Christian Democrats whom
he deserted two weeks ago. His supporters said yesterday he risked losing
political capital by heading a government of limited duration and while he
had yet to form a party of his own.
Mr Scalfaro is reportedly averse to choosing a prime minister who is outside
parliament or 'institutional' like the leader of the chamber of deputies.
The latter is the favoured solution of the main opposition party, the Party
of the Democratic Left (PDS). In this deadlock, despite the demand for a new
face, Prof Amato may well prove the most effective person around whom to
build an enlarged coalition.
The parties are anxious to achieve a quick solution. The government has
several vital issues pending, including wage/productivity talks with the
unions and a mini-budget to curb the public sector deficit.
Parliament itself must address the task of deciding whether to waive
parliamentary immunity on Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran politician and
seven times premier, accused of alleged links with the Mafia. Yesterday
magistrates sent further evidence to parliament, including photographs
allegedly showing Mr Andreotti with Mafia figures.

Russia's economic reforms are beginning to bear fruit, with evidence of a
fall in inflation, a reduction of credit expansion and a stabilisation of
production, according to the Centre for Economic Performance run by the
Russian Centre for Economic Reform and Professor Richard Layard of the
London School of Economics, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
The figures show a fall in the monthly inflation rate from a high of around
27 per cent in January to 21 per cent in March.
Production continues to run at levels between 10 and 15 per cent below those
of last year, but the fall has stopped and there is a very modest evidence
of a rise.

FT  21 APR 93 / Russia will receive IMF money 'in month or two'
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA could start to receive money in as little as a month or two from a
new temporary facility set up by the International Monetary Fund, Mr Michel
Camdessus, IMF managing director, said yesterday.
The IMF board last week approved in principle the 'systemic transformation
facility', which is expected to provide Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6bn (Pounds
2.6bn-Pounds 3.9bn) to help Russia and other countries in eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union make the leap to a market-based economy. Some Asian
countries, such as Mongolia or Vietnam, could also become eligible.
Countries will be eligible to receive up to half their IMF quotas from the
facility. This would allow Russia to get up to Dollars 3bn, with half this
sum available immediately and the rest 6-12 months later.
The facility is intended to provide balance of payments support to countries
which experience a sharp fall in export earnings or a sharp rise in net
import costs, particularly for energy, because of a shift to market prices.
Mr Camdessus estimated Russia's balance of payments shortfall at around
Dollars 40bn over the next year, roughly the size of the Dollars 43bn
package unveiled in Tokyo last week by the Group of Seven.
The conditions required by the IMF will be looser than for a normal standby
agreement, but countries will still have to take 'significant policy
actions' to stabilise their economies, stem capital flight and implement
structural and institutional reforms.

relief workers had found bodies of execution victims - unidentified gunmen
were reported to have shot entire families in the head at point blank range
 -and seen homes looted in the Vitez, Zenica and Travnik areas, where
battles erupted last week between the nominal allies in Bosnia's civil war.
Heavy fighting continued yesterday, but Bosnian radio reported the two sides

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the European Parliament will vote today to toughen rules on
cosmetics testing on animals.
MEPs want to prevent EC cosmetics manufacturers conducting such tests from
the year 2000. But the European Commission has said it will not back the
parliament's attempt to strengthen a delicate compromise on the issue,
agreed by member states last November.
EC ministers agreed unanimously to ban cosmetic tests on animals from
January 1 1998. However, if alternative testing methods have not been
developed by 1997, the ban could be postponed for at least two years.
That deal has not satisfied many MEPs and animal welfare groups. They
believe it could lead to a ban being postponed indefinitely.
Today's vote is on amendments which would toughen the directive by
restricting any delay to a maximum of two years, and extending the measure
to prevent duplication of animal testing. For example, cosmetics companies
would not be allowed to test ingredients on animals if such tests had
already been carried out for other purposes, even under non-EC legislation.
The parliament introduced the idea of a ban last summer, by amending a
directive on the free movement of cosmetics. But without the support of the
Commission it will be unable to force a change to last November's
compromise.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, consumer affairs commissioner, told MEPs yesterday
that the Commission would try to make the process of assessing alternative
tests more transparent. But she said Brussels could not support proposals to
limit any delay to two years, as they would jeopardise ministerial agreement
on the rest of the measure.

FT  21 APR 93 / Fears for fate of coalition if Demirel stands
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, has emerged as the leading
candidate to succeed the late President Turgut Ozal who died at the weekend.
However, his candidacy could have serious consequences both for himself and
his True Path Party (DYP).
There are fears that such a move would cause the break-up of the
17-month-old government coalition between the centre-right DYP and the
Social Democrat Populist Party (SHP) led by Mr Erdal Inonu.
Mr Demirel is widely seen as the strongest candidate, and in an interview
with the Financial Times, he admitted he was 'going to be under pressure,
not just from my party, but from public opinion, the press and other places'
to put his name forward in the first ballot which must take place before May
7.
Now in his seventh term as prime minister, Mr Demirel is determined to avoid
the constitutional deadlock which left Turkey without an elected president
for nearly six months before he was ousted as premier by the military in
1980.
However, commentators point out that his departure would leave his party
without a strong hand on the helm and at risk in next year's local elections
and at the general election due in 1996.
He is probably the only candidate for president capable of securing the
votes of the necessary two-thirds of parliament's deputies. There seems
little consensus behind the other two names being mentioned yesterday - Mr
Husamettin Cindoruk, parliamentary speaker, and Mr Inonu, who is also deputy
prime minister.
Mr Cindoruk, who has been increasingly critical of government policy in
recent weeks, seems certain to be opposed by Mr Demirel's supporters.
Equally, a decision to stand by Mr Inonu, the physicist son of Turkey's
second president, would deprive his party of leadership at a time when it is
faces defections to the newly-revived People's Republican party.
Mr Demirel's election as president would pave the way for Mr Cindoruk to
become the DYP leader who seems likely to favour a coalition with the
right-wing Motherland Party (ANAP). There will then be a question as to how
to accommodate ANAP's leader, Mr Mesut Yilmaz, a former prime minister.

FT  21 APR 93 / UN races against time to disarm Moslems: UK to appeal for
caution in any new military initiatives during talks in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday formally asked for
more time to disarm Bosnian Moslem troops in the besieged town of
Srebrenica, but the request was rejected in advance by the Bosnian Serb
army.
Failure to disarm the Moslem troops by today's noon deadline could wreck the
ceasefire negotiated by Bosnian Serb and Moslem military commanders last
weekend.
The UN Protection Force (Unprofor), which has asked for a 72-hour extension
of the limit, has admitted that only a few of the town's Moslem defenders
have so far surrendered their weapons. However, General Milan Gvero, deputy
commander of Bosnian Serb forces, has insisted the disarmament pact be
carried out to the letter.
An Unprofor official said the peacekeepers, who were due to meet
representatives of the warring parties at Sarajevo airport yesterday, would
also renew efforts to persuade the Serbs to withdraw from the perimeter of
Srebrenica to beyond gunfire range.
The UN said it had not yet determined the parameters of the 'safe zone' to
be established around the town, in the Drina River valley. It has also
proposed the creation of similar safe havens around Gorazde and Zepa, the
last two remaining Moslem strongholds in eastern Bosnia.
The Bosnian Serb army protested yesterday to UN peacekeepers against the
flights of two Nato F-16 jets, which 'buzzed' the Bosnian town of Banja Luka
for the second consecutive day, the Tanjug news agency reported.
The jets, taking part in the UN mission to enforce a no-fly zone over
Bosnia, streaked across the north-western Bosnian Serb stronghold at a
height of less than 200 metres. The Bosnian Serbs said such low flights
frightened the inhabitants and violated air traffic regulations in the area.
Meanwhile, Britain is expected to press the case for caution over any new
military initiatives in Bosnia during two days of talks in the US between Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, and his US counterpart, Mr Les
Aspin.
Mounting pressure for more forceful western action in Bosnia is expected to
dominate the discussions.
The talks follow a brief meeting in London on Monday night between Mr
Rifkind and Mr Francois Leotard, French defence minister, who agreed that
military action to try to stop the fighting in Bosnia would jeopardise UN
humanitarian efforts and endanger the lives of British and French troops
protecting aid convoys.
'We also have very strong reservations about the idea of military action
from the air for the moment, as long as the UN soldiers have not been
regrouped and better protected,' Mr Leotard said.
UK defence officials said they saw no sign of a change in the French
position following the appointment of a new centre-right government in
Paris.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton yesterday summoned his top foreign and
military policy advisers for briefings on what the White House called the
'very serious' situation in Bosnia.
The intensified talks between western allies coincided with preparations by
Lord Owen, the European Community's peace mediator, to fly to Belgrade. He
is expected to have a frosty reception today when he meets Serbia's
President Slobodan Milosevic.
With only five days to go before a UN deadline imposing tough, new sanctions
on the rump Yugoslavia unless Bosnian Serbs agree to sign the Vance-Owen
peace plan, Lord Owen will warn Mr Milosevic that the Serbian people face
extended isolation from the outside world unless they help end the Bosnian
conflict.
But the mood in Belgrade is reported to be unconciliatory.
'The peace process is not dead, but it is not very healthy, and what
undermines it is the continued fighting,' Mr Fred Eckhard, the mediators'
spokesman, said in Geneva yesterday.

FT  21 APR 93 / Voters seize the opportunity to make their presence felt /
Assessment of the outcome of the referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECORD eight simultaneous referendum proposals, presented in the worst of
bureaucratic language, have failed to deter the Italian electorate from
making an unequivocal choice in favour of change.
The final referendum results, announced yesterday, have given the clearest
possible signal to Italy's discredited political establishment that
politicians will have to operate by new rules in a less centralised state.
The main political winner is Mr Mario Segni, who founded the referendum
movement three years ago, and who courageously split from the Christian
Democrat Party to boost his reformist credentials in the run-up to these
referendums. Although he has yet to form his own party, He has emerged with
strong moral authority to appeal to a broad cross-section of the electorate.
Other beneficiaries of the voting are Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the
Lombard League; Mr Achille Occhetto, head of the former communist Party of
the Democratic Left (PDS), who withstood considerable internal criticism for
supporting the referendum movement; and Mr Marco Panella, the maverick
leader of the small Radical Party.
However, both the Christian Democrats and Socialists, the main partners in
the four-party coalition, managed to avoid the vote being turned into a
referendum on the government by discreetly supporting the key proposal for
reforming the Senate electoral system.
Voters distinguished subtly in their preferences for the different
referendum proposals. The highest vote of 90.3 percent was cast to end
public funding of the political parties. This was a predictable reaction
against the way the parties have built up bloated, expensive organisations
feeding off public funds and illicit money collected from kick-backs on
contracts now being exposed in the corruption scandals.
Significantly, a referendum in 1978 to cut state funding of the parties
failed, garnering only 43 per cent of the vote.
The lowest vote - 55 per cent - was for the most controversial and overtly
moral of the proposals: depenalising personal use of drugs. The voters'
stance on the drugs issue, promoted in large measure to reduce pressure on
prisons and keep drug-addicts out of jail, suggests the country is still
cautious on moral issues.
In between these extremes, the powerful agricultural lobby managed to raise
a sizeable vote - 30 per cent - against the proposal to abolish the Ministry
of Agriculture. This has long been a key source of Christian Democrat
patronage and votes, controlling Coldiretti, the Catholic association of
small farmers.
The voting pattern once again revealed the difference between the more civic
minded north and centre of Italy, and the south where voter turn-out was 20
points less. Nevertheless, the vital referendum proposal, introducing a
system of majority voting, was approved by an average 82 per cent.
Proportional representation has encouraged the existence of small parties
which, in turn, has fostered unstable coalition governments.
The proposal, championed by Mr Segni, is for the 315-seat Senate to be
elected by a majority vote for all save 77 seats, which will retain
proportional representation. He was only opposed by three minority groups:
the neo-fascist MSI, the hardline Reconstructed Communism, and La Rete, the
Sicily-based clean government movement headed by Mr Leoluca Orlando. (In
Sicily, on this issue, the No vote averaged 32 per cent and in Mr Orlando's
base of Palermo it topped 41 per cent).
The size of the Yes vote on majority voting increases the pressure for a
complete overhaul of the electoral system and the extension of the same, or
similar, principle to the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies. But sharp
disagreements have to be overcome on whether to adopt a single round, or two
as in France.
Mr Segni himself has been ambiguous about which of these alternatives he
favours. All matters relating to electoral reform will now have to be taken
up by the joint-parliamentary constitutional reform commission created six
months ago and which has been marking time while awaiting the referendum
result.
Abolition of state funding of political parties worth some L82bn (Pounds
34m) a year could spell the death of several small parties - particularly in
the light of the magistrates' investigations into corruption which have
helped cut illicit sources. In future, parties will have to finance
themselves through voluntary contributions. These will probably be tax
deductable up to a certain level and paid into foundations.
The closure of the three ministries - agriculture, state shareholdings and
tourism - along with the removal of environmental issues from the control of
local health authorities, will force a considerable shake-up of ministerial
activity. The State Shareholdings Ministry has been effectively defunct
since the Amato government took office last June, but efforts to create a
Privatisation Ministry, to wind up and assume some of the latter's
functions, have been blocked in parliament. The referendum vote could now
speed up the definition of this privatisation ministerial portfolio.
On agriculture, the authorities will be obliged to devolve many of the
existing ministry's functions to the regions, 10 of which pressed for the
change. But a new co-ordinating body will have to be created to deal with
Italy's EC obligations. In the case of tourism, which includes sport and
entertainment, a similar co-ordinating structure will be needed. As for
ending political control of savings banks nominations (instituted by
Mussolini in 1938), this will be one further nail in the coffin of political
patronage and interference in the economy.

FT  21 APR 93 / Green themes recognised in Queen's awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES selling dress-makers' dummies, pizza crusts and genetically
improved breeding pigs are among this year's winners of Queen's awards for
export achievement and technological development.
More than 150 businesses have won awards for their success in these
categories and, for the first time, for advances in environmental
protection. The Financial Times group has also received its sixth export
award.
With the government championing an export-led recovery, the majority of
winners received their awards for selling overseas.
They include small companies, such as AE Arthur, of King's Lynn, Norfolk,
which sells adjustable fashion dummies around the world, and Canadian Pizza
Crust of Salford, which supplies pizza bases and fillings.
The first 12 winners of the new award for environmental achievement reflect
a cross-section of green themes. They include products or processes to clean
up industrial effluents, reduce air pollution, save the ozone layer and cut
the use of chemical pesticides.

FT  21 APR 93 / Record PSBR pushes deficit beyond Pounds 36bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT ended a grim financial year by borrowing Pounds 9.5bn last
month, the highest monthly borrowing requirement on record.
The figure took the full 1992-93 fiscal deficit to Pounds 36.5bn, dwarfing
the previous year's Pounds 13.8bn public sector borrowing requirement. This
represents a significant turnround from only two years ago when the
government's finances were in small surplus.
The sharp rise in borrowing was partly due to the heavy cost of recession,
but the latest figure will fuel fears that the public sector deficit is
structural and will not decline significantly with economic recovery.
The high level of borrowing is likely to increase pressure on the government
to decide on cuts in public spending in negotiations between the Treasury
and spending departments to fix expenditure totals for the 1994-95 financial
year.
The news prompted surprise in the City, which had been expecting a PSBR of
Pounds 8bn for the month, in line with the latest government forecast. In
the Budget last month Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, reduced his forecast
for public sector borrowing in the latest financial year to Pounds 35.1bn
from the Pounds 37bn forecast in the Autumn Statement.
Excluding privatisation proceeds, the PSBR was Pounds 10.9bn, compared with
Pounds 6.48bn in the same month last year.
The Treasury shrugged off criticism of its forecasting record. It said it
was difficult to estimate the traditional end of year surge in spending.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said there was
nothing which would lead him to revise substantially the borrowing
projections made for the financial year just starting. The latest official
forecasts predict a PSBR of Pounds 50.1bn in this financial year - about 8
per cent of national output.
Although the March PSBR is usually the highest figure of the year, last
month's deficit was Pounds 3bn higher than the previous record of Pounds
6.48bn in the same month last year.
The large shortfall mainly reflected a sharp jump in spending by central
government departments. Net departmental outlays were Pounds 23.3bn last
month - 30 per cent higher than in March last year.
Total cash receipts for 1992-93 were Pounds 200.7bn, a decrease of 0.5 per
cent compared with the previous financial year. Inland Revenue receipts were
4 per cent lower than a year ago, Customs and Excise receipts were 2.5 per
cent higher and social security receipts were 3 per cent higher. The
government collected Pounds 5bn of income tax last month compared with
Pounds 4.5bn in March a year ago.
The government bond market reacted badly to the news, although gilt prices
at the long end recovered later to close just  1/8 of a point lower.

FT  21 APR 93 / Waigel calls for EBRD to be more accountable: Attali told of
bad image and need for 'good housekeeping'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, ROBERT PESTON and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON, STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL for greater account-ability and openness in the way decisions are
made at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was made
yesterday by Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister.
At the same time, Mr Waigel, who is chairman of the EBRD'S board of
governors, told Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, he was concerned
about criticism directed specifically at its expenditure on new offices in
London.
'Mr Waigel stressed his concern about the (press) criticism of the bank and
how it was creating a bad image,' a finance ministry official said. 'He also
said there was a need for 'good housekeeping'.'
Mr Attali faced further criticisms from Mr Henning Christophersen, EC
economics commissioner and an EBRD governor, who said yesterday that reports
on EBRD spending decisions were 'embarrassing' and that the Commission was
very worried about apparently 'insensitive expenditure'.
In London, one of the bank's directors, who represent the countries which
own the bank, said Mr Attali had only with great reluctance agreed that the
bank's audit committee should conduct a thorough review of the Pounds 55.5m
(Dollars 84m) spent on fitting out its new London offices.
The review is expected to take less than three months, a director said, and
its findings are likely to be published.
Last week the directors made three other demands:
That the three board committees, covering audit, remuneration and finance,
should have more powers to scrutinise bank executives' actions and
consideration should be given to setting up a special budget committee;
That Mr Pierre Pissaloux, director of the budget, corporate planning and
also Mr Attali's chef de cabinet, should give up some responsibilities;
That the budget-making process should start earlier in the year.
Directors said they were disappointed Mr Attali wanted to negotiate on these
points rather than agreeing to them immediately. At the board meeting on
Monday, the US director, Mr William Curran, criticised Mr Attali for not
apologising for the high spending. He said it was 'the minimum' he would
have expected.
Mr Christophersen said the question of low disbursements to central and
eastern Europe was 'particularly preoccupying'. The EC had 'already taken
steps to strengthen the bank's budgetary control processes, to ensure that
expenditure will be easier to justify'.
The commissioner also told MEPs last night that shareholders should be given
more information about the day-to-day running of the bank, and that 'if
necessary' they would order an inquiry. However, shareholders would await
the management's explanation of the budgetary situation at next week's
annual meeting.
Mr Waigel's meeting with Mr Attali, which had been planned before last
week's revelations about the bank's spending on decorating its London
headquarters, was more concerned with the EBRD's record in the former Soviet
Union and in eastern European countries.
The meeting appeared to have allayed German finance ministry suspicions that
the EBRD replicates the World Bank and other international financial
institutions, and so is superfluous.
'If you ask me if the bank is necessary now, well, this used to be a hard
question to answer,' an official said. 'We have this institution. We should
work with the bank. It is useless to say we should abolish it. The key thing
is to maximise its efficiency, and make it more flexible.'
Although finance ministry officials admitted EBRD disbursements in eastern
Europe had been slow, 'the bank should not be criticised for taking too
little risk', an official said. 'Being careful about investments is a good
thing.'
But the official believed the focus could be more on money for small and
medium-size enterprises in Russia and east Europe.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK conduct within ERM criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN must give independence to the Bank of England and agree to abide by
ERM rules if it wants any future membership of the European exchange rate
mechanism to succeed, the chairman of the committee of European Community
central bank governors has warned.
Mr Wim Duisenberg, in an interview with the Financial Times, said Britain,
during its short-lived ERM tenure, had reduced interest rates on nine
occasions, 'a couple of times too many'. Other EC nations complied with EC
operating rules by increasing borrowing costs on occasion to keep their
currencies in line with the D-Mark.
While the pound was welcome to rejoin the ERM, Mr Duisenberg thought it
would be in the UK's interest to make the Bank of England rather than the
Treasury responsible for interest rate decisions so that these matters were
taken out of the hands of politicians.
He rejected claims made last year by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that Britain's ERM exit reflected 'fault
lines' in the system.
The EC governors had concluded that the ERM was technically sound and that
it was in Europe's interests to stick with it despite the recent pressures,
Mr Duisenberg said. 'We have looked at the system with a magnifying glass
but we have not found any fault lines.'
He was also critical of statements during the turbulence from various
governments, including the UK, stating their firm opposition to
realignments. 'If you make statements, you need to stick to them,' he said.
Mr Duisenberg, governor of the Dutch central bank, was speaking in Basle as
the governors' committee concluded in its annual report that EC states made
mistakes in their efforts to calm financial markets during the exchange rate
crises last autumn and early this year.
During the unprecedented strains which forced Britain and Italy out of the
ERM and led to the devaluation of the Irish, Spanish and Portuguese
currencies, the report says governments gave the impression that 'policy
measures to counter tensions were being taken on a piecemeal basis, with
insufficient attention devoted to the credibility of the parity grid as a
whole'.
The document paints a bleak picture of economic activity across the EC this
year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY-FIVE domestic companies have confirmed willingness to participate in
a plan to restructure financially Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurance
group, which collapsed last August under the weight of NKr3.8bn (Dollars
559m) in short-term debt.
Uni's administration board yesterday unveiled details of the
recapitalisation plan presented to it by Sunndal Collier and Fondsfinans,
two domestic brokerage firms, although part of the proposal was leaked last
Friday.
The proposal calls for a share issue to raise NKr2.8bn, of which NKr1bn
would be redeemable preferential shares, and a bond issue to raise an
estimated NKr1.5bn - both of which would be listed on the Oslo bourse. The
administration board is considering two alternatives and aims to decide at
the end of this week.
The group's Skandia stake, comprising 19m shares, would be spun off into a
separate, wholly-owned Uni subsidiary, and would involve selling the shares
to the new unit at a price fixed at a rebate and based on the prevailing
trading price of Skandia's shares on the day of the transfer.
The sale would be financed by two other bond issues, one ordinary and the
other subordinate, also to be listed on the Oslo bourse.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Babcock loses chief in strategy
disagreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BABCOCK International yesterday said that Mr Oliver Whitehead is to leave
his post as chief executive of the engineering group after disagreeing with
the board over strategy.
Alfred McAlpine, the construction group, declined to confirm that Mr
Whitehead would become its next chief executive, but said a statement would
be made later in the week.
Babcock cut its interim dividend in October and warned that difficult
trading conditions in all the group's markets would depress future profits.
Babcock shares yesterday closed  1/4 p lower at 37 1/2 p, well below last
year's peak of 69p.
Mr Whitehead, who was appointed chief executive in 1989, at the time of the
demerger of Babcock from FKI Babcock, earned Pounds 322,434 in the year to
March 31 1992. The group said terms had been agreed for the early
termination of his contract, which entitled him to three years' notice.
Babcock said: 'Mr Whitehead has made a valuable contribution to Babcock
since its listing as a separate company, but in considering the future
strategy of the group the board has recently concluded that the Babcock
Group requires new direction.'
The group said it was currently in talks with a potential successor and an
announcement would be made as soon as the appointment was confirmed. Until
then, Mr Jeff Whalley, Babcock's deputy chairman, who is also chairman of
FKI, will be acting chief executive.
Mr Whalley denied there had been a row between Mr Whitehead and Lord King,
Babcock's chairman, and the rest of the board. He said: 'There was no row -
I hope we're fairly civilised fellows. Oliver wanted to go one way, but
there were a number of projects which the board had difficulty with.'
Although Mr Whitehead was responsible for moving Babcock into areas such as
water treatment and materials handling, the disagreement is not believed to
have concerned the diversification moves made to date.
There was, however, considerable concern when Babcock Energy, the group's
power plant division, revealed a Pounds 5m provision for costs arising from
difficulties at a combined-cycle power station at Killingholme in
Humberside.
The delay before these problems were identified is likely to lead to further
changes at middle-management level. A new chief executive will also be
charged with giving greater priority to finding a strategic partner for
Babcock in the power plant area, where the group competes with some of the
world's biggest contract engineering groups.
Mr Whalley, who was asked by Lord King to strengthen the board, said he
hoped to name a new non-executive director, who was a knowledgeable
industrial contractor, within four or five weeks. In January the group
appointed as a non-executive director Mr Alan Wheatley, who resigned
recently as chairman of 3i, the venture capital group.
Babcock will report is results for the year to March 31 in May. The board
said it expected trading to be broadly in line with the indications given at
the time of the October profit warning. Panmure Gordon, the house broker, is
forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 35m, compared with Pounds 50.1m last
time.

FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury rights fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of a rights issue returned to haunt Cadbury-Schweppes after the food
group told an analysts meeting that it continued to look for acquisitions in
Europe. The remarks, which came at a conference on the company's
confectionary strategy, upset a nervous market and the shares tumbled 7 to
472p in an average 1.3m.
Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel gave up 20 to 440p after the
company once again pushed back the opening date, pinpointing continued
disagreements with constructor TML, and the need to raise additional
revenue.
One analyst said simply: 'It is best to be out of this stock. It has always
been a high risk project and it will continue to be.' But Mr Clive Anderson
at Smith New Court was less bearish, saying: 'There is no new negative that
has appeared today. Investors have seen far worse in terms of uncertainty.'
Eurotunnel is on the reserve list for entrants into the FT-SE 100 Index.
Some dealers are sceptical that it will be included when the steering
committee decides in June.
British Aerospace jumped 14 to 288p after a strong recommendation from long
term bull Henderson Crosthwaite was reported in the weekend press. The
broker now believes the company has a break-up value of 600p, against its
previous forecast of 450p. Sentiment was further boosted by a belief that
BAe was about to clinch an order for Hawk aircraft from Indonesia.
Engineering group Vickers was boosted by a recommendation from Robert
Fleming published at the end of last week. The shares firmed 3 to 135p.
In the motors sector, strong bid speculation returned to Lucas Industries,
sending the shares sharply ahead in spite of going ex-dividend. They closed
at 135p xd, on volume of 2.6m and strong activity in the traded options.
International conglomerate BTR, which has been holding presentations in the
City, was once again named as the most likely predator. The word is that
should BTR decide against a bid for Lucas, it still intends to make an
acquisition in the near future. The shares finished 6 up at 613p on volume
of 3.6m.
Further speculation over possible rights issues in the property sector was
raised by Smith New Court, fuelling more talk of the recovery said to be
under way in the maligned sector. Smith said the issue will be made to
'stabilise overgeared companies and to make acquisitions', with British
Land, MEPC and Hammerson the most likely to tap the market.
The broker predicts that cash calls in the next 18 months will raise around
Pounds 1.3bn. Hammerson, reporting results today, fell 9 to 320p amid
dividend worries. MEPC added a penny at 388p and British Land a penny at
260p.
Disappointing results from Associated British Foods hit the shares badly,
making it the worst performing stock in the FT-SE 100. The shares declined
16 to 479p. Sector specialists said the stock would remain weak until a
restructuring of the bakery business.
A cautious note from Kleinwort Benson, together with profit-taking, was said
to have weakened Tate &amp; Lyle, off 6 at 415p. Geest retreated 8 to 440p as
some in the market felt it lessened the chance of a bid following weekend
reports over US interest in Fyffes.
Surprise Sunday newspaper stories that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was poised to bid
for Lord Stevens' United Newspapers were dismissed. One analyst said a
company with enough problems of its own bidding for a group that had twice
its capitalised value would be 'Eighties-style lunacy'. The rise in United
of 7 to 580p was generally attributed to broker enthusiasm, while Saatchi's
gain of a penny to 172p suggested that, even without United's denial of the
story, the market gave it little credence.

FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: HK tycoon bids Dollars 64.3m to
buy back warrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR LI KA-SHING, the Hong Kong property tycoon, has put an end to a stormy
chapter in his corporate history by making a HKDollars 495m (Dollars 64.3m)
offer to buy back all of the remaining covered warrants issued by him and
his holding company on Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa.
The announcement followed statements from Mr Li indicating that Hutchison
was planning a rights issue or a placement. As a result of the comments, the
price of both sets of warrants fell on Friday by almost 20 per cent, and
raised accusations of market manipulation.
The offer for the warrants was pitched at Thursday's closing price, and with
a combined turnover of HKDollars 171m yesterday, brokers assumed that many
holders have chosen to accept the cash offer.
Peregrine Capital, which is handling the warrant purchases, said the offer
was made to 'avoid any criticism being levelled at Mr Li that he was taking
advantage of the situation'.
The Cheung Kong warrants were issued in February 1991 at HKDollars 5.30,
compared with Mr Li's final offer price of HKDollars 3.60, while the
Hutchison warrants were offered in May 1991 at HKDollars 3.80, compared with
the offer price of HKDollars 2.175. The deal has therefore been lucrative
for Mr Li.
Mr Li owns 35 per cent of Cheung Kong and issued the warrants against his
own shareholding. Cheung Kong in turn owns a controlling stake in Hutchison,
and was the issuer of the Polycourt warrants.
The warrants have taken a toll on investors' perception of one of Hong
Kong's largest corporate groups. They were perceived as opportunistic,
preceding a string of bad news on Hutchison.

<TEXT>
MR GEOFFREY Bible, a senior executive at Philip Morris, has been appointed
executive vice-president, worldwide tobacco - a post which will oversee the
group's tobacco operations both in the US and overseas.
The move appears to confirm top management focus on the tobacco operations.
It comes just weeks after the tobacco, food and brewing group started a
price war in the US cigarette market in an effort to bolster market share of
its hitherto very profitable brands.
Mr Bible will report to Mr William Murray, Philip Morris' chief operating
officer. Reporting directly to Mr Bible will be Mr William Campbell, chief
executive of Philip Morris's domestic tobacco operations, and the officers
who head the international tobacco businesses.
Mr Bible, although a long-time employee of PM's tobacco operations, was
given the position of executive vice-president international two years ago,
when Philip Morris announced senior management changes relating to the
retirement of its then chairman, Mr Hamish Maxwell.
This post required him to oversee both the international food and the
international tobacco operations, and his appointment was interpreted as
signal that Philip Morris was focusing on international expansion.
As a result, for the past two years, there has been no single executive
overseeing the tobacco interests.

FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: German toolmakers announce
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAHO and Friedrich Deckel, two of Germany's leading machine-tool
manufacturers, are to merge.
Both companies are making losses, and the merger is an attempt to survive
the current downturn in what used to be one of Germany's strongest
manufacturing sectors.
The merger follows several months of talks between the two companies and is
subject to the approval of Germany's cartel authorities. The combined
companies will have a market share of 35 to 40 per cent in Germany in
certain sectors, for example, milling and boring machines.
Maho had originally planned to build a strategic alliance with Traub,
another large machine-tools company, but this plan was abandoned last month
and Traub announced a co-operation agreement with Berthold Hermle, producer
of milling and boring tools.
The merger is part of a trend in the industry which has forced several
companies together during the past year as economic conditions have
worsened.
The companies said the merger would allow them to secure their competitive
position in international markets.
Maho, based in Pfronten in south Germany, lost DM157m (Dollars 97.5m) in the
year to the end of June 1992 on sales down 31 per cent to DM442m; the
company is expecting to make losses of at least DM45m during the current
year despite extensive rationalisation measures. Munich-based Deckel lost
DM75m last year on sales down from DM406m to DM290m.
The German machine-tool sector is suffering from a sharp fall in demand,
reflecting the cutback in investment which has characterised industry's
reaction to recession worldwide. Production fell 13 per cent in 1991 and 17
per cent last year, and is expected to fall further this year to less than
half the record level of 1989.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;W to attack Asian markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE and Wireless, the UK telecommunications company, is planning a joint
venture with Hongkong Telecom to penetrate telecommunications markets in
Asia, including China.
C&amp;W will own 51 per cent of the new company; Hongkong Telecom, in which C&amp;W
has a majority shareholding, will have 49 per cent.
Although the initial capital investment will be small, Lord Young, chairman
of C&amp;W, said the joint venture was intended 'to take a significant share in
the region's communications development'.
Apart from its Hong Kong interests, consolidated into Hongkong Telecom in
1988, C&amp;W already has several joint ventures or stakes in the regions,
including activities in the Philippines, China, Thailand and Macao.
Its Asia Pacific business has grown rapidly over five years. By volume, its
international traffic in the region was up from 341m outgoing minutes in
1988 to 976m last year.
With Asian telecommunications markets growing fast, the joint venture is
designed to enable C&amp;W to mobilise its regional expertise to enlarge its
share.
Mr Mike Gale, chief executive of Honkong Telecom and Asia director of C&amp;W,
who is to head the joint venture, said it was 'an ideal vehicle for
combining the resources and international reputation of the two companies in
the development of business opportunities in Asia.'
Hongkong Telecom is one of nine companies set to sign a pact in June or July
to lay underwater fibre optic digital cables linking nine Asian nations, at
a cost of about USDollars 610m (Pounds 406m).
According to Singapore Telecom, another participant, the other seven
signatories will be from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand
and the Philippines.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER providing a further Pounds 1m against write-downs in investment and
development properties, Five Oaks Investment saw its pre-tax losses increase
from Pounds 371,000 to Pounds 953,000 in the six months ended December 31
1992.
Although the company felt the property market was bottoming out it was
thought prudent to provide for a further write-down, explained Mr Trevor
Robinson, chairman.
On a brighter note, he said rental income now exceeded all interest and
other outgoings; in the half year the surplus, with other income, was Pounds
50,000 against a deficit of Pounds 578,000.
Apart from rising rents and diminishing voids, the improved performance
reflected lower borrowings following the sale of the Hanley property and
strict control of overheads.
Losses per share came to 2.04p (0.8p).

FT  20 APR 93 / Eurotunnel hits at TML over threats of delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and French con-struction companies were yesterday accused of
blackmail in threatening to delay the opening of the Channel tunnel in
support of longstanding claims for extra payments.
Eurotunnel, which will operate the tunnel, said delays in opening meant that
it could have to raise up to a further Pounds 850m by the end of 1995.
The company said the delays meant that the forecast cost until opening had
risen by Pounds 300m since last autumn to Pounds 8.4bn. This compared with
an original 1987 forecast of Pounds 4.8bn for the project.
Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, said he could not predict
when the tunnel would open. This depended on the contractors' willingness to
co-operate in testing and commissioning the tunnel railway, which was
already largely built.
The opening date has been postponed several times from the original target
date of May 15 this year. Sir Alastair said: 'Only a few a weeks ago
contractors accepted in negotiations that it would be possible to start
running services for heavy goods vehicles from mid-January.'
According to Mr Frank Cain, Eurotunnel executive responsible for
construction of the project: 'Contractors now say that all services will
start at the same time next June.'
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of British construction group Wimpey and joint
chairman of Transmanche Link, the consortium building the project, dismissed
allegations of blackmail as 'astounding nonsense'.
'Sir Alastair is well aware of the principal causes of delay, notably the
many and major changes to safety and performance specifications throughout
the tunnel's construction.'
Delivery of railway carriages to carry cars under the Channel is halted over
a claim for extra time and payments which TML says has been caused by design
changes.
Eurotunnel says that bridging finance will be needed to compensate for the
loss of revenue caused by a delayed opening. This might be raised partly
from shareholders and partly from banks. The amount of money to be provided
by banks, however, is likely to be very limited.
Eurotunnel planned to issue free warrants later this year which would allow
its 630,000 shareholders to buy more shares in the company at an agreed
price. The aim would be to generate about Pounds 200m when the warrants were
exercised next year.
A further Pounds 350m-Pounds 400m would need to be raised by the end of
1995. This would leave an estimated Pounds 200m-Pounds 250m to be found
before the company expected to generate enough from services to cover
operating costs and interest charges. This point was not expected to be
reached until 1997.
The final Pounds 200m-Pounds 250m could form part of a larger rights issue
as Eurotunnel sought to refinance its large bank borrowings once the tunnel
has opened.
It is the first time Eurotunnel has indicated how much extra cash it may
need to raise once the tunnel opens. The money would be in addition to the
Pounds 7.3bn already raised from banks and Pounds 1.6bn from shareholders.
Sir Alastair said the Channel tunnel group would not succumb to pressure
from contractors, which had even more to lose from delaying the opening than
Eurotunnel itself. Failing an agreement, the contractors would have to start
funding construction work themselves until their claims could be settled,
which could take years. Contractors will have to start paying damages after
August 15 for late delivery. This could total about Pounds 200m by next
June.
TML is seeking an extension to the contract to prevent Eurotunnel applying
for damages. Sir Alastair confirmed yesterday he was prepared to sue the UK
and French governments and BR and SNCF for failing to satisfy terms of
railway contracts or the concession under which Eurotunnel will operate the
tunnel.

FT  20 APR 93 / Forced from a cosy cocoon: America's Baby Bell telecoms
groups face radical changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the sunny suburbs of Orlando, Florida, you can gain an insight into one
of the most far reaching changes of industrial structure taking place in the
US - the slow death of the monopolies enjoyed by America's local telephone
companies. Orlando has been chosen by Time Warner, which runs the second
largest cable television system in America, as the commercial launch-pad for
one of the most ambitious interactive home entertainment and communications
networks yet attempted in the US.
An initial 4,000 subscribers will be able from next year to call up on their
cable television systems a wide range of movies on demand, as well as
inter-active video games and video home shopping. And stepping well beyond
cable TV's normal business, Time Warner wants eventually to offer its
Orlando customers personal communications services (PCS) - a kind of mobile,
wireless telephone system - and direct access to the lines of long-distance
telecommunications companies.
Both services could divert some business from the local telephone company.
Time Warner, which has already tested consumer appetite for its services in
the New York city borough of Queens, aims eventually to roll them out across
the US.
This is just one example of how technological change - in particular the
ability to translate video, audio and data information into digital form and
then transmit it along fibre optic lines - is blurring the distinction
between the US telecommunications, media and computer sectors. The three are
converging into a single industry, offering customers the ability to summon
up a wide range of communications services on a single video screen.
Radical change, therefore, confronts the seven 'Baby Bell' regional
companies which dominate the local industry, as well as the other
independent companies which are part of the patchwork of local
telecommunications monopolies.
On the one hand, the fraying of the local monopolies creates a significant
threat to the Baby Bells' financial performance just at a time when the
companies face big capital outlays on new technology. On the other, the new
world opens up huge new business opportunities if these slow-moving
companies can become nimble enough to grasp them - and are allowed to do so
by the state and federal regulators which monitor their every move.
'It is like the early stages of the collapse of the Soviet Union,' says Mr
Victor Schnee, of New Jersey consultancy Probe Research, the author of two
books which forecast much of the current turmoil. 'There are more volatile
and destabilising elements all the time. The perception of risk is growing
in each company.' But he adds that, just as in the former USSR, the
industry's leadership is riven by dissent over which direction to take.
The past few months have produced a series of different initiatives by local
telephone companies looking for ways to improve their positions in the
competitive new world. They include radical proposals by Ameritech, a Baby
Bell, and Independent Rochester Telephone to abandon their monopolies and
open their businesses to competition. In return, they seek greater freedom
from regulation. Other proposals include a scheme by Pacific Telesis to spin
off its wireless communications operations as a separate company.
Southwestern Bell has launched the first takeover bid for a large US cable
TV business by a leading telephone company.
The new competitive forces look likely to hasten the end of the American
telecommunications industry's unusual structure, which was imposed in 1984
by the so-called Modified Final Judgment (MFJ). This settled an anti-trust
court case against American Telephone and Telegraph, then the dominant
long-distance and local US telephone company, known as Ma' Bell.
AT&amp;T's local telephone operations were spun off into seven separate 'Baby
Bell' regional companies. The rump AT&amp;T was left with the long-distance
telephone market - where it faced competition from upstart rivals such as
MCI Communications and Sprint - and manufacturing telecommunications
equipment.
The judge overseeing the case, Mr Harold Greene, also barred the Baby Bells
from entering three markets - long distance, equipment manufacturing and
information services. He feared the companies, which account for some 80 per
cent of the local services' Dollars 90bn in annual revenues, might use their
monopoly telephone revenues to compete unfairly in these areas.
After a long campaign, the Baby Bells managed to get the information
services ban removed 18 months ago and they are pressing to be allowed into
the two other businesses, on the grounds that they now face significant
local competition. The companies still account for the bulk of local
communications traffic, but competition is growing in four important,
interlinked ways:
State and federal regulators have allowed new local telecommunications
companies, known as 'competitive access providers' (CAPs), to establish
themselves in many metropolitan areas, where they operate highly efficient
fibre optic networks. They cream off some of the local monopoly's most
profitable business customers by offering cheaper rates to transmit their
bulk traffic around the area and directly into networks run by long-distance
carriers.
The CAPs are still very small, accounting for only about 1.5 per cent of
total local telecommunications revenues. But some of the biggest have been
bought by cable TV companies, which gives them added financial clout, and
the business could grow rapidly thanks to a landmark ruling last September
by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the government agency which
oversees the industry. The agency voted to allow the CAPs to link their
networks into those of the local telephone companies, so the newcomers can
offer private line services between states to business customers with
offices located out of the reach of the CAPs' often-restricted networks.
Long-distance carriers, led by AT&amp;T, resent the high charges they have to
pay the local telephone companies to carry calls over the last mile or two
of wire to customers. These 'access charges' bear little relation to the
cost of providing the service, yet account for about 30 per cent of local
operators' revenues and are the largest single expense for the long-distance
groups.
AT&amp;T and its rivals are urging that the local market be opened to greater
competition in the hope that this will cut access charges and spur traffic
growth. They are also themselves nibbling away at the local telephone
companies' revenues, since telecommunications regulators in over 30 states
now allow long-distance carriers to compete in the lucrative market for
intra-state medium-distance calls. New technology is about to make it much
easier for consumers to dial up an alternative service provider.
There has been a rapid growth in the US of the cellular telephone industry,
which offers an alternative means of communication to the local phone
company's network. The Baby Bells are among the leading players in this
business, since the federal government granted the local telephone
monopolies one of the two licences it issued to operate a cellular service
in each region.
However, the second licences are held by independent providers and the
largest of these, McCaw Cellular, frightened the Baby Bells late last year
by agreeing to sell 33 per cent of its equity to their arch-enemy, AT&amp;T.
If the deal goes through it will give AT&amp;T its first foothold back in the
local market, as well as another potential means of bypassing the Baby
Bells' access charges.
Wireless competition to the Bells will intensify over the next few years
when the FCC gives the go-ahead for PCS, a new kind of mobile communications
network which uses small, inexpensive, lightweight phones.
Cable TV companies, including Time Warner in Orlando, have made clear that
they intend to play a significant role in PCS, since they can cut the costs
of installing a system by piggy-backing it on their cable network.
The Bell companies face an even bigger tussle with the cable companies over
which industry will dominate the provision of new multi-media services to
the American home, ranging from movies-on-demand to video telephones and
home shopping.
Both industries could exploit the market, since each already has
communications wires running into US homes and these can be upgraded through
the use of fibre optic cable and modern technology for compressing digital
images and switching, or routing, information.
But the two industries also have distinct strengths and weaknesses. Cable
companies are experts in providing entertainment, which is likely to account
for the most intensive home use of the new systems.
They also have a capital investment advantage: the relatively high capacity
of their existing co-axial cable means they should not initially have to
place as much fibre optic cable in the local network as the telephone
companies, whose systems consist largely of low-capacity twisted copper
wires.
The phone companies, for their part, have much greater financial muscle
(their Dollars 90bn of annual revenues compares with cable's Dollars 20bn)
and have two important skills which the cable sector lacks - precise routing
of two-way information flows and sophisticated billing techniques.
The local phone companies - whether or not they are Baby Bells - still face
a huge barrier to full participation in multi-media. They are barred by law
from owning a cable operator in the area where they provide
telecommunications services. However, the past two years have seen
regulatory changes allowing them to at least get a foothold in the video
industry.
The first was the 1991 relaxation of the ban on the Baby Bells entering the
information service industry. This paved the way for Southwestern Bell,
which serves Texas and surrounding states, to make an agreed Dollars 650m
bid last February for two cable systems in suburban Washington, DC. The deal
still has to be approved by Judge Greene, but assuming it goes ahead it will
be the first acquisition of a big cable system by a telephone company - and
will set an important example for others to follow.
The second regulatory break-through came last year when the FCC permitted
telephone companies to offer 'video dial tone' - in other words, to transmit
television programmes over their own lines for third parties.
One of the first to take advantage of this is Bell Atlantic, the Baby Bell
serving the middle of the eastern US seaboard, which is making particularly
energetic thrusts into multi-media services. It has agreed, for example, to
build a state-of-the-art fibre optic cable television transmission system
(which will also carry its own telephone services) in three New Jersey
communities for the incumbent cable operator.
This is but one example of increasing co-operation between cable and
telephone companies in multi-media ventures, suggesting that the current
tussle may end up in a complex series of partnerships between the two sides,
rather than a clear-cut victory for one industry or the other.
With all these competitive forces intensifying, the Baby Bells need to
become more entrepreneurial, but they are hamstrung not only by their
cautious traditions but also by regulations.
In an unusually bold attempt to overcome both these problems, Ameritech, the
Chicago-based Baby Bell, recently announced a total reorganisation of
operations to make it much more 'customer focused,' as well as a radical
proposal for reform of the industry.
It has proposed opening its local system to competition, allowing other
companies to provide services by connecting directly into its distribution
network.
In return, however, it wants to be allowed to enter the long-distance and
cable markets, and be freed from so-called rate of return regulation, which
puts a ceiling on its profits, rather than its prices.
Many analysts think the local communications industry is broadly heading in
the direction outlined by Ameritech, but getting there is likely to be
extremely messy and highly political. The government agencies with a say in
the matter include the FCC, which is awaiting a new Democratic appointee as
chairman; the Justice Department; Judge Greene; local state regulators;
Congress, which in recent years has repeatedly considered legislation to
liberate the Baby Bells; and Vice-President Al Gore, who favours letting the
telephone companies fully into cable.
The Clinton administration, which professes great enthusiasm for the
creation of '21st century information super-highways,' could try and bang
some of these heads together to produce a coherent national
telecommunications strategy. But for the moment the main catalysts of change
in the industry are market pressures, such as those under way in Orlando.

FT  20 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A target too often missed
 -Companies are under pressure to improve their product evolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd Instruments, a manufacturer of materials testing equipment, expects to
have its latest product on the market by June, just seven months after
starting work.
This represents a halving of the time taken to bring its previous testing
machine to market, according to Roger Muttitt, chief mechanical design
engineer, and 'a major step forward' for a company with sales of Pounds 5m
and a workforce of 75.
Lloyd Instruments has achieved this rapid reduction in the time taken to
bring new products to market by getting departments such as marketing and
production to co-operate more closely. It has installed a network of
computers at its Fareham factory so that the engineering, design and
production departments have instant access to the latest drawings and is
farming out more design work to suppliers.
The names given to techniques such as these are parallel processing and
concurrent or simultaneous engineering though this is a somewhat misleading
term since a fully-fledged system involves marketing and purchasing as well
as purely engineering issues.
The advantages to companies of these techniques are manifold: customer needs
can be taken into account in the choice of product; design can use the most
cost-effective manufacturing methods; and time-to-market can be reduced,
increasing sales and profits.
The opportunity for new products to succeed is under increasing pressure,
says David Inwood, joint founder of Inwood Ryan*, a product development
consultancy. 'Customer requirements, tougher legislation and competitive
pressures mean that products developed by traditional design- or
engineering-led methods run too much of a risk of missing their target.'
Using traditional techniques, the marketing department, if it was effective,
would identify a market opportunity; the design department would put
together a suitable product; and manufacturing would then produce it. This
'over-the-wall' approach - one department would pass its work on to the next
with the minimum of consultation - made for higher costs and delays.
The success of, in particular, the Japanese in reducing the time taken to
bring new products to market has led to an increased interest in techniques
such as concurrent engineering but there is still a long way to go.
UK manufacturing companies of all sizes have made relatively little use of
concurrent engineering methods while among small and medium-sized companies
fewer than one in five have adopted the technique, according to a survey of
700 companies by Engineering magazine.
'The survey contradicts the popular view that smaller firms are inherently
more flexible and innovative in their approach to design and new product
development,' Engineering noted.
The results of this failure to plan new product introductions properly are
that projects overrun their development time by 27 per cent on average and
their design costs by 19 per cent, the survey showed.
These weaknesses force many companies to adopt defensive strategies. 'The
added value to the customer from new products introduced in the UK is too
low,' comments John Benson, assistant director of industry at the Design
Council**. 'Small and medium-sized companies have low profitability and low
investment in research and development. Very few are market leaders. They
are 'me too' companies which hang on to market share by trimming production
costs and shaving margins.'
The starting point for new product design should be the sales and marketing
department responding to customer needs. Too often companies fail to ask
their customers what they want and design new products which do not meet
their customers' needs, says Inwood.
Tensator, which makes 'pedestrian guidance systems' consisting of posts and
retractable tapes commonly used to form queues in post offices and banks,
took the decision to move from being an engineering-led company to one with
a sales-led strategy. 'We have a deliberate policy of talking to customers
and our six largest ones, including the Post Office and Marks &amp; Spencer,
have all had products specifically designed for them,' says David Tuppin,
sales and marketing manager.
This represents a cost-effective way of developing new products, many of
which can then be sold to other customers, and the Tensabarrier now accounts
for a third of the company's Pounds 7m sales.
Tensator, which is based in Milton Keynes, has also developed a more
coherent approach to market research, installing a computerised database to
log customer information and economic data. 'These are basic marketing tools
which weren't available in an engineering-led company,' says Tuppin.
But while market research is a frequently overlooked part of new product
design, the crucial element in fast product development is team-working,
according to the advocates of concurrent engineering. The precise make-up of
the team or teams will vary depending on the project and on the company, but
David Inwood includes marketing, manufacturing and technology specialists.
John Benson says purchasing expertise is also important given the role which
suppliers can play in designing components and sub-assemblies.
Muttitt says that Lloyd Instruments is too small a company to support
cross-functional teams - the same people would be in every team. But it does
hold regular product development meetings led by the engineering department
and involving the managing director, senior design staff and representatives
of sales and production.
'We brief them on the progress of the project and discuss any action which
needs to be taken by other departments,' explains Muttitt. 'Production can
start work on the tooling while marketing can get the brochures produced.'
Unlike Tensator, Lloyd Instruments does not invite its suppliers to take
part in these meetings but it does delegate responsibility for
sub-assemblies in fields such as bearings, electronics and cables.
A third company, Watkiss Automation, which makes paper hand-ling systems
used to collate brochures and multi-set invoices, also depends on its
suppliers for help in specialist areas but has in other respects chosen a
different route to reducing development times.
Watkiss, which has turnover of Pounds 4.2m and a workforce of nearly 60, has
brought some jobs in-house because it believes it can get work done more
quickly. The company produces its own tooling for making plastic mouldings
because of the delays involved in using outside companies and it also
brought its software and printed circuit design work in-house. Initial
market research can also be carried out internally because Watkiss has
printing activities so knows from its own experience what it wants from a
paper handling system.
Just over a year ago the Sandy, Bedfordshire-based company launched a
modular paper hand-ling system which allowed customers to assemble a system
that met their precise needs. Designing the new equipment took two and a
half years and cost more than Pounds 500,000 but it has led to a
near-doubling of Watkiss's turnover and taken 40 per cent of its market
sector. The length of the development period reflected the large amount of
innovation involved, says Jo Watkiss, public relations manager.
Despite winning awards for its designs, Watkiss makes less use of the
product design vocabulary familiar to companies such as Tensator and Lloyd
Instruments. Product design is handled by its eight-strong research and
development team composed of designers and engineers.
This may reflect the fact that Watkiss is a family-owned company - six
family members are at present employed, while Tensator and Lloyd Instruments
are subsidiaries of larger, international groups. But whatever technique is
used, companies cannot avoid the growing pressure to improve their approach
to product design.

DATA SCIENCES, the hard-pressed computer company, has appointed Andy
Roberts, a director from rival ICL, as its new chief executive.
Roberts, 40, formerly managing director of ICL Mid-Range Systems with direct
responsibility for North American sales, has the challenging job of keeping
Data Sciences afloat and clear of takeovers.
In the 1980s seven of the top ten suppliers to the UK computer market were
UK-owned, led by Thorn EMI Software and Hoskyns. Today, only three remain:
BT Customer Systems, Logica and Data Sciences. According to industry
analysts, Logica and Data Sciences are both vulnerable to takeover.
Needless to say, Roberts is confident his new company has a bright future.
'It is well positioned to exploit emerging markets in client/server and open
systems environments.'

FT  20 APR 93 / Technology: Stemming the flow of costs - Mexico City's new
water system will be one of the world's most modern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British and French water companies have taken on the daunting challenge of
overhauling Mexico City's water system. Hard as it is to believe, Mexico
City faces a more critical problem than the suffocating smog that pollutes
the air during winter months - the lack of affordable water.
The city's underground aquifer is being over-exploited by 20 cubic metres a
day, and will run dry in a decade or so. It is prohibitively expensive to
build a second reservoir and pump more water in from outside. And with
budgets tight, a recent project to recycle water at a reservoir in
Ixtapalapa at the city's edge had to be called off.
Mexico City's water commission, headed by Carlos Casasus, a former finance
director at Telefonos de Mexico, has thus turned to the private sector to
solve its problems. Earlier this month, two British and two French water
companies and Mexican partners won a contract worth some Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m) over 10 years to restructure the city's water system, prepare a water
census, draw up a digitalised map of secondary pipes, install some 700,000
electronic meters, and repair the city's 12,000km of pipes.
The contract is one of the biggest of its type in the world, and will turn
what is probably one of the least efficient water systems into one of the
most modern. 'Mexico City is skipping a whole generation of technology,'
says Jim Southworth, operations manager of North West Water of the UK. In
two years, the city will have computerised maps of the water infrastructure,
electronic reading of bills by radio, and some of the most advanced and
accurate meters in the world.
According to Dean Wheadon, an economist with International Water
Consultants, who worked on the project: 'Mexico City will become a model for
the developing world. Moscow is interested and is planning to visit the
system. Now North West Water is following, and introducing its own pilot
programme for radio reading of water meters.'
The changes will have a series of effects that will reduce the water
shortage. First, collected revenues should increase by about 20 per cent as
the authorities expand the number of meters installed, and fewer users
escape detection. Mexico City has 1.2m water users, but around 500,000 are
not registered or do not pay. As a result of illegal use, Mexico City's
annual water revenues are only about Dollars 152m while costs are Dollars
516m. The subsidy that goes to water consumption could be re-directed to
increasing supplies from recycling.
Second, accurate metering will reduce consumption, even if relative tariffs
do not change. Most Mexico City residents pay a flat tariff since their
meters are only read once every three years. They thus tend to waste water.
Water consumption per head in Mexico City is about double that in Paris,
where it is metered accurately.
Third, an accurate 'intelligent' map of the water network will help the
water authorities pinpoint leaks and mend them. Currently, Mexico City loses
some 30 per cent of its water to unlocated leaks.
The city's water commission has divided the city into four zones, and
granted contracts to four groups of companies: Lyonnaise des Eaux- Dumez,
Anglian Water, and Bufete Industrial; North West Water and Grupo Gutsa;
Severn Trent and Socios Ambientales de Mexico; and Compagnie Generale des
Eaux, Grupo ICA and Banamex.
While it would have been cheaper to award the contract to one company,
Casasus says the government hopes later to stimulate competition by setting
water prices according to the average rate of return of the four companies.
The first phase is the water census, the digital mapping of the network and
the installation of meters. The census will be conducted by sending sound
signals through the pipes and listening for breaks (which would mean a
private connection). This way, all those taking water (legally or illegally)
can be put on a computerised database and start receiving bills.
At the same time, the four water companies will install new meters, for
which they will be paid per meter. Mexico now uses jet meters, in which
water turns a pin wheel as it enters the system. Given Mexico City's low
water pressure, pin wheels often do not turn, and the meters do not record
full water consumption. The new positive displacement meters work when water
enters a chamber, and pushes the piston or disc around continuously.
The meters will be read electronically. North West Water will read them
using vans that pick up a radio signal. It claims one van can read 30,000
water meters a day. The other companies will install electronic touch pad
meters, of which about 500 can be read by one person a day. Now, just 30 of
the old meters are read a day by one person.
With the new meters, the authorities will be able to compare water
production and water use in a matter of days and reduce the amount of spare
capacity needed.
When the meters are in operation, Mexico City will hand over responsibility
for the maintenance of supply and collection of bills to the private water
companies. In effect, each company will buy water at bulk from the city's
water commission, and sell it at regulated prices to the customer. Each
company will thus have an incentive to be efficient in collection and in
maintenance of secondary pipes.
The eventual, though unstated, goal is the privatisation of the water
system. But rather than do it immediately, the government has decided to go
about it in incremental steps, in view of the appalling condition of the
water system, and above all the lack of information about usage and costs.

FT  20 APR 93 / Bermuda sunbathes as Lloyd's shivers: The colony's
reinsurers are gaining from London's turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years, the tiny British colony of Bermuda has played a specialised role
in world insurance, as the tax-haven home of more than 1,300 'captive
insurers', insurance subsidiaries formed to insure the risks of their
industrial and commercial parent companies.
Now, it is taking advantage of the turmoil at Lloyd's and in the London
market to turn itself into a much more rounded reinsurance centre. Since the
mid-1980s a new breed of independent companies, backed by European and US
capital, have been formed in Bermuda to insure specialised commercial
insurance and reinsurance risks.
Their growth has been impressive. Centre Re, the biggest of the companies,
in which Switzerland's Zurich holds a majority stake, expects to have
doubled its revenues to Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 990m), when it reports its
figures for 1992, its fourth full year of operation.
The revenues of three of the biggest companies amounted to more than Dollars
2bn in 1992, just less than a sixth of the estimated Dollars 13bn in gross
premiums earned by Lloyd's in the same year.
And the profitability of each of the companies has produced a mood of
optimism, which contrasts sharply with the gloom in the London market, where
news of losses and closures has virtually become a daily occurrence in
recent weeks.
In the past six months investors have raised or announced plans to raise
more than Dollars 1.5bn for Bermudan-based companies.
ACE, one of two companies which specialises in insuring large - mainly US -
corporations against legal awards - recently announced an initial public
offering in New York designed to generate more than Dollars 500m.
Centre Re has announced that it is to establish a New York-based subsidiary,
again raising the capital through an initial public offering.
Two new companies, Mid Ocean and TOPS have been formed backed by a further
Dollars 535m in new capital.
American International Group, one of the world's most profitable insurers,
also has plans to launch new Bermudan subsidiaries later this year.
Many of these developments have initially brought comfort to the Lloyd's
market. Bermudan companies provide important reinsurance capacity for
London. Bermudan-based insurers frequently talk about their market
'complementing' the London market.
Centre Re, for example, agreed at the end of last year to back a
multi-million pound reinsurance scheme, which will allow Lloyd's Names to
obtain stop-loss, or personal, reinsurance. Centre Re also provides dozens
of financial reinsurance policies - called 'time and distance' policies -
which allow Lloyd's syndicates to manage their reserves more flexibly.
Another new company, Underwriters Capital (Merrett), has been formed
exclusively to provide reinsurance for the nine syndicates that the Merrett
agency manages at Lloyd's, indirectly increasing their capital base.
However, in other respects developments on the island present a challenge to
the leaders of Lloyd's and the entire London market.
Some business formerly underwritten in London has already been lost.
Mr Brian O'Hara, president and chief executive of XL Insurance, which like
ACE also insures US liability business, says, for example, it is now winning
some contracts that in the past would have been placed in London.
Oil companies have set up TOPS Insurance in Bermuda to insure catastrophe
risks for North Sea oil rigs, because they were unable to buy the cover in
London.
The deal 'has major implications for London,' says Mr Doyle Stephens, chief
executive of OIL insurance, one of Bermuda's longest established mutual
companies, which manages TOPS. 'Maybe we were depending on Lloyd's too
greatly.' Brokers are now much more likely to visit Bermuda. 'As the market
has got more difficult we've seen more broker inquiries in the last
year-and-a-half than we have ever seen before,' says Mr Stephens.
And once lost by London, business is unlikely to be won back quickly.
Centre Re underwrites contracts that stretch over a number of years and
reimburses premiums if losses turn out to be lower than expected. Mr Michael
Palm, executive vice-president of Centre Re, says a big aim of his company
is to 'introduce stability to insurance costs, taking out the year-to-year
volatility'.
Bermudan companies can build up tax-free reserves and companies operate with
much lower expenses than many of their competitors.
In particular the Bermudan companies are able to avoid the very high
so-called 'frictional' costs, which are typical of a market - such as London
 -in which dozens of relatively small insurers and brokers combine to insure
and reinsure large risks.
They tend to conduct a small number of high-value transactions, transferring
huge blocks of risk on to their own books in exchange for multi-million
dollar premiums.
Centre Re earned an average of Dollars 25m for each of its 175 transactions
currently on its books.
'The common element in all our business is a lot of premium per
transaction,' says Mr O'Hara.
The Bermudan companies employ more highly skilled professionals - such as
actuaries - than their equivalents in London, which should allow them to
improve their underwriting performance.
Nearly a third of Centre Re's 30 or so professional staff are actuaries,
whom the group deploys as underwriters.
'We don't believe in the kind of subjective underwriting where you simply
guess what the range of losses will be,' says Mr Palm. Because the Bermudan
companies generally dominate their market sectors, they have been able to
avoid the rate competition which has been suicidal for many companies and
syndicates in London.
Mr O'Hara of XL says: 'Liability insurers in the past have shot themselves
in the knee or even higher.'
More importantly, Bermudan companies are not exposed to the same old
pollution and asbestosis liabilities, stretching back to policies
underwritten in the 1940s and 1950s, that are bedevilling both the London
market and insurers worldwide.
For investors attracted by the prospects of increasing reinsurance rates,
but worried by the industry's legacies from the past, Bermuda looms as an
attractive option.
Certainly Mr David Saul, the Bermudan finance minister, is relishing the
prospect of more insurance business, joking 'Bad news for Lloyd's has been
good news for us'.

FT  20 APR 93 / White-collar work to be contracted out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities in England will have to start contracting out construction
and legal services from October 1995, Mr Robin Squire, environment minister,
announced yesterday.
Compulsory competitive tendering will be extended to other white-collar
services, including information technology services, housing management,
finance, personnel, and corporate services.
For each new service in the tendering programme, the government will
prescribe the proportion of work which must be market-tested. For legal
services, the government is proposing that 33 per cent be put out to tender
from October 1995. For construction services - engineering, architectural
and property management services - the proposal is 30 per cent in October
1995.
This means councils will start seeking tenders for the first services next
summer.

Industrial output in the Czech Republic fell 8 per cent in the first two
months of 1993, compared with the same period last year, according to Mr
Karel Dyba, economics minister, Reuter reports from Prague. Government
statistics showed construction dropped nearly 11 per cent, while exports -
excluding those to Slovakia - fell by more than 23 per cent. The government
expects GDP to grow by 1-3 per cent this year.

FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: European satellite networks
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENTIFIC Atlanta, the US communications group, yesterday began offering
private satellite networks to European companies, including data and voice
communications and business television.
The company said it was the first pan-European service of its type for
private satellite networks usually known as Very Small Aperture Terminal
(VSAT) networks.
VSAT networks allow companies or industrial sectors to set up their own
telecommunications systems using satellites. Worldwide, the market for VSAT
equipment and services is estimated at Dollars 350m, but so far it has been
small in Europe.
Scientific Atlanta says that, to begin with, it is concentrating on the
automotive, banking and distribution sectors. Mr Thom Degnan, managing
director of Scientific Atlanta's private networks division in Europe, said
the company was in advanced negotiations with a leading car manufacturer for
setting up a network.
He declined to reveal the manufacturer but said the network, if set up,
would link more than 800 of the company's dealerships in Europe.
For a large network, the cost of linking sites with data, vision and sound
varies between Dollars 300 and Dollars 500 a site per month.

FT  20 APR 93 / China 'dumping N-waste in Tibet': Indian industrial and
military facilities within missile range, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TIBETAN emigre organisation has accused China of dumping nuclear waste
haphazardly on the Tibetan plateau, and establishing missile sites there
aimed at India.
The International Campaign for Tibet also claimed people living near a
top-secret nuclear facility had developed cancers because of careless
handling of radioactive material.
Chinese officials had no immediate comment on the Tibetan claims. Last year
China firmly denied a charge by the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual
leader, that it was jettisoning radioactive waste in the Tibetan region.
The ITC claimed that China had deployed nuclear missiles in at least three
sites on the Tibetan plateau. It said that forced prison labour had been
used to build the sites.
'China's positioning of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons on the Tibetan
plateau has put many of India's major industrial and military facilities
within striking distance of short-range missiles,' said the report entitled
Nuclear Tibet.
The report said the waste from a facility known as the 'Ninth Academy' in
Qinghai province north-east of Tibet had been dumped in a 'roughshod and
haphazard' manner. ITC also resurrected claims that China was planning to
build a nuclear reactor near the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. Beijing rejects the
claims.
The US-based organisation, formed in 1988 to monitor human rights in Tibet,
said its report was based on interviews with Chinese nuclear experts,
government officials, and two ITC fact-finding missions.
'China's nuclear programme is only a fraction the size of those in the
United States and the ex-Soviet Union. . . but in areas of nuclear
proliferation, lack of worker safety and irresponsible waste disposal,
China's record is as poor or even worse than those of other nuclear powers,'
said the report.
The Ninth Academy was used to design China's nuclear arsenal through the
1970s, and continues to be Beijing's primary nuclear arms research facility,
the ITC report stated.

FT  20 APR 93 / Japanese money supply contracts by 0.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRAGILITY of the Japanese economy was yesterday underlined by a 0.3 per
cent contraction in the money supply last month compared with March last
year. The decline was a reverse from the modest expansion in February, which
marked the end of a five-month money supply contraction from September.
The BoJ also revised down the February rise in the money supply to 0.1 per
cent from its initial estimate of 0.2 per cent.
The central bank believes the fall in the money supply has probably reached
its bottom but that it will not start growing until corporate demand for
bank borrowing increases, which is likely only when industrial production
rises.
The contraction was partly due to the surge in the yen's value against the
dollar which has reduced the yen value of foreign currency deposits.
The broadly defined money supply, which includes cash in circulation plus
certificates of deposit, shrank by 0.3 per cent.

FT  20 APR 93 / Czechoslovak divorce costs both sides dear: Business suffers
as barriers go up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE months after their divorce, the Czech and Slovak republics are
struggling to cope with the costs of separation.
Bitter rows about assets and liabilities, differing economic and political
aims, and a raft of new regulations have all served to disrupt severely the
business that once flowed freely between the two.
Czech sales to Slovakia represent about a quarter of all its exports, while
the Czech Republic takes about 40 per cent of Slovakia's exports. Officials
expected bilateral trade to fall by around 10 per cent, but in January alone
it declined by more than half.
Companies complain of long delays and extra costs caused by new customs and
clearing regulations.
The monetary union under which the two states were to share a common
currency came to an abrupt end in February. A clearing agreement using the
Ecu as the benchmark currency for calculating payments between the two
states failed to halt a sharp decline in bilateral trade. The Slovak crown
has been devalued by 5 per cent and the Czech crown revalued by 2 per cent
against the clearing Ecu, raising the cost of Czech goods for Slovak
companies.
Current projections suggest bilateral trade could fall 30-40 per cent this
year, threatening to postpone economic recovery after two years of sharply
declining output. Economists estimate that a 10 per cent fall in bilateral
trade will cause a 1 per cent drop in Czech GDP, and twice that for
Slovakia.
Faced with a collapse of eastern markets, both countries have redirected
their trade westwards, mainly to Europe. Last year, about 70 per cent of
Czech and Slovak exports were sold in the west, but further inroads into
western markets for exports of traditional products, from steel to textiles,
are facing growing obstacles.
Imports are outpacing exports and the recession in Europe is reducing export
opportunities. The downturn in Germany, now the Czech Republic's largest
single customer absorbing 30 per cent of its exports, as well as its biggest
investor, is viewed with mounting concern in Prague.
Czech and Slovak industrial associations, say government suggestions that
companies should switch sales from each other to other markets are
unrealistic, and would result in a loss of domestic market share to foreign
companies.
However, the collapse of markets in eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia's
partition into two smaller markets, and Prague's focus on western Europe
without the benefits of EC membership, may have reduced the Czech Republic's
attractiveness as a manufacturing base.
Prague insists low labour costs, a skilled labour force, and its location in
the heart of Europe provide an ideal base for foreign investors, but the
lack of incentives may act as a deterrent.
Slovakia, for its part, is desperately courting foreign investors, and
recently unveiled substantial tax incentives. Its economy has been more
affected by the collapse of traditional markets and its unemployment rate
stands at 11 per cent, compared with the Czech Republic's 3 per cent.
According to patchy, and at times contradictory figures, foreign investment
was Dollars 1.6bn and Dollars 270m in the Czech Republic and Slovakia
respectively in 1990-1992.
But last month's decision by Mercedes to abandon plans for a joint venture
to make trucks in the Czech Republic was a worrying signal. The company said
it was no longer interested in the venture because the break-up of
Czechoslovakia had made access to eastern Europe more difficult. Several
other large investments have either fallen through (Dow Chemicals), are
being revised downwards (Siemens) or are locked in endless negotiations
(Iveco/Fiat).
No one in Prague is willing to hazard a guess at the possible number of
bankruptcies that could follow the introduction of a new Czech bankruptcy
law this month, but with figures for inter-company debts running at more
than Kcs 200bn (Dollars 7.1bn), the fear is that there will be a wave of
business failures. Slovakia has so far postponed its own bankruptcy law.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (27): Route to zippier graphics -
. . . For Zoom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Z is for the last word in graphics: zoom in and see the detail. Better
still, rotate it, explode it into components, animate it, change its colour,
freeze it, and drop it into a document, surrounded by text.
Producing graphics used to be a painfully slow and limited business,
restricted by the power of the processor, the resolution of the screen, and
the fairly limited capabilities of the software. A decade ago it was a
triumph to present two pie charts on the screen with associated text. Now it
is possible to see a video running on a workstation, complete with sound.
This is partly due to the explosion in desktop computer power, enormous
advances in screen resolution, and the development of associated peripherals
such as colour printers.
Computer graphics are the icing on the cake for some users, who simply want
to make their presentations zippier. For others in the printing and
pre-press industries, the leaps made in the processing of graphics and
images have revolutionised their business.
NEW APPLICATIONS
Skills that took years to acquire have been outdated by rapid changes in
technology, and seem to belong to another century rather than a few years
ago. With the spread of low-cost CD-ROM and video disk hardware, and
software packages to create interactive applications, multimedia techniques
are becoming affordable in everyday applications.
Image processing was happening 15 years ago, but using 32-bit processors was
beyond the reach of all but specialised businesses. Computer-aided design,
CAD, is one of the few areas where the hardware costs more than the
software, due to the processing power needed to plot a three-dimensional
image, and constantly re-calculate it on the screen for rotation or to show
different views.
More casual users, for whom graphics are an occasional tool for business
presentations, still struggle to get the text in the right place on the
slide. Products such as IBM's Storyboard opened up a Pandora's box of filmic
and animation effects in the mid-1980s, making them comparatively easy to
use.
Graphics vendors have removed one of the most tedious tasks, that of
entering data, by integrating graphics with other applications. The ability
to use data which originates elsewhere has become essential. WordPerfect's
Presentations, for example, can take data from other packages, such as Lotus
123.
Animation has become commonplace, but ease of use is still an issue. Lotus
Development's own Freelance package now incorporates a range of 32 animated
effects, such as wipes, fades, flying texts, and 'canned' animations such as
a spinning globe, which can be customised with text. The magnifying glass
icon provides 'zoom' with close-up detail.
'We've designed Freelance so that people can get good results in half a
hour,' says Steve Jack, European brand manager for graphics at Lotus
Development. He adds that people have better things to do than fiddle around
working on presentation slides late into the night, so Lotus has used
multimedia techniques to create an animated, interactive tutorial.
COMPUTER POWER
Steve Morton, technical director of SAS Institute in the UK, sees computer
power as the main factor holding back the rising tide of interest in
animation, currently being fuelled by IBM and Microsoft. SAS Institute's
SAS/Nvision software produces 3D computer graphics and animation, creating
models, rendering images, and animating scenes. It evolved from a US film
animation product, Neo-Visuals, acquired by SAS Institute in the late 1980s
to incorporate the animation technology into its own SAS information
delivery software.
'At the moment there is little interaction with our standard applications
for information delivery: you can capture and freeze a business graphic, and
then animate it,' explains Morton. 'To be sensible, it requires specialised
3D graphics processors, still a relatively expensive option on workstations.
What we envisage is that the ties with live data will become closer, with
luck co-inciding with the availability of cheap 24-bit graphics cards for
PCs, which would make the technology affordable and practical for business
users.'
Some users already incorporate graphics into every aspect of their work.
Products such as Parametric's Pro/Engineer is typical fo the new generation
of Unix products that integrates the entire design-through-manufacturing
process. But the Macintosh still leads in visualisation with products such
as Abvent's multimedia Zoom, Autodesys' Form-Z, and Electric Image's
animation software.
Innovation Design Engineering Opportunities, Ideo, uses graphics and
animation in every stage of designing products. The technique Ideo calls
'interaction design' applies to pocket mobile phones and microwave ovens as
much as to screen interfaces.
'Whenever we design a product with a chip in it, we simulate it to make it
more satisfying to use,' says John Stoddard, head of design at Ideo.
Ideo uses Macintosh products, Studio 32 to design, and then Macro-mind
Director to 'visualise' the display or control panel, and simulate the very
behaviour of the product in use. A full-time psychologist assists with the
testing process.
'The design is based on solid scientific practice as well as having that
creative leap which gives the users pleasure and satisfaction,' says Mr
Stoddard. The process also cuts down documentation. Mobile phones commonly
come with a hefty 100-page manual whereas Ideo's self-explanatory Dancall
boasts a mere six pages. In the 1990s, users are being offered an exciting
but very confusing convergence of several different technologies, as the
usage of desktop PCs for graphics and presentations expands to include
multimedia, and other technologies seep down from the 'top-end' of CAD and
print-publishing.
The last word belongs to Barnaby Page, editor of a magazine called Pre-Press
which keeps 8,000 professionals in the print, design and reproduction
industries up to date with the latest in graphics and processing
technologies. He has identified a shift in the attitude of users.
'People saw the computer as a means of producing paper, but now they are
beginning to see the computer file itself as the original. The by-product
might be paper, or just as easily, an animation on CD-ROM.'
Once developed, he points out, an animation has several applications, such
as a business or sales presentation, or in a freeze-frame form in a printed
brochure. He points to Kodak's Photo-CD, a scanner for CD-ROM, as a typical
example of how technologies draw together to create new potential - 'in
fact, there's nothing new in the technologies themselves . . . it's the
combination of them that's powerful.'

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (26): Easier ways to build
systems - . . . For Yourdon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ED YOURDON, a pioneering American computer scientist, gave his name to a
method for breaking down the design of a computer system into a set of
components and the relationships between them.
The Yourdon Method is, however, only one among many structured approaches to
building computer systems - all of which fall under the general heading of
computer-aided software/systems engineering, (CASE).
As long ago as the late 1960s, computer scientists recognised that building
information technology systems of any size was a complex task. But they also
saw that it could be simplified if it were viewed as an engineering
discipline rather than an arcane craft.
This important breakthrough in thinking spawned a succession of
'methodologies' - each of which claims to make systems building at least
more manageable, if not easier.
Most software in the past was produced in an informal environment where much
was left to the individual programmer or systems designer. This was
unsatisfactory because it often led to complex systems which could only be
understood by those who built them. If a programmer or designer left,
maintenance became a problem.
Starting in the military and aerospace sectors, the formal approach to
systems and software production has spread throughout the industry since the
early 1970s. The original goal was to improve programmer productivity - the
tools concentrated on code generation and project management. But it became
evident during the 1980s that the 'engineering' approach had broader
potential.
Concepts such as 'information engineering' - where a company's entire
operation is modelled as a set of formal processes - gained credibility.
James Martin, one of its leading advocates, saw that companies could gain
competitive edge in their markets if they could identify applications which
brought high return on investment.
The advanced design and production tools now available to systems builders,
provide the technology to support this vision and produce such applications
quickly.
Nowadays, most serious systems and software development is undertaken within
a formal 'engineering' framework. The final goal of the system is defined,
the systems needed to achieve it are specified and the criteria for its
delivery and support are established.
CASE methods like Yourdon provide the theoretical foundation. They provide
the link between the informality of the real world and the formality of the
computer model.
In its fullest sense, CASE embraces every stage of the development of a
system from the identification of a business need, through development, to
maintenance and 'live' running.
All CASE methods use the concept of the formal software 'life cycle' as
their base and attempt to enforce rigorous design principles throughout.
A system is broken down into a set of components which can be assembled to
create a complete system. The development of the individual components is
managed within the context of the whole system to ensure consistency.
This is a broad area of activity which can be broken down into two distinct
areas: 'upper' CASE - which covers business and system design; and 'lower'
CASE - which covers the development process.
The 'upper' CASE tools and disciplines are used to gather data and evolve a
specification in the form of a data dictionary or system repository. They
may also be capable of simulating a completed system to demonstrate to
users. The 'lower' CASE tools use the design 'dictionary' to generate code
for the final live system.
Any design changes must, of course, be made at the 'upper' level to maintain
the integrity of the design.
At its most ambitious, so-called 'integrated CASE' combines both the design
tools and the production tools in a 'seamless' continuum.
But most early experiences of CASE have, for historical reasons, involved a
mixture of tools and disciplines. A company might like a particular design
tool, but want to use a code generator from a different supplier.
Not surprisingly, this has led to the need for a certain amount of
standardisation of CASE tools, the methods they support and the systems for
which they can generate applications code.
IBM's Application Development (AD)/Cycle is the most ambitious initiative in
this direction.
There are also international standards efforts aimed at defining a
specification for a general-purpose system 'dictionary.' This will make it
possible for a wide range of 'upper' CASE tools to build specifications for
a wide range of code generators.
This is still a long way from the complete automation of the system-building
process. CASE requires a lot of human interference - to get round quirks in
design, which cannot be accommodated by the technology, or to meet the need
for special-purpose code which the code generator cannot produce. It is also
complicated by the change in the underlying infrastructure of information
technology. Applications are no longer built for a single computer - or even
to meet a single need. In the 1990s, they can be spread across a wide range
of technologies from a laptop computer to a giant mainframe.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (25): A battle between rival
contenders - . . . For X-Windows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE coming together of six leading computer companies to produce the Common
Open Software Environment (COSE) raises the significance of the X-Windows
display management standard to the position of potential lead technology in
graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
As more computers are linked together in distributed systems, the need for a
common interface to the services available on such systems, the prime
objective of the COSE initiative, grows more pressing.
The COSE members, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Santa Cruz Operation, Sun
Microsystems, Univel and Unix Systems Laboratories, all have a vested
interest in seeing the X-Windows standard prosper, for all either use it
directly as the basis for their graphical user interfaces, or sell the
operating environment on which it runs.
The X-Windows standard itself started life over ten years ago as two
separate research projects in the US.
Project X at Stanford University in California was aimed at creating a
windowing system, while Project Athena at MIT in Boston aimed at developing
a network-independent graphics protocol that would provide cross-network
services in a mixed-vendor environment.
The two projects were closely complementary and the windowing system was
soon absorbed into the cross-network graphics protocols to form what first
appeared as X-Windows in 1986.
It is now the broadly accepted standard for windowing and graphics
management on Unix-based systems, with a pan-industry consortium of Unix
suppliers and users supporting it.
The key to its acceptance has been the underlying objective of making it
vendor-independent. This has had some drawbacks in driving it through to
universal adoption, however, particularly in the PC arena. Unlike
Microsoft's Windows system, which has the specific PC platform as its sole
target, X-Windows has had to be written as the underpinning specification:
the method by which graphics such as an individual window are to be
displayed and how user actions such as clicking on an icon are to be
handled.
Unlike Microsoft Windows, however, it does not specify the 'look and feel'
of the system. This has led to the inevitable rise of different user
interfaces. Following on from the Unix industry splitting in to two main
camps: Unix International and the Open Software Foundation, the X-based GUI
has been promoted in two different forms, respectively Open Look and
OSF/Motif.
These have been the subject of considerable marketing hype between the rival
contenders. Sun Microsystems has been the leading proponent of Open Look,
and because of the company's dominance in the workstation market (and the
bundling of Open Look with its products) it justly claims that the system is
the most widely sold X-based GUI.
LEADING SUPPLIERS
OSF/Motif, on the other hand, is specified by the largest number of Unix
system suppliers, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment, and
there is growing evidence that is the most likely version to be specified by
users.
The leading supplier of Motif-based windowing systems is IXI of Cambridge,
whose X Desktop windowing system is specified by most of the leading
suppliers. IXI was recently bought by the Santa Cruz Operation (which
already integrates X Desktop into its own Unix) thus giving the company a
significant seat on the councils of the COSE grouping.
Perhaps the most important aspect of X-Windows as a standard is the fact
that it has been specifically designed to work in a client-server
environment. Windowing systems running on a stand-alone machine such as a PC
are self-contained; the user takes an action within a window, and the
application in question is there on the same machine.
In a client/server environment, it is highly likely that the users actions
on a workstation will affect or use an application running on a different
system. The results of the action may, in turn, have to be passed to a
different application on yet another system on the network.
In this situation, there is a need for a management system which not only
ensures that the users actions, and the results, are presented correctly on
the workstation, but also ensures that the users' instructions to and
demands upon the various applications running elsewhere on the network are
correctly routed and acted on.
The flexibility and vendor-independence of X-Windows can also be exploited
to create wider distributed systems than those based solely on Unix
platforms and applications.
For example, a number of companies have developed software tools which allow
X-Windows-compliant windows to be opened within a Microsoft Windows
environment on a PC.
The leading suppliers of this technology are UK companies such as VisionWare
of Leeds and JSB Software of Macclesfield. Their tools allow users to work
at a networked PC, using all the familiar applications and productivity
tools of the Windows environment and, when required, open a X-compliant
window on to a Unix server.
This provides great flexibility, in that the users keep a familiar working
environment on the PC and gain access to the wider, more comprehensive power
of the distributed network through X-Windows.
There is also the full cut-and-paste capabilities of Windows available
between the PC applications and those X-compliant applications on the
network.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (24): Windows on wider horizons -
For Wordprocessors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORDPROCESSORS have come a long way since the early days of the Wordstar
package. Once a wordprocessing file mainly included text. Now it has become
'a compound document into which you can paste drawings or spreadsheets, and
from which you can send electronic mail (email).' So says Elaine Sharp,
messaging server manager at Microsoft (US).
Several technologies have helped to change the focus of wordprocessing (WP):
WINDOWS. Applications (such as spreadsheets, wordprocessors and graphics
packages) written to run under the Windows graphical user interface (GUI)
use similar commands and can therefore be integrated closely.
WYSISWIG (for what you see is what you get). Sharp says: 'I used to have to
print out what I was typing five or six times to get the layout right. Now
that the best WP packages let you see the page exactly as it is going to be
printed out (including different fonts, bold and underlining), I just print
out one copy and sign it.'
DESKTOP PUBLISHING. 'The distinction between high-end wordprocessing and
desktop publishing (DTP) is becoming blurred,'says John Tuohy, European
brand manager for wordprocessing at Lotus Development. 'High-end packages
such as Lotus Ami Pro enable the user to combine text and graphics, vary
typefaces and adjust the amount of space between characters and lines -
features once only available from DTP software.' Sometimes the 'published'
document never even sees paper. For example, long engineering
documents/manuals are starting to be published on computer or optical disks.
PC NETWORKS. The spread of personal computer (PC) networks has created
demand for new features. The best-selling Windows WP packages are 'mail-
enabled.' This means that a user simply has to select 'send mail' from a
menu to convert a piece of text into a mail message. Some packages also
allow users to send each other voice notes.
As the penetration of PC networks increases, Tuohy believes that users will
start to want document management over the network. They will use it, when
they are working on a document with colleagues, to find out when a document
is in use because it is being revised. Or to search for files across the
network, not just on their own hard disks.
Roger Whitehead of Office Futures says: 'Although some wordprocessors allow
users to annotate a document and pass it to another person working on it,
there are relatively few PC products which allow users to work on the same
document at the same time.
'Products which enable two or more users on a network to work on the same
page of the same document together (handing over control from one to the
other) are relatively rare outside the Unix and Apple Macintosh worlds - but
this is coming.'
As well as changes in WP technology, there has also been a change in the
type of person using it. More managers do their own wordprocessing and this
has led to a shift of emphasis in WP design. Shelagh Marsh, Microsoft UK's
Word product marketing manager, says 'the 1980s were very much the years of
the feature wars. Suppliers were packing in features to gain competitive
advantage - even if users didn't need them. Now we're concentrating on
ease-of-use.
'We spoke to our users and they said 'we've got lots of features, but we
still can't get our work done as fast as we'd like to.'
'So we gave several hundred of them 'instrumented' versions of our WP
software, which enabled us to track what they were doing. For example, we
noticed that people were trying to insert bullet points in front of certain
paragraphs. So in Word for Windows 2.0 (launched late last year), we built
in a feature which enables users to insert them automatically by
highlighting the paragraphs they want to bullet, and hitting the bullet icon
(symbol).
'At the moment, we're sitting down with users and trying to find out what it
is they need to achieve. For example, many people produce monthly reports by
taking last month's report, leaving in the headings and updating it. So in
future versions we might include a monthly-report icon which will do this
automatically.'
THE FUTURE. Marsh believes that 'the information, not the application' is
king. People producing a monthly report - see themselves as doing just that.
They don't see themselves as doing some wordprocessing, then using a
spreadsheet. She expects the barriers between wordprocessing and other
applications to break down even further. Using Windows at present, it is
possible to embed a sales graph in a wordprocessing file and call up the
spreadsheet program in a Window to update it. But version 2.0 of Microsoft's
object-linking and embedding technology will allow 'in place' editing. This
will make it possible to update the sales graph without calling up a
separate Window.
However, Marsh points out that as wordprocessing becomes more closely
integrated with other applications, suppliers will have to work hard to
reduce unnecessary overlap between their products. For example, users don't
need a different spellchecker/dictionary for each PC application they use -
just one accessible from all. Roger Whitehead says there are two types of
wordprocessing supplier: 'splitters' and 'lumpers.' Microsoft is an example
of the former. It is concentrating on a nucleus of function and may, for
example, sell its spellchecker separately.
WordPerfect is an example of the latter. It has just included 80 per cent of
basic spreadsheet commands into the latest version of its DOS wordprocessor
WordPerfect 6.0 (available in third quarter, 1993), as well as graphics
handling and Grammatik grammar-checking software. It has even added
Windows-like features, for users who don't want to invest in the more
powerful PCs needed to run Microsoft Windows.
WordStar also belongs to the 'lumpers' group. Its WordStar for Windows
program comes with a grammar checker, Correct Grammar.
David Godwin, general manager of WordPerfect UK, believes that 'as WP
packages start to handle different types of information - this is not just
word or document processing but information processing.'

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (23): Still at the stage of baby
talk - . . . Voice Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDITH MASSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY one thing stands between the average person and their computer: a
keyboard. Although most people feel happiest communicating with each other
through speech, voice interfaces for computers are viewed as a technology
very much for the future.
The computer industry has grappled with this dilemma for at least 20 years.
Periodically, computers which are designed to be controlled with digitised
voice commands are designed and sold to a small number of users. And the
most successful use of voice in computing to date has been found in
specially-built military systems, where voice is used to control aircraft
and radar equipment, and in speech synthesis systems for the disabled.
In business, voice technology is already being widely used for
telephone-based services such as voice messaging. Retailers can replace
human telephone operators with a voice messaging system, then accept orders
placed from customers who key in relevant numbers on tone dialling
telephones. Hospitals and other commercial organisations are using internal
telephone exchanges to manage this type of voice messaging application. Text
files, such as railway timetables and stock market reports, can be digitised
and broadcast over telephone and computer networks.
Small businesses and private homes also benefit from new digital exchanges
and voice/data networks now being installed by British Telecom across the
UK. The fact that most exchanges can store digitised voice locally on
computer disks means that BT can try out new services such as Call Minder.
This tells incoming callers if the number they want is busy, then invites
them to leave a voice message.
Other applications for voice in business have always been limited by the
cost of computer hardware. Storing digitised voice is a resource-hungry
business, with one minute of uncompressed speech taking up one megabit of
disk storage.
Another problem is processing speed. If a computer is to recognise the words
being spoken to it, it must have some way of checking spoken words against a
known vocabulary. Such a vocabulary swallows up disk space, and the act of
matching word to voice dictionary requires a fast computer processor.
But the fact that the cost of PC and Unix hardware has fallen so
dramatically over the past year or two is bringing new voice related
applications onto the desktop. An example of this new breed of
voice-activated application is Shakespeare Speechwriter, a word processor
and document handler that can be controlled wholly or partially through
voice commands.
Speechwriter allows users to dictate documents to their PC, which then
displays words on-screen almost as quickly as they are spoken. Software
converts spoken words into digitised data, which can be stored on the PC's
hard disk. Shakespeare expects that key users of the new system will be
middle and senior managers, who can create documents without using the
keyboard, and sales order processing departments which normally type or
write down incoming telephone enquiries.
Shakespeare will sell Speechwriter as an all-in-one 'voice processor,' which
will include a beefed-up Compaq 80486 PC and software, for around Pounds
5,000.
Although there will be more applications of this type on offer in the
future, most software for the PC that uses voice is still fairly limited.
The most it can normally do is to accept voice commands to open or close
windows on the screen, or to record and play short voice annotations.
Software packages written for Apple's System 7 operating system or for
Microsoft Windows 3.1, which now includes voice capabilities, let users with
a suitably equipped PC record short messages. The message can be included
within a word processing or electronic mail document, where it is shown as a
special icon.
When the document is read by somebody else, they can click on the sound icon
and hear the message. This kind of voice annotation is particularly useful
when users want to be more expressive in the message they are sending, or
wish to draw attention to a particular part of the document.
The fact that Microsoft has included support for voice in Windows means that
there will soon be a critical mass of users able to make the most of voice
in everyday business applications. Another factor will be the increasing
trend for PC and workstation hardware manufacturers to build voice
capability into their products.
JUST THE BEGINNING
One of these manufacturers is Compaq, which recently said that it would
include 'business audio' as a standard feature in its middle and top end
Deskpro products. Deskpro PCs now include a sound chip and a microphone,
allowing users to both record and play back digitised voice. But as Compaq's
desktop product manager, Sue Forkin, explains, this is just the beginning
for multimedia in PCs. The way in which voice is used so far in computing is
still fairly rudimentary and artificial. In the future, voice will be much
more useful - particularly in security systems.
Along with multimedia, security is one of today's hot topics in voice
technology. The fact is that a voice print is as individual to one person as
a fingerprint. It means that voice will be extremely useful in the control
of everyday items, such as automated teller machines (ATMs), as well as
office systems like fax machines. Instead of using complex commands and
remote controls, customers will control such systems simply by talking to
them.
But the key benefits of voice interfaces of the future will be freedom for
users, who will be able to operate computers 'hands-free'; and the removal
of the keyboard barrier for IT-shy managers. Bearing in mind the fact that
people type at rates from a slow 25 words per minute (wpm), but speak at
around 200 wpm, speech input can also bring productivity benefits all round.
'The fact is that the keyboard has been a limiting feature in computing for
far too long,' concludes Mike Patrick, of Digital Equipment UK. 'Voice
interfaces have a great deal of potential, because voice is the key method
of communication for most people.'

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (22): Key role in commercial
computing - . . . For Unix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIX is an operating system: the software that controls the computer
hardware so that business systems can be loaded and run and given access to
data files on disc, to printers and to other resources.
However, Unix is special: it is being worked into a standard so that it can
run on different computers of all sizes.
Computer manufacturers have traditionally sold their own operating systems
with their own computers. This has tied customers in, because moving to
another supplier has meant large redevelopment of application programs.
This tradition has also limited users' choice of program packages. Huge
development costs have restricted package suppliers to offering their
products on a very limited number of operating systems.
All this is gradually changing, thanks to Unix, an unlikely candidate for
such a key role in commercial computing. For one thing, Unix was originally
developed more than 30 years ago by a researcher at AT&amp;T privately working
on a computer game. Ken Thompson found a mainframe computer unsuitable for a
game for a single user, so he wrote an operating system for a spare DEC
minicomputer.
As an operating system supporting on-line working on relatively cheap
minicomputers, Unix gained a considerable following in universities,
especially as AT&amp;T provided it at little cost.
Meanwhile, the heart of the system was rewritten in the 'C' programming
language, which runs on a variety of computers. Unix could now be moved from
one computer to another without massive redevelopment. However, this meant
universities and companies adapted it in different ways for their own needs.
In 1980, Microsoft turned Unix into a serious product by launching a version
called Xenix and other suppliers started showing interest.
AT&amp;T now sought to regain control and in 1983 launched a version called
System V to try to set a standard.
The standards movement started rolling slowly in 1984, when X/Open was
formed as a world-wide body of users and suppliers to gather contributions
on standards, especially relating to Unix, and publish specifications based
on the best proposals.
However, the Unix world was split in 1988 when two rival industry groups
were formed: Unix International, led by Unix originator AT&amp;T and Sun
Microsystems, and the Open Software Foundation, with top computer
manufacturers IBM, Hewlett Packard and DEC among the founders.
Unix International based its future on the Unix System V developed by AT&amp;T
through its Unix System Laboratories subsidiary.
The Open Software Foundation meanwhile built its Unix by combining the best
pieces of software from its member companies. The organisation argued that
there were risks in allowing a single company, AT&amp;T, to control Unix.
Computer manufacturers joined one group or the other and there was open war.
However, user pressure brought a truce, if not peace. This was marked in
1991 when Unix International adopted the Open Software Foundation's
Distributed Computing Environment, a piece of software which enables
different computers running different operating systems to work together.
This and other agreements mean there is now considerable compatibility
between versions of Unix in the way different versions run application
programs.
In March this year there was significant progress when all sides announced
they would work towards common standards at the user level: in particular,
to ensure common user screens and facilities - known as graphical user
interfaces - the adoption of the same networking products, plus agreement on
standards in the handling of graphics, multimedia (the linking, for example,
of tradit ional magnetic disc files with pictures from CDs) and the
management of company-wide distributed systems.
Six companies from the rival factions, including world computer industry
leader IBM, Hewlett Packard - which claims over 40 per cent of the world
Unix market - AT&amp;T's Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems,
announced they would combine the best of their products in these areas,
present a single specification to X/Open and then make that specification
available to anyone - free of charge. In addition they committed themselves
to dropping further development of their own products and standardising on
the agreed specifications.
RED-LETTER DAY
The six companies' announcement drew instant support from another two-dozen
organisations, many of which made equal commitments to adopt the standards -
'this is a red-letter day for open systems and a sign that the open systems
industry is showing a bit of maturity at last,' said Mr Bernard Hulme, head
of marketing and support for Europe at Unix specialist software house Santa
Cruz Operation.
Mr Geoff Morris, chief executive of X/Open, said that by basing the proposed
standard on established products the six suppliers ensured that the
specification should be available by June.
The six are organising a seminar for applications software producers in
October and expect to launch products based on the standards in the first
half of next year.
The spectre at the Unix feast is Microsoft, ruler of the personal computer
operating system market as developer of MS-DOS and Windows and due to
announce its more sophisticated NT in a month's time.
Unix suppliers are pooh-poohing NT. Yet at the announcement by the six
partners in March they took every opportunity to attack Microsoft, even when
answering questions on other topics. And only the week before the chief
executive of Unix International, Mr Peter Cunningham, was in London with a
presentation which specifically brought the NT challenge to the audience's
attention and then proceeded to knock it down. Unix is available on
computers ranging from powerful desk-top machines to mainframes. The focus
of NT is expected to be desk-top machines and office processors managing
local files and programs and running networks.
If there is to be a battle at office and even desk-top level between Unix
and NT, as many observers believe, last month's announcement means that the
Unix army at last seems to be approaching unity.
This in turn means that whatever the outcome of the battle, the customer
looking for open systems already seems set to be the winner.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (21): The shape of things to come
 -Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a few years you may only have to leave your office chair for coffee or a
call of nature. The modern trend in telecommunications is to put more and
more power on your desktop. Meetings will increasingly become unnecessary as
more and more work is conducted by electronic mail, fax and video
conferencing.
The limiting factor in these is the rate at which data can be transferred.
Technically it is known as 'bandwidth' and is measured in 'baud' which
roughly equate to bits per second. The current bandwidth of a telephone
circuit limits the data rate to a maximum of around 14,400 baud.
This data rate means that a fax takes around a minute per A4 page. While
fine for a quick, scribbled memo, it is far too slow for a 140-page
document.
Around 70 per cent of all faxes originate on computers - usually they are
printed and then manually fed through the fax machine by a secretary. At the
other end, they are often photocopied to avoid handling the thermal paper
which is unpleasant to touch and fades with time.
In the next few years, this will change as PCs connect to fax lines via fax
modems. In addition, many documents will be sent as electronic mail and then
printed locally if required. Electronic mail transfer is far more efficient
than fax for textual documents. Although the speed of new modems (which pass
data across telephone connections) has increased steadily, they are rapidly
approaching a performance ceiling. New technologies are facing the laws of
diminishing returns. Data compression techniques have allowed the data rates
to increase further but these are largely unsuitable for video images. Some
might claim that B's videophone is more of a 'toy' than a serious
video-conferencing tool. It provides little more than blurred snapshots
rather than a face-to-face meeting. It is severely hampered by the bandwidth
available on a conventional telephone line.
The next step forward has been ISDN (integrated data sevices network) which
provides two channels of 64,000 baud down a single telephone wire. This
opens up whole new areas of applications. Video-conferencing becomes more of
a reality as the pictures are much better at the higher bandwidth. Using an
ISDN channel, a fax takes only a few seconds per page. In addition, fax
machines capable of using ISDN have improved data compression and error
correction to remove the smudges that plague current faxes.
The beauty of ISDN-2 is that is incredibly cheap. While installation costs
and line rental are higher, call costs are the same as for a standard phone
connection. Companies using data transfer or electronic mail may see
considerable savings. The increased rental costs are soon recovered because
of the decreased call times. ISDN is totally digital so modems become much
simpler to build. Sadly, volumes have not risen quickly enough to persuade
modem manufacturers to reduce their prices accordingly.
ISDN-2 opens up further possibilities because it can provide two separate
channels down the same wire. Feature phones can therefore offer voice on one
channel with simultaneous video or data transfer on the other.
One exciting possibility is the concept of a 'whiteboard.' Participants in a
teleconference use one channel for voice and the other channel for data
exchange between PCs. Each PC runs a simple drawing package which allows the
person sitting at the screen to draw as if on a whiteboard. As they draw an
image, the same image is transmitted simultaneously to all the participants
in the conference.
They can then comment on and change the image by drawing on their own PCs.
Again, these changes are reflected on each person's screen. Value-added
services are also becoming increasingly prevalent in regular telephones.
BT's 'Star Services' have introduced many to the joys of call-forwarding,
call-waiting and so on.
While many large companies have had these facilities supplied by their
internal exchanges, the digitilisation of the UK networks has brought these
facilities within the reach of small businesses.
But the new features are a mixed blessing. Call-waiting, for example, means
that if there is an incoming call during a conversation, you get an annoying
bleep in your ear. The person you are talking to perceives a hiccough as you
talk - in time with each bleep. Research has indicated that 75 per cent of
calls are less important than what they interrupt. While important calls may
no longer be missed, a million dollar deal could be interrupted by a 'junk
call' which previously would have received an engaged tone.
Features to come will reduce this possibility. Already, some areas have
caller identification where the exchange supplies the caller's telephone
number to the telephone.
Devices are readily available which can use this information to screen calls
or re-route them - say, to a secretary.
As travelling to meetings, or even going into a meeting room becomes a thing
of the past, the only exercise you may get is going to and from work.
As teleworking (working from home via communications networks) takes off,
even that may cease. Perhaps then, the growth area will be executive chairs
with inbuilt multi-gyms.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (19): Big impact on the market -
. . . For Risc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE the mid-1980s, reduced instruction set computer (Risc) design has
become the basis for most - if not all - workstations above personal
computer level, for departmental systems and for even more powerful
machines.
The trend was set by one of the oldest and one of the newest computer
manufacturers: in 1986, Hewlett-Packard based its entire future computer
range on Risc; and a year later, Sun Microsystems shook the workstation
market with a product based on its own Risc processor called Sparc, or
Scalable Processor Architecture.
Sun went some way to establishing Sparc as an industry standard through
licensing and marketing deals with the likes of ICL, Xerox, Fujitsu and
Amdahl; in addition, the company's growing significance attracted AT&amp;T as a
leading shareholder.
The move towards Risc is in many ways a move right back to very earliest
days of computers. In the 1940s and early 1950s, processors and memory
worked at the same speed. A programmer's instructions were read from memory
one at a time and processed by hardware which was wired to handle particular
functions, such as add, load and store.
However, advances in processor technology dramatically outpaced the speed at
which program instructions could be retrieved from memory. Processors would
be idle, waiting for the next instructions.
So in the late 1950s and 1960s, processors were given expanded instruction
sets, stored as so-called microcode in very fast local memory. This
development came as high-level programming languages such as Cobol were
making their mark: such languages enabled the programmer to write
complicated statements - for example, to instruct a computer to compare two
items of data and take different action depend ing on the result.
So now, instead of retrieving and processing a simple instruction and then
having to wait for the next one, the processor was fed with a complex
instruction and spent so much time breaking it down into simple microcode
instructions and then processing them that the former idle time was
eliminated.
This new approach was seized on with such enthusiasm that by the mid-1980s a
big mainframe computer might have 300 to 500 instructions built in, compared
with 15 to 30 in the earliest machines. Today these big systems are known as
Cisc - complex instruction set computer - machines.
However, continuing rapid progress in hardware technology meant the memory
speed issue gradually disappeared. In fact the move towards complex
instruction sets was such that in some cases the processor now keeps the
memory waiting: the opposite of the situation that prompted the move to
complex instruction sets.
When Hewlett-Packard came to design its Risc range, it analysed 900bn lines
of programming code from all application areas running on a dozen
manufacturers' computers. And it discovered that just 20 per cent of
instructions accounted for 80 per cent of processing.
Such a finding means manufacturers can in effect return to the 1940s
principle of wiring a small number of often-used simple instructions into
the processor and largely dispense with microcode. This means faster
processing.
The removal of microcode from a microchip also means more of the
instructions can be located together on the same chip, so data being passed
from one instruction to another moves within the same chip and not between
separate components. This, again, increases speed.
Risc has had a big impact on the market, not least because it has taken off,
45 years after its original heyday, at the same time as the Unix operating
system (see also the Unix entry in this A-Z). Suppliers of Risc systems of
all sizes are standardising on Unix.
SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS
New companies - notably Sun Microsystems - have been born and have
flourished, thanks to Risc products. Established manufacturers have launched
whole ranges of Risc products: Hewlett-Packard staked its entire future as a
computer manufacturer on Risc with its 1986 announcement and a commitment to
Unix; and IBM has had success with its RS/6000 range, launched in 1990.
Unlike the personal computer market, where manufacturers have largely
settled on Intel processors, the Risc business is fragmented on the hardware
front, although several suppliers are trying to establish their products as
standards. Sun Microsystems in particular has a big following and MIPS
Computer Systems has struck some deals.
Microelectronics specialist Motorola is a leading supplier to Risc system
builders. Motorola is also part of an as yet unknown quantity: a consortium
with IBM and Apple which is working to get IBM's RS/6000 Risc processors on
the market as electronic components for other computer and workstation
manufacturers.
The use of Risc designs, continuing advances in technology, competitive
pressures and the rapid emergence of Unix as a standard operating system
have taken the prices of basic powerful workstations down to around Pounds
2,000, just as the personal computer market is set for new turmoil. Intel,
purveyor of processors to the personal computer industry, is about to unveil
its top-end Pentium processor and, in May, Microsoft will launch its NT
operating system.
The two old-timers, Risc and Unix - both dating back more 30 years - will be
key partners in the battle for tomorrow's desk-top computing market.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (20): New ways to protect vital
information -  ..For Security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER security is entwined with the myth of the teenage hacker. The
callow youth who cuts through acres of code and plants irreverent and
destructive messages in a critical computer system.
There are real threats to the security of information technology. They come
from more mundane sources than the hacker, but can inflict more damage than
conventional thieves.
Robert Schifreen has carved out a respectable career for himself as a
security consultant. Eight years ago he was in court charged with hacking
into the Duke of Edinburgh's electronic mailbox and signing off as '. . .
His Royal Hacker.'
The authorities were not amused and Schifreen and his fellow hacker pursued
the matter to the House of Lords before their exploit was dismissed as a
harmless prank.
Today, Mr Schifreen is in demand for solid commercial advice. But he
stresses the practical side of security risks - 'telephone hacking is not as
important as the fact that someone can walk up to your office, copy your
files onto a floppy disk, wander out and read them at leisure,' he says.
In order to protect information, everything connected to it must be secured.
Encryption, hiding data behind a sequence of code-words, can lock out
unwanted users. Restricting access to the office makes it less rewarding for
a data intruder to chase up those code-words. But with the rise of local
area networks and computer clusters built around one powerful processor
acting as a central server it has become difficult to 'partition' data
access.
Keith Marsden is managing director of Braintree, a Cheshire-based software
house specialising in security issues. He echoes Schifreen's view that
security is about more than technology - 'it's not about hackers. The most
dangerous person in a company is the one who's under stress and bearing a
grudge.'
Marsden believes security begins with an awareness of personnel, their
problems and grievances and a knowledge of just how far they can delve into
the company's data. Braintree produces Auditor Plus, a software security
product for Digital Equipment computer networks. Costing upwards of Pounds
12,000 per installation, Auditor is not cheap. But it takes a novel approach
to the issue of systems security.
Installed on a network Auditor checks each user's level of authorisation to
assess their potential access to data. The effect is to provide the user
with a harsh remind er of just how many people can see confidential files.
Marsden has found that demonstrating Auditor is an effective, if alarming,
sales tactic - 'one potential user gave us the name of a file that only four
senior staff could access officially. Auditor ran through the system and
reported that 100 people could access it]'
Auditor began life five years ago after the Cern nuclear research laboratory
in Geneva was victim to unauthorised access. The perpetrator destroyed files
and caused significant damage. The lesson was not lost on other sites
guarding irreplaceable data. Auditor's second sale was to the European Space
Agency.
Reuters exists to sell huge volume of data. It uses Auditor to prevent
unauthorised browsing into its huge reserves of historical market data. Paul
Andrews, a Reuters systems manager, has instructed the program to trawl
through his system every 30 minutes. It reports on whether individual
authorisation levels have been changed to enlarge access.
Given that information is the raw material his organisation thrives on, Paul
Andrews has no trouble justifying the cost of IT security measures. And he
finds that Reuters clients are well aware of the benefits of careful
security planning - 'when I say we're using a dedicated security product it
gives the clients an added sense of well-being.'
A lack of adequate security procedures can have unexpected consequences. Bob
Hay, a former police chief superintendent, is chairman of the Federation
Against Software Theft. His organisation was established to highlight the
issues involved in unauthorised copying of software. Bob Hay points out that
computer security extends to protecting an organisation's reputation. If
employees engage in widescale copying of software, the company will be held
responsible.
Both GEC Marconi and Mirror Group have found themselves on the receiving end
of Fast investigations. The answer, says Hay, is to set up a software
management charter.
'Register all software bought by the company and carry out regular audits of
what copies are running,' he says. The European Security Forum is evidence
of the weight that blue chip companies attach to data security. Including
Barclays Bank and British Steel among its members, ESF organises workshops
to pool opinions. In the past three years members have allocated Pounds 2.5m
to the organisation.
LESSONS LEARNED
Alan Stanley is managing director of the ESF. He admits that the Virgin
Atlantic-British Airways conflict highlighted a data security breach. BA is
an ESF member, and it managed the computer data bank that contained
passenger booking files for Virgin.
Alan Stanley attempts to draw a positive lesson from the embarassing case of
a prominent ESF contributor breaching recognised standards of
confidentiality in pursuit of commercial gain. He believes Virgin failed to
appreciate the vulnerability and value of its data.
'When you contract-out a service, security is not always the first
consideration. You have to know who's doing what, and what risks the out
side contractor is taking on board.'
Virgin was livid that BA drew sensitive information from the booking system.
The data was used to analyse the profitability of Virgin routes as well to
approach customers. Virgin said it was poised to bring an action against BA
under the Data Protection.
Given the sharp rise in outsourcing of computer maintenance, it's worth
assessing the loyalty of non-employees. They may be perfectly honest, but
less inclined to understand the value of security. Contract staff can
discuss sensitive passwords over mobile phones and leave identity codes
written down for their colleagues. Cited by security consultants as common,
these lapses prove that it pays to keep up a barrage of reminders on the
vital subject of security.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (18): The next stage of evolution
 -For Query language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUERY language is a way of giving non-programming users a handle on
information, in effect giving them control of their own data. A mass of data
is like a monochrome map: the information is there if you know how to look
for it, but interpretation is a matter of expertise. To bring the picture to
life, one needs to interrogate it, arrange it into patterns, and draw
conclusions from it.
SQL is the most famous of the breed, the Structured Query Language which
could stand as a symbol of the 1980s' movement towards giving power to the
users. Its progenitor was the relational database (rdbms), the form of
database which makes it possible to relate or connect items of data.
Relational database brought about the users's ability to interrogate the
data for him or herself. A trip back to earlier generations of data
processing makes it easier to understand the rdbms revolution. Early
programs written in Cobol or other so-called 'third generation' languages
used a 'data division' of data that could be the property of that program
and no other. Even if the data was re-usable, in the sense of being drawn
from a library or database, it was arranged hierarchically.
The hierarchical database allowed one item only to be the index or key to
the information. The index would have to be a unique value, such as an
account number, and all other values were dependent upon it, or belonged to
it. This imposed a rigid structure on data, geared to the program's primary
purpose.
The relational database removed the strait-jacket by storing data as a
series of ready-made tables. These suggested 'relationships' between data
items. The jargon ('third normal form' and 'flat files,' for example) was a
frightening smokescreen to a very simple concept. It became possible to
combine data in one exercise, by bolting together several tables. The next
step was to make this easy to operate for end users who no longer needed to
rely on a programmer for one-off reports.
EARLY DEVELOPMENTS
More than a decade ago, early attempts at query languages, such as
Cullinet's Online English made use of natural language parsing, (a branch of
artificial intelligence research) with the idea that a user could type in a
question in exactly the same way that it would be spoken. This proved little
more than an introductory gimmick, because users rapidly look for short
cuts. In terms of efficiency, it makes sense for users to learn some sort of
structure, as inexpert users can slow the system down by making clumsy
searches.
By the mid-1980s, SQL had opened the door to non-expert usage of the
database, although some training was still necessary. For programmers, the
development was even more significant. The existence of a widely-established
language made it possible to create programs and entire applications which
could interact with a database using SQL as the standard interface. SQL
could even bridge the gap between mainframe and Unix applications, by
providing a common interface to either. The following is an example of an
SQL statement which is looking for all French-speaking employees based in
London. The asterisk is a common convention signifying all records.
Bracketed lower case words suggest a variable which in practice would be
replaced by the variable name in capitals. Actual 'values' are shown in
inverted commas:
SELECT* FROM (database name eg EMPLOYEES).
WHERE (field name eg CITY) = 'LONDON.'
AND (field name, eg LANGUAGES) = 'FRENCH'.
SQL opened up the possibility of interrogating multiple databases through
one application. In the 1990s, the queries are more suggested rather than
articulated, using intuitive user-interfaces which lead the users through a
series of choices or suggestions, using graphical user interfaces, (GUIs).
Agility Business Software is the UK supplier of one such tool, the Quick-SQL
query tool, part of a set of development software from the Dutch company,
Baan. Quick-SQL does a lot of work behind the scenes, connecting either with
commercial databases such as Oracle, Informix, and Sybase, or with Baan's
own rdbms, or with the raw commodity of Unix databases, C-ISAM.
The user only has to 'point and click' to build a query such as the above,
picking a verb such as SELECT, and choosing operators (plus minus equals,
and so on) values and field names from lists displayed on the screen.
According to Dave Jordan, technical director of Agility, users should have
access to any field, indexed or not, and on any database, on the host
machine or elsewhere - 'you don't have to know the name of the field, where
it is set up, or even what machine it's on. There is usually an English-like
description of a field somewhere which acts as a dictionary for access,' he
says.
The graphical user interface has outdated the original query language, but
it enacts the spirit if not the word of the early pioneers. Images and
speech, the most natural interfaces for information access, promise to be
the next stage of evolution.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (17): It's not such a simple
issue - . . . For Piracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the fundamental problems with software piracy is that most 'pirates'
never realise that this is what they are. It is part of the nature of
software that a program can be copied by one individual, passed on to
another, and the first person still retains their original copy - so how can
it be pirating, for nothing has gone missing?
It is, of course, not theft but breach of copyright and is now treated in
law in broadly the same way as breaches of other copyright in areas such as
writing and music. But while most people are well aware that, if they
photocopy a book or tape a piece of music they are breaching copyright, when
it comes to computer software this does not always register.
Why? Partly it is the industry's own fault. The PC industry in particular
has tended to use a marketing theme along the lines of 'all this technology
for next to no cost.' It is but a short step for many to assume that
software is 'free.'
The industry has also often made its licencing so complicated, particularly
where multiple copies might be required by the user, that copying is simply
the easier option. The other main reason, as implied by recent survey
figures from FAST, the Federation Against Software Theft, is that most
'pirates' simply do not realise that they have actually carried out the act
of piracy.
FAST is made up of around 150 of the leading software suppliers, plus a
growing number of corporate users. The FAST survey has shown that the
majority of offenders are what it defines as ordinary users, often people
using computers for work and passing round within their company applications
that are relevant to their tasks.
Interestingly, the next biggest group of offenders are those that really
should know better, company MIS managers with a tendency to be what FAST
ironically calls 'budget-conscious.' Despite appearances in the press,
unscrupulous resellers, students and dedicated computer hackers in practice
account for less than a quarter of all offenders.
FAST is still more than interested in the activities of such people, and has
recently launched a big crackdown on market and car-boot sale traders who
sell copied applications quite openly. The survey has indicated, however,
that while it should not lose sight of those targets, a shift in focus is
now needed. In short, the corporate users who do not realise they are doing
anything illegal have now become FAST's prime target.
A corporate membership scheme was launched last year and to date FAST has
dealt with some 4,000 enquiries. Two hundred of these have already resulted
in the applicants becoming corporate members of FAST. One of the claimed
advantages of corporate membership is that the software industry members at
last get a method of directly hearing corporate users' problems with such
important factors as licencing agreements and documentation.
Both of these, and in particular the complexity of licencing applications
for use across multiple users on a network, are cited as reasons why
corporate users sometimes end up acting illegally. It also has side benefits
for the corporate users themselves. Not only do they learn how not to act
illegally, they also gain more control over what applications are running on
their networks.
AUDIT SYSTEM
Part of being a corporate member of FAST is to run a software audit,
discovering what applications are being used on the systems. This not only
identifies potential illegalities, but also allows the company's MIS
department to identify problem applications, usually unapproved packages
which have the potential to clash with either other applications or, more
significantly, the network management system itself.
This is certainly seen as a benefit by one of the recent additions to FAST
corporate members, Morgan Grenfell. The company also faced the problem that,
as its traders could not afford to be off-line while audits of their
individual systems were undertaken, it has had to utilise an on-line audit
system running on the network.
M-G sees some big benefits in this approach. Not only are the traders
minimally disrupted, for the audit is run over the network rather than their
individual computers being taken off-line, but once completed, the company
can then institute a continuous review process running automatically in the
background.
The company's Quality Management Group can also identify those applications
which, while perhaps not acquired through piracy (for example public domain
applications) are nonetheless not approved for use on the network. According
to the company's IT Quality Manager, Mike Marjot, this aspect of network
integrity and applications quality was the prime reason for the exercise.
Identifying illegally copied applications was, in a way, a very useful
by-product.
Given this perspective, the Quality Management Group decided they would tell
the traders and other users that the audit was taking place, and
specifically stressed that this was not being done to 'catch' anyone acting
illegally. Needless to say, that would have also been a very useful
by-product, particularly in advance of any unannounced visit from those nice
people from FAST.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (16): The invisible 'glue' in IT
systems - . . . For OLTP Software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST business transactions end up on a computer nowadays. A sales order
recorded from a telephone call, a withdrawal from an automatic teller
machine in the wall of a bank or a quote for an insurance policy - all
eventually find their way into a computer system somewhere.
Since computers were first used in commerce, there has been a demand for
these transactions to be executed in 'real time' or 'on-line' - giving rise
to the concept of on-line transaction processing (OLTP).
For many years this type of computing has been the exclusive province of
specially-built systems based on proprietary computer hardware. IBM's
mainframe computers are the best-known example - although all the leading
computer manufacturers offer comparable systems.
In the last few years, however, there has been a demand for a different kind
of OLTP. The spread of computer networks, which include equipment and
software from different suppliers, has forced OLTP into the wider market for
open systems. US market researchers at the Gartner Group expects this sector
is set to grow significantly in the next three years. It says that the total
market for mid-range transaction processing was worth Dollars 190m in 1992.
But by 1995, Gartner Group says it will be worth Dollars 3bn worldwide. It
goes on to say that this new market will be dominated by two OLTP software
products. Unix System Laboratories, Tuxedo and IBM's CICS/6000 are expected
to take over 50 per cent of the market between them.
CICS is, perhaps, IBM most successful software product with over 33,000
sites worldwide. It was originally developed for IBM's System/370 mainframes
over 25 years ago and has become the established market leader.
In September 1992, IBM announced a new, open version of CICS under the name
CICS/6000. This new version not only runs on IBM's RS/6000 Unix computers,
it is also being made available to other computer manufacturers - Hewlett
Packard being the first to take a licence.
Computer suppliers see OLTP as an important open systems' software
technology. Many companies rely on OLTP as the base for operational systems
such as accounting and customer-service support. Open systems must,
therefore, be able to cope with OLTP if they are to continue to grow and, in
the last two years, the standards infrastructure has grown to include the
mechanisms to make this possible.
The IBM-backed Open Software Foundation (OSF), for example, has published a
standard for distributed computing which covers this. It includes a
technique called the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) which can pass the complex
messages through a network, regardless of the operating environment or
computer hardware. IBM's new version of CICS uses the RPC to allow it to
work across different systems. Meanwhile Unix International, a rival faction
in the open systems market, has put its weight behind an alternative
transaction-processing system called Tuxedo. Although Tuxedo and IBM's CICS
look set to compete with each other in the market for open transaction
processing systems, they could end up co-operating. Tuxedo is able to work
with CICS systems already and IBM has announced that a version of Tuxedo
will be available for its mainframe computers - running with its AIX/Unix -
later this year. Unix International also supports many of the OSF standards
and there are strong pressures for the two standards to come together.
The International Standards Organisation (ISO) and the X/Open Group are also
working on a set of standards for open OLTP. These include the XA interface,
a standard which enables OLTP products from different manufacturers to
'talk' to each other. This means that a CICS system and a Tuxedo system can
co-exist on a network and exchange transactions.
The rush to provide OLTP software is not only restricted to traditional
suppliers like IBM, however. Database software suppliers, such as Oracle,
Informix and Sybase, have also identified OLTP as an important growth area.
They have added OLTP features to their database management software products
in the last few years - partly to expand their market, but also to meet a
growing demand for lower-cost OLTP systems.
NEW WAVE OF HARDWARE
Database software suppliers have also worked closely with a new wave of
computer hardware manufacturers to provide an alternative to the traditional
mainframe hardware platforms.
Companies like Sequent and Solbourne have built powerful computers by
plugging many small processors together. These systems rival the performance
of traditional mainframe systems and, when used with the new OLTP/database
software products described above, can support OLTP applications at much
lower cost.
OLTP is likely to become increasingly important in the context of office
systems and 'workgroup' computing, too. OLTP offers tried-and-tested
mechanisms which can ensure that important messages get from one part of a
network to another.
While this might not be especially important in simple electronic mail
systems, it becomes very important in the new breed of groupware
applications now beginning to surface. These applications need the type of
mechanisms offered by current OLTP software to ensure data integrity and
access security.
Groupware packages like Lotus Notes and FCMC's Staffware are being used to
automate work procedures such as loan approvals and sales calls. If they are
to be effective, they will need the same checks and controls used in
traditional OLTP applications.
OLTP software is the invisible 'glue' in modern information technology
systems and will become increasingly important as more and more business
transaction are conducted through computer networks.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (14): Workhorse of data
processing - . . . For Mainframes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT ONE time, a computer was a computer. Then Kenneth Olsen and his
colleagues at Digital Equipment invented the minicomputer, small,
comparatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly enough to sit in a
corner of the office, and a new name had to be found for the water-cooled
monster in the data centre.
Today, the mainframe computer is still the workhorse of commercial data
processing despite the advent of the personal computer and client-server
technologies which some believe will consign large machines to the dust-bin
of computer history.
Certainly the omens have not been good. The dwindling band of mainframe
manufacturers is in financial trouble because of a combination of
price-cutting - International Business Machines, for example, no longer
publishes mainframe list prices - and a trend among customers to networks of
personal computers and network servers which seem to offer better value for
money.
Mainframes are now made by only a handful of manufacturers. IBM, Unisys,
AT&amp;T through its NCR subsidiary, Control Data of the US, ICL of the UK,
Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, and NEC of Japan build machines of their own
design. Amdahl of the US, together with Fujitsu and Hitachi of Japan, are
'plug compatible manufacturers' (pcms) building mainframes that are
functionally identical to IBM's and able to run the same operating software.
While the financial problems mainframe makers face are real enough, the
notion that customers are turning away in droves from mainframes is an
illusion. There are many corporate data processing jobs which can only be
carried out efficiently by a machine with the power and flexibility of a
mainframe.
The essential historical difference between a mainframe and smaller computer
systems is the way information travels around the system. Mainframe
computers have channels, high speed data paths controlled by microprocessors
which move information to and away from the central processing unit at high
speed.
Minicomputers, on the other hand, typically use a 'bus', a single
information channel. Different kinds of information are separated on the bus
by elaborate timing mechanisms.
Now with the development of powerful microcomputers, the dividing line is
becoming blurred.
Some manufacturers, NCR, for example, are committed to building their entire
product line from personal computer to mainframe from combinations of
microprocessors.
Today, there is great interest in 'downsizing,' in moving from seemingly
expensive mainframes to networks of personal computers and servers, larger
machines which manage databases or carry out intensive computation.
SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS
Such client-server systems seem to offer substantial economies, and in many
cases real savings can be made. Many application were run on mainframes only
because there were no alternatives and these translate easily to smaller
machines.
The decision to downsize from a mainframe is complex, however.
First, because some computing tasks - managing an airline reservation system
involving 3000 terminals, for example, can only be handled by a mainframe
with high speed channels.
Second, because the cost of supporting a client-server systems can be
substantially greater than for a mainframe.
Xephon, a UK-based consultancy, has estimated the cost of mainframe
computing over five years for a defined system configuration as between
Pounds 5,282 and Pounds 5,973 per user.
For a proprietary midrange system the cost rises to between Pounds 7,306 and
Pounds 7,786, for Unix systems Pounds 7,180 to Pounds 7,740 and for
networked personal computers, Pounds 9,400 to Pounds 15,500.
You can argue about the assumptions Xephon made, but its conclusion seems
clear: 'Far from being obsolete, mainframes currently offer the most
cost-effective computing facilities for all but the smallest organisations -
and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.'
It is unlikely, however, that the value of the market for mainframe
computers will grow in the future. The demand for raw computing power will
certainly grow - at 40 per cent or more a year in some cases - but that will
be satisfied at the same or lower cost by improved technology and falling
prices.
CHANGING ROLE
The role of the mainframe is also likely to change. IBM , for example, which
has seen its profitability hurt by declining mainframe sales, is arguing
that the mainframe is the natural server in a client-server network,
offering network management, security and data integrity.
A second change is the emergence of open operating systems on mainframes.
Customers, in the past, had little option but to stay with their mainframe
supplier because of their investment in applications software designed to
run on a particular operating system - IBM's MVS, for example, or ICL's VME.
Particular operating systems were noted for particular qualities. Groupe
Bull's GCOS system, for example, is recognised for the quality of its
communications.
IBM already offers a Unix-like operating system, AIX on its mainframes. This
year it announced an open version of MVS in a move to make it easier to
accept a mainframe in a client-server network.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (15): Marriage with complicated
problems - . . . For Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS impossible to think of computers in modern business without also
thinking about networks. The marriage of computers and telecommunications is
at the very heart of information technology and networks are the
'circulatory' system which provides the mechanisms for moving data and
messages from one computer to another.
There is, however, a fundamental problem. Networks are becoming increasingly
complex and need advanced software to control and manage them.
The increased complexity is the result of broader scope of modern
networking. Many different types of computer are being connected to networks
to provide the power for new applications.
In addition, the trend towards comprehensive digital networks - integrated
services digital networks (ISDN), for example - means that modern networks
must be capable of handling lots of different types of data simultaneously.
The promise of innovative applications like video-conferencing, multimedia
communications and workgroup computing will only come to fruition on the
back of more complex communications networks. But this places greater
demands on networking technology and makes it more difficult to manage and
control.
A survey of European businesses published last November by the networking
specialist 3Com noted that companies had 'serious reservations about the
value for money offered by their existing network investment.'
At the same time, nearly half of those surveyed recognised that they would
have continue expanding their networks to support the growth of their
businesses.
They cited a number of reasons for expansion, including: video-conferencing
to save money on business travel; electronic mail to improve internal
communications; and electronic data interchange (EDI).
Management of network growth is seen as a big problem. About three-quarters
of the network managers that 3Com surveyed said they expected problems in
expanding networks - especially in finding compatible services across
Europe.
ADVANCED APPLICATIONS
The increased use of networks for more advanced applications also poses a
significant operational management problem. Increasingly networks include
many different technologies and operating environments - each with its own
priorities and ways of working.
Monitoring network configuration and performance in this environment is a
nightmare. It embraces issues such as security of access, integrity of
shared data resources, disaster recovery and maintenance of systems response
times.
Most leading computer manufacturers have evolved products to control
networks which include both their own products and those of other leading
vendors. IBM's Netview and Hewlett Packard's Open view are examples.
Broader industry standards for network management have also begun to emerge.
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is one of the most prevalent.
SNMP is closely linked to the Unix open systems movement and a networking
protocol called TCP/IP. The TCP/IP protocol provides a language for systems
to 'talk' to each other and SNMP sits on top of it. If a fault occurs or
someone attempts to access the network without authority, the SNMP
mechanisms inform the central network manager software.
The International Standards Organisation (ISO) has devised a similar
standard called Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP). This is not
as popular as SNMP - although it has some advantages where communications
between different networks are needed.
Other efforts aimed at providing a comprehensive approach to network
management include those from the Open Software Foundation (OSF) and Unix
International. But the most comprehensive approach to enterprise-wide
network management comes from the Network Management Forum (NMF), an
industry body formed in 1988 which, unusually, includes computer users in
addition to suppliers.
NMF was formed to promote standards for network management right across the
board from standard 'voice' telephone systems to high-speed digital data
networks. It notes that standards bodies like ISO and the Consultative
Committee for International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT) are only
concerned with standards for specific types of network, whereas NMF is
looking at the whole problem. NMF has published an Open Network Manager
Architecture in an attempt to synthesize the requirements for managing
different networks into a single specification.
GAINING SUPPORT
These specifications are gaining support from the industry and many
suppliers incorporate them within their own network management products.
NMP has also published a 'roadmap' showing the path that the development of
network management standards should follow in the future. What is most
likely to emerge from these efforts is a hybrid approach which allows for
the various standards to co-operate. Only then will complex problems of
network management begin to be solved.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (13): Success of the decade -
Laser printers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDITH MASSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE research organisation Dataquest asked businesses what they look for
in laser printers, compatibility and price came out at the top of the wish
list - beating speed and print quality hands down.
Dataquest's findings paint an accurate picture of laser printer products in
the 1990s. Organisations expect laser printers to be reliable, robust and
capable of producing excellent print quality. But they are still looking for
improvements in value for money, standardisation and flexibility.
Yet the laser printer has been the success story of the decade. Market
research company Romtec says that non-impact printers (a category which
includes inkjets and lasers) will dominate the UK printer market by 1994,
growing from a 49 per cent market share in 1991 to 67 per cent in 1994.
But when laser printers were first introduced in the mid-1980s, they were
expensive and unreliable. Pioneered by market leader Hewlett Packard (HP),
lasers are now the printer of choice for organisations which need a more
flexible approach to printing than the average daisywheel and dot matrix
device can provide.
The reason for the laser's success lies in its ability to produce limitless
typefaces and fonts, as well as graphics and drawings. An impact printer
like a daisywheel is incapable of producing more than one typeface on a
single page, or of producing any figurative images at all.
The fact that most of us now use graphical applications of one kind or
another - including word processors and spreadsheets with multiple font
sizes and styles - means that we demand more from printers. There is nothing
worse than creating a beautiful graphical document on-screen, only to see it
reduced to a tedious text-only format when it is printed.
Printer manufacturers have worked hard to bring laser technology down to the
level of the desktop, so that users can have a personal laser printer
attached to their PC. But the most exciting developments in laser printing
in recent months have not come on the desktop, but on the network.
THORNY ISSUE
Network printing has always been a thorny issue for large organisations. The
management of printers has become more difficult as PC software applications
provide more flexibility, because there has never been any guarantee that a
particular printer will obey commands generated from a particular word
processor or spreadsheet.
The result for large organisations has often been chaos, with confused
network servers being brought to their knees as users attempt to print
documents in fonts not available on the device that they have chosen.
Network operating systems have added to the problem, hiding printer
management functions deep inside their software - making it difficult for
anyone but the network manager to set up printer queues from multiple users
to output devices.
Recognising the difficulties that large organisations have with network
printers, operating system vendors like Novell and Microsoft have recently
added much better printer management facilities to their software. Novell
Netware 4.0 allows users to print documents more easily to remote devices,
while the Microsoft Windows Printing System simplifies the set-up of laser
printers with application software.
Printer manufacturers have also done their bit. HP's LaserJet 4 printer and
Bi-Tronics interface, which allows bi-directional communication between
printer and host, simplify processes such as printer set-up, network
printing and fault diagnosis. Instead of simply not printing, a laser
printer can use the Bi-Tronics interface to send a message to the user,
telling them that there is no paper, or that there is a paper jam inside the
printer.
PC manufacturer Compaq is a relative newcomer to the printer market, but
deliberately designed its first Pagemarq laser printers for network
printing. Pagemarqs are built around fast reduced instruction set computing
(Risc) processors and include more memory than the average laser printer.
They can also cope with different printer control languages used by
different software packages, and switch a utomatically between different
modes.
VALUE FOR MONEY
An emerging issue in laser printing is value for money. Although the price
of laser printers has fallen steadily, the cost of running and maintaining
them does not begin and end with the purchase price. Like copiers, laser
printers need to have toner and ink cartridges replaced regularly.
Manufacturers have now begun to measure the value for money achieved by
their printers in terms of cost per page, working out average costs over a
year.
Kyocera Electronics is pioneering the idea of lower printing costs,
comparing the running costs of its new Ecosys FS-3500 network printer (0.6
pence per page) against the 1.4 pence per page average of an equivalent H-P
printer.
Kyocera is keen to sell its laser printers as 'eco-friendly' machines that
use up fewer resources, as well as cost less money to run. But it will be
cost that drives organisations to choose better value for money laser
printers in the future. Kyocera's own research found that 75 per cent of UK
organisations would only buy from an environmentally conscious supplier if
its costs were competitive. Nevertheless, there must clearly be a place in
the future for cheaper laser printing.
Companies are also looking for cheaper colour lasers, which are still too
expensive for the average user. And while the growing use of Windows and
Netware will simplify the network printing process, there are still great
strides to be made in the way that software talks to printers. The days of
the plug-and-go network printer are still some time away.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (12): Ways to reduce RSI risks -
. . . Keyboards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I DIDN'T admit that I had repetitive strain injury (RSI) until I dropped
the kettle one morning,' says technology journalist and former RSI sufferer
Dom Pancucci.
'Then I took the car out - and could not unclench my hand after driving. For
six months after that I could not use my right arm at all.'
RSI affects the hands and arms and can cause extreme pain and disablement.
Pancucci contracted it after using an electric typewriter but it is
increasingly being associated with computer keyboard use. Concern about RSI
has led a number of suppliers to produce special ergonomically-designed
keyboards, which look quite different from the standard QWERTY keyboard and
put more emphasis on the user's comfort.
They might just catch on. US-based Aetna Life and Casualty estimates that
workers' compensation claims and other expenses related to RSI, may cost US
business as much as Dollars 20bn a year. And in the UK, the National Union
of Communications believes there may be 100,000 people suffering from
various RSIs. Tim Gopsill, the National Union of Journalists' health and
safety expert, says he knows of 1,000 cases among writers who use computers.
The new keyboards attempt to minimise wrist movement when typing, reducing
stress on the neck and shoulder muscles. For example, Apple Computer's new
ergonomic keyboard (costing Pounds 195) for the Macintosh Computer includes
small pads to rest the wrists on (see picture).
ERGONOMIC MOUSE
Apple also sells an ergonomically designed 'mouse' costing Pounds 40. The
mouse does not need to be gripped tightly in the hand, but can be moved
using the fingertips. And a large button on the top lets more than one
finger do the clicking. A number of RSI cases have been linked to the use of
a mouse, so the choice of ergonomically designed mice is growing. Pamela
Schure, imaging product marketing manager at Apple UK, says the two products
reflect a basic principle of ergonomic design in that they 'adjust to the
worker, not the other way round.'
In the US, new companies are springing up to take advantage of demand for
more ergonomically designed keyboards. One of these is Kinesis of Bellevue,
Washington. Its keyboard separates the keys used by right and left hands in
to pockets at the back of the keyboard. The user must rest his/her wrists on
the front of the keyboard to use them. The company says it designed its
keyboard to take advantage of the neutral hand, wrist and shoulder postures
of the body.
However, innovation in the design of keyboards does not seem to be prompted
simply by concern for the user. Suppliers are also anxious to protect
themselves. In the US, many workers with RSI are suing keyboard and scanner
manufacturers. The defendants include computer industry giants such as IBM,
NCR and Compaq.
Manufacturers are likely to challenge these lawsuits by claiming that their
equipment wasn't used properly - that chairs weren't suitable or lighting
was poor. Or that users were under too much pressure and not given enough
breaks. They are also likely to blame the employers.
KEY QUESTIONS
Are the manufacturers simply shirking their responsibilities, or is their
more to RSI than the keyboard itself?
Jeffrey Boyling, a consultant ergonomist and qualified physiotherapist who
advises the Financial Times, says RSI cannot be blamed on a particular
design of keyboard - 'I've seen cases of RSI involving all manner of
keyboards,' he says.
There is no foolproof way of preventing RSI but the risks can definitely be
minimised. A number of factors are common to most outbreaks:
A physical/ergonomic deficiency in the workstation, or in the way the person
works at it. For example, poor posture or a keyboard position which does not
provide minimal flexing of the wrists.
Added pyscho-social stress, such as a problem with the work itself, or
between a group of workers and their boss. Other possible psycho-social
risks factors include software which is difficult to use, or the threat of
redundancy.
Andrea Caws, a consultant ergonomist at London-based System Concepts, says
because RSI tends to occur among clusters of workers (eg at the BBC in
Caversham and among a group of BT workers), the problem can't be blamed on
an individual being highly strung.
She says some, but by no means all, companies are taking ergonomic issues
seriously. However, under new Health &amp; Safety regulations covering display
screen use, employers can face legal penalties if they don't.
Caws says under the new regulations employers must:
Assess their workstations and the health and safety risks of workers using
them. They must then take steps to reduce those risks.
Adhere to at least the minimum ergonomic standards for screens (eg screens
should be flicker free), keyboards, mice, desk, chairs and the physical
environment, such as lighting.
Plan display screen work to introduce variety and breaks.
Pay for eye tests related to display screen work.
Provide information and training on how to work safely at a computer.
Applying ergonomic principles takes time and money, but the cost of dealing
with an RSI outbreak is likely to be much higher, not just in terms of
payouts to staff but also in management time. For example, the FT says it
has spent over Pounds 1.4m tackling RSI.
The costs to individuals suffering from RSI can also be high. Pancucci says:
'If you are getting pains in your hands and arms, get a medical opinion
quickly from someone with RSI experience. I nearly left it too long.'

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (11): Clever way to cut lead
times - . . . For Just-in-time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST-IN-TIME (Jit), also known as continuous flow production or kanban, is
one of a group of techniques pioneered in Japan which have become associated
with that country's reputation for quality manufacture.
It implies essentially, that parts and components are only delivered to the
production line or to the next stage in the manufacturing process when they
are needed. There is no build up of inventory or work in progress. No need
for fleets of fork-lift trucks to move materials around the factory. No
progress chasers or quality control inspectors.
There are obvious advantages; better space utilisation on the factory floor
because there is no longer a need to store components; reduced cost of
inventory and faster throughput.
Organisations that use Jit typically report lead times cut by 75 per cent,
inventory turn up 50 per cent and a 30 per cent saving in floor space.
There are less obvious advantages as well. Manufacturers in the West
frequently hold buffer stocks of components as an insurance against
stoppages on the manufacturing line. In these circumstances there is less
motivation to get to the root of the breakdown. When Jit methods are used,
production stops if there is a breakdown and every engineer available is
pressed into service to fix the problem. Product defects can be cut by up to
50 per cent as quality problems are relayed quickly back to operators.
COMMUNICATIONS
The essence of Jit is communication, but it does not need computer
technology to work well. Indeed, in Japan an entirely manual set of
procedures, which depend on a close and mutually beneficial relationship
between supplier and manufacturer, is often the norm. Only now are some of
the leading Japanese manufacturers beginning to use computers to manage
throughput.
There are good reasons for this; the output from Japanese factories tends to
be more predictable than in a Western factory and suppliers to Japanese car
manufacturers, for example, are often clustered geographically around the
plant.
It is easy but wrong to think of Jit as an inventory control system. It
represents a whole manufacturing philosophy which makes manufacturing
problems visible in a number of ways - by encouraging simpler factory
layouts, for example, and by removing the slack in the system.
The success that Japanese companies have achieved with Jit, a simple
technique which requires little in the way of computer backup, speaks
volumes about the difference between Japanese and Western manufacturing
methods.
The Western approach to date could best be described as big bucks, big bang.
Western manufacturers exhibit a kind of machismo which encourages them to
build elaborate, expensive computer-integrated manufacturing systems which
run high risks of working poorly or not at all.
A conventional Western approach is to use Material Resource Planning
(MRPII), a generic name for software running on mainframe computers used to
control manufacturing processes. It comprises a master production schedule,
based on orders and forecasts, a bill of materials, inventory records and
process plans. Up to 20 software modules may be involved. MRP II systems are
dependent on the quality of input and inaccurate master plans, inventory
records and lead times can be the result of poor data. Furthermore as a
system, it does nothing to measure, manage or improve quality.
The Japanese approach, on the other hand, emphasises total quality control
where responsibility for preventing faults lies with the line worker and
where defects can be measured in parts per million rather than the
percentages typical of Western manufacture.
Manufacturing experts, however, are now beginning to understand that Jit and
MRP can be complementary. MRP is a complicated, planning system which works
less than well when presented with inadequate information. Jit is a simple
and effective control mechanisms at its best in repetitive, high volume
manufacture, and not well suited to complex planning situations.
Combined together it is possible to create systems flexible enough to handle
medium or low volume production of a variety of different kinds of products.
The overall aim of any manufacturing method like Jit is quality; that means
aiming for zero defects in manufactured products. It starts from an
understanding that defects are caused by management deficiencies rather than
technological problems and therefore requires management commitment to
change.
Starting from the top, it is possible to instil a company-wide awareness of
quality through employee ownership of the manufacturing process. Jit or
kanban should not be used without due consideration of other quality
processes pioneered or developed in Japan. These include kaisen or
continuous improvement and poka-yoke or idiot-proofing - the idea of
designing into a product measures which makes it difficult or impossible to
use it wrongly.
A computer operating system that allows a user to delete most of its
important commands in error has not been designed according to poka-yoke
principles.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (10): Working across the network
 -. . . Interoperability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE buzzword 'interoperability' is a necessary compromise. It is the
computer industry's solution to the problem of making different computer
technologies work together in a network.
Interoperability should not be confused with 'open' systems. Although both
ideas make use of some of the same technology standards and concepts, they
are different.
When a manufacturer says its systems can 'interoperate' with other systems,
it means that they can exchange data and instructions with other systems
over a network.
By contrast, open systems work to a common specification.
The computer industry thrives on diversity. But this has inevitably led to
conflicts between different strands of technological development.
The history of industry in general is full of conflicts which arose from
different technologies, each competing to achieve the same thing. Usually
such conflicts are resolved as one technology emerges as the dominant and
the rest, either disappear or are consigned to specialist status.
The gauge of railway track, film formats and the VHS video format are
examples.
Any requirement for competing technologies to 'interoperate' disappears  -
because there is only one which is significant. VHS video recorders had no
need to include a feature to play Betamax tapes - because no one bothered to
use them any more.
Computers, however, are different. Even after forty years of use in
business, there is still a proliferation of different computer designs and
no sign of a single, dominant technology emerging.
There is, of course, nothing wrong with this. It allows manufacturers to
pursue their own ideas and innovate without the constraints imposed by
existing hardware and software technologies. Indeed, it allows them to
explore new ways to use computers and acts as a stimulus to progress.
Some technologies have, of course, seen off their rivals and created a
'localised' uniformity. The MS/DOS personal computer and the IBM mainframe
are two obvious examples. Each has created an industry in its own right and
dominates it. But each sector of computing keeps its own idiosyncrasies and
speaks different languages - making it necessary for them to 'interoperate.'
This poses a significant problem with today's computer networks. Customers
now demand systems which combine all of their information resources -
regardless of the technology they use. They want to plug personal computers,
minicomputers and mainframes together and have them work in harmony.
So-called 'open' systems - where the basic computer platform is fixed by
agreed standards - are one possible solution. Manufacturers can still pursue
their own innovations at the technology level, but open systems standards
let them present the same 'face' to the rest of the world. Their computers
run the same operating software and application s as everyone else's.
Open systems are, at best, a long-term solution. They are fine for new
applications and there are many 'open' systems products now available which
conform, more or less, to the accepted standards.
But computer systems based on 'proprietary' designs, are still needed to
support current applications - now often referred to, almost nostalgically,
as 'legacy' systems.
In the 1990s, however, these systems must be aware of the wider world of the
network. No computer can afford to be an island and must, at least, be able
to work with others.
DIFFERENT APPROACHES
Computer manufacturers have adopted a number of different approaches to make
their proprietary systems interoperate with others.
Some suppliers, like DEC and Hewlett Packard, have pushed their systems
increasingly towards the 'open systems' camp by changing their operating
software to conform more closely to the standards. Others - such as IBM and
Apple - have accommodated other systems within their own proprietary
designs. Apple's Macintosh, can for example, exchange data files with MS/DOS
personal computers and send standard SQL database calls across a network to
get data from a mainframe.
IBM's 'interoperability' strategy is, for historical reasons, more
ambitious. Not only did it need to provide interoperability with other
manufacturers' systems, it also had to bring together several different
proprietary designs of its own.
In 1987, IBM announced its System Applications Architecture (SAA), a master
plan to bring together its personal computers, its AS/400 minicomputers and
its System/370 mainframes.
In the last six years, IBM has extended the specifications of SAA to include
many open and de facto industry standards to let its systems interoperate
with others.
The purpose of interoperability is well-defined in IBM's SAA. It specifies
the operational characteristics, the user interface and the way each
component communicates with others.
This communication goes beyond the exchange of data between systems. True
interoperability must include mechanisms to start programs in other
computers. A Postscript program, sent across the network to a laser printer,
is a simple example. The wordprocessor program calls up a special program
called a 'driver' which generates the Postscript instructions for the
printer.
In more complex systems, interoperability might extend to the exchange of
online transactions (see O for OLTP) across applications.
Great progress has been made by manufacturers to provide interoperation
features in their products and there is no doubt that the idea will continue
to gain ground as more and more computers are connected to networks.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (9): A dream becomes a reality -
. . . Hand-held PCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER SINCE the personal computer first appeared, the technology has held out
the prospect of eventually making the hardware small enough to hold a
complete system in your hand. This year, that dream looks like eventually
becoming a reality.
There are those that would argue that such machines have been around for
some time, with the UK company, Psion, being amongst the market leaders.
Small note-keeping, diary managing products have had their drawbacks,
however. They have had limited functionality, often complicated connectivity
to other systems such as desktop PCs and, most important of all perhaps, the
restrictions of a small keyboard.
The technology has moved on, however, and it is now possible to move away
from the keyboard as the prime input device and on to the next goal: direct,
on-screen, handwritten input and the use of icons to control system
functions.
This is much more a direct copy of the way people normally work with, say, a
paper-based personal organiser, and as such is the first time that systems
can be small enough and functionally rich enough to contemplate their use as
a direct replacement for them. Already generally referred to by the name
first used by Apple - Personal Digital Assistants, or PDAs - the early
examples made their initial appearance last year.
Apple's PDA, called Newton, was demonstrated as a marketing exercise rather
than a real product, but though the company has shown it several times at
various events, a saleable version has not yet appeared.
Others, particularly Japanese companies such as Sharp and Kyocera, have also
announced varying degrees commitment to the new PDA marketplace, though
little has yet appeared.
The latest, most aggressive and possibly first attack on the market with a
real product available in volume comes from Amstrad. The company claims it
will have its PDA600 PenPad in the shops by May, and at a price of Pounds
299, including VAT, it is certainly aggressively placed to attack a
currently over-hyped but largely non-existent competition.
The features of the PenPad are broadly representative of what most suppliers
are planning. Small size and low weight are, of course, de rigueur. At 400
gms it is claimed to be lighter and smaller than most loose-leaf organisers.
The key feature is the ability to input instructions and information by
writing directly onto the screen with a special stylus. Amstrad claims that,
once the machine has learned to read a user's handwriting, information
entered in this way can be converted into machine-readable text.
If the information is not textual, for example a hand-drawn sketch, this can
be stored 'as is.' Accessing the particular function needed, such as the
Diary or Address Book, is achieved by 'pressing' the appropriate icon on the
display with the stylus. The Pen Pad is said to be able to store a maximum
of 5,000 'pages' of information when the memory is expanded to its upper
limits.
There are, obviously, limitations with such systems, and handwriting is one.
The Pen Pad, for example, can recognise both upper and lower case letters,
but it cannot yet work with 'joined up' writing. Each character has to be
entered to a separate box, just as found on many paper forms, and will
undoubtedly take some getting used to.
The upside of this is that, once captured, the information stays far more
legible than a long-forgotten handwritten note may do. Connectivity,
particularly to a desktop PC, is another key capability which all the
competitors must address.
According to Amstrad, software is coming to allow communications between
them, in both directions. There is also said to be a range of additional
applications coming, such as word processing, spreadsheet and reference
guides.
These will be sold on the credit card-sized PCMCIA cards already broadly
accepted as the standard vehicle for loading applications, expanding
available memory and adding additional functions such as modem-based
communications. The idea is that the user plugs in the appropriate card to
gain the new functionality required.
Though some cards, such as memory and function cards, may be useable across
all types of PDA that utilise the PCMCIA interface standard, applications
cards will probably be geared to use with a particular type of machine. This
could be a problem for applications developers, for the market potential for
PDAs is estimated to be huge.
AT&amp;T, for example, predicts that some a billion units will have been sold by
the turn of the century. The company has two direct interests in this
market. The first is its new Hobbit processor chip family, specifically
developed to be at the heart of other suppliers' PDA offerings; even a 1 per
cent share of this would mean sales of 10m processors over the next seven
years.
The second and most important interest, however, is that AT&amp;T sees PDAs
being the vehicle for a far wider range of services than storing personally
generated personal information. Communications through cellular telephone
networks, for example, would bring the user direct access to wide-ranging
information sources. The users would not just make a note to book an airline
ticket, they would access a worldwide communication and information service
such as CompuServe and make the reservation direct. They could then dial-up
an information service such as Reuters, and gain direct access to stock
market prices that need to be processed in the spreadsheet. The results
could integrated into a report which is then faxed to the individual the
user is planning to visit.
That is the goal: all that functionality in a handheld, personal system.
That level of functionality is still some way off, but the basis of such a
machine, the Model T version of it, is now starting to appear.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (7): How to keep the system
running - . . . Fault-tolerance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE principle of fault-tolerant computing is blissfully simple. The machine
has a doubled-up architecture with a spare processor ready to leap into
action the moment the prime processor fails.
Fault-tolerant machines will keep on running through power-cuts, courtesy of
their own dedicated electricity supply. Financial institutions have made
fault-tolerance a standard criteria for critical mid-range computer
applications.
Two suppliers, Stratus and Tandem, dominate the market. IBM sells Stratus
equipment into the financial sector under the System 88 badge. Installing
these boxes guarantees continuous running of hardware. But as computer
operations have become critical to the financial field so the definition of
fault-tolerance has extended into software, networking and the IT
department's physical location.
Most fault-tolerant applications are in the financial field. This is partly
due to the demands of a market impatient for business and unable to afford
interruptions. It is also a reminder that fault-tolerant systems cost a good
deal more than conventional computers.
Henderson Crosthwaite is a private stockbroking firm with 40,000 clients.
Its five regional offices are interconnected via a computer network based on
a fault-tolerant policy that the company refers to as business continuity.
A large Unisys A-series computer in London provides the engine for Henderson
Crosthwaite's share-dealing. The software that logs these transactions is a
Unisys Remote Database (RDB). This does more than handle the London-end of
the business. It constantly updates a smaller A-series processor at the
firm's Worcester office. If the main computer in London is out of operation
for any reason, Henderson Crosthwaite will still be providing a service for
its clients - 'RDB is a mirrored database, Worcester monitors and tracks all
the deals and all our offices are party to that capability via the network,'
says Peter Firth, a consultant at Henderson Crosthwaite. He admits that the
smaller processor at Worcester would offer a slower service, but at least
the company would still be in business.
This fail-safe approach is not cheap, the extra processor at Worcester will
cost the company over Pounds 300,000. The applications come on top of that,
and RDB is being installed as part of a much larger programme including
hardware that will total Pounds 2.5m. But stockbroking clients do not expect
to lose money because of a systems failure.
The share-dealing business demands a far-sighted approach to technology.
Computer networks are the main arteries of the City of London. Business
transactions are utterly dependent on a steady flow of orders and
confirmations. But the data lines are vulnerable to a variety of potential
faults.
City Networks supplies wide-area networking systems, including hardware and
specialist software, that allow moneybrokers to communicate with banks. The
company claims that its products process 95 per cent of the broker
confirmations in the City.
To achieve that degree of market acceptance, City Networks must offer a
product that is seen to be totally reliable. Neil Coles, business manager at
City Networks, explains that the BT X25 lines used to transmit parcels of
computer data have an excellent track record.
BT provides its own automatic re-routing facility in the event of a
technical glitch. But this doesn't excuse him from contemplating everything
that might go wrong - 'if the line develops a fault, our messages will queue
up. So the data is preserved. We make sure there are multiple routes for the
data, so if one local BT station goes down, the message is switched via
another one. At a larger level, we're looking at alternative distribution
mechanisms.'
City Networks will shortly introduce a fall-back data service using
telephone connection in the event of the client being unable to work from
his normal site. It is a measure of last resort, but Mr Coles has no
intention of being caught out.
NOT SO CHEAP
As with fault-tolerant hardware, such a degree of back-up does not come
cheap. To use the company's Auto-Confs system costs Pounds 6,500 plus Pounds
3,500 for annual rental and support. That money represents an indispensable
insurance. And the users are spared the costs associated with dedicated
fault-tolerant processors.
City Networks configures its systems around PCs, distributing the
information through th ese comparatively cheap terminals. A PC network can
be set up to reconfigure if one box fails, offering a high degree of
resilience.
The most dramatic aspect of fault-tolerance is provided by specialist
companies offering an emergency location for computing operations. It is
also the most expensive. AST Trans-Act opened a business recovery facility
in central London in November last year.
Since then, five City of London institutions have signed up to use its
stand-by computing facility in the event of a widescale disaster. Clearly
spurred on by the devastating terrorist bomb at St Mary Axe, they will spend
a total of Pounds 3.5m on the service over the next five years.
AST's plans allow space for just one more customer. AST offers a
180-position dealing room available 24 hours a day. Financial workstations
sit in an eerily empty room. The installation is fortified against blast and
its permanent staff take security very seriously.
AST insists that its City clients are all 800 metres apart. The distances
represent double the distance used by police to cordon off a suspect bomb.
Companies signing up with AST store copies of their software and updates of
transactions in a secure vault at the site. The idea is to cope with the
worst possible scenario.
The devastating blast at the World Trade Center in New York, earlier this
year, served to reinforce the message that fault-tolerance is no longer a
luxury. AST is already planning to spend Pounds 1m on a second facility. In
all its aspects, fault-tolerance is here to stay.
The price may be high, but if an institution relies on computer data it
cannot afford to ignore the issue.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (8): Teamwork via a PC network -
. . . For Groupware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPWARE means a combination of computer hardware and software that makes
it possible for a number of individuals to work as a team using a network of
personal computers.
Put like that, it seems too obvious and basic a concept to need much
elaboration. It is common experience that business people tend to work
together, sharing a variety of different kinds of information, rather than
in isolation. Information networks should ideally provide the underpinning
to automate the way people work. The public telephone system, for example,
has provided businesses with effective, if limited, groupware for more than
a century.
Networked computer systems obviously offer the potential to share a great
deal more than conversations; today's computer software and services,
however, are principally aimed at individual users and their requirements -
spreadsheets, for example, or databases. Groupware, on the other hand,
introduces a new dimension; computer tools designed specifically for groups.
Why is there a need for this new product? Personal computers can be
connected together easily enough using a range of technologies, but that
does not mean they will function as a group network. In addition to basic
network management and communications software, there is a need for special
applications software that will manage interactions between the various
members of the group. Such software, for example, might manage the
production of a document by the group, keeping track of the various versions
and monitoring changes and amendments.
Acceptance of groupware has been comparatively slow despite the number of
suppliers who are marketing or developing groupware products. The list
includes Lotus, Microsoft, Siemens Nixdorf, Wordperfect, Corporate Software,
ICL, SunSolutions, Digital Equipment, Verimation and ESP.
In a simple way, groupware can be thought of as electronic mail with bells
and whistles; all sorts of information can be shared across the network and
workflow procedures automated.
The introduction of something as simple as electronic mail, however, can
produce significant cultural shock within an organisation; the management
implications of the insensitive introduction of groupware may go some way to
explaining its slow take-off.
The system will, after all, embody some of the beliefs and attitudes of its
creators. Experts point out that it is possible to design groupware systems
which operate in a manipulative fashion, directing their users towards
particular actions and conclusions.
Many companies including Ford, Unilever and Citicorp are beginning, on the
other hand, to report significant productivity increases through using
groupware.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, for example, the accounting firm and management
consultancy, started to use one of the best known groupware products, Lotus
Notes, in 1991.
The aim was to let groups of accountants share financial information, advice
and analyses. About 500 of the company's auditors are using Notes now and
the intention is that 2000 will use it by next year. Already the company is
finding novel uses for Notes such as distributing tax-law changes to
clients.
EARLY RESEARCH
The origins of groupware go back to the 1960s when Douglas Engelbart, a
seminal figure in office automation, created a laboratory at the Standford
Research Institute to explore the use of computers to support human
intellect. Credited with inventing the 'mouse' pointer, Engelbart was a
pioneer of computer-supported teams; among the concepts he worked on were
teleconferencing, group programming, group databases and multimedia
communications. All these ideas are now appearing in groupware products and
services.
Like many early ideas in office automation, groupware was held back by lack
of adequate hardware at economic prices The difference today is that
buildings are wired for networking and low cost, powerful workstations
capable of handling text, video and graphics are available.
At the same time there has been a change in ways of doing business. Business
teams have become fashionable; the trend has been driven by industry
deregulation, declining numbers of middle manager as corporate structures
flatten, a trend towards contract work and mergers and acquisitions.
Business teams and task forces are approach to planning for an uncertain and
rapidly changing world.
The market for groupware therefore seems set to grow at a significantly
higher rate than hitherto: one reason is the steady acceptance of common
technical standards. Lotus, for example, is anxious to establish Notes as
the technical standard in groupware rather like Microsoft's MS/DOS and
Windows operating systems. They are encouraging software developers to
incorporate Notes in their products.
Another factor is likely to be the incorporation of 'softer' software in
groupware. Softer software is easier to use than today's software products
because it incorporates elements of artificial intelligence. Among the
developments that could be expected are 'agents' - computer programs able to
operate on behalf of human users, searching through databases for
information, for example, or able to learn the characteristics and
preferences of human operators. Elements of these kinds of softer software
are already appearing in groupware today.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (6): More help for decision
makers - . . . For EIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE acronym EIS stands for executive information systems
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or at least, it did once, since it keeps changing. The term is now commonly
interpreted as Enterprise Intelligence Service or Everybody's Information
System, embracing wider managerial applications such as budgeting, planning
and reporting.
The original idea of an EIS was that top-level directors need a periscope on
the rest of the world as well as a magnifying glass on internal data. The
assumption is that the higher the executive, the more of a klutz (ie more
incompetent) he, or less likely she, is supposed to be when seated at a
computer keyboard. These IT dunces, however, are expected to know more about
the entire company than anyone else.
An EIS therefore has to take information from all available sources inside
(and outside) the company, distill it, and deliver it in such a way that
will woo the least IT-confident people in the building. The detail must not
be blurred: the user must be able to investigate and 'drill down' to the
component data to examine what lies behind the pretty graphs.
It is this easy-to-use 'handle' on the information that distinguished the
EIS from the long-established MIS (Management Information Systems) and DSS,
Decision Support Systems. Another characteristic supposed to distinguish the
genuine EIS from other systems is that it links not only with all internal
data sources, (accounting, sales processing, and so on) but with external
data sources, such as online database for share prices.
EIS systems have been around for more than a decade, but have changed, as
the latest shift in emphasis suggests, according to the prevailing view of
executive needs. Comshare used to be known for modelling and forecasting
software: now its Commander system claims to be the leading EIS with more
than 40,000 users worldwide, many moving off the mainframe to the PC.
However, a recent survey by EIS software house Cognos found that 70 per cent
of companies interviewed do not currently use EIS, but 55 per cent believed
they might help solve poor management and communication.
Top executives have always had to make far-reaching decisions and hold the
'big picture' of their companies in their heads. In the past they relied on
people, not computers, for information.
Here lies the real expense of installing EIS, not in the computer hardware
or software, but in the analysis of what information is needed, a job often
done better by outsiders. Rod Newing, freelance EIS specialist, points out
that many top managers dislike discussing business strategy with internal IT
professionals.
'The point about EIS is that it should enable managers to do things with
information they couldn't do before. A hefty document specifying
requirements is a waste of time because the user doesn't know them. The
important thing is to set up a prototype and get people to use it.'
The evolution of requirements necessarily demands time from the top people
who are to use the system. It can be radical in that it often challenges the
established order of things. Who communicates with whom, and about what,
defines the structure of organisations, and it is this reporting process
that is taken apart and rebuilt.
'The process is valuable in that it challenges assumptions - that can be of
great value,' says Jon Morgan of Executive Information Solutions. 'The
resulting EIS can be used to reinforce the new way of working.'
Companies with EIS projects are often coy about revealing costs, which are
often high at the start of the cycle, and hard to evaluate when the system
is running. Chase Manhattan's Global Security Services sector has built an
EIS using Comshare's Commander, called Managing Service Performance. David
Da Costa, second vice-president within GSS operations at Chase Manhattan,
says: 'EIS allows us to manage our service pro-actively and in partnership
with our clients through the use of service and quality indicators, fed
directly by our production systems. Its value to us is that it ensures we
provide a premier service to our clients and differentiates us from our
competitors.'
VIEWPOINTS
Another Commander user, British Steel, has discovered that top executives
use the system less than expected, and prefer to dip into the database
rather than use the ready-made screen displays.
'The costs exceed the benefits as far as top executives are concerned, but
the next layer down, the middle managers, find it invaluable,' says Richard
Hewitt, manager of management accounts.
There are many well-established EIS suppliers such as Acuity, Comshare,
information Resources, Holistic Systems, Pilot and many others. The
Softworld exhibition of EIS and Decison Support systems in October 1992
attracted nearly 30 suppliers, and in four years the show has mushroomed.
Yet Cognos' survey revealed that a large proportion of companies, 51 per
cent, use their own DP departments to create EIS systems, and around 80 per
cent, wrote and implemented their own systems - 'there is a lot of education
to be done in this field, with companies having limited knowledge about the
technology, how much it costs, and what business benefits it can bring,'
comments Paul Hart, Cognos' UK marketing manager. 'It leaves the EIS market
wide open.'
Malcolm Harding, marketing director of Holos, sees the market as wider than
just the top people - 'it's a technology, rather than a marketplace,' he
says. Holos is now designed for the middle managers, accountants and others,
not just a few people in the boardroom. For instance, there are as many as
1,200 users in British Gas.'
'There is a lot of scepticism about how important the external resources
are. Lots of people put the tick in the box, but apart from the common use
of share-price access, we only know of one Holos-user who regularly uses the
system for the retrieval of text and numeric data, both internal and
external.'

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (5): Applications for electronic
filing cabinets - . . .  For Database
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S electronic database has exactly the same problems as the
old-fashioned filing cabinet with drawers: retrieving information is never
as easy as it should be. Electronic data items do not get lost, mislaid or
mis-filed as paper items do. The main concern in the initial design of an
electronic database is the way data will be retrieved and used.
It takes the vision of a seer to predict every situation, every possible
detail which might prove of interest in the future. Even the
auspiciously-named Oracle, one of the leading database products which runs
on many different computers, can only deliver information that somebody has,
at some point, defined, collected and keyed-in. Once there, the data is
re-useable and can be shared between applications, and centrally updated.
A decade ago, buying a database was a heavyweight, long-term decision, taken
by IT experts who examined the entrails for predictions of performance by
running benchmark tests. Performance mattered because the database is often
the repository of information used in high volume transaction processing
applications. The coding of the applications was vital (and still is) to
performance, as is the organisation of data.
Users of automatic telling machines know they are sometimes slow in
response: there is probably a queue for the database as the details of the
account are accessed and delivered, using the account number as the 'key' to
retrieval. Relational databases allow any item or combination of items, (eg
name, age) to be used as a key.
MARKET LEADERS
Heavyweight database products, at the top end of the market, still account
for large chunks of the IT budget. They include IBM's stalwart of
transaction processing: the long-lived IMS, and its relational heir, DB/2,
as well as mainframe versions of Oracle, Software AG's and Computer
Associates' Datacom, and Cincom's Supra, successor to the phenomenally
successful Total, which dominated the database market in the 1970s. By the
early 1980s, minicomputer users had already discovered flexibility of
inbuilt databases such as in Pick systems and IBM's System 38, now AS400.
Then came PCs, and the boom in database applications under 'standard' PC-DOS
and later Unix operating systems.
Determining market penetration is less easy than it used to be, because of
the variety of hardware hosts in use. A few databases now run on a broad
range of computers, but the deciding factor in the 1990s is less likely to
be the computer host, performance, or even the development tools and data
access facilities available (see Q for Query languages).
The real selling point is more likely to be a specific application, and the
decision maker may not be an IT expert at all. In fact, a departmental
manager is now likely to buy a database by default, as part of an
application. This accounts for the rise of the value-added reseller (VAR) as
an important part of the sales chain, in many cases taking over the role
once fulfilled by the consultant.
Database vendors use 'runtime' licences for such situations. The end-user of
the application receives an abbreviated version of the database, rather than
the entire set of development tools.
Users are still able to use query languages for ad-hoc reports, though in
many cases they hardly know which database underpins their system.
Relational databases, built for ready retrieval of data, made it easier to
produce applications that could be closely tailored.
Many database vendors, particularly in the competitive mid-range Unix
market, now produce heavy tomes listing the various ready-made applications
available, ranging from specialised pig-breeding packages to everyday
accounting or marketing systems.
Informix, Ingres, Oracle and Progress are among the database vendors who
have built up a strong third-party 'stable' of VARs. Their directories serve
users, VARs, and ultimately their own ends, because once users have acquired
their primary application, they usually look for others from the same
database stable.
MORE THAN 120 PRODUCTS
The Progress Applications Catalogue lists over 120 products, claiming
100,000 applications licences. Informix's Solutions Guide lists hundreds of
applications, in 30 categories, one of which, accounting, offers 50 options.
Oracle estimates 350 applications from 130 VARs, who may hold multiple
development licences because of the various hardware platforms: one medical
specialist sells as many as 200 runtime licences a year.
Unlike many vendors of mainframe products on annual licences, PC and Unix
database vendors rarely know all their users. Oracle is launching a campaign
to locate all users, authorised or not. Tony Lacy-Thompson, senior product
manager at Informix, admits it is sometimes a problem to know who all
Informix end-users are, partly because work with OEMs, distributors and VARs
has been so successful: there are around 400 Informix VARs in the UK and
2,000 worldwide - 'runtime licences probably account for about 70 per cent
of the total licences, around half a million worldwide,' he says.
Traditionally, the only way to do it has been to include a registration
card, but they only have 2,000 names that way - 'now we've started issuing a
serial number and key. We only give out the key once people have registered,
and that gives us the opportunity to find our a lot about our users.'

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (4): Doorway for innovative
applications - . . . For Client/Server
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE client/server approach to the design of computer systems separates users
(clients) and services (servers) and allows them to be distributed across
many different computers. It is a flexible design model which not only
handles different types of computer and operating environment, but also
maintains the level of control required in traditional corporate IT systems.
Although centralised mainframe computer systems continue to dominate the
operational computing needs of medium-to-large institutions, these systems
are limited. They cannot provide graphical user interfaces (GUI) nor can
they support innovative applications such as office automation, image
processing or multimedia. These applications need special-purpose computing
power such as local support for GUIs and remote support for shared databases
and printing resources.
Advances in computer and communications technology over the last decade have
made it possible to distribute specialised computer power to where it is
most needed. The client/server design approach provides a general-purpose
framework to accommodate these advances and meets the demand for innovative
IT applications. It also provides appropriate mechanisms to compensate for
the lack of a central, controlling 'authority.'
Powerful personal workstations with advanced GUI software and local
processing give users a 'window' on to the network. These are, of course,
the 'clients.'
Specialised 'servers,' which provide services such as shared printing,
communications links, special-purpose computation facilities and database
storage, can be connected, via a netw ork, to the client workstations.
There are significant benefits which come from distributing computer power
in this way. Network traffic and communications costs can be reduced while
expensive central computers are freed to concentrate on administrative
functions such as data integrity, security and systems management.
These functions will continue to be important for corporate computer-users
and - contrary to some views - point to the survival of central mainframe
systems. But instead of their traditional role as the 'engine room' of a
whole corporate IT system, mainframes will, in future, act as special
'servers' to the network.
The lower cost and technological flexibility of client/server systems opens
the door to innovative applications which would be prohibitively expensive
or impossible with traditional centralised computing. This includes
applications such as image processing, multimedia and voice-mail. These
applications demand a different way of looking at IT systems in the light of
advances in technology which have made them possible. They use innovative
hardware and software which cannot be accommodated within traditional
centralized systems.
Client/server systems provide the enabling mechanisms for these new
applications. They define both the framework and the component
specifications to let users build flexible IT systems. The most suitable
products can be selected from a competitive, commodity market. This is
important with the growth of networks which connect computers from different
manufacturers and require that various operating environments work together.
Companies are increasingly turning to combinations of different types of
computers connected in this way - rather than relying entirely upon a
single, central computer.
This change - sometimes referred to as 'downsizing' or 'rightsizing' -
brings the advantages of flexibility and the client/server approach provides
a coherent design model to achieve it.
The changeover to client/server systems will not be easy, however. It relies
on computer manufacturers and software developers agreeing on a set of
standards so that the components fit together properly. This process is,
fortunately, now well advanced as a result of initiatives both from
suppliers and from international standards bodies, (see 'I' for
Interoperability).
STANDARDS
Most suppliers support the so-called 'open' systems standards which have
emanated from groups like the X/Open Group and the International Standards
Organisation (ISO). In addition, certain de facto industry standards such as
the Postscript printer standard are also widely accepted.
The advantage of standards such as these - within the client/server design
model - are that they let suppliers compete, while not prejudicing the
buyers freedom to choose. The standards only define how clients and servers
communicate with each other - not how the various functions are constructed.
The most advanced example of this approach is to be found in so-called
'object-oriented' systems where both the software and the hardware
components of a systems are defined as 'black boxes.' The Object Management
Group (OMG), an industry organisation which promotes standards in this area,
has defined ways for computers and software to communicate at a high level.
These standards are now widely accepted across the industry and promise to
stimulate the move to client/server systems even further.
The move to client/server systems will not be easy, however. It will stretch
the capabilities of systems builders and try the patience of end-users.
But the early evidence from applications based on the client/server model,
suggests that the effort is worth it. A report on client/server computing
from market researcher Ovum, published last year, records successes from
large user organisations as diverse as BP Canada, Hughes Aircraft and
Gillette. All pointed to the lack of development tools and inadequate
network management. But none of them found fault with the client/server
approach and all of them intend to continue to move in this direction.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (3): A measure of how data is
transmitted - . . . For Bandwidth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE thing that all new applications of computer technology have in common is
a demand for 'bandwidth.' Image processing, multimedia computing, voice-mail
and groupware applications are all examples of tasks that need a way to pass
large amounts of information back and forth very quickly.
In strict technical terms, bandwidth defines 'the difference, expressed in
hertz, between the two limiting frequencies of a band.' In practical terms,
bandwidth provides a measure of how much data can be transmitted from one
place to another in a given time.
Taking the analogy of a road transport system, bandwidth can be thought of
as the number of lanes on a motorway. If there are more lanes, then the
greater the number of vehicles which can use the road.
There are two obvious ways to increase the usable bandwidth of a
communications network. Firstly, the size of the 'pipe' which carries the
traffic can be made larger and more efficient. Secondly, the 'size' of the
data can be reduced or compressed so that more data can be carried in the
same 'pipe.' There are efforts under way to increase usable bandwidth in
both these areas.
The transition from analog to digital networks is one way to make the
communications 'pipe' bigger and better - either by using asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) technology (see 'A') or integrated services digital
networks (ISDN). In both cases, data is carried through the network entirely
in a standard digital form, thus removing the need to translate it. This
increases transmission speeds and makes networks more efficient.
VIABILITY
Digital networks have been around for some time in the form of expensive
leased lines. These have only been viable for large organisations with a
continuous demand for a connection. It is only now, with the advent of
dial-up ISDN services, that the large bandwidth offered by digital
communications has become generally available and cost-effective.
UK telecommunications carrier Mercury says that, if line usage is less than
3.2 hours a day, the cost of a dial-up ISDN service is less than the cost of
a permanent leased line.
One of the main advantages of ISDN is that the bandwidth can be varied
according to the nature of the transmission. There are several different
ISDN services now becoming available - each rated according to the number of
'lines' they provide. The basic service offers two lines. More advanced
services provide as many as 30.
But these lines are not physical lines - they are logical lines, controlled
by the software. This means that many different messages can be carried
simultaneously using a single physical wire or optical fibre. If, however,
there is a need to carry a large amount of data - say, a broadcast-quality
video signal - several lines can be allocated to the task. Returning to the
road analogy - it is like carrying a wide load down two lanes of a motorway.
The other approach to increasing the usable bandwidth of a communications
network is to 'compress' the data with special hardware and software. If the
data transmitted across a network is reduced in this way, the traffic load
is, of course, also reduced.
There are number of approaches emerging to provide data compression.
In February, Microsoft announced its strategy for data compression which
will be built in to future versions of the MS/DOS operating system. Called
the Microsoft Realtime Compression Interface (MRCI), this specification will
give software developers a general-purpose mechanism to compress data in PC
systems. Microsoft says that MRCI will reduce data storage requirements. It
will also improve data transfer speeds between computers and between a
computer and its storage devices.
At the same time, the US software develop er Software Publishing (SPC)
announced a data compression technology for image data. It uses a technique
called fractal transform to convert images from strings of pixel information
into mathematical formulae. Fractal graphics have been used to create
lifelike computer graphics for some time now. SPC claims that the storage
requirements for a full screen, 24-bit colour image can be reduced from
about a million bits to as little as 10,000 by using the technique.
The combination of faster, more efficient communications networks and clever
data-compression techniques will help to remove many of the current
bandwidth restrictions. This will provide the foundation for many new
applications of information technology - particularly those which fall under
the heading of multimedia computing.
By the end of the decade it is conceivable that a standard desktop computer
will be able to provide full colour broadcast-quality images, hi-fi sound,
high-speed international communications and instant access to a multitude of
on-line services and databases. Much of the technology to achieve this is
already in place and it is only the lack of bandwidth which is the limiting
factor. Soon, even this limitation will be overcome.

FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (2): Not so complex, really - . .
. For ATM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER

<DATELINE>
   IT SOUNDS complicated
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but the idea of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) communications technology
is essentially simple. It provides a common transport mechanism for digital
communications traffic, regardless of whether it is between computers on a
local area network (LAN) or across a public telephone network.
This is a significant breakthrough. It makes it possible to move data
between computers without the need to translate it into analogue formats.
Although LAN technology uses a digital format, most traffic carried across
wide-area telecommunications networks is still in analogue form. This means
that a modem is needed at both ends of the network to translate data between
analogue and digital form at and vice versa. In the long term, ATM
technology will make this unnecessary.
In the short term, ATM promises to boost the performance of LANs and allow
companies to be more flexible in the way they set up their networks.
According to the US market research company, CIMI, the average corporate
personal computer user changes office locations every 14 months - with
so-called 'power' users changing every seven months. This means that
companies must be able to re-organise their LAN frequently to cope with
changes in network traffic patterns.
The US manufacturer, Network Equipment Technologies (NET) says that ATM
technology makes it much easier for companies to do this. By using ATM
technology, they can set up a 'virtual' LAN which can be re-organized
quickly to cope with the changes.
Like current LAN technology, ATM uses 'packets' to carry data. But it uses a
fixed-size packet known as a 'cell.' Each cell contains only 53 bytes of
data, including five bytes used for addressing and directing data through
the network. An important advantage of ATM technology is that the cells can
be handled by hardware, which significantly increases the speed of
transmission. This is crucial when carrying voice and video signals - both
of which are, of course, time sensitive.
FASTER SYSTEMS
Existing LAN technology operates at a transmission rate of 10-16 megabits a
second - although there are faster technologies in the pipeline. Proposals
for a 'fast' Ethernet, one of the two leading LAN technologies, promises to
bring transmission speeds up to 100 megabits a second using existing
cabling.
In addition, there are moves to introduce a new standard called Fibre
Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) which also offers 100 megabits a second.
But ATM technology promises much greater transmission speeds. It starts at
155 megabits a second and has the potential to handle much higher rates up
to 2.4 gigabits. This scalability of ATM technology is one of its main
virtues and gives companies much greater flexibility in their use of LANs.
In the long term, ATM technology will also help to solve the problems
associated with moving data from one LAN to another through the public
telephone network.
The international standard for ATM communications has been agreed by all of
the world's leading telecom suppliers under the auspices of the CCITT.
Although it will be two or three years before the standard is fully
installed, equipment which conforms to it is now beginning to emerge and
opens up opportunities to improve the speed and efficiency of communications
between computers.
Large telecom suppliers - including AT&amp;T and MCI in the USA and British
Telecom in the UK - have promised to move to ATM technology for their
long-haul wide-area networks by the middle of the decade. Once in place, all
types of data can be carried from source to destination without the need for
any conversion. ATM opens the door to exciting new applications of computer
networks - especially those which involve moving large amounts of data about
such as video and audio. In the UK, for example, there are plans to upgrade
the Janet network, which links universities and research institutes, to ATM
technology. Known as SuperJanet, the new network will use ATM technology to
link 200 sites across the UK.
A pilot application to link six UK sites with ATM began in March 1993. When
it is complete, SuperJanet will be able to carry the large amounts of data
needed for applications like digital video and multimedia. One potential use
of the network will be for 'remote' medical consultancy where a team of
specialists will be able to observe and advise on an operation from
locations across the UK.
At the same time, commercial products which use ATM are beginning to emerge.
Hughes LAN Systems, a leading supplier of ATM technology demonstrated an
ATM-based digital video system at an exhibition in Washington, US, in March.
The demonstration used Hughes ATM switches to carry full-motion,
near-broadcast quality video images to five Sun SPARC Unix workstations.
Hughes says that the system can be used for applications such as video
conferencing, distributed training briefings and remote medical
consultations.
These early examples of the use of ATM communications show the exciting
possibilities of the technology.

infrastructure for information technology and the exciting new business
applications which this will allow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EVEN casual observers of the computer and communications industries cannot
have failed to have noticed that things are changing. The inexorable rise of
the MS/DOS personal computer, the growth of networked systems and the
continued advances in both computer and communications technologies has
wrought change on a grand scale in the last couple of years.
These changes promise to create a stable continuum for future information
technology (IT) systems - but they mean a radical shift in the underlying
infrastructure of information processing which is both technological and
cultural.
On the technology side, new approaches to building and designing systems
using low-cost, high-performance hardware and standard 'open' software have
turned conventional wisdom on its head. Bigger is no longer necessarily
better and traditional IT is no longer competitive.
On the cultural side, the struggle to keep the IT industry the fast-moving,
high-growth industry it has been for the last 30 years, has led to
unprecedented alliances between erstwhile market rivals.
More important, the demands of computer users for genuine cost-effective IT
systems has forced suppliers to adopt a different approach to the design of
systems. It has also forced them to co-operate like never before.
The bottom line is that the new technology infrastructure of computers and
communications opens the door to exciting new applications.
But it also means that the world becomes more complex. In place of the
relatively simple computers of yesterday, modern users are confronted with
an array of technology to help them do their job.
This year's A to Z of Computing looks at the technological innovation which
has made this possible. Advanced digital telecommunications creates greater
bandwidth to carry more, richer information - opening the door to multimedia
applications.
The wide acceptance of the client/server architectural approach to networked
systems design, coupled with software standards such as SQL for databases
and X/Windows for workstation computing, makes it possible to build systems
from multi-sourced components.
NEW approaches to the application of IT - such as groupware, just-in-time
manufacturing, computer-aided systems engineering and voice technology -
provide opportunities for companies to gain competitive edge from their IT
investment.
At the same time, the growth of complex networks of computers raises
questions such as security, fault tolerance and software piracy.
While advances in IT do much to create new opportunities, traditional
approaches still have a role to play - although they will, of course, have
to change to survive. The mainframe computer still has much to offer - as
indeed does a traditional software discipline like as transaction
management. Future IT systems will be required to 'interoperate' with each
other at all levels to satisfy the growing need for a stable continuum of
technology from a handheld computer through to a powerful mainframe.
This future is being written now and the FT's A to Z of Computing places the
implication in context for the general reader as well as the technologist.

<TEXT>
Growing confidence that the economy is reviving prompted one investment bank
to raise its already high forecasts for National Westminster Bank. The move
sent the shares up 9 at best before they were brought back with the market.
They closed 6 better at 461p on turnover of 4.9m, heavy relative to
yesterday's general trading levels.
Morgan Stanley, the US bank, raised its 1993 profits estimate by Pounds 45m
to Pounds 915m and re-emphasised its bullish stance. Banking analyst Mr Nick
Collier said: 'We had already forecast quite heavy provisions and, with the
growing sense of economic recovery and the number of new problems slowing
down, we feel the debt is going to be slightly better than anticipated.'
The improved optimism spilled over into Barclays, which is more burdened
with heavy high profile debts but also poised to benefit from economic
upturn, especially in the hard hit property area. Barclays appreciated 6 to
414p.

FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were signs that the clouds might be lifting over the food retailers as
two leading securities houses turned more positive, although the shares
remained largely unmoved in lethargic trading.
Since the new year, the sector has been worried by a combination of price
war fears, the erosion of margins and the arrival of US-style discounters.
Brokers have responded by advising investors to go underweight.
Yesterday, NatWest Securities turned positive, arguing that 'the sector is
capable of growing earnings by at least 14 per cent per annum for the next
two years'. The threat of the discounters was dismissed as 'overdone', while
the large financial commitments of the majors was likely to keep price
competition fears in check.
SG Warburg took the opportunity to respond to the recent weakness in the
shares and Friday's retail price data, underlining its positive short-term
stance on the sector.
Both houses recommend Argyll Group, whose shares faded after an initial
spurt to close a penny down at 338p. NatWest upgraded its profits estimate
for the stock by Pounds 10m to Pounds 553m for 1994-95. Asda was also on the
NatWest buy list, with Kleinwort Benson also said to be positive yesterday.
The shares gained 2 1/2 at 68 1/2p.

FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Break-up worries hit ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in ICI languished at the start of the new trading account after the
bear case for the group's proposed split was widely publicised in the Sunday
press.
Analysts who are not gagged by their participation in the impending Pounds
1.3bn rights issue have been arguing that the break-up value of the company
is between 950p and Pounds 10. The estimates are steadily approaching the
ground-breaking and pessimistic analysis by Smith New Court last November.
Even some analysts involved in the cash call have apparently been voicing
their concern privately.
As a result, said one observer: 'Fund managers are creeping in with
increasingly cold feet.' Everything hinges on the attitude in the US and, at
a time when swingeing reforms are overhanging the pharmaceuticals industry,
US investors are unlikely to be euphoric about Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals
arm.
Others argue that the huge fund-raising exercise will be acclaimed as a
success in the same way that Wellcome's giant flotation last year was
heralded in spite of sharp share price falls. They say institutions are
unlikely to turn down the benefits of the discounted shares but may take
them only to sell Zeneca stock soon afterwards.
Yesterday, ICI shares were down 15 at worst and closed a net 8 easier at
1182p. The ADS US equivalents were also lower. Meanwhile, Wellcome shares
were sharply weaker, falling 22 to 702p in spite of an announcement that
Prudential had increased its stake to 4 per cent. The slide was prompted by
a large overhang of stock washing around the market.

FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early market surge runs out of steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROMISING start to the new three-week trading account in London, triggered
mainly by Wall Street's surge to an all-time peak on Friday and hopes that
this week could bring lower German interest rates, was largely eroded as the
Footsie future retreated after a disappointing opening on Wall Street
yesterday.
Earlier, London dealers were surprised at the level of early buying interest
in the equity market. Wall Street's move to a closing record level last
Friday was said to have prompted a flurry of early buying interest in
London, driving the FT-SE 100 Index up from an initially easier opening of
2,822.8 to the day's high point of 2,844.2, a net rise of almost 20 points,
just before midday. A large number of stocks going ex-dividend accounted for
4.6 points off the index.
Dealers said the early buying was triggered by a number of broking houses
adopting a more optimistic attitude on UK recovery trends, leading to a
series of earnings upgrades in the leading stocks. An easing in French
interest rates was also seen as another bullish angle for London, with
markets across Europe still hopeful that the French move could be followed
by a reduction in German rates after the Bundesbank meeting this Thursday.
After reaching the day's peak, however, the market began to drift, with
activity slowing appreciably in the run-up to Wall Street's opening, which
saw the Dow Industrial Average down more than 16 points as London closed.
The disappointing showing by New York quickly impacted on London, where the
FT-SE 100 gradually came off to finish a net 5.6 up at 2,830.0. The 100
index just managed to maintain its recent outperformance of the FT-SE Mid
250 Index, which closed a net 2.1 ahead at 3,074.4, having moved in a narrow
range throughout a generally quiet session.
Dealers said turnover in the market was disappointing, with 463m shares
traded, made up of 185m of Footsie stocks and 278m non-Footsie stocks.
Dealers continued to take heart, however, from the consistently high level
of customer business in the market.
Last Friday, the final day of the three-week Easter account and a session
badly affected by the nation-wide railway strike, attracted customer
business worth Pounds 1.19bn.
So far this year there have been only a handful of trading sessions during
which the value of retail, or customer, business has fallen below Pounds
1bn.
Senior marketmakers, worried by last week's bad news on inflation, were
relieved at the market's performance yesterday. A trader commented: 'The
market still feels very jittery but has been helped by perceptions that
European rates could come down.'
Around the various sectors, the banks stood out with good gains as one of
the leading US investment banks voiced its enthusiasm on National
Westminster shares.
Leading retailers were generally well supported, notably Boots, but the oil
majors looked to have run out of steam as some US analysts were said to have
decided that BP and Shell had risen far enough.
ICI received a choppy ride in the market, with some industry analysts taking
the view that the hiving off of the Zeneca drugs business may prove more
disappointing than previously thought. Bid rumours, however, continued to
surround Lucas Industries.

FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH move to lower interest rates, together with Friday's strong
performance on Wall Street, led to an early advance in stock index futures,
although it had faded by the close, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened strongly at 2,841, on the first day of the new account, the
June futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index saw buyers from the outset. The
buying was encouraged by the French moves, and by 11.30am the contract was
trading at the session's high of 2,858.
However, with 2,855 seen by many dealers as a resistance level, traders
decided that the early advance had gone far enough and that profit-taking
was now in order, which led to a retreat for the June contract.
A further decline was seen during the afternoon, more to do with a lack of
buyers than outright selling, and a poor opening for Wall Street weakened
sentiment further.
June closed at 2,845, up 13 from Friday's close and around 8 points above
its estimated fair value premium to cash which falls to about 8 on this
account. Turnover was unexciting at 6,277 lots.
Volume in the traded options remained poor, reaching only 23,576 contracts.
A large part of the total was in the index options, the FT-SE 100 option
trading 8,996 contracts and the Euro FT-SE 2,411. Bid speculation made Lucas
Industries the busiest stock option at 1,484 lots.

FT  20 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Intel declines sharply after
court ruling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices retreated yesterday, bringing the main indices down from the
record highs achieved at the end of last week, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.62 easier at 3,466.99, but off
the day's low. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 1.49 to 447.45, while the
American SE composite lost 1.66 at 418.26. New York SE volume was 245m
shares and declines led rises by 1,166 to 754.
The Nasdaq composite finished 3.75 off at 663.03 after a steep fall in Intel
shares.
Prices opened weaker, which did not surprise analysts. The Dow had advanced
to a record close on Friday, but the gains were primarily a result of
trading related to the monthly expiration of options contracts. Analysts
noted that it is quite common for stocks to reverse direction on a Monday
morning after an options-expiration rally in the previous session.
Although first-quarter corporate earnings continued to pour in, affecting a
number of issues, the spotlight was focused yesterday on technology stocks
after a landmark court ruling by a federal judge on Friday.
The judge's decision to set aside the verdict reached last year in a
copyright dispute between Advanced Micro Devices and Intel means AMD can now
begin manufacturing a clone of Intel's top-selling 486 microprocessor chip
while the two companies await a new trial.
News of the judgment sparked heavy and at times frantic trading in both
issues. AMD jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 27 7/8 in volume of 5.4m shares,
while Intel, traded on the Nasdaq electronic market, plunged Dollars 12 1/4
to Dollars 97 3/4 in volume of 17.7m shares. The 486 chip that AMD will
begin cloning accounted for a substantial portion of Intel's Dollars 2bn of
first-quarter revenues.
A number of other technology issues declined in sympathy with Intel. Texas
Instruments lost Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 45 and Hewlett-Packard Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 73 1/4 .
Chrysler dipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 42 in volume of 3.4m shares in
spite of news of first-quarter profits that exceeded market expectations.
Analysts put the decline down to profit-taking.
Leading airline issues weakened after Northwest Airlines fired the latest
salvo in the fierce domestic price-cutting war when it dropped fares on some
domestic and selected trans-Atlantic routes by as much as 35 per cent. UAL
fell Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 141 7/8 , AMR Dollars 2 to Dollars 66 5/8 and
Delta Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 56 3/4 .
Chase Manhattan shed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 34 1/2 after the banking group
said it planned to raise Dollars 750m through a stock offering.
Canada
TORONTO gained further ground in another record volume as the smaller oil
and gas issues, along with diamond miners, continued to attract wide
interest and were traded in heavy turnover.
The TSE 300 index ended 11.4 higher at 3,663.2 and rises outpaced falls by
384 to 316 after volume of 90.7m shares valued at CDollars 601m. Monday's
volume included two large blocks in American Eagle Petroleum totalling about
12m shares.
Abitibi-Price, up CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 14 5/8 , reported reduced losses
from continuing operations in the first quarter and said it is considering
selling additional non-core assets.

FT  20 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Excitement in Hong Kong, Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week featured bullishness in the US, sheer excitement in Asia and a
reward for economic consistency in Ireland. A 1.6 per cent gain in the US
was the main reason why the FT-Actuaries World index rose by 0.8 per cent in
local currency terms.
In New York, share prices began by moving higher in tandem with government
bonds as consumer and producer prices data allayed fears that inflationary
pressures had been building up in the economy. Last Friday, bonds declined
but equities rose again, pushed up this time by company results.
Hong Kong had its best gains on Tuesday and Wednesday, domestic trading
bracketing a surge in London on the resumption of Sino-British talks on the
colony's future. Share indices and turnover both hit record levels before
easing back towards the end of the week.
In Europe, Ireland's 5.1 per cent advance on the week left it with the best
performance in the FT-Actuaries World Indices this year, a rise of 34.2 per
cent in local currency terms.
The gains began in anticipation of a further interest rate cut last Friday.
When this actually transpired, it was the seventh reduction in eight weeks,
following the punt's devaluation in January, and subsequent cuts in German
interest rates. In addition to the interest rate prospects, the market had
indications of improved cash flow at domestic institutions, the placing of
the government's 55m shares in Irish Life and a US bid for Fyffes, the fruit
wholesaler.
On prospects, Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy Stockbrokers in
Dublin, thinks that the market is still attractive on a strategic time
frame, valued at 15 1/2 times earnings for 1992 and a prospective 13 1/2 p/e
for 1993. In London, Mr Adrian O'Carroll at Dillon Read reckons, however,
that significant undervaluations in the big blue chips have disappeared, and
that attention will turn to second line stocks from now on.

FT  20 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as
Singapore hits another record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WAYNE APONTE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING from government-managed public funds and arbitrageurs failed to
offset the day's losses entirely, as the yen's appreciation against the
dollar prompted profit-taking and kept investors cautious, writes Wayne
Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average of 225 issues lost 185.52 at 20,112.34, after trading
between a session low of 19,890.47 and an opening high of 20,254.09. The
Topix index of all first section stocks shed 11.53 to 1,553.57, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.76 to 1,215.80.
Volume on the first section languished at an estimated 370m shares, down
from Friday's 561m, and declines led rises by 771 to 268.
Investors held the sidelines before the Bank of Japan intervened to
stabilise the yen's rise beyond Y111 to the dollar. Mr Bill Clinton, the US
president, mentioned a stronger yen as one strategy to cut Japan's trade
surplus, following a meeting on Friday with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese
prime minister, in Washington.
In spite of the session's low turnover, Mr Isao Takahashi, senior manager of
equity trading at James Capel Pacific, predicted that more institutional
investors will enter the stock market in the short term since the 20,000
level served as a firm support to this session and because some market
participants had missed out on last week's rally. He added, however, that
the Nikkei's upside is limited to around the 21,500 mark due to a lack of
fundamental incentives.
The strengthening of the yen pressured exporting issues. Sony weakened Y90
to Y4,770 and TDK, the world's largest manufacturer of magnetic tapes, fell
Y90 to Y3,980.
Sumitomo Metal and Mining, the most active stock for the third consecutive
trading session, climbed Y30 to Y980 as gold and platinum prices maintained
high levels.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 174.76 to 21,810.07 in volume of 20.3m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets moved in widely divergent directions.
SINGAPORE continued its record run, closing at a fourth consecutive all-time
high, although some profit-taking was evident during the afternoon. The
Straits Times Industrial index rose 8.67 to 1,772.02, supported by
institutional and retail buying, in volume of 403.4m shares. Prices peaked
at an intraday record of 1,781.39.
SEOUL closed at its highest level for 20 months after individual investors
actively bought financial shares in the wake of recently lowered interest
rates. The composite index added 13.46 at 725.76. Turnover came to Won880bn,
after Won471.6bn in Saturday's half-day session.
The market sustained a firm note established early in the session with
buying of high-technology related shares. The buying spree then spread to
the financial sector as steelmakers and carmakers took a rest from recent
steep rises.
KARACHI, by contrast, dived to its lowest level since November 1991 after
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan sacked the reformist Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif. The 100-share index lost 36.98 to 1,069.79.
Mr Daniel Smaller, head of emerging markets at Lehman Brothers in London,
said the market had fallen about 7 per cent over the last month as political
worries grew. Mr Muddassar Malik, director of BMA Capital Management in
Karachi, added that, while political uncertainty was likely to continue for
the next couple of months, economic fundamentals remained strong with no
shift in direction expected from a new administration.
HONG KONG saw profit-taking among bank shares. The Hang Seng index lost 17.0
at 6,680.15, after rising to 6,709.38. Turnover fell to HKDollars 4.0bn from
HKDollars 4.53bn as investors became cautious ahead of the Sino-British
talks on the colony's future, which begin on Thursday.
AUSTRALIA eased as investors took profits, the All Ordinaries index closing
6.8 off at 1,696.4 in turnover of ADollars 221.4m. Broker JB Were commented
that falling bond yields and a cut in corporation tax, which has added some
7 per cent to eps expectations for 1993/94, have contributed to the 8.6 per
cent rise in the index over the last quarter.
KUALA LUMPUR's inexorable advance continued, the composite index gaining
2.93 at 664.95, after reaching 665.48.
Some analysts maintained that the market would consolidate this week after
strong gains over the previous fortnight. Turnover remained very high, at
MDollars 1.4bn.
TAIWAN recouped some of last week's losses on bargain hunting but some
brokers said investors remained unsettled because of the possibility of the
US imposing trade sanctions in the near future. The weighted index rose
86.40 to 4,577.48 in TDollars 33.5bn turnover.
BOMBAY turned lower in thin trading and the BSE index shed 38.63 to
2,261.15.

FT  20 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris falls in spite of
further interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL upheaval or the prospect of it vied with interest rate hopes in
moving bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was largely unmoved by a further easing in intervention rates,
prefering instead to concentrate on comments made by Mr Edouard Balladur,
the prime minister, on Sunday in which he said that taxes, which he did not
specify, may have to be raised in order to cut the budget deficit. The
CAC-40 index closed 17.78 lower at 1,968.91 in thin turnover of some
FFr2.2bn.
Mr Andrew Shepherd-Barron, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said that investors
were looking for further interest rate cuts if the historically strong start
to the year was not to peter out. However, he added, with the rate
differential between France and Germany now at 60 basis points further cuts
domestically were effectively ruled out until the Bundesbank moved once
again.
Both Eurotunnel and Euro Disney featured heavy trading as the former delayed
completion of the project and cut its revenue projection for 1994 and the
latter was hit by further negative press articles and fears of higher staff
costs. Eurotunnel closed off FFr1.30 or 3.4 per cent at FFr37.35 while Euro
Disney lost FFr2.80 to FFr81.80.
Lafarge was another heavy loser, down FFr6.40 at FFr357.60, after announcing
that it was making a Pta36bn share swap bid for full control of Asland,
Spain's second biggest cement group, in which it has a 54 per cent stake.
MILAN maintained the higher trend established early in the session as exit
polls published after the close of voting in the electoral reform referendum
confirmed that the country was in the mood for change.
The Comit index rose 12.12 or 2.36 per cent to 525.38 as exit polls showed
83 per cent of voters in favour of reform.
'For the first time, investors can start looking at Italy on the
fundamentals rather than having to absorb an unnecessarily high political
risk,' said Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International in London.
'At last the door has been opened whereby tangible progress can be made
towards a new style of government, within a sensible time table.'
Generali, helped by buy recommendations from London brokers, rose L700 or
1.9 per cent to fix at L36,600 before adding a further L600 after hours.
Fiat rose L159 to fix at L6,410 before rising to L6,610 after hours amid
signs that it may voluntarily co-operate with magistrates investigating the
country's political corruption scandal.
FRANKFURT fixed upon the French repo rate move to speculate that the
Bundesbank will make significant interest rate cuts on Thursday. The DAX
rose 14.45 to 1,693.30, turnover climbing from DM4.8bn to DM6.1bn.
Foreign orders, and short-covering on the DTB futures market were reported
for VW, Mannesmann and Veba, up DM5.80 to DM323.50, DM5.20 to DM265.70 and
DM6.20 to DM394.20 respectively. Veba was also boosted by speculation that
its PreussenElektra subsidiary might be floated on markets. The subsidiary
denied the speculation.
A fall in profits at the specialty chemicals company, Henkel, left it DM4
lower at DM542.50.
AMSTERDAM was in a positive mood with a rise in the CBS Tendency index of
0.9 to 110.6. There was interest in cyclical stocks with Akzo putting on Fl
2.00 to Fl 157.30 while ING, which saw an intraday 12-month high, closed up
10 cents at Fl 67.70.
MADRID cleared the 240 level, the general index closing 4.29 higher at
244.12 on anticipation of a Bundesbank move. Turnover put on nearly 50 per
cent, rising from Pta14.3bn to Pta21.3bn
Construction stocks, strong last week on a Pta658bn plan to divert water
resources to the south, climbed again on the bid from the French group,
Lafarge, for the cement company, Asland.
ISTANBUL took fright at the prospect of political upheaval after President
Turgut Ozal's sudden death on Saturday and prices plunged by 10.45 per cent.
The market index fell 767.23 from Friday's record high to 6,574.14, having
rebounded during the last half hour from a day's low of 6,502.
The sharp fall was also attributed to a correction after the bull run which
had taken the index up 25.19 per cent since April 1, posting eight record
high closes on the way.
Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London noted that the fundamentals
responsible for this month's upward surge - a positive corporate outlook, a
liquid lira and bank plans to set up equity-based mutual funds - had not
changed and he expected the market to pick up again as soon as the political
uncertainty was resolved.
OSLO edged higher, with the central bank's trimming of the overnight lending
rate by 25 basis points to 8.25 per cent coming after the close. The
all-share index finished 4.11 higher at 450.66. HELSINKI also benefited from
lower rates with a rise in the HEX index of 18.8 or 1.7 per cent to 1,079.4.

FT  20 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen remains strong in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN remained very strong in European trading yesterday after earlier
setting an historic high against the dollar in Far Eastern markets, writes
James Blitz.
The Japanese currency's value against the dollar soared by some 1.5 per cent
in Monday's Tokyo trading, after President Bill Clinton said at the weekend
that the yen's appreciation was helping to curb the US/Japanese trade
imbalance.
Both the Japanese prime minister and finance minister tried to cool the
yen's advance with comments throughout the day, and the Bank of Japan
intervened on foreign exchange markets by buying the dollar.
However, the absence of any intervention from the US Federal Reserve helped
to underline that there was no co-ordination from the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries to stop the yen climbing.
After its record peak in Tokyo trading, the Japanese currency opened even
stronger in London at Y110.70 to the dollar before finishing at Y111.00,
some Y1.6 above Friday's London close. In New York trading yesterday the
dollar finally stood at Y111.09.
In the last two months the yen has rallied from around Y124.00 against the
dollar and few dealers saw much chance of a strong retracement in the next
few days.
Mr Steve Hannah of IBJ International in London said: 'There is feeling now
that a strengthening yen reflects the weakest line of political resistance
in Japan and the US.'
In his view, the Miyazawa government will acquiesce to a strong yen because
of the fear of US imposition of tariffs on Japanese exports. At the same
time, the Clinton administration is unlikely to intervene to support the
dollar because of the need to get the Japanese trade surplus down.
Both the US and Japan might re-think their positions if the yen's rise hurts
Japanese exports and damages the economy. 'If, like the US, you are trying
to get greater access to a market, the worst thing that can happen is that
the market in question starts to weaken,' added Mr Hannah.
European trading was otherwise dominated by the slight weakening of the
D-Mark against most currencies.
The Bank of France's decision to cut its intervention rate for the first
time in five months concentrated expectations that the Bundesbank will, in
turn, ease policy this week. It also underlined the market's confidence in
the new French administration. The French franc closed at FFr3.378 to the
D-Mark from a previous FFr3.379.
However, Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets in London said the
Bundesbank is unlikely to reduce its official rates this week because the
repo rate level is so far above that of the discount rate. She also believes
that the market should be wary of the forthcoming consumer price data in
Germany. 'A higher inflation figure might force the market to retrace,' she
added.

FT  20 APR 93 / Money Markets: France cuts two rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH FRANC futures rose modestly yesterday after the Bank of France cut
its intervention rate for the first time in five months, writes James Blitz.
The French authorities lowered their intervention rate, which sets the floor
for money market rates, from 9.10 per cent to 8.75 per cent. This was the
first time that the intervention rate had been cut since November 12 last
year.
The French authorities also reduced the 5 to 10-day lending rate, which sets
the ceiling for money market rates, from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent.
The move, announced before European markets opened yesterday morning,
triggered an immediate rise in French franc futures prices. The June
contract, which closed at 91.76 on Friday night, opened at 91.87, peaked at
91.94 and ended at 91.89.
The cost of borrowing funds in the French franc cash market also fell back.
Three-month French cash closed at around 8.63 per cent, having finished at
some 9 per cent last Friday.
Dealers are clearly bullish about the prospect of more reductions in French
rates before the summer, believing it will soon be followed by more easing.
The June Pibor contract was last night pricing three-month money at 8.03 per
cent, some 60 basis points below the level of three-month cash.
The French franc's strong performance in the wake of the cut has also
further reduced the premium required by dealers for holding French francs
over D-Marks. The differential between three-month German and French cash
yesterday was down to 73 basis points. At the height of the crisis in the
exchange rate mechanism it was as high as 400 basis points.
Some dealers were also assuming yesterday that the cut in French rates might
herald further easing in the Bundesbank's official rates. The June Euromark
contract rose some 3 basis points on the day to close at 92.74.
Nevertheless, reasons remain for being cautious about predicting further
rate declines in Europe.
Sterling markets were quiet after last week's reduced expectations of a base
rate reduction.
Three-month rates closed softer at 6 per cent from a previous 6 1/16 per
cent. The June short sterling contract finished a basis point down on the
day at 93.92.

FT  20 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivian state and private
mining groups in joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JOINT venture contract has been signed between Comibol, the Bolivian state
mining corporation and Comsur, Bolivia's largest private mining company,
over the Bolivar polymetallic mine. Comibol further hopes to complete two
additional joint venture deals before general elections are held in June.
Comsur will invest Dollars 13m in Bolivar and anticipates an initial 30 year
exploitation plan. Under the terms of the deal Comibol will take 50 per cent
of future profits. Future investment in Bolivar will be Comsur's sole
responsibility.
Both parties have guaranteed the jobs of the mine's existing workforce of
about 300 and new jobs may also be created. Local miners are said to be
broadly in favour of the deal. However, the directorate of the main miners'
union, the FSTMB, remains implacably opposed to joint ventures. Union
spokesman Mr Victor Baldivieso said it would try to prevent this joint
venture and condemned Bolivar workers in favour of the deal.
Mr Jaime Urjel, Comsur's managing director, said the company hoped to take
over Bolivar within 45 to 60 days. The mine would then become operational
within 15 to 18 months. A new mill - which will be able to deal with 1,000
tonnes of lead/zinc and zinc/silver ore a day - is being built at the site.
The plant may process tin in the future.
Comibol executive director Mr Armando Guzman said that while the FSTMB union
was clearly opposed to the deal, Bolivar workers themselves would carry the
day. He said it was possible that RTZ, the UK-based group, which has close
associations with Comsur, would be involved in future funding of Bolivar's
operations. The International Finance Corporation will also be involved.
This is the third joint venture contrast to be signed between Comibol and a
private mining company since 1991. But operations in the first two remain
blocked by union action. Mr Guzman said both these joint ventures would be
activated by August this year.
Two further joint venture tenders have been issued by Comibol. The first,
for which invitations have yet to be sent, is an exploration venture for
alluvial gold deposits in the Pando and Beni Regions. The second, for which
invitations were sent out recently, is for the exploration of the Cerro Rico
(Rich Hill) in Potosi. A recent study estimated that the hill contained
Dollars 400m tonnes of silver ore. Mr Guzman estimates there are between 80m
and lOOm tonnes of silver ore reserves.
According to figures just released by the Medium Mines Association, Bolivian
mining registered negative growth in 1992 of 4.9 per cent, compared with
growth in 1991 of 2 per cent. Legal sales and exports of gold fell by 46 per
cent. Antimony production was down 34 per cent, wolfram 15 per cent, cadmium
38 per cent, silver 14 per cent and tin 5 per cent.

FT  20 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: MIM covers all the options on
Queensland deposit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian resources group, yesterday underlined its
determination to acquire a substantial stake in the Ernest Henry copper-gold
deposit in north-west Queensland by announcing a second conditional deal to
buy the mining leases.
The Ernest Henry deposit was discovered in 1991 by a joint venture between
Western Mining Corporation and Hunter Resources on a group of six leases
owned by Savage Resources, a small coal and exploration company.
The deposit has indicated reserves of 69m tonnes of mineralisation at an
average grade of 1.6 per cent of copper and 0.8 grammes per tonne of gold.
However, its ownership is disputed between Savage Resources and the joint
venture partners.
MIM announced earlier this month that it had agreed to buy Hunter Resources'
30 per cent interest in the Ernest Henry deposit and the adjacent Mount Fort
Constantine area in the event that the Queensland courts ruled against
Savage.
Under the second deal, announced yesterday, MIM would acquire 51 per cent of
the deposit for ADollars 92.5m (Pounds 43.5m) if the courts ruled in favour
of Savage Resources, or ADollars 14m for Savage's royalty rights if WMC and
Hunter Resources are awarded ownership.
Alternatively, the agreement provides for a range of royalty and equity
transfers to MIM if the dispute between Savage and the joint venturers is
settled out of court.
Mr Norm Fussell, MIM's managing director, said that the group wanted to
secure a substantial position in Ernest Henry as part of its basic strategic
objective of expanding copper production, especially in its north-west
Queensland base.
The Ernest Henry deposit and the highly-prospective Mount Fort Constantine
area are close to MIM's Mount Isa base, where the group has extensive mining
and copper smelting facilities.
In a separate announcement, MIM said that it would acquire the 13.5 per cent
of the Oaky Creek export coking coal join venture that it does not already
own from Hoogovens Delfstoffen of The Netherlands and Empresa Nacional
Siderurgica of Spain.

FT  20 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recycling the image of CIS
aluminium - Kenneth Gooding talks to the emotional defender of an industry
under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE MANY Russians, Mr Igor Prokopov can become emotional at times. And he
gets noticeably cross when anyone suggests that the Commonwealth of
Independent States is entirely responsible for bringing the world's
aluminium industry to its knees and to a point where low prices are
threatening the existence of many smelters.
Some European producers, for example, blame the unprecedented surge in
exports of aluminium from the CIS for driving them to the point of
extinction.
But Mr Prokopov, who is president of Concern Aluminiy, the holding company
for the CIS industry, points out that aluminium is a world commodity and
there is only one market - a world market. The CIS is now an important
member of that market and the rest of the industry will have to adjust to
that fact, he says.
Japan once was a big aluminium producer, he recalls, but now makes virtually
none. The Japanese were forced out of the business in the early 1980s
because their costs were too high, particularly their energy costs. Nobody
blamed the CIS producers for that, says Mr Prokopov. So why blame them now
when other high-cost production in threatened?
Mr Prokopov says most CIS smelters use low-cost hydro-electric power, as do
smelters in Latin America and Canada. It is not their fault if smelters in
central Europe have to buy energy that is relatively high-cost and that
makes them the world's highest-cost producers.
And the CIS has not been increasing its capacity like Canada and central
Europe have recently.
Mr Prokopov becomes particularly agitated at suggestions that the CIS is
dumping aluminium in the west. How can this be, he asks, when all official
CIS contracts are linked to the world price fixed by the London Metal
Exchange and most of the export is handled by reputable western trading
companies?
He is making this spirited defence of his industry because the European
Commission is at present considering whether it should impose draconian
quotas on CIS aluminium imports to 'safeguard' its domestic producers. He
says this would make no sense. Putting a fence between Europe and the CIS
would not work - the metal would simply enter the world market elsewhere.
Quotas would make even less political sense at a time when the world's
industrialised countries were dismantling trade and tariff barriers and
providing the CIS with other help for its transformation to a market
economy.
Mr Prokopov points out that the CIS uses much of the hard currency raised by
aluminium sales to buy raw materials, equipment and spare parts for its
smelters and, because each smelter supports a community, food for employees
and their families.
Many of these necessities are bought in the European Community, which is not
only the nearest big market for aluminium but also the nearest big supplier
of such goods.
Last year the CIS industry was allowed by the central authorities to export
650,000 tonnes of aluminium free of duty to raise cash for these
necessities. Mr Boris Yeltsin , the Russian president, recently signed a
decree to permit 520,000 tonnes to go out duty-free this year.
That is not to suggest CIS total aluminium exports will be cut this year.
Both CIS output, at about 3.2m tonnes, and official exports at 850,000
tonnes, will be about the same as in 1992, he says.
But Russia hopes to stem the flow of unlicensed exports from the CIS. Some
suggest these reached 400,000 tonnes last year but Mr Prokopov insists they
were not that high. Nevertheless, there has been so much unofficial metal
available that the London Metal Exchange has become very wary about
registering any more brands of CIS aluminium because of worries about
ultimate ownership and who is taking responsibility for quality.
Mr Prokopov says virtually none of the unofficial metal is being exported
from Russia but is escaping via other members of the federation. Russia is
introducing new customs regulations to make it much more difficult for metal
to slip out this way.
The CIS industry knows it has an image problem. One of the most telling
points put by EC producers is that clean, modern, community capacity is
being shut down to make way for imports from heavily-polluting, out-dated
CIS smelters.
So the CIS producers last week in Helsinki joined with some of its western
suppliers to form a new association to defend and promote the CIS industry's
interests.
Mr Prokopov admits it is difficult for his industry to attract the
investment to make the smelters less environmentally damaging.
VAW of Germany recently estimated it would cost USDollars 6.6bn to modernise
just four of the 14 CIS smelters and most observers believe the CIS simply
cannot afford to go that deeply into debt.
One solution which is emerging, however, would be for the CIS to use
intermediate technology and upgrade those of its smelters using the old
Soederberg production system - ten out of 14 smelters - instead of jumping
to the most up-to-date, pre-baked technology.
Mr Vesa Kumpulainen, chief executive of the Kumera Corporation, a Finnish
group with many years of experience supplying Russia, suggests that this
would cost an affordable total of Dollars 600m. His company has put
proposals to all of the CIS Soederberg smelters, offering to upgrade them by
using well-tried technology developed by Reynolds Metals of the US. Reynolds
has converted two of its own Soederberg smelters in the US.
Mr Kumpulainen says the Reynolds' technology not only cuts pollution
substantially - for example at one smelter 20 kg of emissions a year would
be reduced to only 2 kg - it also saves energy. The present power efficiency
of 80 per cent would be raised to 90 per cent. Ironically, because Russia
has perhaps the most stringent emission regulations in the world, the
smelters would still not meet the rules after upgrading.
Mr Erik Jensen, one of the Reynolds Metals' executives at Helsinki, insists
the CIS primary aluminium industry is 'tremendously viable'. He wishes
western bankers would understand it was a unique industry, with very low
costs and little or no debt, thus making it very hard for the rest of the
world to compete. 'It has great technological strength, is well-organised
and is producing a commodity that is instantly convertible into cash,' he
points out.
The CIS industry has the ability to repay debt rapidly, yet western bankers
insist on placing conditions on loans that they would not dream of imposing
elsewhere in the industry. Anywhere else the smelter would be used as
collateral for loans but that is not possible in the CIS. Mr Jensen says
this is probably because the question of who owns the smelter remains
obscure.
This ownership question is gradually becoming clearer as the industry is
privatised. Mr Prokopov says management and employees now own 51 per cent of
the Russian smelters with the rest in the hands of the state. But this 49
per cent is being sold at auctions to the public.
Mr Prokopov insists that the difficulties facing foreign investors in the
CIS can be overcome. Many western companies, particularly from Italy, are
building joint ventures. For example, Fata, the Italian industrial group,
and Reynolds are working with a Russian consortium to build a plant to
produce 43,000 tonnes a year of aluminium foil - 'this will leave more
aluminium in Russia,' he says: 'This is not aid, it is investment. We are
convinced both Fata and Reynolds will see satisfactory profits.'
Reynolds' Mr Jensen says the joint venture is making only slow progress but
his company's philosophy is that as many new downstream products as possible
should be encouraged in Russia. 'There is,' he says, 'no better way to help
the world aluminium industry.'

FT  20 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Surprise jump in Indian
polished diamond exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S EXPORTS of cut and polished diamonds jumped 10.6 per cent to
USDollars 3.24bn in the year to March 1993, surprising local businesses.
The rise resulted from windfall gains for India as consumers in the
recession-hit West and Japan switched to small diamonds, in which the
country specialises. A sharp fall had been feared as diamond polishing
activity in the western part of the country came to a standstill for more
than three months following intermittent riots.
India, which depends entirely on external sources for rough (uncut)
diamonds, imported stones worth Dollars 2.38bn last year mainly through the
Diamond Trading Corporation of India. The added value in exports last year
was 36.1 per cent, up by two percentage points from the previous year.
Exports became more competitive last year with partial convertibility of the
rupee, allowing 60 per cent of inward remittances to be converted at market
rates. The remaining 40 per cent was to be offered at the rate fixed by the
country's central bank.
Exporters were given a further boost as the rupee was made fully convertible
last month. Mr MR Bhansali, chairman of gem and jewellery export promotion
council, says the gain will amount be about 2 per cent.

INDIA WILL produce 11m tonnes of white sugar in 1992-93 (October-September),
down from a record 13.3m tonnes last year, food minister Mr Kalpnath Rai
said yesterday, reports Reuter from New Delhi.
Production has dwindled because of a drought in the western state of
Maharashtra and some other parts of the country, the Press Trust of India
quoted him as saying.
He said at least 500,000 tonnes of sugar would be exported during the
present year, about the same as last year. Mr Rai said that carry-over
stocks stood at about 1.6m tonnes.
The country exported 321,000 tonnes of white sugar in the first ten months
of the 1992-93 fiscal year (April-March), Mr Kamaluddin Ahmed, the minister
of state for commerce said in Parliament.

FT  20 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New York coffee prices head for
20-year lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON COFFEE prices closed sharply down yesterday, while the New York
market continued its headlong plunge towards 20-year lows following the
collapse of the International Coffee Agreement negotiations last month.
Yesterday the London July robusta contract closed at Dollars 859 a tonne,
down Dollars 17 on the day, while the New York May arabica contract fell
0.95 to 52.75 cents a lb in late trading. Chartists believe the New York
contract is heading below the 20-year low of 51.65 cents seen last
September, possibly to test 50 cents a lb.
The world market's oversupply was reflected in last Friday's figures from
the Green Coffee Association of New York, which estimated that US coffee
warehouse stocks rose by 217,000 bags (60 kg each) to more than 10m bags,
representing well over half US annual consumption of 18.45m bags.
Prices in the London robusta market have held up better than those in New
York, partly because of a relative shortness of supply in nearby months. In
addition, the large speculative element in New York has taken short
positions following the collapse of the International Coffee Organisation
talks, helping to depress the market faster.
Coffee producers are making frantic efforts to salvage something from the
wreckage of the ICO talks. Colombia said last week that it was seeking a
common front with Brazil and Mexico; the Central American countries are
thought to be discussing a coffee retention plan; and the African producers
plan to meet next Monday and Tuesday in Abidjan.
But analysts were dismissive of any cartel emerging. 'They are not going to
be able to agree on a cartel for the same reasons they could not agree at
the ICO,' said one yesterday. 'With the best will in the world, it's just
not going to work.'

<TEXT>
PLATINUM closed well below an early eight-month high of Dollars 373.50 a
troy ounce on the London bullion market. SILVER eased and GOLD ended only
marginally above Friday's close as relative calm at funeral services for
slain African National Congress Nationalist Chris Hani eased fears of supply
disruptions. While many stayed away from work, the gold and platinum mines
were unaffected. Three-month COPPER consolidated just above Dollars 1,900 a
tonne at the close on the LME, while other metals finished easier. Trading
was less active as some semblance of stability entered the market after last
week's collapse to 5 1/2 -year lows of Dollars 1,870. But the market was
unable to sustain a technical rally towards Dollars 1,950. London COCOA
prices were easier by the close with initial liquidation in the US prompting
further sales in London. A lack of significant industry buying was
preventing any upturn in the market, dealers said. There were no fresh
fundamental influences, and volatility was expected to be limited until the
fate of the Ivorian mid-crop became clear next month.

FT  20 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Bank of France's rate cuts help lift
European prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by the Bank of France to cut its key interest rates yesterday
morning provided a welcome boost for many of the European government bond
markets.
The French central bank cut its intervention rate from 9.10 per cent to 8.75
per cent and lowered its five to 10-day securities repurchase rate from 10
per cent to 9.75 per cent. The five to 10-day rate, which provides a ceiling
rate, was cut by *something in here (HP) *
2 percentage points from 12 per cent last week.
French government bonds rallied on expectations of further interest rate
cuts. The French franc strengthened against the D-Mark, reflecting the view
that lower interest rates will encourage economic growth. The franc moved
from 3.3785 to the D-Mark to 3.3766, before ending at around 3.3780.
Short-dated bonds showed the strongest gains on the day, and the one-year
yield spread over comparable German government paper fell from 95 basis
points to 87 basis points. The 10-year yield spread slipped from 53 to 52
basis points.
Cash bonds and futures gave up some of their early gains on profit-taking
and the Matif futures contract, which closed on Friday at 118.12, rose to a
high of 118.32 before ending the day at around 118.12.
THE French rate cut helped to pull up German government bond prices in early
trading, and dealers said the French move had revived hopes of an easing by
the Bundesbank.
Bund market participants expect the Bundesbank to lower the rate by a few
basis points at this week's repo tender from last week's level of 8.11 per
cent, and there are hopes the German central bank may lower its Lombard rate
 -possibly as early as this Thursday, at the Bundesbank Council meeting.
The Liffe June bund futures contract ended at 96.35, against its previous
close of 96.28 and after a high of 96.53.
Details of the Treuhand privatisation agency's new bond issue are expected
to be announced today, dealers said.
LANDSLIDE support for electoral reform in the Italian referendum prompted a
strong rally in the Italian government bond market yesterday, although
profit-taking later in the session wiped out most of the gains.
The Liffe futures contract, which closed at 95.68 on Friday, climbed to a
high of 96.45 before dropping back to close at 95.85.
Dealers said investors were still waiting for further news on the political
front, following prime minister Giuliano Amato's offer of resignation.
FRIDAY'S adverse reaction to news of rising UK inflation continued to affect
early trading in UK government bonds, but the longer end of the gilt market
rallied later to close about  1/4 -point higher.
Dealers felt the disappointment at the RPI figures - up to 1.9 per cent in
the year to March from 1.8 per cent in February - had been overdone.
The shorter end of the market remained weak ahead of details, due today, of
the next gilt auction on April 28. The market is expecting a further tranche
of the 7 1/4 per cent bond due 1998. Estimates of the amount to be raised
vary from Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn.
The price of the existing bond slipped  3/16 to 101 1/32 . Hopes of a
further cut in base rates were checked by comments from Mr Norman Lamont,
chancellor of the exchequer, during a meeting of EC finance ministers, that
he regarded the present level of interest rates as compatible with recovery.
THE Japanese ministry of finance is expected to auction about Y800bn of
10-year bonds with a 4.5 per cent coupon today in a reopening of last
month's No 157 bond issue.
Although there was concern that the new supply would weigh on the market,
dealers expect the auction to go moderately well.
The prospect of the auction may have had a limiting effect on the cash bond
market. The benchmark No 145 issue showed little change, closing at a yield
of 4.255 per cent, compared with an opening of 4.25 per cent and a day's
trading range of between 4.24 per cent and 4.27 per cent.
The positive effect of the yen's continuing strength against the dollar, in
the wake of the Miyazawa-Clinton trade talks in Washington, helped to lift
the futures market, and the contract rose to 108.72 from 108.59, after
reaching a high of 108.87.
US Treasury prices firmed at the long end yesterday in light trading as
dealers and investors waited patiently for the next raft of economic data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 105
1/8 , yielding 6.721 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , to yield 3.756 per cent.
After opening with a firm tone due to buying by Japanese investors, the
market came under pressure in early trading from two sales of Treasury
futures by primary dealers, which brought prices down from their overnight
highs. After the futures sales, however, the market settled down, and
longer-dated prices crept steadily upward throughout the afternoon amid some
short covering by dealers.
The absence of new economic statistics contributed to the downbeat nature of
trading. The next set of data will come today with the publication of the
March housing starts.
Analysts are expecting the figures to show a slight decline, attributable to
the affect on housebuilding of last month's winter storms.

FT  20 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Coverage of new issues
includes yield spreads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STARTING today, the Financial Times' daily coverage of new issues in the
international bond market is being extended to include yield spreads, where
relevant.
In the new international bond issues table, the numbers shown (in basis
points) are the yield spreads at which each issue was launched over the
relevant benchmark government bond. The coupon and maturity of the benchmark
are shown in brackets after the spread: where further details are necessary,
they will be shown in a note. The spreads are supplied by the lead managers
of each transaction.
Details of prices and fees are being amended to reflect the prevalance of
the fixed-price reoffer method of selling bonds in the Euromarket. For bonds
sold using the fixed-price reoffer system, the price shown for each bond is
the price at which they are offered to investors (an 'R' next to the price
indicates this method of pricing). For these issues, the fees paid to
underwriters will be shown at the reoffer level: they indicate the fees
earned by underwriters if the bonds are sold at the reoffer price.
For other issues, the price shown is the issue price, with the full fees for
underwriters if the bonds were sold at that price.

FT  20 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Yield premium on UK corporate
paper at low-point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YIELD premium on unsecured sterling corporate bonds compared with
secured paper has fallen to unprecedented levels, according to an analysis
from Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
But with a shortage of new bond issues from UK companies and subsiding
concerns about credit quality as the UK comes out of recession, many
analysts expect yield spreads to remain at tight levels.
According to BZW, the yield spread between secured and unsecured stocks in
the sterling bond market is 'at an all-time low'.
The risk premium on unsecured paper, by this measurement, is now less than
20 basis points, compared with around 80 basis points in early 1990.
Factors driving the narrowing of spreads include the search by investors for
higher yields as UK interest rates have fallen, as well as the relative
scarcity of new paper from UK companies.
Mr Hugh Corbett, an analyst at UBS in London, added that the experience of
Queens Moat Houses - trading in whose debentures was halted at the end of
March - and London and Provincial Shops, which prepaid a debenture issue
earlier this year, had also weakened faith in secured bonds.
'People like solid corporates - (confidence in) asset-backing of property
has been blown apart in the last year.'
According to BZW, in its latest quarterly review of the outlook for the
sterling bond market, there has been a distortion of 'the relationship
between credit ratings and spreads along the (yield) curve and the question
of where value lies in now a difficult one.'
The bank concludes, though, that unsecured issues are 'for the most part not
overvalued.'

FT  20 APR 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Austria returns to the
Dutch guilder sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Austria returned to the Dutch guilder sector yesterday after
a five-year absence, attracted by the narrowing of the yield differential
between Dutch and German government bonds.
A year ago, Dutch bond yields were 30 to 40 basis points higher than bund
yields, but Dutch bonds are now trading roughly flat to the German market,
depending on which area of the yield curve is taken.
Since the policy of the Austrian federal financing agency is that exposure
to D-Marks or guilders does not create foreign exchange risk, the decision
to tap the market was based on interest rate levels. Yields in the Austrian
market are 20 to 30 basis points higher than in Germany or the Netherlands.
Although the financing was 'slightly more expensive' than a comparable deal
in the German market, according to Mr Helmut Eder of the financing agency,
the issue allowed the borrower to diversify.
Austria has now completed about two-thirds of its planned foreign borrowing
programme of Dollars 3bn this year.
This is the largest deal launched in the guilder market for some time. Lack
of swap opportunities has discouraged foreign investors, and Dutch companies
have been waiting for further declines in rates.
Austria's Fl 1bn six-year issue was priced to yield 8 basis points over the
comparable Dutch government bond. The yield looked attractive against D-Mark
bonds, as six-year Dutch government bonds yield about 10 basis points more
than comparable bunds, while at the 10-year area, Dutch bonds trade five
basis points through bunds.
In the Italian bond market, Eurofima launched a L300bn 10-year deal, the
third issue at that maturity in the last week. The deal was arranged by
Banca Nazionale de Lavoro.
Activity in the dollar market is likely to take centre-stage for the rest of
the week, if a number of transactions under discussion go ahead.
Abbey National, the UK bank, is in discussions with banks over a Dollars
1bn, 10-year offering, expected to be priced to yield 60 basis points more
than the comparable US Treasury. Goldman Sachs and UBS are tipped as likely
underwriters. Officials in Abbey National's treasury department were
unavailable for comment yesterday.
Also expected to emerge in the next few days is a five-year offering
totalling at least Dollars 500m for Canada's Export Development Corporation.
Credit Suisse First Boston was said to have won the mandate to arrange the
deal.

FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Tata group plans for the end of
the licence-raj - How India's largest company is coping with liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG boardroom battle at Tata Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest
company, ended yesterday with the dismissal of 75-year-old Mr Russi Mody,
the chairman.
Mr Mody had refused to abide by a controversial new retirement policy.
Mr Ratan Tata, deputy chairman and a member of the founding Tata family,
succeeded Mr Mody, with the support of Mr J. R. D. Tata, the family's
88-year-old patriarch.
The Tisco board, meeting in Mr Mody's absence, dismissed him for allegedly
attacking the company in the press. Mr Mody criticised the company after Mr
Ratan Tata and Mr J. R. D. Tata pressed him to resign against his will after
more than 50 years service.
MR RATAN Tata, the head of Tata, India's largest industrial group, this
month completed a deal that would have been unthinkable five years ago: he
sold a controlling stake in one of the group's oldest companies - Tata Oil
Mills.
Mr Ratan Tata's disposal of assets highlights the challenge India's large
family-based groups face with economic liberalisation.
No longer can they hide behind protectionist rules. The panoply of controls,
known as the licence-raj, is giving way to an economy in which market forces
are being given rein. This is creating opportunities but also exposing
Indian companies to competition.
The Tata group, with annual sales of Dollars 4.5bn in everything from
lorries to luxury hotels, looks well-placed to take advantage of change. Its
name is a by-word for commercial integrity; it is strong in steel, cement,
power, vehicles and engineering, all industries vital to India's future; its
international collaborators include top-flight groups, such as IBM and AT&amp;T
of the US and Germany's Daimler-Benz.
Yet Tata's success is not assured. The company seems to have lost some of
the pioneering spirit it showed before 1970, when it founded India's first
steelworks, luxury hotel, airline and large-scale software export business.
Other groups have grown faster that Tata's 46 operating companies, notably
Reliance Industries, the textiles and chemicals combine. Moreover, the group
has been torn by a boardroom battle involving Mr J. R. D. Tata, the group's
88-year-old patriarch, Mr Ratan Tata, his 55-year-old successor, and Mr
Russi Mody, chairman of Tata Steel, the group's flagship. The struggle over
the Tata family men's efforts to force Mr Mody to retire, has absorbed the
energy of executives for more than a year.
A Bombay businessman, a confidant of Tata managers, says: 'It's like the
last days of the Roman Empire at Tata. There's a vacuum at the top and
there's no-one to fill it. The group is drifting.'
Mr Ratan Tata, who took over in 1991 as chairman of Tata Sons, the group's
nerve centre, admits the group has lost some of its unity. But he believes
it is regaining it.
He aims to stamp his authority on the group and focus on markets in which
the group has a strong position or can achieve one. Other businesses must
sold or wound down.
Mr Ratan Tata's task might have been easier if he had started earlier. But
Mr J. R. D. Tata delayed his retirement from the chairmanship of Tata Sons
until he was 86.
Mr Mody and chiefs of other leading operating companies increasingly ran
their businesses independently, sometimes even entering into competition
with each other.
Mr Ratan Tata's answer was last year to introduce a controversial retirement
policy, requiring managing directors of group companies to retire at 65 and
chairmen at 75. Tata Steel's Mr Mody refused to go.
But, with Mr J. R. D. Tata's support, Mr Ratan Tata yesterday won the
encounter.
Mr Ratan Tata's problem is that Tata Sons, a privately-owned company
controlled by Tata family trusts, and its affiliates, hold only modest
stakes in the larger public-quoted operating companies.
Since Tata Sons lacks capital, Mr Ratan Tata wants group companies to take
stakes in each other. But some bankers in Bombay wonder why outside
shareholders should support such investments.
Greater group discipline will not alone bring Tata success in the wake of
liberalisation. Tata companies must also concentrate on activities in which
they hold competitive advantages, and pull out of others.
The disposal of Tata Oil Mills, a lossmaking oils and soaps producer long
overshadowed by Hindustan Lever, Indian offshoot of Anglo-Dutch
multinational Unilever, shows Mr Ratan Tata is serious.
Tata also needs to cut costs in those businesses it plans to keep. High-cost
production from the years of protection must now be phased out.
But cost-cutting at Tata has its limits: Tata does not wish to lose its
reputation as a generous employer. Moreover, Indian law virtually bans
large-scale sackings. Tata executives say they will go as fast as they can,
shedding labour through retirements.
Mr Ratan Tata wants the group to invest in new businesses, particularly
those based on high technology. But a proposal for a Dollars 1bn
petrochemicals complex at Haldia near Calcutta has been repeatedly delayed
and, according to Mr Ratan Tata, is now under review. The group has had its
successes - notably Titan Watches, a new venture in watchmaking in
partnership with Timex of the US. But this is modest compared with projects
on the drawing board. The only large project to have gone ahead is the
Dollars 1bn modernisation of Tata Steel.
Partly, the group has been held up by red tape. Partly, too, Tata's ageing
top executives were less adventurous than some competitors.
Even before he became chairman, Mr Ratan Tata tried to galvanise the group
with a series of joint ventures with foreign companies in electronics, oil
exploration services and financial services.
Foreign partners include Honeywell, the US electronics group, American
Express, the financial services combine, and AT&amp;T. But with turnover of less
than 10 per cent of Tata Steel's, and patchy profits, the ventures have yet
to make a significant contribution.
This year, the group has launched a joint venture with IBM, to sell the
American group's computers in India and to export software. Similarly, in
cars, Tata would like a foreign partner for the joint production of
passenger cars. The government's decision this month to lift controls on new
investment in the auto industry could enable Tata to revive a planned joint
venture with Honda of Japan.
Fortunately for Tata and other domestic groups, the government is giving
them time to adjust. Import duties will be phased out slowly. And, although
the licence-raj is being abolished, foreign companies will still face
hurdles to entering India.
But if Tata is to take advantage of this breathing space, it will need to
move faster in the next five years than it has in the last five.

MR GEOFFREY Bible, a senior executive at Philip Morris, has been appointed
executive vice-president, worldwide tobacco - a post which will oversee the
group's tobacco operations both in the US and overseas, writes Nikki Tait.
The move appears to confirm top management focus on the tobacco operations.
It comes just weeks after the tobacco, food and brewing group started a
price war in the US cigarette market in an effort to bolster market share of
its hitherto very profitable brands.
Mr Bible will report to Mr William Murray, Philip Morris's chief operating
officer. Reporting directly to Mr Bible will be Mr William Campbell, chief
executive of Philip Morris's domestic tobacco operations, and the officers
who head the international tobacco businesses.
Mr Bible, although a long-time employee of PM's tobacco operations, was
given the position of executive vice-president international two years ago,
when Philip Morris announced senior management changes relating to the
retirement of its then chairman, Mr Hamish Maxwell.
This post required him to oversee the international food and the
international tobacco operations, and his appointment was seen as a signal
that Philip Morris was focusing on international expansion.

MR JOHN Dawkins, Aus-tralia's federal treasurer (finance minister) is coming
under increasing pressure to reject an application from Mr Conrad Black for
permission to take a larger stake in Australia's John Fairfax newspaper
group.
Mr Dawkins has until the end of the week to decide whether to allow Mr
Black's UK-based Telegraph group to raise its holding in Fairfax from 15 to
25 per cent.
The federal cabinet is likely to discuss the application today.
The application has attracted criticism from a wide range of public figures,
including Mr Martin Ferguson, president of the Australian Council of Trade
Unions (ACTU), and Mr Malcolm Fraser, a former conservative prime minister.
Mr Ferguson told Mr Dawkins in a letter that the government would fail its
first big test since winning re-election last month if it allowed Mr Black
to increase his stake.
'The policy of the ACTU is to ensure that foreign interests cannot control
either directly or indirectly the management or programme content of any
newspaper, magazine or periodical,' Mr Ferguson said.
Mr Fraser, who campaigned against the acquisition of Fairfax in 1991 by the
Tourang consortium led by Mr Black, said the high level of overseas
investment in the Australian media was a serious problem.
He said a takeover of Fairfax by Mr Kerry Packer, the media entrepreneur,
would be preferable to an increase in the minority holding Mr Black acquired
in 1991, because foreign control was a more important issue than
concentration of ownership.
Mr Packer owns about 10 per cent of Fairfax, but would have to give up
control of the Channel Nine commercial television network before launching a
full bid.

NATIONSBANK, the large south-eastern regional banking group formed in 1991
by the merger of C &amp; S Sovran and NCNB, yesterday unveiled a 55 per cent
jump in first-quarter 1993 net profits, to Dollars 481m, or Dollars 1.89 a
share.
The results were inflated by a one-time Dollars 200m benefit stemming from
accounting changes.
NationsBank, the fourth largest US banking group, disclosed that its
non-performing assets totalled Dollars 1.92bn at the end of the first
quarter, equivalent to 2.53 per cent of total loans, leases and foreclosed
property, and about 29 per cent below the non-performing level a year ago.
Bad debt provisions totalled Dollars 1.57bn, down from Dollars 1.66bn a year
ago. Provisions taken in the quarter were Dollars 120m, less than half the
Dollars 265m taken in the first quarter of 1992.
Net interest income was Dollars 1.098bn, up from Dollars 1.012bn a year ago.
Non-interest income was Dollars 481m, against Dollars 471m.
NationsBank, which owns Panmure Gordon, the UK stockbroker, said its Tier
One ratio of capital to assets was 7.61 per cent compared to 7.17 per cent a
year ago.
Mr Hugh McColl, chairman of NationsBank, said he was particularly encouraged
that credit quality improved and the loan portfolio grew in a generally weak
economic environment.
In New England, Shawmut National, a regional bank, said its net income in
the first quarter was Dollars 36.3m, down from Dollars 43.3m a year ago. The
bank said this was due to lower securities gains and to charges taken in
relation to property loans, branch closures and staff reductions.
Banc One, the growing Ohio-based bank, said it agreed to acquire FirsTier
Financial, a bank with Dollars 3bn of assets that was based in Omaha,
Nebraska. Banc One, which has Dollars 70bn of assets, said it would acquire
the Omaha bank in a stock swap valued at Dollars 712m.

MR JOHN Dawkins, Australia's federal treasurer (finance minister) is coming

permission to take a larger stake in Australia's John Fairfax newspaper
group.
Mr Dawkins has until the end of the week to decide whether to allow Mr
Black's UK-based Telegraph group to increase its holding in Fairfax from 15
per cent to 25 per cent.
The application has attracted criticism from a wide range of public figures,
including Mr Martin Ferguson, president of the Australian Council of Trade

Mr Ferguson told Mr Dawkins in a letter that the government would fail its
first big test since winning re-election last month if it allowed Mr Black
to increase his stake.
'The policy of the ACTU is to ensure that foreign interests cannot control
either directly or indirectly the management or programme content of any

Mr Fraser, who campaigned against the acquisition of Fairfax in 1991 by the
Tourang consortium led by Mr Black, said the high level of overseas
investment in the Australian media was a serious problem.
He said a takeover of Fairfax by Mr Kerry Packer, the media entrepreneur,
would be preferable to an increase in the minority holding Mr Black acquired
in 1991, because foreign control was a more important issue than
concentration of ownership.
'Kerry's a good businessmen and he's very much an Australian. If we are
going to have . . . control by individuals I would far sooner (have) Kerry
Packer . . . than Conrad Black,' Mr Ferguson said.
Mr Packer owns about 10 per cent of Fairfax through his privately-owned
Consolidated Press Holdings group, but would have to give up control of the
Channel Nine commercial television network before launching a full bid.
Opposition to Mr Black's application among Labor MPs has been muted since
the election because of the promotion to the government of several prominent
critics.
However, Mr Barry Jones, Labor's federal president, was one of five senior
backbench MPs who signed a letter last week urging Mr Dawkins to block the
Telegraph group's application.
Mr Dawkins is believed not to have made a final decision on the application,
which is likely to be discussed by the federal cabinet today.
Tourang acquired Fairfax for ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1bn) after the group
was put into receivership, following a bungled buy-out of family
shareholders by Mr Warwick Fairfax.
The group publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial
Review and The (Melbourne) Age. It is the principal competitor to News
Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's US-controlled media group, which is
Australia's largest newspaper publisher.

for sharp upturn

<TEXT>
TRAVELERS, the US compo-site insurer in which Primerica holds a 27 per cent
stake, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 195m for the first
three months of 1993, although the figure was boosted by the inclusion of
Dollars 123m of realised investment gains.
In the first quarter of 1992, Travelers made after-tax profits of Dollars
224m. However, this figure was also distorted, by Dollars 2m of realised
investment losses and a one-off Dollars 170m gain related to accounting rule
changes.
The Hartford-based insurer said yesterday that operating profits in the
first quarter were Dollars 72m, against Dollars 56m. Mr Edward Budd,
chairman, suggested the results left the group 'on target for achieving a
sharp improvement in our operating performance in 1993'.
He noted that the group's property-casualty, managed care and employee
benefits, and financial services divisions all reported an increase in
profits, year-on-year.
The advance in the property-casualty division, moreover, came in spite of
higher catastrophe losses - up from Dollars 7m to Dollars 21m after tax -
resulting from the severe winter storms.
Travelers - badly hit by a large, souring portfolio of property-related
investments - said the underperforming mortgage loan and real estate
portfolio remained at Dollars 5.1bn, unchanged from the end-1992 figure.
Travelers shares gained Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 30 1/8 in New York
yesterday.

<TEXT>
UNISYS, the US computer and electronics group, achieved earnings growth in
its first quarter in spite of a decline in revenues. Continuing its recovery
from heavy losses in 1989-91, it reduced debts and reported strong
cash-flow, with the highest operating margins in five years.
Net earnings before special items were Dollars 56.8m, or 16 cents per
primary share and 23 cents per fully-diluted share, which includes
convertible preferred stock and convertible bonds. Including a special gain,
net income was Dollars 260.6m and earnings per share Dollars 1.39 primary
and Dollars 1.06 fully diluted.
Earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations.
Special items included a charge of Dollars 26.4m for the settlement of legal
actions connected with the sale of the Sperry Aerospace Group in December
1986, and two accounting changes that produced a net gain of Dollars 230m.
In the same period last year, net income was Dollars 48.3m, or 11 cents per
common share.
Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 1.91bn, down from Dollars 2.01bn.
Revenue growth in the US commercial information systems market was more than
offset by continued market weakness in Europe and Japan and the negative
effects of exchange rates.
Debt, net of cash, stood at Dollars 1.5bn, the lowest since the company was
formed in 1986. Unisys said that, as anticipated, worldwide orders declined
in the quarter.

REICHMANN International, the property investment joint venture between the

yesterday it had recruited Mr Leonard Chazen as deputy chief executive,
writes Alan Friedman.
Mr Paul Reichmann, chairman of Reichmann International, said he had worked
with Mr Chazen when the latter had served as an adviser to Olympia &amp; York,
the troubled property company founded by the Reichmann family.
Mr Chazen, who will be president of Reichmann International's US division,
was previously a managing director of Tishman Speyer Properties, a property
developer. Mr Chazen is expected to lead Reichmann International's team in
advising Mr Soros's separate Dollars 500m Quantum Realty Fund.

<TEXT>
ABITIBI-PRICE said it had taken the first step in a long-expected financial
turnround in the first quarter, with a strengthening newsprint market and
tight cost control.
The loss from continuing operations was CDollars 28.8m (USDollars 22.9m), or
42 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 37.9m, or 56 cents, a year
earlier.
Sales were CDollars 471m against a restated CDollars 379m.
'Though we are not yet profitable, we have shown the first year-over-year
improvement in quarterly results of our core newsprint business since 1988,'
said Mr Ronald Oberlander, president.
Rising newsprint demand was based on advertising gains in the eastern US,
along with some build-up in inventories - partly due to fears of stoppages
in eastern Canada mills.
The unions have targeted Abitibi for a pattern-making contract. Nearly all
the eastern Canada contracts run out on April 30.
Abitibi's shipments to Europe came up against Scandinavian competition
following last year's devaluations, but Asian and Latin American markets
were firm. Groundwood papers, of which Abitibi is a large producer, lagged
the newsprint market's strength.

THE SLOWER pace of earnings growth for the US pharmaceuticals industry was
reflected yesterday in the first-quarter results unveiled by leading drugs
companies.
Merck, the world's biggest drugs company, posted slightly
better-than-expected profits for the quarter, but the improvement lagged the
company's historical strength and reflected the impact of inflation and
unfavourable exchange rates.
Stripping out accounting changes last year, Merck's 1993 first-quarter net
income rose 10 per cent to Dollars 613.8m, or 54 cents a share, from Dollars
559m, or 48 cents. Including accounting changes, the company earned Dollars
96.6m, or 8 cents, in the 1992 quarter.
Sales advanced to Dollars 2.38bn from Dollars 2.22bn. Mr Roy Vagelos,
chairman and chief executive, said price increases had virtually no effect
on sales growth. Sales in the quarter were led by new products.
Merck reiterated its predictions of moderate earnings growth for 1993,
reflecting worldwide healthcare cost-containment measures and an
increasingly turbulent and competitive environment in the US.
Eli Lilly reported a 16 per cent decline in underlying first-quarter
earnings to Dollars 373.5m, or Dollars 1.27, on essentially flat sales of
Dollars 1.56bn. The company warned investors in March that slower sales of
several important drugs could reduce first-quarter earnings per share by
more than 20 per cent.
Lilly's net income for the three months, including accounting changes in
both years, was Dollars 362.6m, or Dollars 1.23, against Dollars 325.8m, or
Dollars 1.10.
American Cyanamid, the pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, turned in
underlying first-quarter profits of Dollars 118.7m, or Dollars 1.32, up from
Dollars 114.8m, or Dollars 1.25, a year ago. Including accounting changes,
Cyanamid had a deficit in the latest quarter of Dollars 433.7m, or Dollars
4.82.
Sales in the quarter to March 31 rose 1.6 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn, from
Dollars 1.38bn.
Its agricultural segment had strong sales of crop protection products, but
the medical side posted a decline in first-quarter sales. Its chemicals arm
unveiled an operating loss, largely linked to accounting standards.
In February, Cyanamid said it would spin off its Dollars 1bn chemicals
business to shareholders later this year.
Warner-Lambert unveiled an 11 per cent rise in underlying first-quarter
earnings to Dollars 181.1m, or Dollars 1.34, from Dollars 163.6m, or Dollars
1.22, last year.
Including accounting changes and a one-time charge in the latest quarter,
the company had net income of Dollars 182.1m, or Dollars 1.35. Monsanto, the
US chemicals group, has received approval to expand the use of its
Nutrasweet or aspartame artificial sweetener. The Food and Drug
Administration approved four new applications for the product, allowing it
to be used in most non-alcoholic drinks, confectioneries, commercial baked
goods and low-alcohol beer.

fresh trial is ordered

<TEXT>
INTEL'S share price plunged yesterday in response to an announcement late on
Friday that a new trial had been ordered in its copyright licensing dispute
with rival semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices.
The court set aside an earlier decision preventing AMD from competing with
Intel in the lucrative market for 486 high-performance microprocessors used
in personal computers. Yesterday, AMD said it would enter the 486
microprocessor market immediately.
Intel's stock closed down Dollars 12 1/4 at Dollars 97 3/4 yesterday in New
York in very heavy trading, with 17.7m shares changing hands.
In a decision announced on Friday, US district court judge William Ingram
ruled that Intel had failed to produce documents that were relevant to the
copyright dispute, preventing AMD from getting a fair trial in litigation
decided last June.
Pending the outcome of the new trial, there is no legal barrier preventing
AMD from shipping microprocessors that incorporate Intel microcode, the
software that controls the functions of a microprocessor, AMD said.
AMD will begin shipments of a 486, using Intel's microcode, this month, but
will continue development of its own microcode and introduce new versions of
the 486 later.
'The worldwide computer industry has been held hostage to an unfairly
maintained monopoly on 486 microprocessors,' said Mr WJ Sanders, chairman
and chief executive officer of AMD.

PRIMERICA, the US financial services group, yesterday reported a 17 per cent
increase in first-quarter operating earnings to Dollars 179.3m after another
record performance by its Smith Barney brokerage subsidiary.
Net income for the three months totalled Dollars 190.3m, following a charge
of Dollars 16.7m related to changes in the accounting for post-retirement
benefits and a one-off addition to earnings of Dollars 27.7m. The latter
came from investment portfolio gains, the sale of the group's remaining
interest in the consumer catalogue company Fingerhut, and a contribution
from portfolio gains earned by Travelers, the insurance company part-owned
by Primerica.
Net income in the first quarter last year was Dollars 192.1m, which also
included special charges and gains.
Smith Barney was once again the star of the Primerica show. The Wall Street
brokerage house posted record profits of Dollars 57.5m, earned on record
revenues of Dollars 411.1m. Earnings from broking commissions, investment
banking, and asset management were all buoyant. They helped offset a decline
in principal trading revenues, which were hit by poor returns from
mortgage-backed securities trading.
First-quarter results were not affected by the acquisition of the Shearson
retail broking and asset management business. Mr Sanford Weill, chairman of
Primerica, said the purchase of Shearson would be completed by early July.
Earnings from Primerica's consumer finance services division rose 8 per cent
in the quarter to Dollars 48.3m, due primarily to a decline in loan losses.
The insurance services business contributed earnings of Dollars 47.2m, up
slightly on the same quarter a year ago.
Primerica's results had little impact on the group's share price, which has
more than doubled over the past year. Yesterday, the stock eased Dollars
7/8 to close at Dollars 46 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The performance, struck on revenues 10 per cent higher at Dollars 3.3bn,
reflected strong profits from each of the group's five main divisions -
music, publishing, filmed entertainment, the Home Box Office (HBO)
programming division and the cable operating subsidiary.
The first-quarter result was also helped by the redemption of some Dollars
3.2bn of preferred stock issued at the time of the merger of Time and Warner
three years ago and by other significant steps toward debt restructuring
taken by Mr Gerald Levin, the new Time Warner chairman.
Mr Levin noted yesterday that progress continued during the quarter as
preferred stock was replaced by lower-cost and long-term debt. He said work
on lengthening the maturities of debt and reducing financing costs would
continue during 1993.
Until more of the preferred stock is redeemed Time Warner will still have a
net loss after paying dividends on the preferred paper. For the first
quarter, this loss was Dollars 124m, down from Dollars 150m a year before.
Time Warner's publishing division showed an operating profit before interest
and depreciation charges that was 27 per cent improved at Dollars 56m.
Revenues were Dollars 731m, up from Dollars 672m in the first three months
of 1992.
The music division had Dollars 160m of operating profits before interest and
depreciation, a rise of 13 per cent year-on-year. Revenues were Dollars
795m, against Dollars 764m.
The Warner Brothers filmed entertainment business recorded Dollars 104m
operating profit on the same basis, up from Dollars 96m a year ago. Revenues
were Dollars 898m, compared with Dollars 777m.
The HBO business achieved record operating earnings of Dollars 55m, against
Dollars 52m. HBO's revenues were Dollars 359m, up from Dollars 351m.
The Time Warner cable operating subsidiary, which is engaged in building an
inter-active and multimedia network in Orlando, Florida, had 12 per cent
better profits of Dollars 255m. Revenues were Dollars 546m, up from Dollars
511m.
Capital Cities/ABC, the media and publishing group that controls the ABC
Television Network, turned in first-quarter operating income of Dollars
140.9m, up from Dollars 97.9m. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.18bn,
up from Dollars 1.09bn.
At the net level, the group made Dollars 70.5m profits before special
charges, against Dollars 41.7m. After deducting charges related to changes
in accounting the 1993 net profit was Dollars 58.4m, against a loss of
Dollars 101.5m a year ago.

FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro takes CDollars
1.3bn charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ONTARIO Hydro, Canada's largest power utility, is to take a CDollars 1.3bn
(USDollars 1.03bn) charge this year to cover the cost of its restructuring.
About 4,500 staff will be leaving, including senior managers.
The charge will include a penalty of several hundred million dollars for
cancellation of a multi-billion 15-year power contract. The contract was
signed with Manitoba Hydro but is now considered superfluous because of lack
of growth in the Ontario market.
The charge also takes in CDollars 500m for the staff reductions. 'We're
taking the big hit in 1993,' said Mr Maurice Strong, chairman, who was
appointed last year to reverse the deterioration in Ontario Hydro's
fortunes.
The company is being divided into three groups:
Ontario Hydro Enterprises, headed by Mr Strong and handling the marketing of
expertise abroad and development of new technology;
Ontario Hydro Electricity, run by Mr Allan Kupcis, president, and operating
80 nuclear, coal and hydro-generating plants and the distribution grid;
Ontario Hydro Energy, handling conservation and customer relations and
headed by Mr John Fox, a Canadian formerly with Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in
California.
The utility is revaluing assets to be placed into each group and allocation
of its CDollars 34bn debt.
Mr Strong said that Ontario Hydro would now sell power at competitive rates
and costs would be tailored to set the market.

FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Chrysler returns to black on
strong new model sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US car manufacturer which is bouncing back from financial
difficulties, yesterday underscored the success of its new model
introductions by reporting first-quarter earnings of Dollars 530m, excluding
accounting changes.
The profits compared with a loss of Dollars 231m, excluding special factors,
in the same period of last year, and were struck on sales and revenues up 33
per cent to Dollars 10.9bn from Dollars 8.19bn.
While the US vehicle market has been recovering only gradually from
recession, Chrysler's sales and market share have been rocketing due to the
introduction of several boldly-styled new vehicles, including its LH series
of full-sized cars.
The company's share of the US new vehicle market rose 2.5 percentage points
in the quarter to 15.5 per cent, while its sales volume rose 24.2 per cent.
First-quarter earnings per share totalled Dollars 1.57 before accounting
changes, ahead of the Wall Street consensus forecast, yet the company's
shares dipped Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 42 on the New York stock
exchange.
Mr David Healy, an analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities, said the share price
reaction was a 'bit of a mystery' in view of the results and was probably
due to profit-taking by investors.
A contributory factor could have been confirmation by Chrysler that its
plants would be affected by a lot of model changes in the third quarter.
The company reported a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 4.15bn, or
Dollars 12.81 a share, after taking a one-time non-cash charge of Dollars
4.7bn for a change in its methods of accounting for retirees' health
benefits. However, it warned Wall Street of the size of this charge at the
start of April.
Chrysler Financial, the group's financial services arm, reported
first-quarter earnings of Dollars 37m before a one-time Dollars 29m charge
for the same accounting changes.
That compared to Dollars 60m of earnings in the first quarter of last year
before a Dollars 51m gain from changes in new accounting standards for
taxes.
Chrysler Financial said the figures had been hit by higher borrowing costs
and lower levels of non-automotive assets, partly offset by lower credit
loss provisions.
In the first quarter of last year, the Chrysler group reported a net loss of
Dollars 13m, or 7 cents a share, after a one-time gain of Dollars 218m for
new tax accounting methods, a gain of Dollars 88m from a sale of shares in
Mitsubishi Motors, and a Dollars 63m loss on investments.

FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Lafarge bids Pta36bn for Asland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAFARGE Coppee, the big French construction group, yesterday announced a
Pta36bn (Dollars 318m) share swap bid for full control of Asland, the
second-biggest Spanish cement company in which it has a 54 per cent stake.
Under the terms of the bid, Lafarge will offer two of its shares for every
nine of Asland's. Lafarge acquired its stake in 1989. The French group,
which is advised by Kleinwort Benson, will be issuing a maximum of 4.7m
shares, representing 8 per cent of its equity capital, to make the offer at
an extraordinary general meeting on May 25.
The downturn in Spanish cement consumption is not forecast to touch bottom
until late next year and is unlikely to return to 1992 levels until 1996.
Asland has a capacity of 5.9m tonnes, representing 15.9 per cent of Spain's
installed capacity, and is the main producer in the Madrid region and in
central Spain. The swap bid values each Asland share at Pta1,730, which
represents a 21 per cent premium on the opening price last Friday but well
down on Asland's book value of Pta2,200 per share.
'It is not a generous price but it is a reasonable deal,' said Mr Paul
Farrow, chief analyst at FG, Madrid brokers. Asland's net profits slid to
Pta3.9bn last year from Pta8.6bn in 1991 and Pta11.7bn in 1990. The company
is forecast to have flat profits and a high price/earnings ratio over the
next two years.
Lafarge's decision to buy out the minority shareholders may have been
prompted by the aggressive acquisition policy of Mexico's Cemex group which
bought a series of companies, including the main domestic producers
Valenciana and Sanson, last year in order to corner nearly 30 per cent of
Spain's cement market.
The French construction group is seeking a cheaper purchase. According to
FG, Lafarge will be paying Pta17,000 for every tonne of cement sold by
Asland whereas Cemex paid some Pta25,000 per tonne sold in its 1992
acquisitions.
Lafarge has not set a minimum acceptance level for its offer and has not
disclosed the success rate of its bid.

AUSTRIAN Airlines, the Austrian state-controlled carrier, saw its operating
loss jump last year to Sch437.1m (Dollars 39m) from Sch156.9m in 1991.
No dividend will be paid for last year. The airline is expecting a similar
loss this year and plans no dividend for 1993.
Austrian, which is one of four European airlines studying combined
operations, said its revenues rose 12.1 per cent to Sch11.1bn, but operating
expenses advanced 12.9 per cent to Sch11.6bn to produce a loss of Sch524.7m
from flights and associated services.
The loss was reduced slightly by a Sch87.6m financial result, down 63 per
cent from the previous year. Cash-flow was off 3.9 per cent to Sch1.04bn.

<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-OSAKE-PANKKI, Finland's leading commercial bank, expects to almost
halve losses in 1993 to about FM2bn (Dollars 345m).
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chief executive, said the forecast reflected the
sharp drop in Finnish interest rates which was expected to lead to a big
reduction in credit losses. Last year, the bank's pre-tax deficit was
FM3.7bn.
Mr Voutilainen said the bank was expecting a big drop in credit losses
related to small and medium-sized companies which last year accounted for
FM3bn of total write-offs of FM4.3bn.
'Non-performing loans in this sector are gradually levelling off, which is
an indication that we will have fewer problems in the near future,' he
stated.
The drop in Finnish interest rates, which at 8.5 per cent are half last
autumn's 17 per cent level, should lead to a drop in bankruptcies, he added.
KOP expects credit losses in the personal sector to increase from last
year's FM400m level, because of rising unemployment.

The company said it would pay an unchanged dividend of DM7 on common stock

FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Volvo may disclose chairman's
salary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Volvo, the Swedish vehicle maker, may tomorrow make public for
the first time details of the salary and benefits of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar,
its chairman, in a bid to stave off pressure from small shareholders angry
over reports of excessive executive remuneration at the lossmaking company.
Leaders of Aktiespararna, the Swedish shareholders' association, plan to
demand details of Mr Gyllenhammar's pay at Volvo's annual meeting in
Gothenberg tomorrow which is expected to be attended by about 2,000
stockholders.
They also want to know the salary package of Mr Soren Gyll, the chief
executive appointed last year, and the severance deal granted to his
predecessor, Mr Christer Zetterberg, and other executives who left the
company last year.
The company last year fell to a record loss of SKr4.75bn (Dollars 610m)
after financial items, and for the first time cut its dividend, by 50 per
cent.
Volvo yesterday denied reports that Mr Zetterberg, 42, had received a golden
handshake of SKr75m and an annual salary until retirement of more than
SKr400,000. The board, which will meet tomorrow morning, is expected to
issue a statement in advance of the shareholders' meeting giving at least
some of the details demanded by Aktiespararna in the hope of defusing a
rumpus.
The company said it was possible this would include details of Mr
Gyllenhammar's remuneration, which Volvo has never before published. Swedish
press reports have speculated that his package amounts to several million
dollars per year, including the use of a private jet and other perks.
The small shareholders face an obstacle in forcing greater disclosure by the
board as they need to win 10 per cent of votes in the company to push
through any resolution. They appear unlikely to receive any help from
Renault, the French car and truck maker which is the biggest shareholder in
Volvo, with almost 10 per cent of the parent company.
Renault declined to say how the company would act in the issue, but said:
'We support the management of Volvo.'
Like the Swedish pension funds and insurance companies that are the other
main large shareholders, Renault's chief concern is to get Volvo back in
profit. In that, the management of Mr Gyllenhammar may be an issue, but the
question of executive pay is regarded as peripheral, if publicly sensitive.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Buying Spanish minority for Pounds 23m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS intends to spend Pounds 23m in acquiring the remaining 8.8 per cent
of the shares in its Spanish subsidiary. It is making an offer of Pta825 per
share which values them at 25 per cent over the price quoted on April 16.
The bank, which wholly owns most of its subsidiaries in Europe, said it
expected to gain regulatory approval for the deal from the Spanish
Securities Commission within 10 days. It subsequently expected to end the
local listing.
Barclays said the largest minority holder of Barclays Bank SA, in which it
first acquired an 80 per cent stake in 1981, had already indicated he would
accept for his holding of 4.06 per cent of total shares.
The bank listed its subsidiary on the Spanish exchange in 1988 in order to
establish a market in the shares for minority holders. However, it said
liquidity and turnover since then had been inadequate to achieve the
original aim.
Barclays Bank SA has assets of Pounds 220m, and contributed a profit of
Pounds 18m to the parent, which last year recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds
242m. The parent bank said the acquisition was in line with its preference
for whole ownership of its subsidiaries.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Cisco proposals include shake-up in SE
structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CITY lobby group is seeking a shake-up in the structure of the Stock
Exchange as part of its proposals for alterna-tives to the Unlisted
Securities Market which faces closure in 1996.
The City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) has drawn up proposals for a
three tier market which will be sent out to its members some time this week.
The tiers include: an international equity market made up of the top 350
securities; a national market for the majority of the remaining companies
listed both on the Official List and the USM; and an enterprise market with
minimum regulation for companies not on the Official List.
Mr Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Cisco, said the latter two tiers
would have separate governance from the international market. This should be
done under a Stock Exchange umbrella, he said.
However, 'it would mean a significant restructuring of the governing board
of the Stock Exchange'.
Cisco is also proposing that the class tests on the national market - ie,
the levels of disclosure - should be similar to those currently used on the
USM.
This would reduce the costs of maintaining a listing for companies on the
national market, the vast majority of which would be capitalised at less
than Pounds 50m.
Companies falling into the enterprise category would be higher risk, with no
trading record or market value requirements. However, Cisco argues that
investors should be protected from fraud rather than business risk.
Mr Balarkas said this could be done with existing regulations, such as
independently audited accounts and codes of practice for corporate
governance.
The group proposes that regulatory requirements for admission should be the
minimum possible under UK and EC law. This last market would be governed by
the same structure as the national market.
The Stock Exchange said the document raised several issues 'which we are
sure investors and companies would be concerned about at first sight'.
The working party, which is being set up to examine alternatives to the
closure of the USM and will be announced in the next few days, was expected
to study the proposals closely.
It is unlikely the Stock Exchange will accept proposals on easing the class
test requirements for the Official List. It is thought to argue that
investors would reject attempts to reduce corporate disclosure.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Quarto slips to Pounds 3.81m but confident
of brighter prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUARTO GROUP reported a dip in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.05m to Pounds
3.81m in what the publishing, marketing and production services company
described as the 'harshest year we have known'.
Sales in the year to December 31 rose from Pounds 35.1m to Pounds 39.4m.
The US-registered group said: 'Our determination not to trade sales for
margins has restricted our turnover growth this year, but it is important to
recognise that margins, once lost, are hard to regain.'
Quarto is involved in publishing in the UK, US, Europe, the Far East and
Australia, and said the diversity and geographic spread of its activities
had afforded the group a degree of protection from poor market conditions.
Profits were depressed by a Pounds 160,000 exceptional charge relating to an
aborted acquisition. There was also an extraordinary loss of Pounds 296,000
from the disposal of Lefax, which was sold to Filofax for Pounds 1.2m in
October.
The board said that because of these charges, the performance of the group
was better reflected by earnings per share of 16.2p (17.9p).
Quarto said prospects for this year were much brighter, with better
sentiment in the US after the election feeding through into better sales. A
similar effect had been seen in Australia, following last month's election,
and even in the UK sales had risen.
In view of the better prospects, the group increased its final dividend to
3.75875p (3.6375p), making a total for the year of 5.37125p (5.25p).

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Expansion helps Greenacre advance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENACRE GROUP, the USM-traded nursing home and residential care operator,
has completed another year of profitable growth, with pre-tax profits 49 per
cent higher for the 12 months ended January 31 1993.
The profit was Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 913,000) on FRS 3 basis, after charging
Pounds 65,000 for the loss on the sale of the home brewing business.
Turnover jumped from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 4.82m, including contributions
from acquisitions down from Pounds 681,000 to Pounds 410,000.
Mr Tony Acton, chairman, said beds under operation and/or development rose
from 334 to 460 and the number of homes from seven to 10.
He said the group's limited reliance on publicly funded residents would
leave it relatively unaffected by the initial confusion widely expected to
result from the Community Care reforms which were introduced on April 1.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 0.57p (0.47p) on increased capital
after conversion of preference shares into ordinary. The final dividend is
0.15p for a total of 0.28p (0.25p).

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: London &amp; Associated rises 14%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON &amp; Associated Investment Trust, the property investment group,
reported a 14 per cent rise from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 1.17m in pre-tax
profits for the year to the end of December on gross income which had
improved 16 per cent from Pounds 3.61m to Pounds 4.19m. Net assets at the
year end showed a gain of 5 per cent to 39.34p on a year earlier.
An independent valuation of the group's portfolio showed a 'creditable'
surplus. The acquisition of the Brunel Centre, Bletchley, since the year end
brings the total number of shops to more than 550 and the annual rental
income to over Pounds 5m.
Property operating profits were higher at Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 1.87m) with
other investments contributing a static Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 213,000).
Share of associates was Pounds 94,000 (Pounds 42,000).
Earnings were down slightly from 1.14p to 0.99p, but the dividend goes up
from 0.53p to 0.58p with a proposed final of 0.53p.
Bisichi Mining, in which London &amp; Associated has a 42 per cent interest,
showed a 57 per cent increased in pre-tax profits from Pounds 106,000 to
Pounds 166,000 in the 1992 calendar year. Earnings per share jumped from
0.75p to 1.34p and the proposed dividend goes up to 0.63p (0.6p)

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays names headhunters - Professionals
called in to advise on investor and public relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS, the UK's biggest bank, has appointed Spencer Stuart, the
international firm of headhunters, to advise it in its search for a new
chief executive.
It has also appointed Makinson Cowell, the investor relations consultants,
for advice on its relations with institutional shareholders, and Brunswick,
the public relations firm, on its public image.
Barclays' image has been battered over the past year by its poor financial
performance - it made a post-tax loss in 1992 of Pounds 343m  - and by last
year's controversial decision that Mr Andrew Buxton should combine the roles
of chairman and chief executive.
It has never in the past employed specialist investor relations consultants,
nor has it hitherto sought advice on its corporate image from a specialist
financial public relations firm.
Both Brunswick and Makinson Cowell are leaders in their fields. Their
combined fees for a full year's work for Barclays are likely to exceed
Pounds 200,000, according to a banker.
Mr Buxton is hopeful that the chief executive search should not take much
more than three months. Spencer Stuart will make its recommendation of the
best candidates to a board sub-committee, headed by Sir Denys Henderson,
chairman of ICI, the chemicals group.
A banker said he thought many of the leading candidates were likely to come
from outside the UK.
After pressure from shareholders, which believe that big companies should
not combine the chairman and chief executive positions, Mr Buxton decided in
March to relinquish the role of chief executive.
However, the bank has not wanted to disclose the name of the headhunting
firm, which was appointed within the past few weeks. 'It is highly
confidential', Mr Andrew Buxton said in a recent interview.
Spencer Stuart refused to comment on the appointment.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Second half sales boost for Asda Property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA Property Holdings has more than lived up to expectations with pre-tax
profits showing a gain of 36 per cent for 1992 at Pounds 6.02m, compared
with halved profits at the interim stage.
During the year the sale of the greater part of its tenanted residential
portfolio for Pounds 36m was completed, with a high proportion of it low
income or non-income producing.
This represented only slightly more than half of the total sales achieved
during the year of some Pounds 70m; the net result at the year end was a
reduction from Pounds 117m to Pounds 67m in net debt.
Rental income showed marginally ahead at Pounds 11.2m. With other sales and
additions the rent roll is now almost Pounds 13m which covers current
interest and overheads more than 1.4 times.
The impact on profit of the extraordinary level of sales was largely offset
by property write-downs amounting to Pounds 1.3m and costs of Pounds 1.1m
incurred in unwinding interest rate hedging against borrowings repaid.
Financing charges showed a drop from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 10.7m.
Mr Manny Davidson, chairman, told shareholders of progress on several fronts
including commercial property, the investment portfolio and development
projects.
He also said that the group had been able to generate trading profits of
more than Pounds 1m from new commercial ventures. The division was
continuing the contribution to profits in the current year.
He reported that investment acquisitions since the year end had been made
totalling Pounds 12m with a combined yield of 13 per cent. All were modern
properties let on long leases to a mix of good tenants and had potential for
capital appreciation through active management.
Earnings worked through at 8.1p (5.4p). The dividend total is increased to
2.1p (2p) with a recommended final payment of 1.45p.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Metropolitan back in the black
with Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL reductions in administrative and interest costs enabled Scottish
Metropolitan Property to return a pre-tax profit of Pounds 532,000 for the
half year ended February 15 1993.
That compared with a losses of Pounds 840,000 for the corresponding period
which were reduced to Pounds 490,000 by the year-end.
Net revenue from properties was marginally reduced to Pounds 9.96m compared
with Pounds 10.6m. The programme of sales remained ahead of schedule. Eight
investment properties were sold realising Pounds 16.3m and showing in
aggregate a 9.7 per cent reduction on book value. Major sales included
Pentland House, Edinburgh, and a unit on the Longield Industrial Estate,
Tunbridge Wells. Since the half year further disposals realised Pounds
7.15m.
Total borrowings were down to Pounds 157.8m and at April 15 had been cut
further to Pounds 150m. The company has negotiated an extension until
October 31 1995 of banking facilities. The total facilities, prior to final
repayment, are to reduce in tranches to Pounds 64.7m; outstanding borrowings
under those facilities at April 15 were Pounds 86m.
Earnings per share in the half year came to 0.43p (losses 1.38p). The
interim dividend is cut to 0.5p but it is intended to maintain 1.5p for the
year.

OVER THE six months to February 28 net asset value at EFM Dragon Trust has
jumped 61 per cent, reflecting strong performances from all Pacific stock

subsequent depreciation.
At February the asset value was 19.32p, against 12.03p at August 15 and
13.23p a year earlier.
The geographical split of the portfolio is: Hong Kong 17.4 per cent,
compared with 39.2 per cent in August 1992; Thailand 25 (16.3) per cent; and
Malaysia 18.8 (13.8) per cent.
Total revenue in the half year was Pounds 754,000 (Pounds 493,000) and

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Pinning its future on launching trusts -
The refocused Ivory &amp; Sime is planning to reassert itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE past 10 years have not been easy for Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based
fund management company whose star was once among the brightest in the
investment firmament.
But now the company is moving to reassert itself in the product which has
been at the heart of its success, the investment trust.
Yesterday, Ivory &amp; Sime launched its first investment trust in four years
after having remained in the background while competitor after competitor
came to the market with increasingly sophisticated products.
The trust, to be known as Income and Savings Investment Schemes, is expected
to raise Pounds 100m in new funds, and features an investment twist which
allows investors to capitalise on the more generous treatment of capital
gains tax.
Mr Gordon Neilly, finance director, said the company intends to launch as
many as four more trusts, one possibly as early as June, all of which will
be aimed at private investors rather than institutional clients.
'We see the return of the private investor as crucial to our strategy,' said
Mr Neilly, adding that he wants to increase the percentage of retail
investment trust business from its current level of 30 per cent.
Competition for institutional buyers of investment trusts has become much
tougher since many fund managers began running their own internal products,
Mr Neilly said, explaining why he wished to change the company's focus.
Other products are also likely to offer tax efficiency as a selling point.
Mr Neilly said the company has sat on the sidelines for so long 'because we
felt the time wasn't right and we didn't have the right product'.
But pension consultants say the company has also been too preoccupied with
its internal difficulties to concentrate on new product development or
marketing.
'Ten years ago, they were winning half of all the assignments out there,'
said one pension fund consultant. But a string of well-publicised defections
of senior management - who in the mid-1980s managed to take many of the
company's best clients with them - had left the firm floundering.
Investment performance suffered, and pension fund clients in particular
deserted it, consultants said.
The firm soldiered on through some tough years before refocusing its
institutional business and sharpening its expertise as an equities-oriented
specialist pension fund manager.
By 1990, when Ivory &amp; Sime had begun to recover in the performance league
tables and had set about assembling a high-quality investment team, it was
hit again by defections.
This time the former managing director, Mr David Ross, left with a string of
five senior executives to set up a new firm, Aberforth Partners. The former
chairman left as a result, and the company now has a completely new board of
directors.
Although the more recent defections did not appear to affect fund
performance - consultants say their specialist funds have achieved top half
performance over the past three or four years - new pension clients have not
been knocking at the door. 'All of our new business has been from existing
clients,' Mr Neilly said.
In addition to broadening its product range, Ivory &amp; Sime has taken the
unusual step of acquiring a telemarketing distribution company.
The company answers inquiries from potential clients who have responded to
the company's targetted newspaper advertising campaign.
Mr Neilly said he believes that up to 25 per cent of all sales of Ivory &amp;
Sime's new ISIS product will come through the distribution company, saving
considerable costs.
Ivory &amp; Sime, according to one pension consultant, is living proof of the
axiom that no one investment star is likely to shine in the firmament
indefinitely. The question for the company is whether it can make its star
shine once again.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ibstock Johnsen Pounds 27.6m in the red -
Despite signs of recovery no return to profitability is foreseen until 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBSTOCK JOHNSEN, the UK's third largest brick maker, barely broke even a the
trading level in the year to last December and said it was unlikely to
return to profitability until 1994.
But reinforcing reports that building activity is picking up in the UK, Mr
Colin Hope, Ibstock Johnsen's chairman, said demand for bricks had risen
sharply in the first three months of the year.
Ibstock Johnsen was reporting operating profits before exceptional items of
Pounds 382,000, down from Pounds 10.1m, on sales down 3 per cent at Pounds
277m.
As forewarned, the group made a Pounds 28.6m exceptional provision to cover
the cost of reorganisation, which will include the closure of four brick
plants over the next 18 months. A profit of Pounds 10.6m became a loss of
Pounds 27.6m at the pre-tax level.
Losses per share came out at 9.89p, against earnings of 2.58p last time, and
the group has cut its final dividend to 0.5p (3.75p), giving a total for the
year of 1p, down from 6p.
The brick industry had become only marginally profitable, according to Mr
Ian Maclellan, managing director. The group would this year be focusing on
generating cash by destocking, selling surplus assets and cutting capital
expenditure.
'The provisions will be sufficient to get our businesses in the US and the
UK back to a profitable position but we are, to some extent, delving in the
unknown,' said Mr Hope. He said there would be little benefit until 1994.
Trading in UK building products was hardest hit, with profits of Pounds
9.79m falling to Pounds 2.74m. In the US, a Pounds 683,000 loss grew to
Pounds 1.64m and in continental Europe profits slipped from Pounds 2.41m to
Pounds 2.12m.
The forest product trading loss also increased - from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds
2.83m. Mr Hope said that at 'current world prices, the business is unlikely
to be profitable in the short term'.
The chairman said he was confident of the economic recovery in the UK but
was less sure of the return to growth in the US.
At the end of December, net debt rose to Pounds 45m and gearing climbed to
19 per cent - after a Pounds 15m write-down in the value of reserves to take
account of the reduced value of clay reserves which will no longer be
exploited after the imminent closures.
COMMENT
If recent estimates of the speed of recovery in house building are to be
believed, six months' supply of bricks held in the UK could already be
falling. Taken with the lower depreciation charge, after yesterday's asset
write-downs, profits should start to come back for the group this year even
if brick makers are not able to make price rises stick with the
housebuilders. But Ibstock Johnsen has badly underperformed the sector
because of recession in another of its markets - pulp. For that market to
turn, further capacity will need to go, and that will take time. However,
one advantage of recessions in each of its markets - house building, bricks
and pulp - is that the bounce, when it comes, could be sharp. Investors
should not, however, hold their breath. This year profits should be only
marginally higher. In 1994, however, pre-tax profits could jump to Pounds
8.8m, or 2.8p of earnings.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Regalian confidence after sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGALIAN Properties yesterday told shareholders it had agreed the sale of
eight flats in its Kensington Palace Gardens development, its ambitious
residential project that has been on the market for the last two years.
Sale prices of the flats were not disclosed, but analysts believed they were
equivalent to a reduction in the building's value from an initial asking
price of Pounds 117m two years ago to about Pounds 45m.
The flats are being bought by Hong Kong and Middle Eastern clients, who were
encouraged to purchase in the UK by the devaluation of sterling.
Mr David Goldstone, chairman of Regalian, said there was substantial
interest in the other 12 apartments in the block. Sales of the remaining
residential portfolio continued to be buoyant, he said.
'It is confidently expected that in respect of both the Kensington Palace
Gardens project and the Central London portfolio, the majority of remaining
units will be disposed of within the current financial year.'
Regalian's banks have agreed in principle to extend its facilities until
December 1994. The company said that its improved cashflow resulting from
property sales would give it the opportunities to buy development sites on
attractive terms.
The shares price rose from 15 1/4 p to 19p.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: NHL wins approval for Eurobond repayment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Home Loans, the mortgage lender, yesterday won approval at a
bondholders meeting to repay a DM150m (Pounds 61m) Eurobond issue on
schedule in June.
The agreement means that NHL will face no debt repayment obligations until
November 1995, according to Mr Nigel Terrington, the group's finance
director.
Earlier this year, NHL had abandoned plans to reschedule the D-Mark
Eurobond. But in order to redeem the bonds at maturity, NHL had to gain the
approval of its dollar bond holders, whose bonds were restructured along
with NHL's bank debt last year, in order to extend their maturity to
December 1995.
The company has a second D-mark Eurobond outstanding, which falls due in
November 1993.
NHL was rescued by its banks from collapse last year, and is now paying
interest of 200 basis points over Libor (the London interbank offered rate)
on its Pounds 400m of bank debt, compared with 30 basis points over Libor,
prior to the restructuring. It is also paying 200 basis points over dollar
Libor on its rescheduled dollar bonds.
Since last year, NHL has been running down its mortgage business and
concentrating on repaying its debt. It now has a mortgage book of Pounds
325m, after removing more than Pounds 2bn of mortgages from its balance
sheet through securitisation.

FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Waste Management up 26%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE MANAGEMENT International, the UK-listed overseas arm of Waste
Management of the US, yesterday reported first quarter profits in line with
expectations and said it was continuing to benefit from acquisitions and
internal growth.
Pre-tax profits increased 26 per cent to Pounds 34.4m in the three months to
March 31 on turnover 18 per cent higher at Pounds 220.9m. Most of the
increase in sales was due to acquisitions, although there were also gains
due to price increases and foreign exchange swings.
Europe remained the company's most important market, accounting for 82 per
cent of sales compared to 77 per cent last year. Asia continued to grow in
importance, accounting for 10 per cent of sales. The company is involved in
or studying projects in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Its hazardous waste treatment plant in Hong Kong is due to begin commercial
operations in the next few days. The company has also submitted four
proposals for waste energy plants in Taiwan.
Earnings increased 19.6 per cent to 6.1p. That fell in the middle of
forecasts issued last week by the company following concerns, mainly in the
US, that profits were below expectations. The company does not pay
dividends.
The shares, which were listed last year at 585p, gained 1p to 544p.

<TEXT>
CHASE MANHATTAN, the big New York bank engaged in a wide-ranging
restructuring programme, yesterday turned in higher first-quarter earnings
and revealed plans to raise Dollars 750m (Pounds 500m) of new equity capital
while also writing off Dollars 1bn of commercial property loans in a
significant change in strategy in the property sector.
Net profits for the quarter were Dollars 153m, up from Dollars 141m a year
ago. The net income was struck after a Dollars 500m extraordinary gain
reflecting accounting changes related to income tax.
The first-quarter 1993 profit also reflected special provisions of Dollars
884m taken after the bank decided to segregate about Dollars 2bn of 'lower
quality domestic commercial real estate assets' and to sell these in the
next few months. In addition to the charge the bank also used Dollars 135m
of its loan loss reserves, thus marking down the total value of the Dollars
2bn property portfolio to Dollars 1bn.
Mr Art Ryan, president of Chase, said selling the Dollars 2bn of property
assets would reduce the bank's bad debt provisions by Dollars 750m for the
rest of 1993.
Chase also said it had informed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
it planned to raise Dollars 750m of additional equity capital by way of a
share offer that will be underwritten by a syndicate led by Goldman Sachs,
First Boston, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and SG Warburg Securities.
Mr Tom Labrecque, chairman of Chase, said the aim of the property loan
disposal plan and share offer proposal was 'to take advantage of better
liquidity in the real estate market in order to shrink the size of the
property loan portfolio' while raising capital to continue financing the
bank's strategy of focusing on worldwide corporate, information and clearing
services and domestic New York area retail banking and consumer products.
At the end of March Chase's US commercial property loan portfolio totalled
Dollars 4.6bn, down from Dollars 8.2bn a year ago.
Chase also made other bad debt provisions of Dollars 360m, compared with
Dollars 300m a year ago. The bank wrote off Dollars 220m of loans in the
quarter, compared with Dollars 294m a year ago. Its tier one ratio of
risk-weighted assets to capital was 7.1 per cent at the end of the first
quarter, from 5.7 per cent.

<TEXT>
MALAYSIA has reached preliminary agreement with a consortium of local
businesses and Britain's North West Water to build and operate a national
sewerage scheme costing between MDollars 5bn (Pounds 1.27bn) and MDollars
6.3bn.
Malaysia's cabinet is understood to have approved the project in principal
in mid-February and the two sides are now negotiating terms and conditions.
Mr Bob Thian, North West Water's chief executive, said he hoped final
agreement would be reached by the end of the year.
The consortium plans to build, upgrade and operate sewerage systems in more
than 40 cities and towns throughout Malaysia. The agreement covers a 28-year
period and involves modernising existing waste water systems and building
new facilities.
North West Water said it will take a 25 per cent stake in the consortium. If
the contract is approved, North West will manage the project and operate the
sewerage systems. Berjaya, one of Malaysia's leading conglomerates, will
hold a 20 per cent stake while Aims Worldwide, another Malaysian company,
will take a 15 per cent stake. Malaysia's armed forces retirement fund and
police force investment co-operative will each hold 20 per cent.
North West has won a string of similar deals in recent months, including a
Pounds 160m waste water contract in Bangkok, Thailand. However, some
observers said they were surprised North West's partners had no track record
in water projects.
Berjaya is controlled by Mr Vincent Tan, one of the country's most
controversial businessmen, while Aims Worldwide is controlled by Mr Ghazi
Ramli, an executive director of the Berjaya group. Both men are believed to
have close connections with Malaysia's political leaders but analysts say Mr
Tan's company has no proven experience of handling such a large and complex
project.
Most of the financing for the project will come from syndicated loans, while
the consortium will also negotiate for a MDollars 500m low-interest loan
from the government. The consortium's total equity investment is not likely
to exceed Pounds 40m. Mr Thian said North West would not guarantee any of
the debt.

FT  20 APR 93 / ABF ahead 7.3 per cent to Pounds 161m on accounting change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED British Foods increased interim pre-tax profits by 7.3 per cent
to Pounds 161m, but non-trading items caused the rise.
Operating profits fell 9.7 per cent to Pounds 131m as the squeeze on milling
and baking margins continued and there was a reduction in retail profits.
However, Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said 'we anticipate that the full year's
profit figure will show some growth over that reported last year.' The 1992
pre-tax figure was Pounds 267m, restated from Pounds 297m.
He said there were opportunities for recovery in areas which were down and
growth in businesses which were ahead. The rise in prices as the green pound
devaluation was passed on would be beneficial in the second half.
The interim dividend was unchanged at 8.5p and any increase in dividends for
the year would be included in the second interim payment.
The figures were distorted by a change in the period end from mid-March to
the end of February and a switch to FRS 3. The 1992 interim profit was
restated from Pounds 175.2m for six months to Pounds 150m for 26 weeks. The
shares fell 16p to 479p on the results.
Group turnover rose 8.1 per cent to Pounds 2.04bn. UK manufacturing
operating profits fell Pounds 6m to Pounds 100m, although within that
British Sugar's profits increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 75m. Mr Weston
said that in milling and baking margins were 'very, very tight'. A recent
bread price increase had been accepted and 'the outlook is not so grim'.
The group's retail businesses, which include Quinnsworth and Crazy Prices in
the Irish Republic, increased sales 17 per cent to Pounds 593m but profits
fell from Pounds 23m to Pounds 13m as a price war raged.
Investment income rose by Pounds 10m to Pounds 45m and interest payable fell
from Pounds 19m to Pounds 15m. Mr Weston said the group's investments had
been well positioned for Black Wednesday, but the return in the second half
would be closer to current interest rates. Net cash at the half year end was
Pounds 282m (up from Pounds 206m). A Pounds 15m rise in the value of AB
Foods' stake in Berisford International, the food and property group, was
not included in profits. The comparable period did include an Pounds 11m
fall in the stake's value.
Earnings per share rose 12.7 per cent to 23.9p (from 21.2p).

FT  20 APR 93 / Berisford offers 239p a share for Clark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERISFORD International's proposed bid for C&amp;J Clark would be worth 239p a
share, the board of the private shoe company told shareholders in a circular
posted yesterday.
This is higher than the rumoured 205p a share, but includes 26p of deferred
cash relating to the sale of surplus Clark's property.
At 239p a share the company is valued at Pounds 184m. Clark said an offer of
239p would give a 165.6 per cent premium to the 90p at which the shares were
last traded and represented 19.9 times the average of the last three years
earnings per share.
The board said the offer was 'fair and reasonable' and seven of the 11
directors recommended it to shareholders. Three opposed the bid and one said
shareholders should be allowed to decide for themselves.
However, some family members who are against the sale were yesterday
consulting lawyers over the form of the proposals and legal action could
follow.
Clark board said that if Berisford, a food and property group, wins more
than 50 per cent of the votes at a special meeting to be held on May 7, but
its bid fails to gain 90 per cent acceptances, Clark would sell its business
to Berisford for cash and then recommend the liquidation of the company.
Berisford would only launch its bid if the proposal is approved at the
meeting. It would then offer 213p a share in cash, Berisford shares or
convertible loan stock. Surplus properties would then be sold and the
proceeds distributed to Clark shareholders.
Berisford said if Clark shareholders all took shares they would have a
majority of Berisford shares. Berisford shares were suspended at 128p
yesterday and will remain frozen until after the meeting.
The seven directors who recommended the bid said that 'there are no other
available alternatives which would provide a solution to Clark's
long-standing problems' and that the Berisford proposal was 'in the best
interests of Clark's'.
A statement from the three dissenting directors, who are non-executives and
family members, said Clark's three-year plan showed that the company could
be turned round to produce good profits and that 'it is unnecessary and
undesirable to sell C&amp;J Clark to Berisford'.

FT  20 APR 93 / Franc rises after Bank of France cuts interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday pulled off a double coup, after months of monetary rigour,
when it cut its official interest rates and saw the franc rise on the
foreign exchanges.
The cuts by the Bank of France - in its intervention rate from 9.10 per cent
to 8.75 per cent and in its five-10 day repurchase rate from 10 per cent to
9.75 per cent - reflected recent declines in domestic money market rates.
Further cuts, essential to reviving France's stalled economy, would have to
follow similar moves by the Bundesbank, economists in Paris agreed.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, hailed the 'very favourable'
performance of the franc which closed in Paris at FFr3.378 to the D-Mark.
But he acknowledged this reflected the fact that the official interest rate
cuts just 'consolidated' movements on the money markets since the
centre-right came into government last month.
Later today Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, is due to put the
finishing touches to a draft statute to give the Bank of France autonomy in
monetary policy. At the weekend he indicated that one possible difficulty
had been resolved by his decision to leave responsibility for supervising
commercial banks with the French central bank, in contrast to the system in
Germany where banking control does not lie with the Bundesbank.
But when he holds his first meeting with German chancellor Helmut Kohl in
Bonn on Thursday, Mr Balladur will be able to press his case for closer
Franco-German co-operation by arguing that France is well along the
institutional road towards a German-style monetary policy.
Shares on the Paris bourse in fact fell slightly. Bank economists said it
would take a bigger drop in rates to persuade French investors to start
switching their savings out of money market funds into equities but that
such a switch was necessary for the big privatisation programme planned by
the government.

SOUTH AFRICA last night appeared to have pulled back from the brink of
disaster after the funeral of Mr Chris Hani, the slain black leader,
provoked few significant incidents of violence.
No event in South African history - not even the release from prison in 1990
of Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress leader - has inspired such
emotion and mobilised such large crowds.
ANC marshalls battled to control 80,000 mourners who packed a soccer stadium
near the black township of Soweto and the tens of thousands who drove in a
funeral cortege to the white cemetery where Mr Hani was buried.
Peace monitors said most of the 100,000 people who took part in the day's
events were restrained, with only 200 to 400 youths involved in violence.
The monitors had feared the funeral, the largest of many in the history of
the liberation struggle, could spark off heavy violence.
But in spite of stone throwing, arson and looting, the toll of dead and
injured was much lower than expected. Six people were reported to have died,
with one of them killed by police. Three others were killed by shots fired
from a migrant workers' hostel, the sort of incident which occurs almost
daily in the low-intensity war between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom
party, its main black political rival.
Before the funeral began, 19 people died overnight in the black township of
Sebokeng, deaths which the ANC blamed on the so-called 'third force' linked
to the government security apparatus. Main motorways around Johannesburg
were closed for two hours at midday as hundreds of cars and buses travelled
to the Elspark cemetery near the multi-racial suburb where Mr Hani lived and
died.
Outside the cemetery, a handful of armed members of the far right Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) looked on as a guard of
honour from Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the ANC army, paraded
outside the graveyard. Most white residents kept a low profile.
Speeches by ANC leaders at the funeral and by President FW de Klerk in
parliament illustrated the deterioration in relations between the two
parties since Mr Hani's death.
Mr Mandela and Mr Joe Slovo, chairman of the South African Communist party,
delivered militant addresses which blamed the murder on the government. Mr
Slovo twice asked the crowd: 'Who killed Chris Hani?', inviting the reply
which he received: 'FW de Klerk.'
The president warned that the spate of killings which had followed Mr Hani's
death could ignite a race war.
With whites more despondent and fearful than at any time in the past, Mr de
Klerk condemned the ANC's planned six-week campaign of mass protest action,
saying it would 'set the stage for further violence'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors delivered a telling verdict on yesterday's cut in French interest
rates. The stability of the franc against the D-Mark underlined how far
sentiment has turned, but the new government should not break out the
champagne. The 35 basis point cut in the intervention rate simply brings
official rates into line with the drift of money market rates since the
election. Real rates remain painfully high and Mr Balladur is mulling over
higher taxes. French equities were rightly unimpressed. Efforts to raise the
tempo ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting will doubtless fall on
deaf ears.

FT  20 APR 93 / The Lex Column: AB Foods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABF seems to specialise in bare-knuckle fights. In the UK, the trench war in
milling and baking continues to grind down the participants. The industry
turns over some Pounds 3bn, yet it is making negligible profits and has
plenty of latent capacity. Exit costs are high, so breaking even in the hope
of an upturn may seem preferable to crystallising losses. ABF's shares
rallied in the wake of Tomkins' acquisition of RHM, presumably in the hope
that capacity would be cut quickly. So far that has not happened, and there
seems little reason to suppose that a mild economic recovery will stimulate
demand for bread.
In Ireland, ABF says it has regained the market share it lost in the
supermarket price war. However, margins have been mauled, and rebuilding
profitability will be a slow process. Only British Sugar offers comfort, yet
even here profits growth is dependent on rationalisation and the benefits of
green pound devaluation.
The one-off gains in investment income following sterling's exit from the
ERM are also unlikely to be repeated. With interest rates low, investors may
thus look for ABF's strong balance sheet to be used to greater effect. The
company has so far failed to find a suitable target to apply British Sugar's
expertise abroad. Until it does, prospects are dull.

FT  20 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Lafarge Coppee
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having paid through the nose in 1989 for its position in Spanish cement,
Lafarge Coppee is making amends. While it is offering minority shareholders
in Asland a 20 per cent premium to the market price, it is still paying a
discount to net assets. That will reduce the amount of goodwill being
charged against profits from the original purchase. It is also buying
unencumbered access to Pta 15bn of cash tucked away in Asland's balance
sheet. Since the all-paper offer increases Lafarge's share capital by 8 per
cent, the deal looks not unlike a substitute rights issue.
Even so, the timing is curious. The Spanish construction downturn shows
every sign of deepening. Cheap cement imports are adding to the cyclical
pain. Following Cemex's acquisition of a 30 per cent market share last year,
Lafarge may be hoping to force further consolidation. Prices might then
stabilise even if volume remains poor. With the likes of Holderbank present,
there may be a chance to establish the price discipline existing elsewhere
in Europe.
Other shareholders in Asland might feel unenthusiastic about an offer paid
in shares by a company which has underperformed the French market by 30 per
cent in three years. With Lafarge already in control and the industrial
outlook so bleak, though, the minority has scant chance of forcing better
terms.

FT  20 APR 93 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profit taking may have pulled Wall Street lower after Friday's record high,
but retail investors are clearly still keen on equities. This enthusiasm
sits somewhat oddly with the wider markets' sceptical attitude to the
dollar. If the economy is picking up fast enough to produce the earnings
recovery which the equity market needs, then the dollar might be expected to
do well too.
Part of the answer may lie with the nature of the US recovery. Growth has
slowed from the 4 per cent expansion seen in the last quarter of 1992. The
expansion is also biased towards investment and productivity gains and away
from consumers. Indeed, with individuals still retrenching and personal
incomes growing slowly, a consumer boom looks unlikely. Inflation is subdued
and expectations of interest rate rises have eased. That both encourages
investors to continue switching funds out of deposits into equities,
particularly capital goods stocks, and reduces the dollar's attractions.
Modest growth and low inflation may also allow bond yields to fall further
if the deficit reduction process keeps going. If it fails, private investor
liquidity is a poor support for a market which looks historically expensive.

FT  20 APR 93 / The Lex Column: No ace in the hole
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Channel Tunnel project, which began in a euphoric wave of entente
cordiale, looks set to end in a deluge of disputation. Eurotunnel is now
pursuing claims against a rolling stock manufacturer, British Rail and SNCF
as well as both nations' governments. After yesterday's bitter exchanges,
the dispute with the TML consortium looks even further from resolution.
Who will emerge as the 'winner' is debatable given that both sides have
already lost. The contractors can ill-afford the cash to complete the
project's commissioning. They have already been forced to take substantial
provisions. But Eurotunnel is scarcely profiting from TML's discomfiture.
Absurdly, the delay in opening could cost Eurotunnel more in lost revenues
than the sums in dispute with TML. In a more rational world, Eurotunnel's
bankers might be expected to bash heads together.
The good news is the spectacular project will open some time next year.
Eurotunnel's shares have risen strongly in anticipation. But the company's
financial vice will not immediately ease on opening. Its revenue projections
for 1994 have fallen drastically from Pounds 504m to Pounds 260m. Its peak
funding requirement may climb to little shy of Pounds 10bn. Even with a
further injection of Pounds 850m of debt and equity finance, Eurotunnel will
not reach a cash break-even position until 1997. There remain massive
variables in Eurotunnel's funding, revenues and interest charges, which
suggests the shares should be shunned. Emotion rather than reason will,
however, probably continue to drive the share price.

The motorways were strewn with broken glass for miles, as mourners broke the

How does the word's most powerful transport minister travel the world? When
Federico Pena, the US secretary of transportation, returns home today after
talks in London with his UK opposite number, he will be travelling the same
way as he arrived - by economy class, albeit on an American-owned and built
jumbo.
Pena, like his boss, is said to be very sensitive about spending taxpayers'
money. But these sorts of PR gimmicks rarely survive for long - so Observer
is offering a bottle of the finest malt whisky for the first recorded
sighting of Pena travelling in any style other than economy.

When it comes to stock market forecasters there are good firms and bad.
However, BZW has broken new ground by venturing into a particularly tricky
area of British forecasting - the weather.
As one of the lead brokers on the rights issue for Zeneca, ICI's bioscience
subsidiary, BZW has pulled out all the stops to show off its client. Tucked
away inside an impressively bullish 96-page report is a prediction that
Zeneca's agrochemicals and seeds business will enjoy a 10 per cent rise in
turnover and a 41 per cent rise in operating profit this year.
One of the key assumptions behind the upbeat forecast seems to be that just
because last year's climatic conditions were 'poor', the weather should be
better this year. Even the Met Office would shy away from putting its name
to a forecast like that.

A conflict of political theology is coming to a head at the Department of
Trade and Industry.
Neil Hamilton, the free-market minister in charge of the government's
deregulation initiative, is pressing for the abolition of regulations that
insist a British pint of beer must be just that - exactly a pint. The froth
cannot be included. Hamilton argues that drinkers know if they are getting
short measures and can remove their custom. It is all unnecessary red-tape,
he says.
Enter Edward Leigh, industry minister and as much a Thatcherite as Hamilton.
But the regulations on a pint of beer were largely his creation and a
notable publicity winner for him back in December 1991. He is putting up a
strong fight to stop Hamilton getting his way. Right arms they may be but
cheers is not the word.

FT  20 APR 93 / Observer: Maude transfer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The speed with which 39-year-old Francis Maude has jumped from one
high-paying job at Salomon Brothers to an even more highly paid one at
Morgan Stanley International, is wonderful news for out-of-work MPs.
Although his salary is secret it would be surprising if young Maude were not
a millionaire by the time he seeks re-election to parliament. He has proved
that there are still lush jobs for smart and well-connected boys. Even so,
it is far from clear why the former financial secretary at the Treasury is
regarded as such a hot property.
Apart from a few dogs like British Coal and British Rail, there is not much
left to privatise in the UK so Maude's contacts in this area can't be of
much use. And given that he has almost certainly not ruled out a return to
politics at the first whiff of a safe seat, Morgan Stanley must be seeking
an unusually quick pay-back on its latest 'privatisation' investment.

FT  20 APR 93 / Observer: Border raid on Belgium
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was something of a run on the Belgian franc yesterday morning, and,
for once, the central bank was powerless to defend the currency - it managed
to lose some BFr70m of it to armed robbers through its own back door.
Even for connoisseurs of Belgian curiosities a successful robbery of the
central bank is a rarity, and bank officials were keen to play down its
importance. 'The robbers didn't attack the bank; they attacked a postal
van,' insisted a bank spokesman, although he admitted that the raid had
taken place in the bank's backyard.
In other respects, the would-be speculators played it entirely by the book,
mounting their dawn raid not on the bank's Brussels HQ but on an outlying
sub-office near the Luxembourg border. Like many Belgians seeking to avoid
home-country scrutiny of their income, the thieves may even have nipped
across the frontier and tried to deposit the booty at one of the Grand
Duchy's 200 or so banks.
Could it have been an inside job? Bank officials were mystified as to how
the thieves got in. Bank governor Alfons Verplaetse was in Basle for a
meeting of EC central bankers, so he had a perfect alibi, as did Belgium's
most wanted man, Patrick Haemers, who went on trial yesterday.
Happily, there were no casualties in yesterday's raid, except perhaps the
central bank's pride and, of course, the Belgian national debt - now up to
BFr8,557,070,000,000.

FT  20 APR 93 / Leading Article: Democracy, Pakistan-style
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT DOES NOT say much for the development of democracy in Pakistan that all
three civilian governments since the lifting of martial law in 1985 have
been sacked by a president acting with the consent, though on this occasion
apparently not the active co-operation, of the military. President Ghulam
Ishaq Khan has tarred the dismissed prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, once
his protege and now his victim, with the same brush as Ms Benazir Bhutto,
whose government he removed in 1990. Then, as now, the charge was
corruption. But this time the president's motive is clearly to preserve his
ultimate sanction over governments.
Mr Sharif, like Ms Bhutto, can be accused of a degree of political
ineptitude. He failed to build on the power base which he had as the
president's man and as the former chief minister of Punjab province. His
policies concentrated on economic reforms in the hope that success would
bring political popularity. Though seemingly secure in office - he easily
saw off a challenge from Ms Bhutto last year - he took on the president by
seeking reversal of a constitutional amendment which empowers him to remove
governments and appoint chiefs of the armed forces. But Mr Sharif lacked the
clout to force the measure to a successful vote in the National Assembly,
where he would have needed a two-thirds majority.
With evidence of alleged corruption not yet produced, the record of Mr
Sharif's government is generally good. He has overseen a programme to open
the economy, reducing tariffs, seeking foreign investment and privatising
state industries - though he has not succeeded in beating the country's most
chronic economic problem, the budget deficit. Mr Sharif strove for peace in
Afghanistan and sponsored an agreement which is yet to be fully tested. On
the eastern front, however, Pakistan and India - both at least potentially
nuclear powers - remain at loggerheads despite meetings between Mr Sharif
and the Indian prime minister. The climate has been worsened by allegations
of Pakistani involvement in the Bombay bombings.
An odd result of the president's move is to foster the political resurgence
of Ms Bhutto, one of whose aides is a minister in the interim government. Ms
Bhutto, on the pretext of backing fresh elections, finds herself colluding
with the president's effort to keep the powers which he used to remove her
in what she had called a constitutional coup.
It is perhaps too much to expect Pakistan's elected politicans to develop
stature when their powers are so constrained. Those foreign companies which
have been cautious about Pakistan despite its encouraging reforms may thus
have been proved wise and aid donors, who meet this week in Paris, will have
to consider whether Pakistan can fulfil economic promises given the
country's evident political fragility.

FT  20 APR 93 / Leading Article: AT&amp;T vs BT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of American Telephone and Telegraph and British
Telecommunications invading each other's turfs - brought nearer by the US
company's application for a UK licence last week and a similar application
by BT in the US last month - will cheer telephone users on both sides of the
Atlantic.
The traditional cartel structure for handling international traffic has
served customers ill. While it would be naive to hope for a head-on
collision between the two giants, more competition should bring substantial
benefits.
The most obvious would be cheaper transatlantic call charges, currently two
to three times cost. Customers could also benefit from a wider range of
services, such as international freephone dialling and from dealing with the
same operator on both sides of the ocean.
The consumer interest in greater competition has long been clear - in fact,
there have been desultory talks between the US and UK governments for two
years aimed at opening markets. What has changed is that BT and AT&amp;T now
realise that competition is in their interests too.
In the past, they believed that their interest lay in excluding each other
from their markets. Now they judge there is a greater advantage in a
reciprocal opening.
This is partly because they have found the market for international calls is
highly 'elastic' - cutting prices stimulates greater phone usage, perhaps
even to the extent of compensating for the cut in margins. Moreover, both
AT&amp;T and BT have an interest in building traffic bases in overseas markets
so they are well positioned to become leading players in an increasingly
liberalised global market. A similar consideration applies to the UK economy
as a whole. Cheaper and better handled calls between the UK and the US would
reinforce Britain's position as Europe's largest telecommunications hub, on
which it could further capitalise when markets in the rest of the continent
are opened.
While the giants' conversion to liberalisation is welcome, a beneficial
outcome is by no means assured. Although they would now prefer mutual
opening of markets to mutual exclusion, the ideal outcome for each would be
the maximum opening of the other's market and the maximum protection at
home. In fact, BT and AT&amp;T have lost no time in listing restrictions which
exist in the other's market and in insisting that these be removed before
their home markets are opened.
Details obviously matter, but there is a danger of negotiations between the
governments becoming bogged down in minutiae. What is needed is for both
governments to inject urgency into the talks. In doing so, they will need to
keep sight of the big picture and be prepared to override some of the
detailed demands of their phone companies. They must ensure that the best
does not become the enemy of the good.

FT  20 APR 93 / Leading Article: Over-the-top pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAME non-executive directors sitting on malleable remuneration committees
advised by tame pay consultants appear to have pulled off the trick once
again. According to the Institute of Management's latest annual salary
survey, directors of British companies with a turnover of more than Pounds
600m received average pay rises of 8.6 per cent last year, more than twice
the national average. Such is the monotony with which surveys reveal a
higher rate of pay inflation in the boardroom than in the world outside that
there is a growing risk that no one will notice. Yet notice needs to be
taken, because the disparity is symptomatic of much that is wrong with
British corporate governance and management.
Over the past decade and a half, hidden unemployment has been substantially
reduced in the British private sector. Big companies, where boardroom pay
inflation is highest, have been net shedders of jobs and employment practice
has moved closer to the US hire-and-fire model. This harsher industrial
climate is unlikely to be compatible with harmonious labour relations, over
the longer run, if there is a perception that the balance of risk and reward
is being unevenly shared.
The growth of hostile takeover activity and the increasing assertiveness of
institutional shareholders have admittedly introduced a modicum of
accountability into the British boardroom. The Cadbury report on corporate
governance has also made some contribution. But the balance remains uneven.
One tell-tale indication is the fact that the highest paid directors in the
Institute of Management's survey were in the privatised energy sector, where
the average salary was Pounds 110,981. This raises once again the question
as to the justification for the large pay increases awarded to directors of
newly-privatised companies, notably the utilities.
At a more fundamental level, the tendency of companies in the Anglo-Saxon
economies to offer much larger pay packages to top executives than their
opposite numbers in Germany or Japan reflects an exaggerated view of what a
single executive can achieve and too little respect for the symbolism of pay
relativities between board and shop floor.
Much of the problem with existing practice lies in the non-executive
directors' shared interest in high levels of executive pay, since so many
non-executives are executive directors elsewhere. Within the existing
framework of company law, the Cadbury committee was probably right in
arguing that the chief discipline must be openness. And in suggesting that
the chairman of the remuneration committee should answer to shareholders at
annual general meetings, Cadbury provides a constructive weapon to
shareholders. It would have been still more constructive if the committee
had been less timid in its disclosure recommendations. But institutional
shareholders should not hesitate to make the most of it.

FT  20 APR 93 / Letter: UK manufacturing industry must attract the most able
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CRISPIN HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Prof Mackintosh (Letters, April 15) makes points about Britain's
industrial future which few would question. It is fortunate that all schools
must now teach technology as part of the national curriculum, but that in
itself will not ensure healthy industrial production.
Part of the answer lies with the schools and universities as well as with
the industries themselves.
Since the middle of the last century the most able pupils have been
encouraged to enter the professions, the services and other non-technical
careers. Many great industrialists of the early 1800s, when they retired to
the countryside, discouraged their sons from 'dirtying their hands' in
industry and sent them to appropriate schools. This tendency is now perhaps
declining but the trend continues. The City of London seems more attractive
than the factory.
Manufacturing industry now urgently needs to make itself at least as
attractive a possibility for pupils leaving school and university as other
well-trodden careers. The onus is on the academic world to give informed
advice, with real encouragement to enter industry, and on industry to draw
the best pupils.

FT  20 APR 93 / Letter: Girobank telephone banking designed to complement
network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD L BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read John Gapper's article, 'Banks dial M for
money' (April 6), but I would like to comment on some of the points he made
about Girobank.
As the pioneer of telephone banking, Girobank has never had to 'support
small branch networks' as he stated. Unlike other direct banks all our 1.5m
customers have access to both Link cash dispensers and the nationwide Post
Office network, which we use on an agency basis, as well as our Telecare
telephone banking centres at four regional locations. This combination gives
our customers a truly convenient service.
We regard the country's 20,000 Post Office outlets as a big asset,
especially as, with the growing number of bank closures to which John Gapper
referred, they are now the sole provider of banking services in an
increasing number of communities. This is important because, although the
telephone can handle information, it cannot deliver the cash that customers
still need.
Girobank's cost/income ratio is indeed higher than those of its competitors
but this reflects the make-up of our interest and fee income which is not
comparable with the other high street clearers.
More significantly, in 1992 Girobank achieved a return on shareholders'
funds of 44 per cent, higher than any of the other clearers.
Our telephone banking service is very cost-effective and complements the
convenience of the biggest network of outlets of any bank or building
society. We are not convinced customers should be forced into a
strait-jacket of telephone banking simply because other banks are trying to
recover the costs of some of their worst excesses of the 1980s.
Girobank, I am pleased to say, continues to attract new customers at an
encouraging rate.

FT  20 APR 93 / Letter: Real dangers of Bosnia appeasement policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr A H HERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Had the US refrained from pouring oil on the fire and refused to supply
arms to the UK in 1940, and later to the Soviet Union, many lives could have
been spared and the second world war much shortened. It could have been
avoided entirely had the UK kept out of the conflict between Hitler and his
neighbours. Indeed, if not deported and sent up the chimney, we could now be
spared the Maastricht treaty tussle: we would be living in a Nazi Union.
Of course, the brutal expulsion of millions of Bosnians from their homes and
the connected atrocities touch the nerve. But so also should the genocides
in progress in many other parts of the world.
In Bosnia-Hercegovina, however, what is at issue is not our feelings but our
future. Srebrenica is the present day Munich. It stands for the appeasement
of Russia, whose imperialism is only temporarily subdued. Having survived
the czars, Stalin, and Brezhnev, it is already lifting its head again by
supporting Serbian conquest. And this will hardly stop before the Serbs
subdue also Croatia and Slovenia on whose toil they became accustomed to
live.
Like Munich in 1938, so now Srebrenica. The appeasement policy of the
present government will encourage further Russian expansion - by setting
Romanians against the Hungarians, Slovaks against the Czechs and Ukrainians
against the Poles. The time will come when the UK and the US will be no
longer be able to sleep in peace and will be obliged to take much more
radical and more painful decisions than lifting the arms embargo by which
they are now helping the Serbs to complete the genocide safely and without
effective opposition.
The real danger is that the present appeasement policy will in five to 10
years lead to a third world war.

FT  20 APR 93 / Age of the old buffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Our churches, those seductive promoters of immortality, are losing
customers. This is another example of short-termism. The question of eternal
life, the lost congregations tell themselves, is not an immediate one. What
does seem urgent is to ask what we are to do with the extra quarter of a
century that most of us can now look forward to - and how to pay for it. The
ancient conundrum that gave so much gainful employment to philosophers in
centuries past is being turned on its head. In the west the contemplation of
life after death is being replaced by studies of life before death.
Canny social scientists are seizing the opportunity opened up by this shift
in the angst market. Some of them will meet in London next week to discuss
'life, work and livelihood in the third age', a conference called to mark
the recently published final report of a Carnegie-sponsored inquiry into
those topics. The 'third age' is taken to mean everyone over 50 and under
75. In Britain that amounts to a quarter of the population, or some 14m
people.
This important chunk of society would not exist but for 20th century
medicine and economic development. Since 1901 the average life expectancy at
birth has risen from 45 to 73 for men and from 49 to 79 for women, largely
as a result of a reduction of deaths in infancy and childhood.
At the same time the number of people surviving into what Carnegie and
others term the 'fourth age' - the years of dependency - has grown sharply.
In 1951 only 4 per cent of the UK population was aged 75-plus; by the turn
of the century the proportion will have doubled to 8 per cent.
Carnegie's central proposition is that the 50 to 75-year-olds should be kept
busy, either in gainful if part-time employment, or in voluntary work, the
better to be able to help finance or manage the upkeep of the over-75s.
'Fundamentally, the third age could be the source of a major contribution to
the economy or a drag upon it,' says the report. Solutions may be easier to
find for those whose working lives have been brain-driven than for those who
have been made redundant by the contraction of smokestack industries. Old
miners, old steelworkers, old shipbuilders may not die - not just yet - but
we know that many of them are doomed to spend long empty years fading away.
The unfairness of human existence persists to its end.
This is recognised in the report, whose chapter on pensions is the best in
the book. No surprise here: it was prepared at the Institute for Fiscal
Studies. Under Carnegie's label the IFS presents a list of recommendations,
and a set of options. The choices make themselves. First, we cannot afford,
and should not aim to afford, state pensions for under-65s. Recent hints
from ministers suggest that there is some infirmity of purpose on this
matter. The logic of raising the pension age for women to 65 has been
accepted. What remains to be demonstrated is the will. In my view the state
pension age should be 70, and rising.
Second, the earnings-related state pension should be abolished, although
existing commitments will have to be met. Let private and occupational
pensions do the job for which Serps was intended. Third, the upper earnings
limit on National Insurance contributions should be removed, thus raising
the marginal tax rate on the top tranche of higher earners' incomes.
The tens of billions of pounds saved could be directed towards better social
security for very old pensioners, the majority of whom are women. Retired
people in the third age are more likely than their older relatives to have
independent sources of income, such as part-time earnings, company pensions,
savings, a paid-for house, or even a few dividends. For them the
government's policy is to allow the value of the basic state pension to
decline in relation to average earnings - that is, to let it wither away.
Perhaps this is right.
It is in the fourth age that the need becomes desperate. Loading the money
into support for people who depend entirely on the state makes sense. The
pity is that no one has a comparable plan for men in their 50s who are
trapped in long-term unemployment - unless you count what has become a
ritual incantation about education and training.
The IFS chapter also floats the idea of long-term care insurance, which
would help defray the costs of living through our 80s and, with luck, our
90s. This could be a runner. I turn to Professor Alan Walker of the
University of Sheffield. He is co-ordinator of the European Community's
official and continuous colloquy on these matters - the 'EC Observatory on
Ageing'. Professor Walker says that there are now two models of late-in-life
care evolving within the Community.
The predominant one is for the state to pay, as with Britain's community
care (some of which is in private homes) and Denmark's luxurious home helps,
who are available around the clock. Against that, Germany and Belgium are
developing state-organised insurance schemes. This sounds more like it: an
individual armed with insurance money can make a better choice of carer than
a local council official. Even better would be laws against age
discrimination, as in the US. True, these are evaded but in logic they must
help break down social attitudes based on 19th-century rates of
life-expectancy.
Grey power in America is, however, an old story, its victories won, its
consequences digested. Europe is different. Here the tendency has been to
encourage early retirement. Less than half the men aged between 55 and 64 in
France and the Netherlands are counted as economically active. The UK figure
in the year cited, 1988, was 68 per cent, a sharp fall on the 91.3 per cent
of 1970. According to Prof Walker that tide is turning. The tendency in
Continental northern Europe is now to reduce the force of 'early exit'
policies.
Thankfully, this will be a matter for individual countries. The EC has no
legislative competence here, although it might acquire some under the social
chapter of the Maastricht treaty. To compensate itself, it is financing
talk-fests. This is the Community's 'Year of Older People and Solidarity
between Generations', a soggy phrase derived from surveys that suggest that
the aged prefer to be called something like 'senior citizens'. Personally I
am - shall be - quite content with 'old buffer', if the money is right.

FT  20 APR 93 / Letter: No contravention of Gatt rules by Japan's
low-alcohol tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KOJIRO SHIOJIRI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Michiyo Nakamoto's article, 'Japanese low-alcohol
tax sinks EC spirits' (March 24). The article leaves one with the impression
that the new tax rates for low-alcohol whiskies in Japan somehow contravene
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Those new tax rates have recently been imposed on low-alcohol whiskies,
which began coming on to the Japanese market at the start of this fiscal
year. The new rates apply equally to domestic and foreign products, and
therefore neither penalise foreign products nor break Gatt rules.
Japan is not alone in producing low-alcohol whiskies, which are naturally
taxed at a lower rate than full-strength whiskies. Distillers in both Canada
and France also produce and sell low-alcohol whiskies. Moreover, as you
know, whisky and lemonade can be found in the British market. In fact,
mizuwari is taxed under a system much like the one used in the UK for
low-alcohol beverages. It does not seem appropriate to single out Japan in
this matter.
The crux of the issue is that European Community regulations prohibit whisky
distillers in the EC from producing and selling 'whisky' which is less than
40 degrees proof. The issue at hand, therefore, lies not with questions of
tax discrimination on the part of Japan.
With regard to the tax differentials that Michiyo Nakamoto mentions in her
piece, I would like to emphasise that they have narrowed considerably as a
result of the 1989 revision of Japan's Liquor Tax Law, which was undertaken
in accordance with the recommendation of a 1987 Gatt panel.
Those differentials have dropped from 1:16 to 1:5 for shochu and whisky, and
from 1:2 to 1:1 for shochu and white spirits (based on percentage of
alcohol).

FT  20 APR 93 / Letter: Ivory tower view of German railways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Prof Dore's plea (Letters, April 17) for the German way of
'microcorporatist' rail union involvement, by which he apparently means the
sacrifice of short-term profits to attain flexibility and quality, was
written in his ivory tower with all the windows firmly shut. As the
Suddeutsche Zeitung reported on April 6, the truth about German Rail is very
different. Its debts now amount to at least DM70bn (Pounds 28.6bn), and are
rising at about 10 per cent a year. For 1992, the turnover of the West
German Railways in goods traffic was less than in 1972.
The current plan, therefore, is to set up a limited liability company called
Deursche Bahn AG, which will have the effect of transferring DM70bn of debt
to the German taxpayers (and to me). These are the real results of
microcorporatism.
What Prof Dore advocates is in fact a daily burden on the German taxpayer of
DM27m (Pounds 11m), solely to offset the daily loss made by German Rail. If
Prof Dore had said that microcorporatism means macrolosses, he would have
been at least accurate in judging economic performance.

FT  20 APR 93 / First cut is the easiest: France has limited room for
manoeuvre in monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French financial authorities were yesterday being modest about their
success in cutting interest rates while still keeping the franc firm,
because they know it is only a modest success.
The Bank of France, unusually, made no comment when it cut the intervention
rate at which it rations loans to commercial banks from 9.10 to 8.75 per
cent, the lowest level since 1989, and further reduced its five-to-10-day
repurchase lending rate from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent.
For his part, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was busier warning about
forthcoming 'unpopular' tax increases to stem the public spending deficit
than crowing about the first fruits of his three-week old government's
success on the monetary front.
The French authorities are playing it cool for two reasons. One is a
question of style. The Balladur government is very keen to show foreign
exchange dealers it is just reacting to recent falls in domestic money
market rates by lowering official rates, and that it is in no way trying to
force official rates down further or faster than the fundamentals of the
French economy justify.
The other reason for caution relates to precisely these fundamentals. For
the moment, the franc's link to the D-mark seems solid. The Bank of France
has recovered the reserves it lost in defending the currency since last
autumn, enough, according to Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, to
be making an early repayment of the debt to the Bundesbank incurred in
support of the French intervention.
Today, Mr Alphandery will present to Mr Balladur his draft statute to give
the French central bank the same independence in monetary policy as the
Bundesbank enjoys. Therefore, when the French premier visits Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in Bonn on Thursday, he will be able to claim to the German
leader that France is on the road to 'institutionalising' its present policy
of a strong currency and a low inflation rate, which, at around 2.3 per cent
,is nearly half Germany's.
This in turn strengthens Mr Balladur's hand in making his pitch for
even-closer monetary co-operation between France and Germany, sufficient to
ride out possible storms arising out of Danish and British decisions on the
Maastricht treaty.
But the battle for the franc will not finally be won until health is
restored to the French economy and to its state finances. Even the record
low point for inflation has its downside, because it increases the 'real'
cost of interest for companies and individuals on their borrowings.
'Today's interest rate cuts are not enough to relaunch growth,' says Mr
Jean-Michel Charpin, chief economist of the Banque Nationale de Paris.
'Although we are clearly on the right path, with the three-month interbank
rate also down to 8.75 per cent today, this rate has to come down to 7 per
cent,' he stresses. Other economists see the need for even bigger cuts to
kick the stalled French economy into life again.
Mr Balladur's sober start has so far gone down well in the public opinion
ratings which have given him the highest marks of any Fifth Republic prime
minister. But this honeymoon may soon be cut short, because his room for
economic manoeuvre is so small. The only reflation measure he has announced,
a saving of FFr20bn (Pounds 2.41bn) - yet to be identified - out of a budget
deficit of over FFr330m this year, is to be used to give property investors
and developers tax breaks to revive the depressed real estate sector.
Other larger-scale measures have been mooted. But they will either punch an
even bigger hole in the state's finances (up to FFr100bn, if the government
decides to help companies' cashflow by implementing a speedier refund of
value added tax), or are too gradual to have any immediate effect on growth
and employment (such as the proposal to transfer progressively the FFr150bn
a year social charges from company payrolls to the state budget over 10
years).
France's sad experience in recent years is that it generates fewer jobs for
a given amount of growth than its neighbours, and there is no one in the
country, from Mr Balladur down, who believes that with the economy forecast
to expand by less than 1 per cent this year the number of unemployed will
fall below its current level of 3m before 1994.
The structural roots of unemployment lie in 'productivity rates, rigidities
of labour market practices, the cost of labour', says Mr Charpin. Tackling
this will take a long time. This is why Mr Balladur has set himself a
five-year economic programme. But with presidential elections due by 1995 he
may in reality have only two years to play with.
In contrast to last year when France recorded a large trade surplus, the
European horizon looks equally sombre from Paris. Despite the continuation
yesterday of EC discussions about a European growth initiative, French
exporters are saddled with the handicap that the franc has appreciated by
about 8 per cent since mid-1992 against other European currencies.
This fact, together with depressed domestic demand, hardly creates the right
climate for French companies to start reversing the investment spending cuts
they have been making since 1990. Even if it were, French industry would
take its time about sinking money into new plant, when their existing
factories are so under-utilised.
In such circumstances, Cartesian logic might indicate that France's best
hope would be for a liberalisation of world trade - as could be provided for
by an early settlement to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
negotiations. But the Balladur government seems just as hostile as its
Socialist predecessor to a rapid Gatt agreement on terms acceptable to the
US, and indeed to many of its EC partners. Among the latter, the most
important is Germany, and Mr Balladur will be trying this week to convince
Mr Kohl of the need for a tougher European trade policy.
But however forcefully he puts his Gatt case to Mr Kohl, Mr Balladur cannot
ignore that he needs Germany's co-operation on monetary matters even more.
It is only with the full political and financial backing of Germany's
government and central bank that the franc has beaten off the speculators.
Certainly, the foreign exchange markets have taken to Mr Balladur's
conservative style and policies. The franc closed yesterday at a rate of
FFr3.378 to the D-mark, up more than three centimes since March 21, the date
of the first round of the French legislative elections, which signalled a
landslide victory for the centre-right.
Yesterday's official interest rate cuts were relatively easy, because they
merely consolidated the movement that had already taken place in the market.
Further cuts in official French rates will have to depend on what the
Bundesbank does next.

FT  20 APR 93 / Arts: In the right place at the right time / Review of
Georgia O'Keeffe, long-standing doyenne of American art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reputation was ever an insecure quality, and never more so than in our own
time. Yet we grow oddly reluctant, not so much to question as actually to
prick the bubble. Or is it perhaps that in this age of free-standing,
self-sustaining fame, the bubble has become more resilient, impervious, more
a sort of rubber ball? In the world of art, certainly, there are reputations
that once established, just go bouncing on and on, the vested interests of
commerce, tourism or national pride, as the case may be, simply too
interested to miss a beat.
As for the lucky artist, the trick is often simply to be in the right place
at the right time and, if the luck is really in, then to let the reputation
float quite free of the work as such. Georgia O'Keeffe had all the luck she
could have wanted, let alone needed. She was a woman of striking if severe
beauty, married to a remarkable photographer, Alfred Stieglitz, who had
encouraged her in her early career and largely created and sustained her
personal image. Her country needed her, in the sense that in her prime,
between the wars, there were few other artists indigenous to America that
could be promoted convincingly in terms of international modernism, and none
at all so particularly and romantically American in her subject-matter - the
wide, open spaces of the south-western desert states of America, the old
frontier. She lived to an immense old age, dying at 99 in 1986, the
long-standing doyenne of American art, loaded with honours and quite beyond
criticism. Now there is the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation, at Abiquiu in New
Mexico, to keep her reputation for posterity.
It is only when we come to the work itself, the foundation upon which this
impressive edifice of reputation is set, that the questions and the doubts
come flooding in - or do they? The wonderful irony of this present
exhibition is that so judiciously critical an opportunity should be
presented to us as the vindication and celebration of a great artist's
career and achievement, and sent on a world-wide tour. I am all for the
proper critical study of any substantial reputation, that must take its
chance for good or ill. And the Hayward Gallery, at my mid-week visit just
after Easter, was filled by a studious and, more to the point, respectful
crowd, predominantly young and - should I even notice, let alone say such a
thing? - female.
Clearly the work strikes a plangent chord in many breasts, and it is easy to
see why. Whatever its other qualities, a characteristic O'Keeffe has a
graphic simplicity that reproduces well. Posters and cards have made her
imagery familiar to a general audience far beyond the particular interest of
modern art, and the explicitly sexual and ecstatic connotations of her
flower-heads, seen in exploratory close-up, of bare, rolling hills and
eroded valleys, swirling clouds and symbolic abstractions, are obvious
enough. The metaphor of woman celebrating and idealising her own sexuality
is irresistible to the feminist, which constituency today is enormous.
And it is quite as hard for the more disinterested viewer to resist the
conclusion that the general response to the work of Georgia O'Keeffe hangs
entirely on the nature of its imagery. For when we come to examine these
paintings as painting, they reveal themselves as poor, thin stuff indeed.
The first surprise is how little of it there is, to stand for so long a
life, but the greater surprise is the lack of any true development within
it. Changes in immediate preoccupation there may have been, now flowers, now
skies, now the embarrassingly inept surrealist pastiches of the 1950s, but
technically they remain the same.
Small or large, always they are out of scale, the paint on the surface
inadequate or inappropriate to the purpose, the drawing flaccid, the mark
light, uncertain, perfunctory. And there is no real sense of the artist
looking hard at the real world, whether to allow painterly invention to feed
intuitively upon the subject before it, or to develop later into informed
abstraction. Rather it is that the image is all - which is another way of
saying that the painter is no painter at all. For the true painter is always
quite as much engrossed in the stuff of the painting he is making, as the
pigment comes of the brush on to the canvas, as he is in the external
reference or stimulus.
With Georgia O'Keeffe there is the initial look, but no scrutiny, and the
paint a mere question of filling in between the lines. Her barn in the snow
might as well have ben painted by an artist who had never seen snow, but
only told that it was white. Her tree-trunks, writhing together, are
paper-thin, volumeless, cut crisp and clean as scenery at their edges and
overlays. Her skyscraper is but a matter of poorly-drawn white blocks on a
dark ground. Her little wooden virgin, so charming a votive figure at first
sight, stands unresolved in all its proper form and significant detail. I
suspect she used photographic reference far more than has been admitted, for
the photograph, notoriously deceptive, always withholds more information
than ever it offers as image.
Clearly she believed in her own myth, which remains evidently potent after
her death. The hard truth is that she was a weak draughtsman and at best an
indifferent painter. Was it her sense of her own technical inadequacies that
moved her to break with the art schools, where she had studied and taught,
and go west into the desert? 'Where I was born and where and how I have
lived is (sic) unimportant. It is what I have done with where I have been
that should be of interest.' Indeed it should be.

FT  20 APR 93 / Arts: A Love Song for Ulster - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want tickets for the most exciting new drama in London, you should
telephone the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn straightaway. Since it is quite
possible that it will be already sold out, the next best hope is that it
will be performed elsewhere - say at the Royal National's Cottesloe Theatre,
or all sorts of other venues home and abroad.
A Love Song for Ulster is a trilogy by Bill Morrison about the Irish
question since the creation of the border in 1922 to the present day. The
three parts, The Marriage, The Son and The Daughter, can be seen separately.
It is probably best to see them all on a single day - as they were premiered
on Sunday, spread over eight hours with ample breaks for tea and supper. The
experience comes as close to catharsis as you can expect to find in a modern
play.
Love Song does not stand out so much for the quality of the writing.
Morrison's script would go down just as well as a six part series on
television, and one hopes that some day it will. On stage it is the quality
of the acting and direction, and the immediacy of the contact with the
audience, that count. In Nicolas Kent's production with an all Irish cast,
these come close to perfection.
Some members of the audience initially thought that the first part of the
trilogy, covering the period 1922-36, was too slow. Yet by halfway through
the second part, which takes the action on to 1969, it is clear that the
beginning is essential for an understanding of subsequent troubles. From
then on I have rarely seen an audience so hooked.
Morrison works in the Greek mould even down to having a kind of chorus
commenting on the action, sometimes close to it, sometimes detached. He
picks out one family and sticks to it over generations. A mother and her
daughter, Kate, are arbitrarily separated at the time of the introduction of
the border, the mother going south, the daughter staying north. The details
of the plot would seem complex on paper but are straightforward enough on
stage. There is rape, murder, pillage, yet also love and reconciliation. The
family, continually intertwining, is a microcosm for events in Ireland.
An underlying theme is male domination. In southern Ireland this comes about
because of the power of the priesthood which terrifies women into submission
to their husbands. In the north the men are presented as believing in male
supremacy for its own sake. There are a lot of religious references in the
course of which the line 'God forgives all men' takes on a new meaning.
The more subtle theme, however, is that the Irish are more ready to live
together than the evidence of events of events suggests. They are deterred
from doing so by history, prejudice, extremists on either side and perhaps
ultimately by a lack of self-confidence which goes back to the historical
point: who rules Ireland?
Love Song goes about as far as is possible to go without a potential libel
action in placing a lot of the blame on the likes of Ian Paisley. The
protestant minister played by Walter McMonagle is the contemporary villain
of the piece, growing visibly better dressed while seeking more and more
land for his church: he just about keeps his fingers clean while encouraging
the violence.
There is some mild mocking of an Irish priest and the Irish Republic is
ridiculed for its policy of proclaiming its belief in Irish unity without
doing much to achieve it. But anyone who says that Love Song lets off the
IRA comparatively lightly would have a case.
The other culpable party is the British. True, the British officer who
presides over partition has become less of a dummy when he returns with the
British troops in the late 1960s, but the brutalities are not spared. Some
of the motivation here is questionable. Morrison suggests that the real
reason for the British presence is the protection of the sea routes on
behalf of Nato. When the Berlin Wall comes down, it is implied that the
troops will go away as part of the defence cuts. That has not happened.
Never mind the details, however. This is a play to make people talk about
Ireland and the atrocities in Bosnia as well. The performances by John
Keegan as a loyalist husband and Orla Brady as Kate are superb, but so are
they all. Terry Mortimer combines playing the British officer with the
musical direction which is an essential part of the piece.

FT  20 APR 93 / Arts: Gunter Wand and the BBCSO - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friday's BBC Symphony Orchestra concert at the Festival Hall was a great
occasion. The orchestra's recently-instituted policy of low-priced,
unreserved tickets for its South Bank schedule had obviously contributed to
it: every seat was occupied, and in a 'democratic' way that lent to this
normally neutral environment an touch of Proms elation.
But mainly, of course, it was the music-making that caused the air of
festivity. Concert-going London, having at last realised that every one of
Gunter Wand's appearances with this orchestra is precious, is determined to
make the most of them. In 25 years of regular Festival Hall attendance I can
recall few events characterised by so rapt a feeling of audience absorption
in the music itself. Wand, in his early 80s, seems to represent a tradition
of symphonic interpretation that gains ever more meaning and value as its
true upholders diminish in number.
In Wand performances, every note tells. As Friday's gloriously clear,
balanced and truthful BBC accounts of the Schubert Eighth and Bruckner Ninth
symphonies showed once again, those famously painstaking Wand rehearsals are
never an end in themselves: they have as their purpose the sustenance of
intelligent and intelligible re-creative musicianship.
The union of exact dynamics and tempo choice, graceful phrase-shaping,
evocative colouring and forwardness of rhythm made the Schubert a continuous
revelation - not because there was anything in the least outlandish about
it, but because Schubertian execution of this sort, alert to the sense and
inner workings of the score, is always a wonderful surprise.
The BBC's Bruckner symphonies under Wand have become celebrated. He does not
direct the players toward craggy heights or searing depths of expression,
toward squeezing out the last degrees of blissful sweetness or awesome
thunder. The hammer-blows of the Scherzo were each placed for their proper
weight and purpose - no more, but also no less. The phrasing of those
angular melodic intervals at the start of the Adagio had not an ounce of
egregious portentousness in it. Everything in the performance seemed
directed toward a conclusion justly and honestly arrived at.
In verbal description this may sound a temperate goal, a somewhat bland
achievement; in the Festival Hall last Friday it proved thrilling. This
pairing of Schubert's and Bruckner's unfinished symphonies has often been
made in concert programmes. Rarely has each work sounded, in the best sense,
so finished.

FT  20 APR 93 / Arts: Dame Elisabeth Frink, RA - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elisabeth Frink, who died at the week-end at the age of 62, after a long
illness, was unique in her generation as a British woman sculptor of
international standing. She was of that immediate post-war generation that
was at once formed by and rejected the example of Henry Moore and Barbara
Hepworth, committing itself rather to a more openly expressionist sculptural
figuration, dynamic in its modelling and urgent in its effect, 'the Geometry
of Fear' as the conventional description of the time would have it.
But Miss Frink was always her own distinctive self in her work, and her
particular interest in animal subjects, which did so much to revive the old
and honourable animalier tradition within the context of modern sculpture,
always set her apart. Her work for the rebuilt Coventry Cathedral, notably
the eagle lecturn, established her national reputation, and she remained
thereafter prolific in the production of public sculpture, often within a
religious context.
Horses and riders, warriors and the monumental male image became her
favoured subjects, and as with Moore and his reclining women, it will be by
the massive, totem heads, bullet-headed and blankly staring, that her work
as an artist will most readily be called to mind.

The programme chosen by David Attenborough as one of his 12 favourites from
the past 16 years of 'Wildlife On One' is indeed a classic. The methods
invented or adapted by producer John Downer to get film of birds in flight
included building a miniature camera into a radio controlled model plane
which was then disguised as a stork. This trick and others worked
astoundingly well, as you can see in Wildlife 100 (7.00 BBC1). Assignment
reports on the illegal trade in Russia's national treasures, especially
religious icons (7.45 BBC2). This has been going on for years but has
intensified since the collapse of communism. If Sailortown maintains the
standard set by the previous seven comedy pilots in this series it will be
quite appalling. This one is set in a Belfast pub (8.30 ITV). On the other
hand, if the second of three programmes about modern technology in Without
Walls is as good as the first it will be very well worthwhile (9.00 C4). The
hugely improved 40 Minutes uses tapes of original phone calls to document a
hair-raising incident when a Belgian banker's family was taken hostage (9.50
BBC2).

FT  20 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Liquidating ambiguity - The SFO's
increased powers to use material obtained by liquidators against suspects in
court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The powers of the UK Serious Fraud Office to use information obtained under
questioning when a suspect's 'right to silence' has been removed have once
again been strengthened.
In a recent judgment, the Court of Appeal removed any restrictions on the
SFO using material obtained by company liquidators or administrators as
evidence in a criminal trial.
This means that any information gathered by liquidators using their powers
under section 236 of the Insolvency Act 1986 to compel interviewees to
answer questions can be demanded by the SFO and used freely in subsequent
criminal prosecutions.
The ruling was received by the SFO as a welcome clarification of the
relatively new body of law affecting its powers. It undoubtedly amounts to a
strengthening of these powers. As one appeal court judge said, it is likely
to make SFO prosecutions more efficient, render issues clearer to juries and
speed up some over-long fraud trials.
However, the ruling has been seen by some defence solicitors as a further
example of the creeping erosion of their clients' traditional protection
against self-incrimination.
Concern has also been expressed - largely by liquidators - that the ruling
could hinder both liquidators and administrators in carrying out their work
quickly and efficiently in the interests of creditors.
The legal challenge was brought by lawyers acting for Mr Muhammed Naviede,
the head of the Manchester-based Arrows Group, who currently faces fraud
charges brought by the SFO. In his wake, further challenges were also
mounted by two defendants facing charges over the Maxwell affair - Mr Kevin
Maxwell and Mr Larry Trachtenberg.
The long-running action brought by Mr Naviede reached the High Court last
November.
Mr Justice Vinelott ruled then that while the SFO could demand that
liquidators pass over transcripts of section 236 interviews, restrictions
should be placed on the use of this material; in addition an undertaking
should be given by the director of the SFO that he would not use the
transcripts in ways inconsistent with those restrictions.
These restrictions were identical to those placed on the SFO in relation to
information it obtains from its own 'section 2' interviews when the right to
silence is removed.
These curbs prevent the SFO using such information in direct evidence. Such
material can only be used when a defendant, giving evidence at trial, makes
a statement that is inconsistent with evidence given during a section 2
interview.
Last month these restrictions were removed by the three appeal court judges,
Lord Justice Dillon, Lord Justice Steyn and Lord Justice Rose. They gave the
reasons for the judgment just before Easter.
The thrust of their argument was that the Criminal Justice Act 1987, which
legislated for the creation of the SFO and its powers, was perfectly clear
on the point.
It was plain that, under the wording of section 2 of the act, liquidators
should be regarded as persons from whom the SFO was entitled to demand
information, Lord Justice Dillon said. Civil courts had neither the
jurisdiction to impose restrictions on the SFO's use of this information nor
the power to exact undertakings from the director of the SFO, he added.
The implications of removing the High Court's restrictions prompted
different responses from liquidators. Their central concern was whether or
not the effective removal of all confidentiality from interviews would
damage their ability to collect information from company directors who might
fear prosecution.
Ernst and Young, the liquidators of Arrows, saw no reason why the efficient
conduct of liquidations should be adversely affected. However,
administrators acting for various Maxwell companies took a different
position, arguing that the public interest in ensuring that liquidations are
efficiently carried out justified restrictions on the SFO's use of their
information.
The restrictions imposed by Mr Justice Vinelott in the High Court had struck
a reasonable balance between the public interest in prosecuting fraud and
the public interest in the speedy and efficient conduct of liquidations,
they argued.
The restrictions would mean that the readiness of people questioned by
liquidators to talk openly would not be impaired.
Lord Justice Dillon said: 'The reasoning is that persons examined under
section 236 are more likely to be co-operative and to give full and truthful
answers to office-holders if they believe that their answers will be treated
as confidential and will thus not be used against them in any prosecution.
'Consequently it appears that some office-holders make a practice of giving
assurances of confidentiality to persons who are being examined under
section 236.'
However, in rejecting the public interest argument, he pointed out that
under the Insolvency Act, statements made during a section 236 interview can
be admissible evidence in criminal as well as civil proceedings.
Liquidators should plainly not offer assurances of confidentiality to
persons they are about to question when these would be inconsistent with
other statutory obligations such as those owed to the SFO under section 2 of
the Criminal Justice Act, he said.
Any assurance given by a liquidator to a director of a company which would
prevent the liquidator from fulfilling another statutory obligation would be
invalid.
When the scope of current legislation became more widely appreciated, the
practical difficulties faced by liquidators would be reduced, he said.
Afterwards, Mr Mark Homan of Price Waterhouse, president of the Society of
Insolvency Practitioners, said the ruling could make directors marginally
less willing to answer questions during section 236 interviews.
However, in other cases, the clarification of the law could encourage people
to disclose more information voluntarily, rather than less.
Mr Neil Cooper, head of corporate recovery at Robson Rhodes, said that the
ruling might affect the amount of information passed to liquidators, but
agreed it could have long term benefits.
Although company directors could go to great lengths to avoid giving
information, liquidators had to be very circumspect about 'cosy deals' not
to pass information on to the SFO, he said.
'We have always regarded the need to be able to communicate information to
the relevant authorities as one of the prices we have to pay.' He agreed
liquidators could benefit from the Court of Appeal clarification.
'Liquidators don't want to be put in the middle between company directors
and the SFO in proceedings which may not advance the case of creditors at
all,' he said.

<TEXT>
THE UK Commission for Racial Equality has confirmed that it is to conduct a
formal investigation into the Council for Legal Education, which runs the
finals course for the Bar. The inquiry follows complaints about the high
failure rate of ethnic minority students. Preliminary inquiries have
produced sufficient grounds for belief that discrimination may have occurred
in the Council's examination system (the Bar exams), the CRE says. The start
of the formal investigation will be delayed until September, however, to
allow an interim report by the Council's own inquiry team to be published in
August.

FT  20 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Swiss senior law partners are best
paid in Europe - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR partners in Swiss law firms are the best paid commercial lawyers in
Europe, earning an average of Dollars 490,000, according to a survey by the
International Financial Law Review. Partners in German firms are the next
best paid, earning on average Dollars 465,000, followed by senior partners
in UK firms earning an average of Dollars 440,000. Ignoring averages and
looking for the highest paid lawyers overall, the IFLR says partners in
German commercial law firms come top. Senior partners in Frankfurt firms are
reputed to earn about Dollars 840,000 a year, it says, with the highest paid
partners earning as much as Dollars 1.2m.
The highest paid partners in top City firms are said to earn up to Dollars
825,000. Over the past few years partners have seen their profits stagnate
and salary rises for associate solicitors have been minimal, one managing
partner of a City firm told IFLR. Bringing up the rear are Portugal and
Greece where partners earn on average Dollars 165,000 and Dollars 125,000
respectively.

FT  20 APR 93 / Business and the Law: UK benefits discriminatory - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has ruled that invalidity benefits which
discriminate against women can only be justified under EC legislation if the
form of the discrimination already exists under other benefit schemes and is
necessary and objectively linked to the difference in retirement age.
The case concerned the right in the UK to severe disablement and invalidity
care allowances. Both sets of allowances cannot be claimed by individuals
over retirement age, which in the UK is 60 for women and 65 for men.
The case was brought by five women who were refused the allowances because
they had reached the age of 60. The House of Lords asked for a preliminary
ruling from the European Court on the issue of whether UK law was compatible
with EC law.
The court ruled that the statutory schemes fell within the scope of the
relevant EC legislation. The UK legislation was discriminatory and could
only be justified under a provision in the EC legislation which allows
member states to determine for themselves the pensionable age 'for the
purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible
consequences thereof for other benefits'.
The court then relied on a recent decision involving the UK Equal
Opportunities Commission. This was to determine that forms of discrimination
provided for in benefit schemes other than old-age and pension schemes can
be justified only if such discrimination is necessary to avoid disrupting
the financial equilibrium of the social security system or to ensure
consistency between retirement and other benefit schemes.
In a rare move for a preliminary ruling, the court held that as it was
called on to provide worthwhile answers for the national court, it had the
jurisdiction to give guidance as to whether the criteria justifying
discrimination existed in fact. In this fact-finding guise the court
strongly found against the UK schemes and the arguments put forward in their
support by the UK government.
C-328/91: Secretary of State for Social Security v Thomas and others, ECJ
6CH, March 30 1993.
German rules restricting mutual recognition valid.
The European Court has upheld German rules which restrict the use in Germany
of a master's degree obtained from a university outside Germany without
authorisation from the local authorities.
The case was brought by a Mr Kraus, who obtained a masters degree from
Edinburgh university and hoped to use it to continue his legal studies in
Germany. The local authorities refused to accept his degree because it was
not accompanied by the relevant form and DM 13, as required under German
law. Mr Kraus argued the German law was incompatible with Rome Treaty
provisions on the free movement of workers and the right of establishment.
The court on a preliminary reference from a Stuttgart court held first that
the subject matter was governed by EC law. However, at the time the case was
brought there was no specific legislation dealing with postgraduate degrees.
Member states were therefore competent to deal with such matters in their
own territories. However such action by member states was limited to
restricting the exercise of the fundamental rights to free movement and
establishment which were guaranteed by the Rome treaty.
C-19/92: Kraus v Land Baden-Wurttemberg, ECJ FC, March 31 1993.
German licence rules on canal navigation valid
German rules which only allow carriers access to canals in Germany if they
are in possession of an accredited navigation licence were upheld by the
European Court. The court upheld a member state's right to employ this type
of licence scheme, but emphasised that members were not entitled to modify
such schemes in a manner which discriminated against carriers from other EC
countries.
Joined Cases C-184/91 and C-221/91: Ooburg and van Messem v Wasser-und
Schiffahrtdirektion Norwest, Aurich, ECJ 6CH, March 31 1993.

FT  20 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Venture capital update
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Upheavals in the venture capital industry have made it even more difficult
for entrepreneurs to find a suitable backer. Established venture capitalists
have withdrawn while others have refocused their activities.
The present state of the industry means it is essential for the entrepreneur
to have up-to-date information. Fortunately, help is available in the shape
of new editions of two established venture capital directories.
The Venture Capital Report Guide to Venture Capital in the UK &amp; Europe, now
in its sixth edition, provides the most thorough review of the UK industry.
It lists more than 100 UK venture funds as well as 70 in continental Europe.
A valuable feature of this guide is the lists of the investments that have
been made by each venture fund, including those that have been written off.
This allows businesspeople seeking money to judge the investments that
venture capitalists actually make as opposed to those that they claim to
support, says Lucius Cary, editor.
Who's Who in Risk Capital 1993 concentrates on individual venture
capitalists, providing thumbnail sketches, including in many cases
photographs. Users value a picture when speaking to someone on the telephone
for the first time or when attending conferences, says publisher Antonia
Millen.
To date, Who's Who has appeared annually, giving it a slight edge over the
Venture Capital Report which is updated every two years. It is also more
comprehensive in its continental European coverage but cannot match its
rival on its wealth of detail on the UK industry.

FT  20 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Happy with the boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Working in a small business is often thought to involve poor working
conditions and putting up with an autocratic boss. But a survey* of small
firms in the services sector and their employees paints a more favourable
picture.
Ninety four per cent of employees said they got on well with their boss
while three quarters of owner-managers said they had arrangements for
consulting their staff. Most employees said supervision was not close, the
researchers from Kingston Business School found.
The survey covered 81 businesses and 175 employees in four business sectors:
advertising, marketing and design; computer services; employment and
secretarial agencies; and pubs, wine bars and restaurants.
Six out of 10 employees said they received full pay when off sick while more
than one in five had a company car. But pension schemes and paid holiday
arrangements were less generous than the national average.
Forty per cent of employers said they would resist recognising a union but
nearly a third said they would not object if their employees wanted union
representation. However, only a quarter of employees would join a union if
the opportunity arose.
One third of employees were part time and more than half were women. While
most employers had no preference for either men or women, those who did
expressed a preference for women, who were regarded as more hard-working and
reliable.
Nearly half of employers reported problems in finding suitable staff
regardless of local unemployment levels. Few made use of agencies or job
centres, preferring direct approaches and personal recommendation by
existing employees.

FT  20 APR 93 / People: New Commissioner of Customs and Excise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Responsibility for the UK's customs arrangements in the single European
market passed yesterday to Martin Brown, the newest Commissioner of Customs
and Excise. Brown becomes Director Customs, in succession to Sandy Russell
who was recently promoted to deputy chairman.
Brown, 44, is a modern linguist who joined Customs from Oxford in 1971.
Previous jobs included heading the anti-smuggling division and customs at
Manchester Airport. He was, until his promotion, responsible for excise
duties on tobacco, oil and gambling.
Outside Customs, Brown spent two years on secondment as an adviser to the
government of Barbados. He also had a spell in the Treasury, as private
secretary to Robert Sheldon, the last Labour Financial Secretary.
As Director Customs, Brown will head the policy division in charge of UK
trade interests, control of imported freight, warehousing, free zones and
control of strategic exports. In liaising with the European Commission, he
will also be responsible for EC customs, duty-free shops and travellers'
allowances.

Speaking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE life cycle of many management techniques follows a predictable pattern.
First, the business school academics and management gurus come up with an
innovation that they declare will confer competitive advantage, multiply
profitability, improve flexibility and the like. Then it is taken up by the
management consultancies which spread the word far and wide.
After a time, the debunkers move in to expose the hyperbole and challenge
the myths. After the savaging, what remains may prove to be of real value to
managers and organisations.
Business process re-engineering (BPR), currently a hot topic among
management experts, is just entering the third phase. If its progress runs
true to form, it should be possible within a few months to distinguish the
elements of lasting value through a smokescreen of misinformation and
mystery.
BPR is a way of improving business efficiency. It involves taking a view of
the company that focuses on key processes rather than traditional functions,
divisions or products.
Changing these processes through redesign and the use of technology can lead
to order-of-magnitude improvements, the argument goes. Certainly, it has
proved persuasive enough to become enormously fashionable in the US and
Europe. Computer Sciences Corporation, a large US-based pioneer of BPR, says
it attracted 1,500 executives to its annual conference in Boston this month,
double the number that attended a year ago.
OTR, an energetic, Brussels-based consultancy, has taken a critical look* at
BPR, driven by a belief that many senior managers have reservations. As,
they reason, their business was never engineered in the first place, how can
it be re-engineered?
OTR's chief conclusion is that BPR is based on real principles and there can
be genuine value in applying them, but that hyperbole is confusing the
picture.
It concludes, for example, that claims for BPR applications are often
exaggerated. It cites Hallmark Cards in the US. While BPR is supposed to
imply fundamental rethinking of the whole business, the main change at
Hallmark was the installation of barcode readers in 250 stores.
'Hallmark now knows what is being sold much quicker than before,' it says.
While this has clearly been beneficial, the basic procedures have not been
altered, notes OTR. 'Hallmark still monitors which cards are sold and
adjusts its stock and design requirements accordingly.'
In fact, OTR concludes, nobody has re-engineered their whole business: it is
too risky. Even where funds are unlimited, no company dares risk removing
the pillars that support its business, rearranging them and putting them
back in place - the worry is that the business would collapse before
reassembly was complete.
How then can a company achieve the benefits of BPR? OTR prescribes measures
which resemble those traditionally recommended for implementing information
technology: leadership from the top, cultural as well as organisational
change and a cautious approach - experimenting with prototype re-engineering
in a small part of the organisation is better than attempting an
enterprise-wide transformation.
It recommends an interesting mix of people for the re-engineering team. It
suggests broadly-based insiders, dispassionate outsiders - and 'rebels' who
think the whole exercise will be a waste of time.
Such people are better on the inside than the outside where their fears and
suspicions can help to spread doom and despondency. Their ability to spot
genuine flaws in the project can save money in the long term. The rebel as
hero is an uncommon image in management lore, but it may become increasingly
familiar as BPR spreads.

FT  20 APR 93 / People: Tregoning takes on unit trusts challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Julian Tregoning, 46, an executive director of the Save and Prosper unit
trust group, is to be the next chairman of The Unit Trust Association, which
is fighting to find a role for itself in the fast-changing financial
services industry.
Old Harrovian Tregoning, who has spent over 20 years with Save and Prosper,
cuts a more traditional figure than the outgoing chairman, Barry Bateman,
47, managing director of Fidelity Investments. Fidelity is one of the more
aggressive fund managers, while S&amp;P is regarded by many as one of the
industry's sleeping giants.
Bateman, who joined Fidelity in 1981 after stints as marketing director of
Datastream and research director of brokers Hoare Govett, leap-frogged a
number of rivals for the UTA chairman's job two years ago. By contrast,
Tregoning (right) has arrived at the top via the more traditional route of
the deputy chairmanship of the UTA.
However, one industry-watcher played down the differences in style and said
that while Tregoning 'might seem a bit of an old buffer, he is really quite
sharp'. Bateman has done a lot to modernise the UTA but his more combative
style has sometimes upset powerful members.
Tregoning will have to be more than a traditional industry figurehead if he
is going to make his mark. The old demarcation lines between building
societies, investment trusts and other financial services, are crumbling and
unit trusts are facing increasing competition from overseas funds. As a
result the UTA is changing its constitution and renaming itself the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds.
Tregoning is not the only new face at the top of the UTA. Victoria Philip,
31, Fidelity's corporate affairs manager, is replacing Gavin Grant as head
of public affairs. Grant is going to do the same job at Body Shop
International. She is the latest in a number of new arrivals which include
Sheila Nicol, director legal and fiscal affairs, who came from the Stock
Exchange, and Simon Smith, taxation adviser, who was hired from Arthur
Andersen.

FT  20 APR 93 / Technology: Ice that thinks it's a liquid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It sounds like part of a fictional arctic vision of the future, a cold and
forbidding landscape where computers hold sway. But binary ice is not
something in the science fiction books and its applications are the mundane
ones of the supermarket and the industrial plant.
Developed by a British company called Solmecs Flo-Ice Systems, binary ice is
formed through the suspension of microscopic ice crystals in a salt, sugar
or alcohol solution. It has the properties of normal ice from frozen water
but behaves like a liquid. This means it can be pumped and easily stored.
Solmecs has been developing Flo-Ice technology for the past six years and
has licensees in 20 countries in Europe (mainly Germany), Asia, Africa and
South America. It hopes to conclude a further deal in France for use in
supermarkets. Interest from British companies, however, is still lagging.
'There's lots of inertia over here,' says Len Constant, a Solmecs director,
about UK companies' response to new ideas.
With concern growing about the harmful impact on the atmosphere of
refrigerants containing CFCs, Solmecs believes that the greater use of
binary ice would have both commercial and environmental benefits. 'The
increasingly intense discussion about future refrigerants is creating
headaches for manufacturers of refrigeration equipment, installers and
especially for end-users,' Joachim Paul, head of German-based Integral
Technologie (a part owner of Solmecs), said in a recent paper to the UK's
Institute of Refrigeration.
Crystals of binary ice have a high heat absorption rate and, in their main
application, can act as a secondary refrigerant flowing round large cooling
systems at temperatures below zero. This allows companies to cut down on
harmful primary refrigerants which are being phased out anyway. The need for
large pipes and cooling equipment is thus reduced.
Ice can also be made at night, when energy is generally cheaper, and pumped
into a storage tank for use in the daytime.

FT  20 APR 93 / People: Francis Maude switches American banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than a year after joining Salomon Brothers, Francis Maude, financial
secretary at the Treasury until he lost his seat at the last general
election, is on the move again - this time to rival US investment bank
Morgan Stanley. The job description (head of privatisation) remains the
same, but at Morgan Stanley International, Maude will get a seat on the
board as a managing director (he was only a director at Salomon) and an
opening in a bank with higher standing internationally in the privatisation
business.
'There is nothing particularly sinister' in the early switch, Maude says,
pointing out that his new employer is 'set up to do large-scale
privatisation business'. He tactfully declines to comment on his experiences
at Salomon, where his name has not been closely associated with any large
new transactions.
Still only 39, Maude has now had three careers - as a barrister, junior
minister and now banker - but says: 'There is time for plenty more.' Though
he has indicated that he will not fight to regain his old seat as an MP, he
adds that his political ambitions are 'not dead by any means'. The move to
Morgan Stanley was seen by former colleagues at Salomon as a way for Maude
to make his mark quickly (and presumably very profitably) before jumping
back into politics at the next UK election. (See Observer)

FT  20 APR 93 / PowerGen opens Pounds 290m gas plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT to coal mining from gas was underlined yesterday when PowerGen
became the first of the two large electricity generators officially to open
a combined cycle gas turbine power station.
The 900MW output of Killingholme, on Humberside, is equivalent to that
produced from a station supplied by two large coal mines.
It is the first of three combined cycle stations planned by PowerGen.
National Power, the other large generator, is building a gas-fired station
on a site adjacent to PowerGen's Killingholme plant. All but one of the 12
regional electricity companies are involved in building combined cycle
stations.
Enron, the US company, recently opened a 1,875MW plant on Teeside.
Combined-cycle stations use exhaust gases from a gas turbine to power a
steam turbine, thereby reducing emissions.
Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said yesterday that Killingholme,
built at a cost of more than Pounds 290m, would probably not have been built
unless the electricity industry had been privatised. 'Privatisation really
gave the board the right to manage, to do what it believed was commercially
right,' he said.
At privatisation, 'we inherited power stations that were on average 20 years
old. They were predominantly coal. Fuel was expensive and dirty. When you
compare combined cycle stations to coal equivalents it is difficult to see
the disadvantages,' Mr Wallis said.
Meanwhile, Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, yesterday warned that even
more jobs would have to go from the coal industry if was to become fully
competitive with imports.
'If we are prepared to accept the assistance of the taxpayer to allow us to
become yet more efficient, then we must accept that there will be a price to
pay,' he said. British Gas has completed its second gas auction, offering
supplies to 102 companies that applied for gas under the release programme
agreed by the company as a way of encouraging competition.

FT  20 APR 93 / Facts show fat cats are fatter: Lucy Kellaway uncovers
backing for allegations of directors' greed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR'S season of company reports is revealing a picture which backs up
the claim that company directors are greedy.
The assertion was made by Mr Roger Young, head of the Institute of
Management, who was commenting on a report by the institute which shows
directors' pay is rising at more than twice the rate of inflation.
Large companies such as British Gas and ICI have announced pay freezes in
the boardroom, but other companies giving out fat increases to directors are
causing raised eyebrows. British Aerospace, Hillsdown Holdings, SmithKline
Beecham, BAT and English China Clays have all hit the headlines recently
over rises in executive pay.
The onus is now on them to prove they deserve such big payments. In general
the evidence suggests this is not always the case.
This year companies are starting to provide more information in their annual
reports about what they pay their top people - a move prompted by the
Cadbury Committee's report on corporate governance. Most of the big
companies have included in their 1992 report a new section on corporate
governance, declaring compliance with the Cadbury code which comes into
force in June.
Companies are providing details of their audit and remuneration committees
and are giving breakdowns detailing the salary and bonus elements of the pay
of directors, the chairman and the highest-paid director. Some companies are
giving information on how the pay is arrived at.
For many this marks a big departure. A survey by Monks Partnership, the pay
consultancy, showed that only 16 per cent of FT-SE 100 companies fully
complied with the code in their 1991 accounts. Many companies have made
significant changes already. Lloyds Bank, for example, which complied with
none of the guidelines last year, now meets all of them.
However, even where company reports fully meet the code shareholders might
benefit from some further explanation of directors' pay.
Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals
group, saw his pay rise 20 per cent last year to Pounds 1.5m, while profits
before tax rose just 11 per cent.
The company's report shows that the bulk of his rise was in bonus. His basic
salary and perks rose 12.5 per cent. The company said he deserved the rise
as it had performed well.
The Institute of Management survey shows the level of pay increases varies
sharply from one sector to another, yet those differences are not balanced
by similar differences in profitability.
In chemicals and allied industries directors received pay rises of 15.3 per
cent last year, while the earnings of the chemicals sector as a whole fell
11 per cent. Directors of food, drink and tobacco groups received less than
3 per cent more last year, yet their companies performed relatively well. In
particular, food retailers increased earnings by about 11 per cent.
Mr Young points out that sector figures mask large differences in the pay of
individual companies. For instance, the big increase in top pay of energy
companies may be largely a reflection of a catch-up in the pay of
electricity utilities following privatisation.
Even within each sector the position is different. In the energy industry
some companies are showing restraint - such as British Gas after public
anger the previous year when Mr Robert Evans, chief executive, received an
over-generous rise - while other smaller companies are not doing so.
Shareholders in Premier Consolidated Oilfields are becoming restive at the
50 per cent increase in total directors' pay last year and are planning to
put embarrassing questions at the group's AGM next week.
Companies themselves give a wide variety of reasons for pay rises to
directors. BAT justifies the 50 per cent-odd increase in pay of Sir Patrick
Sheehey, its chairman, in terms of that company's leap in productivity.

THE managing director of Dean Smith &amp; Grace has saved part of the West
Yorkshire-based machine tool company from closure by acquiring the spares,
service and rebuilding activities from Monarch Machine Tool, the US parent
company.
Monarch said in December it would close Dean Smith &amp; Grace in June because
of the recession. A new company, DSG Lathes, has been formed by Mr Richard
Hole to focus initially on rebuilding and re-engineering standard and
computer numerically controlled lathes.
The terms of the deal have not been disclosed but Mr Hole and his wife will

FT  20 APR 93 / Jail for executive who stole Pounds 13m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Ferriday, the former chief executive of Eagle Trust, was jailed for
six years yesterday for stealing Pounds 13m to cover losses in the 1987
Black Monday stock market crash.
At Wolverhampton Crown Court Judge Malcolm Ward described Mr Ferriday as
'totally unscrupulous' and disqualified him from being a company director
for 10 years.
Mr Ferriday, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, was found guilty by jury
earlier this month of five theft charges after a 10-month trial. He denied
stealing Pounds 12.25m and 1.7m shares belonging to Eagle Trust.
The court heard Mr Ferriday syphoned off money from the company to cover
losses he suffered in the Black Monday stock market crash in 1987.

FT  20 APR 93 / Ulster terrorism plans attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has become embroiled in a row with its main statutory
advisory body on human rights in Northern Ireland over proposals aimed at
combating terrorist-linked racketeering in the construction industry.
A document by the Northern Ireland Office proposes a package of measures
including the issuing of identity cards for building workers, a special
licensing scheme for construction companies, new powers for customs officers
and Inland Revenue inspectors, and a widening of emergency anti-terrorist
legislation.
The NIO estimates that the IRA raises more than Pounds 2m a year through
construction industry-related tax fraud and extortion.
It emerged yesterday that the proposals have been the subject of heated
correspondence between the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights and
the NIO after the government bypassed the commission in an initial
consultation exercise at the beginning of February.
The commission learned about the proposals last month from Mr Kevin
McNamara, the Labour spokesman on Northern Ireland, only after the plans had
in turn been leaked to him through a third party unconnected with the
government.
The NIO said: 'The consultative exercise has gone well, and when it is
concluded ministers will be informed of its outcome and invited to consider
the way forward.'
This was disputed yesterday by members of the commission, who indicated that
the consultation had strained relations with the NIO.
The government is also facing opposition not to the principle of combating
terrorist funding but the way it is proposing to deal with the problem from
bodies which were initially consulted on both sides of industry.
Mr Nigel Smyth, the CBI's Northern Ireland director, said the working paper
implied excessive regulation which could unfairly discriminate against small
and medium-sized companies.
The Irish Congress of Trade Unions said the proposals had civil liberty
implications and were in part impractical.
The high cost of fighting terrorism has left the Royal Ulster Constabulary
short of cash and diverting funds from reserves set aside for buying vital
computer equipment, senior police sources in the province said yesterday.
The overtime bill for the last financial year was nearly Pounds 70m.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE HEALTH and Safety Executive will investigate the links between chemicals
used in semiconductor manufacturing and miscarriages suffered by women
working in the industry.
The UK investigation follows a recent large-scale study in the US which
found a miscarriage rate of 12 per cent to 14 per cent among women working
in semiconductor manufacturing. This compared with 10 per cent for the
population as a whole.
Between 2,000 and 2,500 women are estimated to work in semiconductor
manufacturing in the UK.
The HSE said the chemicals involved were glycol ethers, adding that there
was particular concern about the glycol ethers of lower molecular weight.
There have already been moves by the industry to phase out the use of the
most potentially hazardous glycol ethers, following an earlier small-scale
US study of miscarriages among women exposed to the substances.

FT  20 APR 93 / Record fine over worker's death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COURT yesterday imposed a record fine on a construction company for a
health and safety offence.
J Murphy and Sons of north London was fined a total of Pounds 160,000 plus
Pounds 28,000 costs at Knightsbridge Crown Court following the death of a
worker in February 1991. The company admitted two charges under the Health
and Safety at Work Act 1974.
The Health and Safety Executive, which brought the case, said the level of
the fine reflected 'a widespread corporate failure'. Mr Jeff Hinksman, HSE
deputy chief inspector, said the fine 'should serve as a warning to all
firms in the construction industry to take their management responsibilities
for health and safety seriously'.
The court heard that William Kerr, 35, of Greenford, Middlesex, died from an
electric shock suffered while working underground on stage two of the London
water ring main project. He was one of a number of subcontracted workers who
were moving a mobile electrical transformer inside a tunnel.
Mr Hugh Carlisle QC, for the HSE, told the court a 'catalogue of errors'
throughout the company had led to 3,300 volts - 13 times the domestic rate -
passing through Kerr.
An oversight meant the electrical system had not been properly earthed and
the work should have been done under guidance from a fully qualified
engineer, he said. Maintenance supervision was 'haphazard' while the company
had failed to come to terms with new electric regulations brought in almost
a year earlier.
The company was fined Pounds 150,000 for failing to have a system for
ensuring the safe design, construction and maintenance of the electrical
system at the site. It was also fined Pounds 10,000 for failure to maintain
the electrical system involving the transformer. Costs were awarded to the
HSE.
J Murphy and Sons said last night it deeply regretted the accident. 'The
company views the safety of its employees, contractors and members of the
public as being of prime importance.'
The company added that Mr James O'Callaghan, J Murphy's director with
responsibility for safety matters and director of the tunnelling division,
had been acquitted of charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act and
had been awarded costs after the prosecution declined to offer any evidence.

FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister defends Group 4 service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was no reason yet to believe Group 4 Court Services was not up to the
job of operating Britain's first private prisoner escort service, Mr Peter
Lloyd, prisons minister, told the Commons home affairs committee yesterday.
Seven prisoners escaped or were wrongly released during Group 4's first
fortnight of running the service in the east Midlands, Yorkshire and
Humberside.
Mr Lloyd conceded that the Group 4 operation had got off to a disappointing
start and provided a 'field day for cartoonists.' But he believed the
principles behind contracting-out escort services, releasing police and
prison officers for other tasks, were correct.
He would not think the government had taken the wrong course unless similar
numbers of escapes continued in the coming weeks.
The committee was also told that in addition to his Pounds 125,000 salary,
Mr Derek Lewis, the television executive recruited by the government as
director general of the Prison Service, will qualify for performance related
bonuses of up to 35 per cent of his salary. Mr Lloyd said the formula for
calculating the bonuses had not been finally decided.

FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Private-sector rail plan considered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday acknowledged for the first time that it was
considering a plan by a private-sector consortium to finance a much-needed
Pounds 900m upgrade of the railway line between London Euston, the Midlands
and north-west England.
Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said: 'It's a very exciting
idea, and we are discussing with our colleagues in the Treasury how it would
work.' The government had also been approached with similar plans for other
lines, Mr Freeman said.
The scheme under consideration, prompted by the government's recently avowed
enthusiasm for attracting private finance into public-sector infrastructure
projects, has been proposed by three of Britain's biggest engineering
companies: GEC Alsthom, Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty.
The Pounds 900m bill for the project would also cover the purchase of a
fleet of trains to be provided by GEC Alsthom. However, Mr Freeman yesterday
said this part of the scheme might be funded separately under a Pounds 150m
leasing facility awarded to BR in last year's Autumn Statement.
Alternatively, the Pounds 150m could be used to lease more Networker
commuter trains to operate on Network SouthEast's Kent Coast and Great
Northern routes. Tenders would be invited for both options, Mr Freeman said,
with the eventual choice depending on the bids received.

THE Student Loans Company has breached government undertakings by taking
more than Pounds 1.5m from the higher education system, the Commons public
accounts committee heard yesterday, John Authers writes.
Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West, quoted figures from the
committee of vice-chancellors and principals to back his claim. 'The CVCP
says it's costing colleges an average of Pounds 7 per student, and the
department is only paying them Pounds 4 per student,' he said.
He also quoted a statement made in 1990 by Lord Caithness, then the
education minister responsible, that the government intended to 'cover the
costs for universities'.
Mr Williams combined the total number of student loan accounts administered
by the Student Loans Company, of around 524,000, and the average subsidy of
Pounds 3 per loan to claim that the SLC was taking 'more than Pounds 1.5m'
from the colleges, in breach of Lord Caithness' undertakings.
Mr Ronald Harrison, chief executive of the SLC, denied this, saying that the
Pounds 4 figure was intended as a reasonable contribution towards cost. He
added: 'There are colleges which are administering it within the Pounds 4
per student that we pay. There are other universities which cannot meet this
standard and they are the ones which are complaining.'
Committee members also criticised the optimistic assumptions for take-up
made by the SLC when it was launched. It assumed that 80 per cent of
eligible students would take out a loan in its first year. The eventual
figure was 28 per cent.

FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Legal obstacles to contracting out
targeted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS are considering legislation in the next session of parliament to
sweep away legal obstacles to the contracting out of Civil Service work.
The obstacles have emerged in the search for work to be put out to tender in
a second round of market-testing, due to start in the autumn.
The first round, currently in progress, has put contracts worth almost
Pounds 1.5bn out to tender, forcing nearly 45,000 civil servants to compete
for their own jobs. The contracts include some core Whitehall work such as
the Treasury's economic forecasting and data collection, as well as support
work such as information technology consultancy, legal and estate management
services.
Consultants have been helping departments and agencies to draw up lists of
activities for the second round, which is expected to be worth more than
Pounds 1bn. However, scope for putting more civil service work out to tender
appears to be constrained by acts of parliament which prevent ministers from
delegating their duties.
The Civil and Public Services Association, the largest Civil Service union,
says that plans to market-test the agency that pays Civil Service pensions
have been put on hold after lawyers advised that ministers could not
delegate their authority to administer the scheme under the Superannuation
Act 1972.
If legislation is needed it is likely to be in the form of additional
clauses 'piggy-backing' on other bills going through parliament rather than
a single bill to cover market-testing.
Any changes will not, however, attempt to deal with the biggest obstacle
which has emerged to the market-testing programme - the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 1981, or Tupe, regulations which
guarantee the jobs and pay of the existing workforce in many cases when work
is contracted out.
As the regulations implement the European Community Acquired Rights
Directive they cannot be removed by UK legislation.
Local authorities in England will have to start contracting out construction
and legal services from October 1995, Mr Robin Squire, environment minister,
announced yesterday.
Compulsory competitive tendering will be progressively extended to other
white-collar services, including information technology services, housing
management, finance, personnel, and corporate and administrative services.

STRIKERS at the Timex company's plant in Dundee have been warned by their
trade union that it may expel them if they break the law in the course of
the dispute.
In a letter sent to each of the 340 strikers Mr Gavin Laird, general
secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said:
'Failure to obey the instructions of the union's executive council will
render you liable to expulsion from the union.'
Today the Scottish TUC is debating the Timex strike , while tomorrow the
AEEU's national committee will discuss the Timex dispute at its annual
conference.
Next week, representatives of both the company and the union will present
their cases before the House of Commons employment committee.

FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd wins backing for Bosnia
blockade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE MPs showed signs last night of rallying around a government
policy on Bosnia of toughening sanctions against Serbia and rejecting for
now - but not ruling out - an escalation of military action.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, won support among Tories for his pledge
to ensure the tightest possible enforcement of sanctions agreed by the UN on
Saturday. 'We are looking to turn sanctions into a blockade,' he said.
But he again faced calls from Labour for 'punitive' air strikes against Serb
supply and communication lines if the peace plan of UN negotiators Mr Cyrus
Vance and Lord Owen was not accepted. Some Labour left-wingers urged a more
forceful intervention.
Among Tory MPs, however, widespread fears about Britain being dragged into
an escalating conflict surfaced during Mr Hurd's statement.
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, last night flatly rejected
calls from Lady Thatcher, his successor in 10 Downing Street, for western
military intervention. Sir Edward, speaking after Mr Hurd's statement, said
that the West had no hope of settling the war by military means. Instead it
should concentrate its efforts on improving the supply of humanitarian aid.
Earlier in the Commons Mr Michael Ancram, Conservative MP for Devizes, said
positive military action might produce short-term results but could
'threaten a wide and bloodier civil war'.
Mr Nicholas Budgen, Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, asked: 'What is
the British national interest in Bosnia?' He said the government needed to
explain what differentiated 'the horrible war in Bosnia from the many
equally horrible wars which are occuring in other parts of the world'.
Mr Michael Colvin, Tory MP for Romsey and Waterside, said the Serbs had
enough weapons to last two years and backed strongly the imposition of a
blockade. 'The umbilical cord between Moscow and Belgrade must be cut,' he
added.
For Labour, Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, said the
government had admited existing sanctions against Serbia had not been
properly enforced. He said it was time the Serbs were given an ultimatum
backed by the threat of air strikes.

FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Confident Fowler stresses recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END of the recession and the growing strength of the economy forms the
background to next month's county council elections, Sir Norman Fowler, the
Tory party chairman, said yesterday.
In a confident assessment of the UK's economic prospects, Sir Norman
emphasised that the message over the remaining weeks of the campaign would
be that Conservative policies were bearing fruit: 'The recession is over. We
are recovering.'
His words were echoed in Newbury, Berkshire, where the by-election in the
once-safe Tory seat will be held on the same day as the local elections. Mr
Julian Davidson, the Tory by-election candidate, said a Conservative victory
would signal confidence in the government's economic policy.
But Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader whose party offers the
main challenge to the Tories, used a rally in Newbury last night to urge
voters to 'speak for Britain', and force the government to change its
approach.
Liberal Democrats hope that Mr Ashdown's 'Newbury declaration' will show
that they offer more than a protest vote. It lists demands for action by the
government, such as investment in skills and education, fair taxation, and a
well-resourced health service.
'We can in Newbury set out the positive vision of where Britain needs to go
to make this country, again, a successful nation,' Mr Ashdown said.
But the other main parties were dismissive of the impact a victory for Mr
David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat candidate, would have. Campaigning in
support of Mr Steve Billcliffe, the Labour candidate, Mrs Margaret Beckett,
the party's deputy leader, said that voting Labour was 'a vote for a clear,
competent alternative that the government could not shrug off'.
The extent of the Liberal Democrat challenge to the Tories, in Newbury and
in the county council elections, was underlined by the Tories' attack
yesterday in both campaigns on the Liberal Democrat proposal of a local
income tax to replace the council tax.

FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour pressed on industry stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL JORDAN, president of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical
Union (AEEU), yesterday called for the Labour party to drop its
constitutional commitment to take British industry into public ownership.
He told the union's conference in Llandudno that trade unions should abandon
their dominant role in the party's policymaking by scrapping their block
votes at party conference.
His proposals are likely to be welcomed by Labour leader Mr John Smith, who
is seeking to modernise Labour's programme and constitution.
Mr Jordan told delegates Clause 4 of Labour's 1918 constitution, which
commits the party to public ownership, had become obsolescent.
'Seventy-five years on, the Labour party is more than just a worker's party
representing trade unionists at Westminster. It is a party that must
represent all ordinary men and women regardless of sectional interest.'
He suggested as an alternative that Labour should state its commitment 'to
secure for the people of Britain the right to healthcare, education and
employment and to ensure that there is equality of opportunity and justice
for every citizen.'
The AEEU president said the union block vote had to go to improve Labour's
image. 'The sight of union barons holding aloft block votes representing
thousands of union members to decide Labour policy is anathema to the
majority of people,' he said. 'We should move as quickly as possible to a
system of one member one vote inside the party.'
Mr Jordan announced yesterday the union would hold a postal ballot of
members this summer on whether they wished to keep supporting the trade
unions' political fund. The AEEU leaders intend to emphasise that all the
money raised through the political levy taken from their members'
subscriptions will be used to finance Labour. The union is set to pay about
Pounds 750,000 to the party next year.
The ballot is being held 18 months earlier than required by law to ensure
the state will pay three-quarters of its cost.

FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Left in censure move over social
chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S ATTEMPTS to corner the government over the Maastricht treaty's
social chapter were thrown into confusion last night after left-wing Labour
MPs tabled a motion censuring Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker.
The move came after the government seemed to have been put on the defensive
by Mr Morris's decision to accept a new Labour clause calling for an
explicit vote on Britain's social chapter opt-out.
This appeared to be a setback for the government since the selected clause
is more tightly drawn than the similar Labour new clause which the
government said last week that it would accept.
But it remained unclear whether the clause - known as new clause 74 - had
the potential to pose a real threat to the Maastricht process by forcing the
government to choose between accepting the social chapter and ratifying the
treaty.
The three Labour signatories to the motion of censure seemed to think that
it did not. Mr Peter Shore, the veteran MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney,
described both it and the new clause accepted by the government last week as
'entirely agreeable' to the government.
The motion was tabled after Mr Morris, the MP presiding over detailed
consideration of the Maastricht bill, again confirmed that he would not
allow MPs to vote on a potentially crucial Labour amendment which would
remove the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from the social chapter.
The motion - tabled by Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, Mr Denzil
Davies, the MP for Llanelli, and Mr Shore - expressed regret that Mr Morris
had decided 'contrary to normal practice' not to permit a division on an
amendment 'having allowed a debate upon it to take place.'
It called on Mr Morris to 'reconsider his ruling forthwith' and permit MPs
to 'reach a decision on that amendment'. Unless withdrawn, it is expected to
be debated today or tomorrow.
But there were predictions last night that its main effect could be to make
a vote on the amendment less rather than more likely.
This was because it might undermine the efforts of the Labour front bench to
secure a vote on the amendment - known as amendment 27 - during the bill's
report stage.
If the motion were heavily defeated as seems likely, the reasoning went, it
would suggest MPs were happy with Mr Morris's ruling and this could weaken
the argument for holding such a vote at report stage.
Later Liberal Democrat support helped the government to win a vote to extend
debate beyond 10pm by a margin of just 7 (302 votes to 295.) With Labour
abstaining, MPs then voted by a margin of 200 (296 votes to 96) that clause
one - the measure's main substantive clause - should stand as part of the
bill.

FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: The respectable face of an unholy
alliance - Labour's voice on European affairs talks to Philip Stephens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Robertson's European credentials are as good as any in the House
of Commons. The 47-year-old MP for Hamilton was a friend of Brussels long
before it was fashionable to be so in the higher reaches of the Labour
party.
He played a pivotal role in persuading the opposition to put enthusiastic
Europeanism at the centre of its manifesto for the 1992 election. His
reputation among some of the less enlightened Labour MPs as a 'Euro-fanatic'
played a not-insignificant part in denying him enough votes to win the place
he deserves in the shadow cabinet.
But that was last year. Now Labour's European affairs spokesman spends every
waking hour making it as difficult as possible for Mr John Major to ratify
the British version of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Robertson is adamant that his party is not out to destroy Maastricht.
Sitting in his Westminster office yesterday he stressed repeatedly that its
tactics were legitimate. 'Labour at no stage has organised any filibuster
against the legislation. Nor has it supported attempts to wreck the treaty.
We have acted like an opposition. We have not made life easy for them. But
we have not prejudiced the long-term future of the treaty,' he said.
Later this week, he added, Labour would join the government in opposing the
referendum on the treaty demanded by Euro-sceptics on the Conservative back
benches.
But the opposition will press to the limit its campaign to force the
government to abandon Britain's opt-out from the treaty's social chapter
whatever the threats from Mr Major that without such an exclusion he would
not ratify.
Before last night's outburst by left-wing Euro-sceptics Mr Robertson had
been among a delegation which persuaded Mr Michael Morris, the deputy
speaker, to accept for debate another amendment to the bill which might -
just might - derail the ratification process.
The amendment, the latest in a series opposing the social chapter opt-out,
is designed to face Mr Major with the choice of abandoning either the
opt-out or the whole treaty. It requires the Commons to take an explicit
vote before final ratification - or rather a still-more explicit vote than
the one demanded by a similar amendment already accepted by the government -
on the social chapter protocol.
The Tory Euro-sceptics may join the opposition in voting to delete the
opt-out, hoping that Mr Major would then abandon the whole treaty. Labour's
judgment was that the prime minister would drop the opt-out rather than
become the pariah of Europe by wrecking the treaty.
Mr Robertson will continue to press for yet another vote - on the so-called
amendment 27 - which would put still more pressure on the prime minister
over the social chapter.
This less-than-holy alliance with the Tory Euro-sceptics is not that easy to
explain to the outside world. It smacks of political opportunism. Until
yesterday's move by Mr Tony Benn to censure the deputy speaker, it had
allowed the opposition to paper over its own internal divisions by
persuading the Labour Euro-sceptics to keep relatively quiet.
The stance sufficiently disturbed President Francois Mitterrand of France
for him to seek a personal assurance from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
that the opposition would not destroy the treaty for the rest of the
community.
But Mr Robertson is unrepentant. Mr Major, not Labour, had delayed the
passage of the bill by promising the Tory Euro-sceptics that the critical
third reading would not come until after the second Danish referendum on May
18, he said.
Within that timetable, Labour had demanded no more than the proper scrutiny
demanded by legislation of such significance. 'We have taken a specific
decision not to support amendments which would wreck the treaty . . our sole
interest is not to prevent ratification but to get the social chapter which
all the other 11 countries are going to enjoy,' Mr Robertson said. Britain's
European partners did not want the opt-out.
He had checked with other governments that a decision by Britain at this
late stage to accept the social provisions would not delay ratification. The
necessary changes could be made in an inter-governmental conference lasting
a matter of hours. Whatever Mr Major said now, if parliament voted for the
social chapter it was 'inconceivable' that the prime minister would refuse
to sign 'something that everyone else in Europe regards as sensible'.
Maybe. Mr Robertson is a skilful enough politician to make it sound
convincing. Nor could anyone doubt the honesty of his attachment to the
social chapter. But somehow he cannot quite dispel the impression that
Labour, like the government, will emerge eventually from the Maastricht saga
with something less than honour.

FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union warning to Timex strikers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRIKERS at the Timex company's plant in Dundee have been warned by their
trade union that it may expel them if they break the law in the course of
the dispute.
In a letter sent to each of the 340 strikers Mr Gavin Laird, general
secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said:
'Failure to obey the instructions of the union's executive council will
render you liable to expulsion from the union.'
Since the beginning of the Timex strike 12 weeks ago the union has been
determined not to be involved in any unlawful action which would threaten
its own funds. Nevertheless the AEEU is going to unprecedented lengths to
protect itself from the dangers of litigation.
Mr Laird told the Timex strikers loss of union membership would lead to
withdrawal of the Pounds 30-a-week strike pay and other facilities. He added
that they could also lose their right to complain about unfair dismissal by
the company before an industrial tribunal if the union expelled them.
Mr Laird says in the letter: 'The executive council is seriously concerned
at reports received over the last few days about the escalating situation.'
Nevertheless, hundreds of the strikers' supporters have visited the picket
line outside the plant and others have held cash collections for them.
In an earlier letter Mr Laird told the strikers that any picketing that took
place outside the Timex plant had to be undertaken 'only by those who were
formerly employed by Timex and the union's officials and limited to six
people.
Today the Scottish TUC is debating the Timex strike and a large contingent
from the strikers is expected to lobby the delegates in Glasgow. Tomorrow
the AEEU's national committee will discuss the strike at its annual
conference.
Next week both the company and the union will present their cases before the
Commons employment committee.
The dispute aroused controversy after the company dismissed all its
employees for refusing to co-operate in a new working practices agreement
involving lay-offs and replacing them with a substitute workforce.
Timex has been unwilling to accept the intervention of the independent
conciliation service Acas to resolve the dispute.

FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Private rail plan scrutinised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday acknowledged for the first time that it was
considering a plan by a private-sector consortium to finance a much-needed
Pounds 900m upgrade of the railway line between London Euston, the Midlands
and north-west England.
Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said: 'It's a very exciting
idea, and we are discussing with our colleagues in the Treasury how it would
work.' The government had also been approached with similar plans for other
lines, Mr Freeman said.
The scheme under consideration, prompted by the government's recently avowed
enthusiasm for attracting private finance into public-sector infrastructure
projects, has been proposed by three of Britain's biggest engineering
companies: GEC Alsthom, Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty.
It would involve the renewal of worn-out tracks, replacement of signalling
and overhead electricity supply systems, realignment of curved sections of
track to allow faster train speeds, and replacement of some bridges.
One option for financing the scheme would be for the consortium to be
granted a limited-life concession to operate the line, upgrade it at its own
expense, and be paid by the government according to the number of trains
using the tracks.
The Pounds 900m bill for the project would also cover the purchase of a
fleet of trains to be provided by GEC Alsthom. However, Mr Freeman yesterday
said this part of the scheme might be funded separately under a Pounds 150m
leasing facility awarded to BR in last year's Autumn Statement.
Alternatively, the Pounds 150m could be used to lease more Networker
commuter trains which could operate on Network SouthEast's Kent Coast and
Great Northern routes. Tenders would be invited for both options, Mr Freeman
said.

MR BILL JORDAN, president of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical
Union (AEEU), yesterday called for the Labour party to drop its
constitutional commitment to take British industry into public ownership.
He told the union's conference in Llandudno that trade unions should abandon
their dominant role in the party's policymaking by scrapping their block
votes at party conference.
His proposals are likely to be welcomed by Labour leader Mr John Smith, who
is seeking to modernise Labour's programme and constitution.
Mr Jordan told delegates Clause 4 of Labour's 1918 constitution, which
commits the party to public ownership, had become obsolescent.
'Seventy-five years on, the Labour party is more than just a worker's party
representing trade unionists at Westminster. It is a party that must
represent all ordinary men and women regardless of sectional interest.'
He suggested as an alternative that Labour should state its commitment 'to
secure for the people of Britain the right to healthcare, education and
employment and to ensure that there is equality of opportunity and justice
for every citizen.'
The AEEU president said the union block vote had to go to improve Labour's
image. 'The sight of union barons holding aloft block votes representing
thousands of union members to decide Labour policy is anathema to the
majority of people,' he said. 'We should move as quickly as possible to a
system of one member one vote inside the party.'
Mr Jordan said nobody could deny the US unions supported the Democratic
party, without the kind of ties that bound Labour and unions in Britain.
'The unions must maintain strong links but not chains on Labour's leaders,'
he said.
'The trade unions link will remain if we work hard to ensure that trade
unionists become individual members of the party,' Mr Jordan said. 'Those
who believe the Labour party will abandon trade unionists are mistaken. We
will continue to have our say through the new democratised structure.'
The AEEU would remain as a substantial financial contributor to Labour's
funds whatever happened to the future relationship between the unions and
the party.
Mr Jordan announced yesterday the union would hold a postal ballot of
members this summer on whether they wished to keep supporting the trade
unions' political fund. The AEEU leaders intend to emphasise that all the
money raised through the political levy taken from their members'
subscriptions will be used to finance the Labour party. The union is set to
pay about Pounds 750,000 into Labour's coffers next year.
The ballot is being held 18 months earlier than required by law to ensure
the state will pay three-quarters of its cost.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The platform is lifted into place for Amerada Hess's Scott field, which is
expected to be the largest oilfield development in the North Sea this
decade. The field, which is thought to contain 450m barrels of oil and 287bn
cu ft of gas, will produce 10 per cent of the UK's oil needs when production
starts in November. The oilfield will be operated by Amerada Hess, whose
partners in the development include Amoco, Deminex, Enterprise Oil, Mobil,
Kerr McGee and Pict Petroleum.

FT  20 APR 93 / Council tax allows town hall staff cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
MOST COUNCILS in England and Wales have coped well with the introduction of
the council tax to replace the poll tax, a report today by the Audit
Commission, the local authority watchdog, shows.
The commission found in a survey that the change had allowed councils to
reduce staff by a planned average of 24 per cent.
The commission found that many councils still faced 'significant' backlogs
from the community charge which would take time to clear.
It found fault with two areas of council-tax implementation:
About 21 per cent of authorities face the danger of being left with computer
capacity they do not need, having bought equipment for the changeover
without an option of returning it.
More than 10 per cent of authorities have failed to monitor progress with
the council tax.

FT  20 APR 93 / Record fine imposed after worker dies
</HEADLINE>

A COURT yesterday imposed a record fine on a construction company for a
health and safety offence.
J Murphy and Sons of north London was fined a total of Pounds 160,000 plus
Pounds 28,000 costs at Knightsbridge Crown Court following the death of a
worker in February 1991. The company admitted two charges under the Health
and Safety at Work Act 1974.
The Health and Safety Executive, which brought the case, said the level of
the fine reflected 'a widespread corporate failure'.
The court heard that William Kerr, 35, of Greenford, Middlesex, died from an
electric shock suffered while working on the London water ring main project.
Mr Hugh Carlisle QC, for the HSE, told the court a 'catalogue of errors'
throughout the company had led to 3,300 volts - 13 times the domestic rate -
passing through Kerr.
An oversight meant the electrical system had not been properly earthed and
the work should have been done under guidance from a fully qualified
engineer, he said.
The company was fined Pounds 150,000 for failing to have a system for
ensuring the safe design, construction and maintenance of the electrical
system, and Pounds 10,000 for failure to maintain the system involving the
transformer. Costs were awarded to the HSE.
J Murphy and Sons said last night it deeply regretted the accident. 'The
company views the safety of its employees, contractors and members of the
public as being of prime importance,' it said.
It added that Mr James O'Callaghan, J Murphy's director with responsibility
for safety matters and director of the tunnelling division, had been
acquitted of charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act and had been
awarded costs after the prosecution declined to offer any evidence.
