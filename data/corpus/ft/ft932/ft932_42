FT  20 APR 93 / CBI cautious on start of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SHOP SALES grew in the year to March at their fastest rate since November
1991 but the improvement in sales is not yet firmly established, the
Confederation of British Industry reported yesterday.
Sales volumes last month were up on a year ago for the third consecutive
month, but the CBI warned that the increase in spending had not yet spread
to all sectors of the high street.
A consumer confidence survey from Gallup also cautioned against excessive
optimism about the recovery, finding that only a fifth of 2,000 respondents
thought the financial position of their household would improve over the
next 12 months.
The latest Gallup survey, conducted on behalf of the European Commission,
suggests that people are very cautious about the strength and durability of
any recovery, with the March Budget making little positive impact on
confidence.
In its monthly distributive trades survey the CBI reported that recent sales
growth has been concentrated mainly in the large chain stores and mail-order
companies, while small chain stores continue to report sluggish sales.
Individual retailers still report trade down on a year ago.
Overall, retailers indicated that sales for the time of year were only a
little below levels they would consider average for the time of year.
The survey shows the outlook for wholesalers is promising. Last month there
was a strong year-on-year increase in sales volumes, compared with February,
when sales declined. Wholesalers were also able to reduce stock levels in
March following the better sales, in spite of an increase in orders placed
with suppliers.
Motor traders reported their fourth consecutive year-on-year rise in monthly
sales in March, with both vehicle sales and sales of parts and accessories
up.
The Gallup survey found that 20 per cent of the people interviewed expect
the financial position of their household to improve over the next 12
months.
This was the same as in March, but lower than in January and February.
Gallup said: 'The so-called feelgood factor is not being widely felt by
consumers.' It added there were signs of improvement in the economy in
general, however.
Three in 10 expect the general economic situation to improve over the next
12 months, only slightly less than those who expect to see it deteriorate.

FT  20 APR 93 / Business hopes rise in north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 23 CHAMBERS of commerce in Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Yorkshire and
Humberside yesterday reported steady economic improvement for the first
quarter.
Yorkshire and Humberside's 13 chambers said trading had improved beyond the
levels of last summer, reflecting 'a slow but genuine increase in activity'.
The 10 chambers in north-west England said domestic order books had improved
for the first time in three years, with the number of manufacturers
reporting increases outnumbering those reporting a continuing decline.
But the Manchester chamber's economic committee urged caution until there
were clearer signs of improved capacity utilisation. It also stressed that
banks had a crucial role to play in providing working capital as recovery
picks up. Banks have already warned that overdrafts will be harder to get
than in the 1980s.
Improvements in the last two quarters apply to domestic sales and orders, as
well as investment in plant, machinery and buildings. Expectations of
improved turnover and profit - the main measures of confidence - are
strongly up.
Exports are faltering in some markets, although Yorkshire and Humberside
manufacturers are reporting strong quarter-on-quarter improvements.
Between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of businesses have been recruiting,
rather than shedding labour. Up to 40 per cent had continuing difficulties
in finding the right people for posts.
The Yorkshire and Humberside chambers surveyed 1,492 businesses. The
north-west survey, co-ordinated by Manchester chamber's economic committee
and Pieda, the economics consultancy, involved 778 businesses.
Mr David Kern, chief economist at National Westminster Bank, sounded a note
of caution yesterday about the economic recovery by forecasting that
unemployment in London and the south-east would rise 13 per cent in the year
ahead, compared with a national increase of 10 per cent.

FT  20 APR 93 / Plan for Welsh local government attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WALES Trades Union Congress yesterday criticised the way the government
is proposing to create 21 unitary authorities for Wales to replace the eight
county councils and 37 district councils.
Mr Derek Gregory, chairman of the Wales TUC's social policy committee, said:
'We have been strong supporters of the creation of a unitary local authority
structure in Wales for some time. Yet the manner in which the present reform
is being conducted gives us some considerable cause for concern.'
The Wales TUC says in its document A New Map for Local Government in Wales?
published yesterday, that the timescale for the unitary authorities, due to
take full responsibility in April 1995, is very tight. It says that the
Welsh Office proposals would put levels and standards of service at risk and
threaten to create more unemployment.

FT  20 APR 93 / Construction output to fall further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION output will fall further this year than had been expected, an
industry forecasting body said yesterday, Andrew Taylor writes.
The National Council of Building Material Producers said it expected output
to fall by 2.5 per cent this year. It had been forecasting a 1.5 per cent
decline.
The group blamed the outlook on a worse-than-expected decline in commercial
property building and the government's delay in giving approval for the
Pounds 1.7bn Jubilee Underground line extension in London.

FT  20 APR 93 / Stevens warns on media excess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD STEVENS, chairman of United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily and
Sunday Express, warned yesterday that the media had over-stepped the mark in
recent years, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The chairman of the group, which includes the Daily Star, said in the
company's annual report that it was not so much the content that was
objectionable but the tone.
He said: 'Clearly public opinion is now telling us that we need to improve
our standards. That we shall seek to continue to do.'
Lord Stevens argued that the Press Complaints Commission had made a good
start in improving standards although much more needed to be done.
He welcomed the fact that the commission had come out against telephone
bugging or tapping and said he hoped a method could be found to control the
use of long-range photography on private property.
Statutory regulation of the press, Lord Stevens added, would be a very blunt
instrument and should be strongly resisted.
There was no doubt, however, 'that the media - and in this should be
included television - have overstepped the mark in recent years', he added.

FT  20 APR 93 / BBC will survey employee opinion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is going to conduct its most detailed investigation of what its
staff think of the corporation, their jobs and their management.
One third of the 24,500 staff, including the World Service and BBC
Enterprises, will be chosen at random and be asked to complete a 28-page
questionnaire.
The 100 questions include more than 20 on BBC managers. Staff will be asked
the extent to which managers accomplish high-quality work, take public
responsibility for mistakes and communicate in an open and direct manner.
The questionnaires will be confidential and will be sent directly to
independent consultants for analysis.
The results of what is expected to become an annual test of staff opinions
will be published.
Mr Alaric Mostyn, head of corporate international communications, said the
results would not change basic corporation strategies such as Producer
Choice - the controversial strategy which gives producers the freedom to buy
services from the external market.
The BBC has also commissioned a large survey of public opinion of the
corporation.

FT  20 APR 93 / Threat of more rail strikes recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of further strike action on British Rail receded last night as
Aslef, the train drivers' union, settled its dispute with BR management and
the main rail union, the RMT, agreed to resume talks today.
The RMT will not call a third 24-hour stoppage this week and has told BR it
wants to take part in 'intensive discussions'. BR, welcoming the move,
confirmed fresh talks would be held today in London.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's personnel director, said: 'I hope that the RMT's
willingness to reopen the dialogue means they will now demonstrate the sort
of flexibility needed to end this damaging and fruitless dispute.'
Aslef said it had reached a 'satisfactory' position with BR over its
national agreement.
Mr Derrick Fullick, Aslef general secretary, said BR had agreed to honour
all national agreements incorporated in individual contracts of employment,
including transfer and redundancy arrangements in the approach to
privatisation.
Mr Watkinson said of the Aslef settlement: 'This is welcome news for our
passengers and freight customers. Settlement was achieved not by last
Friday's strike, which was damaging and pointless, but by the two sides
working out the best solution for both of them in an atmosphere of mutual
goodwill.'
The RMT has been attempting to get assurances from BR that there will be no
compulsory redundancies and no further use of outside contractors. The union
says there has been a softening in management's position over the past few
days.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the union was 'going to test
BR's good faith' in the talks. If management wanted a negotiated settlement
'all the elements are there', he said.

FT  20 APR 93 / Daf vans staff accept pay cut to aid buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS at Leyland Daf's van plant in Birmingham agreed yesterday to accept
a pay cut of up to 8 per cent and longer hours to help a management buy-out
of the threatened plant.
Most of the 1,000 employees, who accepted the deal by a large majority in a
secret ballot, will have their wages cut by 5 per cent - a Pounds 12.50
reduction in the average weekly wage of Pounds 250. But some staff who
received a 3 per cent rise in January, before the company went into
receivership, will lose that increase as well as the 5 per cent cut.
The pay cut will hit everybody at the Birmingham plant from the boardroom to
the shopfloor. Directors stand to lose Pounds 3,000 a year as a result.
Trade union negotiators were reluctant to agree to the deal, which involves
longer working hours, a deterioration in the value of pension benefits and
lower levels of redundancy payment.
Mr John Allen, chief negotiator of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union, said yesterday: 'We only see this as an interim measure to help the
buy-out team. We will be back as soon as the company shows signs of
profitability to seek a restoration of salaries.'
Mr Tony Woodley, chief negotiator for the TGWU general union, said that the
cut in pay was designed to help in the 'successful launch' of the new Daf
operation.
He added that his union was also looking forward to restoring the cut 'as
soon as possible'.
The pay cut is being linked to an element of profit-related pay, although
the details of this were not revealed.
Leyland Daf said yesterday: 'A profit-related element is one way that all
the employees can contribute to the success of the new company. We have to
remain competitive and cut every cost we can. It will be reinvested in the
future of the company.'
Union officials privately see the pay deal as a model for what may be needed
to save the other Leyland Daf plants which are in the hands of the receiver.
These include the truck plant at Leyland in Lancashire, the warehouse
operations in nearby Chorley and the axle plant in Glasgow.
The details of the management buyout at the Birmingham plant are expected to
be announced this Friday. Leyland Daf's receivers have reached a settlement
with Automotive Products, part of the BBA group, allowing a resumption of
the supply by AP of brakes and clutches. A legal dispute had threatened to
halt production at the van and truck plants.
AP had refused to supply components pending settlement of its claim for the
Pounds 758,000 it was owed when Leyland Daf went into administrative
receivership in February.
AP has also reached agreement with the management buy-out teams at both
plants on long-term supply contracts.

FT  20 APR 93 / Press groups launch own news agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESS ASSOCIATION, the UK's national news agency, has suffered the first
serious split in its 125-year history.
Two regional newspaper groups, Westminster Press - part of Pearson, which
also owns the Financial Times - and Northcliffe Newspapers, have decided to
stop taking the PA service for their evening newspapers from May 12.
PA is the domestic news agency, owned by the regional and local press,
providing a service of news, information and pictures to regional and
national papers and broadcasters throughout the UK.
After trials since February with their own agency, UK News, which they
described as a 'runaway success', Westminster Press and Northcliffe have
apparently decided to make it permanent.
The groups intend to remain PA shareholders, however, and their morning
titles, such as the Northern Echo in Darlington and the Western Morning News
in Plymouth, will continue to take the PA service.
The move is embarrassing for Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson managing director, who
was due to be nominated PA chairman at the news agency's annual meeting on
May 13. It is expected that Mr Barlow, who stood down as a PA director
during the UK News experiment, will not let his name go forward for the
chairmanship.
Mr Barlow, who has been encouraging PA to become more commercial, said: 'I
don't think they will want me as a director, let alone chairman.'
The full PA service, including racing results and television listings, can
range from 400,000 to 500,000 words a day. There is also a select service of
40,000 to 50,000 words.
UK News, with a team of 20 journalists based in Leicester, has produced a
service of about 8,000 words a day and has been able to call on the
contributions of the 1,800 journalists who work for both regional groups.
Mr Richard Wooldridge, Westminster press editorial director, said in a
statement both groups needed 'a closely tailored and cost-effective service
for their evening papers'.
PA is, however, planning its own 'mini' service for smaller evening papers
of about 5,000 words a day. Senior PA executives are surprised that
Westminster Press and Northcliffe editors went ahead with UK News before the
launch of the new service.
One PA director said yesterday: 'The annual meeting is certainly going to be
interesting.'

FT  20 APR 93 / Sacking unlikely to end political impasse

THE latest turn of events in Islamabad has a depressing familiarity.
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan is sacking a prime minister and dissolving the
national assembly for the second time in less than three years.
In 1990, he dismissed Ms Benazir Bhutto and promoted the election of Mr
Nawaz Sharif. In 1993, he is dismissing his hand-picked protege and opening
the door to the possible return of Ms Bhutto.
Such cavalier treatment of the country's elected leaders bodes ill for the
future of Pakistan's fragile democracy; it raises concerns about the role of
the country's powerful military establishment, its economic prospects and
its relations with foreign states, especially the US and India.
Pakistan has had 15 rulers since independence: the two who lasted longest
were both military dictators - General Ayub Khan in the 1960s and General
Mohammed Zia al-Haq, who died in an air crash in 1988.
Among President Zia's political legacies was a constitutional amendment
which gave great powers to the presidency. His successor, Mr Ishaq Khan, has
now used these powers twice to striking effect.
On each occasion, the president has claimed that he was acting to defend the
constitution. In fact, this 79-year-old former Finance Ministry official has
also been acting to protect his own political position. Ms Bhutto was sacked
after losing a power struggle with the army, which might have culminated in
a military takeover had the president not intervened. Mr Sharif has been
dismissed after a concerted effort to enlarge his own authority at the
president's expense.
After apparently working well together for two years in which Mr Sharif did
nothing to anger his political mentor, the two men quarrelled over the
appointment of a new army chief, over Mr Sharif's ambition to head the
Pakistan Muslim League, the country's largest political party, and finally
over Mr Sharif's effort to curb the president's constitutional powers.
The president's dismissal of the government and the national assembly is, he
announced, to be followed by national elections in three months' time. But
already in Islamabad yesterday there were doubts whether polls could be held
in July, in the heat of the summer. Mr Zahid Sarfraz, one of Mr Ishaq Khan's
top supporters, said elections might be postponed for 12 months to allow
time for the summer, the monsoon and a long-overdue census.
Whether the polls are three months away or 12, the campaigns are likely to
be bitter. The Pakistan Muslim League, the main component of the coalition
which supported Mr Sharif's government, is split between the former prime
minister's faction and one backing the president.
The main opposition party, Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party, has
swallowed its pride and temporarily allied itself with the president to
secure Mr Sharif's dismissal. But relations among these groupings are fluid,
as are links with other parties, notably Islamic fundamentalist groupings.
Mr Sharif's political survival depends on support in his home province of
Punjab, where he served as chief minister and where his family has extensive
business interests. 'Punjab is the crucial test of Sharif's popularity,'
says one of Mr Sharif's political advisers. If Punjab backs Mr Sharif, as
seems likely, while the other three provinces do not, dangerous
inter-provincial rivalries could erupt.
General Abdul Wahid, the army chief of staff who took over in January, is
avowedly apolitical. But he is also the president's man, appointed against
Mr Sharif's wishes. So, if the president chooses to delay elections to boost
his own popularity at the expense of Mr Sharif, the army is unlikely to
protest. The army's main worry is that the political battles now raging
should not lead to civil disorder.
The prospect of extended political confusion unsettles businessmen. The
Karachi stock exchange's index slid 3 per cent yesterday, its biggest
one-day decline this year. Mr Nasir Bokhari, a leading broker, said: 'The
business community is not panicking but it is very much shaken by the prime
minister's dismissal.'
The shock is particularly acute because Mr Sharif was lionised by
businessmen for being the first industrialist to have led the government.
They welcomed his policies of economic deregulation, privatisation and the
encouragement of foreign investment.
However, as long as the pre-election uncertainty is not too disruptive, the
long-term impact of Mr Sharif's departure may not be as bad as some
businessmen fear.
His policies owed much to economic bureaucrats who will survive the change
in government. The new government, like Mr Sharif's, will also probably have
to pay attention to the country's international donors led by the World
Bank. The general expectation in Pakistan is that economic reform will
continue, though it may slow down.
The crisis will do little to enhance Pakistan's international reputation as
a place in which to invest. But Mr Sartaj Aziz, Mr Sharif's finance
minister, says that companies which have already committed themselves to
Pakistan will press ahead, including Honda Motor, the Japanese car maker
which is building a small assembly plant near Lahore, and Bear Stearns and
Merrill Lynch, the US stockbroking companies which are establishing joint
ventures in Karachi.
Foreign governments will be closely watching the impact of the crisis on
Pakistan's external relations. There is a risk that Pakistani politicians on
the campaign trail may try to court easy popularity by appealing to
nationalist or Islamic fundamentalist sentiments - for example, by
denouncing India or the US, which is considering whether to blacklist
Pakistan as a terrorist state for its support for insurgents in India.
A more probable international effect of the crisis could be that Pakistani
leaders will be distracted from dealing with external affairs. Foreign
visits will be postponed or cancelled. That in itself will be serious enough
because Pakistan has found it hard to redefine its foreign policy since the
end of the Afghan war. Relations with the US, Afghanistan, Iran and above
all India need attention.

FT  20 APR 93 / Pakistan calls off talks with donors
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN last night called off a planned annual meeting with international
aid donors as the country's political crisis prompted a review of economic
policy-making.
The caretaker government appointed on Sunday to replace the dismissed
administration of Mr Nawaz Sharif postponed the talks just hours before a
delegation was due to leave for Paris to meet representatives of donor
organisations, including the World Bank.
Mr Sharif's two-year-old government was sacked by President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan, who also dissolved the national assembly and promised elections within
three months.
The government said the talks were being postponed 'in view of the political
change'.
It said: 'The compulsion of the economic problems that have been inherited
by the caretaker government calls for a full assessment of the present
economic situation and the formulation of an appropriate response to restore
financial balance. This is expected to create a more conducive environment
with the aid-donor community.'
Mr Ishaq Khan has accused Mr Sharif's government of economic mismanagement,
as well as corruption, over-spending and mishandling an extensive
privatisation programme.
But it is not clear what changes, if any, the caretaker government will
make. In the past, frequent changes of government prevented Pakistan from
trying to maintain some continuity in economic policy. The economy in the
year to June is expected to grow by just over 5 per cent in line with
previous years' perfor-mance.
Mr Sharif's government has allowed the budget deficit to grow above its
target of 5 per cent of national output and it is likely to be about 7 per
cent this year.
Mr Sartaj Aziz, Mr Sharif's finance minister, told the FT yesterday that he
expected continuity in policy-making. 'I'm sure the new (caretaker)
government will carry on talking to donors and trying to attract foreign
investors,' he said.
Mr Sharif's dismissal came the day after a televised speech in which he
accused the president of conspiring to overthrow him.
Mr Ishaq Khan's move was the climax to an increasingly acrimonious struggle
between the two men about the appointment of a new army chief, over Mr
Sharif's attempts to secure the leadership of the Pakistan Moslem League,
Pakistan's largest party, and over Mr Sharif's attempt to curb the
president's powers.
Party leaders yesterday started preparing campaigns for elections. Mr
Sharif, who hails from Punjab province, announced he would travel by train
from Islamabad to Lahore, the Punjab capital, stopping along the way to
campaign. The degree of support the dismissed prime minister can command in
his home province is seen as crucial to his political future.
Meanwhile, supporters of Ms Benazir Bhutto, leader of the opposition
Pakistan People's party, said they were delighted at the opportunity to
fight Mr Sharif at the polls.

FT  20 APR 93 / Bank of Japan set to intervene over yen's rapid rise:
Currency's appreciation against the dollar is threatening to choke off the
country's export growth

THE BANK of Japan was this morning standing ready to intervene in foreign
exchange markets in an attempt to arrest the yen's rapid rise against the US
dollar which threatens to choke off Japanese export growth.
It is thought the BoJ is preparing to defend a rate of Y110 to the dollar.
The BoJ intervened twice yesterday but it is thought extremely unlikely
there will be co-ordinated intervention with other central banks to slow the
yen's rise.
The dollar closed down Y1.95 at Y111 in Tokyo trading after President Bill
Clinton's remarks in Washington over the weekend that a stronger yen would
help to cut Japan's trade surplus with the US.
Mr Clinton's remarks, which came after similar comments several weeks ago
from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, confirmed Japanese officials'
suspicions that Washington's policy on the yen has shifted sharply within
the new Democrat administration.
Senior finance officials say their understanding was that the US had been
happy with a rate of about Y120 to the dollar. Mr Bentsen's support for a
stronger yen were regarded by some officials as off-the-cuff remarks and not
necessarily a guide to US policy.
However, Mr Clinton's comments after his weekend talks with Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, seem to confirm the US administration's
determination to talk up the yen. The US approach is seen as a central
ingredient of a much more assertive approach to macro-economic and trade
relations with Japan.
The yen's rise has provoked a mixed response among Japanese politicians.
Mr Miyazawa and Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a leading policymaker in the ruling
Liberal Democratic party, both supported the BoJ's move. Other senior LDP
leaders, including Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, stressed that the
US and Japan were in agreement that sharp fluctuations in the yen's value
were undesirable.
Mr Hayashi said he was perplexed by the yen's rise, which helped to
undermine the recent rally in the Tokyo stock market, with the Nikkei index
closing 185.52 lower at 20,112.34. The fragility of the Japanese economy was
yesterday underlined by a 0.3 per cent contraction in the money supply last
month compared with March last year.
The decline marked a reverse from the modest expansion of the money supply
in February, which indicated the end of a five-month contraction starting
last September.
The BoJ also revised down the February rise in the money supply to 0.1 per
cent from its initial estimate of 0.2 per cent.
The central bank believes the fall in the money supply has probably reached
its bottom but that it will not resume growing until the economy recovers.
The BoJ expects money supply growth will only resume once corporate demand
for bank borrowing increases, which is likely only when industrial
production rises.
The contraction was partly due to the surge in the yen's value against the
dollar which has reduced the yen value of foreign currency deposits, the BoJ
said.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PALESTINIANS indicated yesterday that they were close to a decision on
resuming Middle East peace talks in Washington. Mr Faisal al-Husseini, who
is likely to head the Palestinian delegation, said in Cairo that he expected
to receive shortly a further statement from the US and Israel which would
permit the talks to go ahead, probably on April 27.
The Palestinian delegation had earlier refused to accept the US invitation
to return to the negotiating table today, because the response to its
demands had been 'ambiguous'. Mr Husseini said that some of its requests had
been answered clearly, 'but others were answered in an ambiguous way and on
others it was not clear if they were real answers or were just an attempt to
calm us down'.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said on Sunday that the
other three Arab delegations would not attend negotiations with Israel until
Palestinian objections had been resolved.
The issues centre on Israel's unwillingness to accelerate the return of
nearly 400 Palestinians expelled to south Lebanon in mid-December, and
restrictions placed on workers crossing into Israel from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza.
Saudi Arabia yesterday also sought to encourage a positive Palestinian
decision by offering to resume the financial support to the Palestine
Liberation Organisation which was cut off during the Gulf war.

MR JIM Bolger, New Zealand prime minister, yesterday played down a landslide
win by Mr Winston Peters, a dissident in the ruling National party, in a
weekend parliamentary by-election despite claims that Mr Peters may be about
to launch a new centre-right party ahead of a general election due in
November.
Political commentators say if Mr Peters chose he could put together an
opposition grouping that could split conservative support and thus open the
way to a Labour party victory.
Mr Peters rejected suggestions he would form a new party. He won the
by-election by a record 11,000 votes, confirming his position as the
country's most popular politician, with a rating of around 22 per cent,
compared with 7 per cent for Mr Bolger.
Mr Peters, who is a Maori, was fired by Mr Bolger as minister of Maori
affairs for 'disloyalty' last year after he constantly accused the
government of not honouring its election promises. Mr Peters also angered Mr
Bolger by continuing to claim in parliament that there were irregularities
in Bank of New Zealand's finances following its near-collapse in 1988.
Mr Peters was pressured by government members who forced him to resign from
the ruling National Party's parliamentary caucus. This led him to quit his
seat and stand for re-election as an independent. Two smaller opposition
parties, the Liberals and the Alliance, made overtures to him.

FT  20 APR 93 / ANC struggles to control its radicals: Leadership's problems
are legion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN AN obscure leader of the black supremacist Pan-Africanist Congress in
South Africa gets more applause at a rally than Mr Nelson Mandela himself -
as happened last week in Soweto - the African National Congress knows it has
something to worry about.
The murder of Mr Chris Hani, whose funeral yesterday ranked as one of the
most important political events in South African history, has seriously
threatened the always fragile unity of the ANC.
It has jeopardised the ascendency of moderate ANC leaders who have brought
South Africa to the brink of agreement with the government on a
post-apartheid constitution and forced them to adopt militant rhetoric and
tactics to please angry supporters. It has also jeopardised relations with
the ruling National party, destined to be the ANC's coalition partner in any
multi-party interim government.
Inevitably, moderate leaders such as Mr Mandela, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa,
secretary general, and much of the top ANC leadership, have grown away from
their mass base as they have moved towards power-sharing with whites. (The
maverick Mrs Winnie Mandela says they show indecent haste to sleep between
'the silken sheets of power.' She has been encouraging ANC crowds to 'kill
the Boers, kill the farmers.')
Links between the moderate leaders and the radical youth, the unemployed,
with the huge underclass, are tenuous at best. Mr Hani's death raises the
risk that the ANC leadership will lose control of that radical constituency,
either to the black power-inspired PAC, or to chaos itself. The PAC so far
has negligible support, despite the symbolic applause at the Soweto rally;
but chaos decidedly beckons.
'Chris Hani was the umbilical cord between the African National Congress and
the masses,' says Mr Peter Mokaba, leader of the ANC youth league. As
general secretary of the South African Communist Party, which operates as a
sort of 'Militant Tendency' within the ANC, Mr Hani provided a radical home
for the 'young lions' of the townships while ensuring their electoral
support for the ANC.
His death has thrown up two potential successors, men with the radical
credentials - and some of the charm and intelligence - to recreate that
vital link. They are Mr Sam Shilowa, deputy general secretary of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, the over one-million-strong
ANC-allied union federation, and Mr Tokyo Sexwale, another former guerrilla
commander who is leader of the ANC in the crucial industrial heartland
around Johannesburg and Pretoria.
Neither yet has the stature of Mr Hani, though both have skilfully handled
the huge crowds which have turned out to mourn the slain leader. So the main
task of defusing the radical threat has inevitably fallen to the ANC
leadership - at a time when, after three years of superficially fruitless
negotiations with the government, their street credibility is at an all-time
low.
'Mandela released three years ago; South Africa still not free.' This
complaint, from a placard carried by demonstrators at Saturday's 30,000-
strong march through Johannesburg, has become increasingly common as
negotiations seem to bog down in ever greater detail.
'The people think that all negotiations have achieved so far is to get Chris
Hani killed,' says one moderate ANC leader, stressing that the ANC can no
longer afford to ignore popular discontent. 'We want the people to be angry.
If they were not, we would know they had given us up,' says Mr Sexwale. 'Now
we have to see how we are going to channel this anger properly.'
That seems to be the strategy behind the ANC's call for a six-week programme
of mass protest action to follow yesterday's funeral. Mass action is meant
to defuse that anger - damming it up, says Mr Joe Slovo, leading ANC
negotiator, would be 'the shortest route to an explosion' - while applying
pressure to speed negotiations.
The risk is that a sustained campaign of mass action would tip the delicate
balance within the ANC away from 'realists' such as Mr Ramaphosa and Mr
Slovo towards the romantic revolutionaries, ideological purists and
firebrand socialists who make up the radical camp.
This would reverse the balance of power which has prevailed for the past
seven months, since the radical-inspired ANC march on the Ciskei capital
Bisho, in which more than two dozen died. Moderate ANC leaders, led by Mr
Ramaphosa, took control after the blood-letting at Bisho, and were not
seriously challenged until Mr Hani's death.
In those seven months, they managed to force through the most momentous
policy shift in ANC history when they endorsed multi-racial power-sharing
until the end of the century, a decision which broke the logjam in
constitutional talks with the ruling National party and will form the basis
of an eventual deal.
Mr Mandela cleverly put down a revolt over this issue, allowing the radicals
to hang themselves with their own rope after they were unable to propose any
pragmatic alternative to power-sharing.
The test he now faces is far greater: to lead his angry people to a
level-headed constitutional deal, rather than letting their rage tip South
Africa into chaos and race war.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE two-month-old government of South Korean President Kim Young-sam said
yesterday that it planned to introduce extensive economic reforms during its
five-year administration.
The guidelines released by the economic planning board established goals for
economic deregulation. A detailed blueprint on their implementation will be
announced at the end of June. Some of the measures announced yesterday had
been promised by earlier administrations, but were delayed for political
reasons.
Although the new programme is impressive in its scope, some seasoned
analysts in Seoul expressed reservations that, based on past experience, it
would reach fruition.
The measures include financial liberalisation to ease state controls on the
banking sector and cut the government's role in credit allocation.
The nation's 23 commercial banks will be encouraged to merge and will be
allowed to expand into other financial sectors. Almost all interest rates
will be deregulated by 1996.
Credit controls on the nation's big industrial conglomerates, or chaebol,
will be abolished but they will be replaced by tougher anti-trust laws to
force them to concentrate on a few core businesses instead of operating a
wide range of diversified activities.
Institutional investors will be encouraged to raise their chaebol
shareholdings to cut the influence of family owners that now dominate them.

FT  20 APR 93 / Prices increase sharply in China
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION in China's biggest cities surged in the first quarter, prompting
fears that economic overheating could bring tighter credit curbs and direct
government intervention to slow imports.
China's state statistical bureau reported that prices in the country's 35
biggest cities jumped on average 15.7 per cent in the three months to March
compared with the same period last year.
Shanghai and Guangzhou, where the economic boom has been most marked,
recorded the highest rates: 16.7 per cent and 17.2 per cent respectively.
Prices rose 14.6 per cent in Beijing and 12.3 per cent in Tianjin.
The price surge is certain to strengthen arguments in the leadership of
conservatives who have been urging measures to cool an overheated economy.
Reformists have been resisting these pressures, but may now feel obliged to
take more rigorous action to restrain activity.
China recorded average growth last year of 12.8 per cent. Economic activity
has continued unabated in the first quarter of this year in spite of credit
curbs. These seem certain to be strengthened along with efforts to slow
growth in the money supply.
Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, recently cautioned Beijing
about the dangers of the economy running out of control.
He said China's economy could sustain rates of growth of between 7.5 and 8
per cent without risking the stop-go cycle of the 1980s. Then, the
leadership resorted to draconian credit curbs and import restraint to slow
activity.
'The need to sustain growth within the bounds of what the physical and
institutional structures can handle is paramount in their minds,' said Mr
Preston after meeting top officials.
Chinese officials insist that these latest inflationary pressures are
different from those of the 1980s that threatened the reform programme.
These derive less from rampant borrowing and excessive imports, they say,
than structural changes that have led to sharp increase in basic commodities
such as foodstuffs and fuel.
But western economists say the leadership cannot afford to be sanguine about
a wage-price spiral that may prove difficult to control without resorting to
measures that might threaten the economic reforms themselves. These
officials note that wages have also surged in line with price rises.

PAKISTAN is expected this week to pledge to maintain its existing
international financial commitments in spite of the political crisis caused
by the dismissal of Mr Nawaz Sharif's government and the dissolution of the
national assembly.
Pakistani officials were expected to leave Islamabad last night for Paris
where they are due to meet representatives of aid donors, including the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and developed country governments.
Mr Sartaj Aziz, the former finance minister who was sacked with the rest of
Mr Sharif's government on Sunday, was due to have led the Pakistani
delegation. In his absence, a senior official will head the team. Mr Aziz
told the Financial Times yesterday there would be no change in Pakistan's
attitude to foreign donors or investors.
'There's a certain continuity in our policies,' said Mr Aziz. 'I'm sure the
new (caretaker) government will carry on talking to donors and trying to
attract foreign investors.'
Mr Aziz was speaking after President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dissolved the
national assembly and dismissed Mr Sharif's government, accusing Mr Sharif
of damaging the country and its economy. He also accused Mr Sharif of
corruption and nepotism.
Mr Ishaq Khan was responding to a televised speech Mr Sharif made on
Saturday in which he accused the president of conspiring to overthrow him.
The exchanges followed an increasingly acrimonious struggle between the two
men about the appointment of a new army chief, over Mr Sharif's attempts to
secure the leadership of the Pakistan Moslem League, Pakistan's largest
party, and over Mr Sharif's attempt to curb the president's powers.
Party leaders yesterday started preparing campaigns for elections, which Mr
Ishaq Khan said he would hold within three months. Mr Sharif, who hails from
Punjab province, yesterday announced he would travel by train from Islamabad
to Lahore, the Punjab capital, stopping along the way to campaign. The
degree of support the dismissed prime minister can command in his home
province is seen as crucial to his political future. The Moslem League has
split between his supporters and backers of the president.
Meanwhile, supporters of Ms Benazir Bhutto, leader of the opposition
Pakistan People's party, said they were delighted at the opportunity to
fight Mr Sharif at the polls. One of Ms Bhutto's aides declined to comment
on the party's view of Mr Ishaq Khan - the president who dismissed Mr Sharif
is the same man who sacked Ms Bhutto's government in 1990.

FT  20 APR 93 / Many ADB projects 'failed'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 60 per cent of Asian Development Bank projects scrutinised by bank
staff last year either failed or were only 'partly successful', according to
the ADB's 1992 annual report yesterday.
The ADB said the average success rate for its aid projects had declined over
the last five years, largely because the projects had become more complex
and because more of them were directed at poorer member countries where they
were more likely to fail.
Last year, the ADB approved a total of Dollars 5.12bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in
loans and investments, with the energy sector - power stations and
transmission lines - taking the largest share and accounting for about 29
per cent of the total.
Most of the projects evaluated by ADB officials in the course of 1992 dated
back to the 1980s. Of the 28 projects chosen for evaluation, 11 were
classified as 'generally successful', 12 as 'partly successful' and five as
'unsuccessful'.
However, the definition 'partly successful' is controversial. For example an
engineering education project in the Philippines was defined as 'partly
successful' although, by the ADB's own admission, the facilities provided
remained largely unused, the quality of engineering education had not
improved as expected, and the examination pass rates for graduates of
engineering schools under the project had in fact declined.
Some ADB staff have criticised the prevailing attitude to failed projects,
accusing the bank's managers at headquarters in Manila of simply wanting to
spend more money instead of listening to the ADB's own post-evaluation
office and learning how to spend money more effectively.

FT  20 APR 93 / Clinton pushes jobs package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL Washington moved into high gear yesterday as the Senate reconvened
after the Easter recess to take up President Bill Clinton's long-stalled and
now reduced economic stimulus package.
Mr Clinton stepped up his lobbying campaign with an address to a trade union
convention emphasising the need for short- and long-term job creation. Over
the weekend he had sought to prise loose selected moderate Republicans who
have so far sustained the party's united filibuster against his proposals.
Senator George Mitchell and Senator Robert Dole, the Democratic and
Republican leaders, also planned a private session to see if a compromise
could be ironed out.
In public, however, neither seemed in a mood to give in. Mr Mitchell
described the Republican strategy as one of 'gridlock, filibuster,
obstruction, delay, defeat and embarrass President Clinton'. But he conceded
that the original Dollars 16.3bn (Pounds 10.7bn) package, cut by about
Dollars 4bn by the president last Friday, had no chance of passage.
Mr Dole said he could accept one part of the proposals - Dollars 4bn to
extend unemployment benefits - and might make 'exceptions' for other
elements, including a Dollars 300m national immunisation plan. But he
insisted emergency spending was unnecessary in the current economic climate
unless financed by additional spending reductions.
The affair is proving a test both of Mr Clinton's political muscle and of
the Republican blocking tactics. Partly distracted by other events,
including the summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the continuing
Bosnian crisis and concern about the aftermath of last weekend's Los Angeles
trial verdict, and with Congress in recess, Mr Clinton has not focused as
much on ending the Republican filibuster as he had earlier on getting his
substantive budget-cutting plan through the legislature.
The current impression, which Mr Clinton needs to dispel, is that his
initial victories led him to underestimate opposition to the stimulus
package, which includes some Democrats. Simultaneously, he is being accused
of trying to do too many things at once.
Last week's speculation that the administration was considering a national
value added tax to help finance health care reform, seems not to have helped
Mr Clinton.
For his part, Mr Dole seems conscious of the need to avoid being labelled as
the prime perpetrator of the dreaded political 'gridlock', but is equally
mindful of the importance of giving his own party, a minority in both houses
of Congress and facing a Democratic president for the first time in 12
years, a distinctive mission.
He is accorded much credit for keeping the 43 Senate Republicans in line on
the filibuster, only breakable if 60 members of the 100-strong Senate vote
to end it. He has been encouraged by some measurable recent declines in Mr
Clinton's popularity ratings.
But Mr Dole, a close friend of Mr Mitchell, also has a reputation for
preferring compromise to the confrontational approach typical of his party's
right wing.

FT  20 APR 93 / Menem losing his hold over a once-retiring Congress:
Opposition has forced a pensions compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina has become used to getting his own way.
But his once unassailable political authority, particularly his ascendance
over Congress and the Peronist party, seems to be wavering.
Last week the opposition forced his government to negotiate a compromise
formula on a bill reforming Argentina's pension system.
The bill was introduced to Congress last August. The eight-month delay may
not seem unusual, but the government had become used to a pliant Congress
enacting government legislation at high speed. In 1989 it rapidly granted Mr
Menem virtually dictatorial powers to halt hyperinflation. Two years ago, it
swiftly approved a bill making the currency convertible, paving the way for
economic recovery.
As economic emergency recedes, Congress is less willing to rubber-stamp
legislation. Bills privatising the gas industry and then the national oil
company ran into heavy opposition in Congress.
The proposal by Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, to replace the
collapsing state-run pension system with a semi-private scheme may be no
more daring than other reforms once thought impossible in Argentina, but it
is facing far greater opposition.
Mr Cavallo says pension reform is a crucial part of his broader economic
strategy. Not only would pensions cease to be a financial burden for the
state, but a private pension system would invigorate capital markets, boost
domestic savings, reduce reliance on imported capital and provide long-term
finance for industry.
Under the original plan, employees would compulsorily channel 11 per cent of
their wages into individual retirement savings accounts handled by private
fund managers.
But militant pensioners, opposition politicians and disaffected members of
the ruling Peronist party had obstructed the pension bill ever since its
introduction.
Last week, they finally won a government promise to make contributions to a
private scheme voluntary.
This could radically change the future pension system. It could mean that
only the better-paid would opt for a private scheme, while lower-paid
employees would continue contributing to the state scheme. Thus, the private
system would be more profitable for management companies while the state
would still be left with a heavy financial liability.
Congress had already diluted the bill's original text. One change required
the state to establish minimum investment returns for retirement saving
accounts.
Another requires state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina to guarantee
accounts against failure.
The government is running out of time. Unless Congress approves the bill
before campaigning begins for October's congressional elections, its chances
of becoming law this year will become even more remote.
The government has a majority in the Senate, but lacks a majority in the
lower Chamber of Deputies.
The Peronists' 117 seats make them the largest party in the Chamber, but are
still 12 seats short of a majority. Furthermore, a small but crucial
splinter group has defected to the opposition benches.
Underlying the increasing opposition is a growing awareness of Mr Menem's
need for support in his over-arching ambition to win re-election. A
two-thirds majority is required in Congress just to start this complicated
process, as the constitution at present prevents incumbent presidents from
seeking a second term. Many politicians are exploiting the government's
urgency to demand favours for themselves or increased spending for
cash-hungry local government.
Many politicians oppose the pensions bill because they say it is technically
flawed. Opposition Congressman Alberto Natale says: 'The present system is a
disaster, but the government proposal is no good either.' Mr Natale says the
private system's high operating costs would consume one-third of
contributors' savings. He claims most savings would not be channeled to
private industry, but into government bonds, not a traditionally reliable
investment.
A New York banker added: 'There are a lot (of politicians) who are not happy
at losing Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.94bn) a year in cashflow to the private
sector that they could distribute for their own populist ends.'
Others believe it is wrong to profit from pensions, and want them to remain
as a branch of social policy under government control.
The unions - which remain influential in the Peronist party - are also
opposed to the reform.
There is also a well-founded fear that Argentina's financial community could
bankrupt the system.
However, most observers, be they government officials, bankers or
politicians, agree the pensions bill will eventually become law.
The government has another two highly controversial bills to introduce this
year. One would reform Argentina's notoriously rigid labour market, the
other is Mr Menem's constitutional reform package.
But the pension reform's troubled progress through Congress is proof that
ministers can no longer automatically expect smooth treatment for government
business in the future.

FT  20 APR 93 / Reno discounted the risk of cult's mass suicide: The
questions being asked after the inferno at the Waco religious compound in
Texas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US Attorney General Janet Reno said last night she asked 'question after
question' before giving the go-ahead for the FBI action which ended in the
fiery suicide of religious cult members in Waco, Texas.
'Obviously, if I thought the chance was great of mass suicide, I would never
have approved the plan,' Ms Reno said.
The deaths confronted Ms Reno with a crisis just a month after being sworn
in as the first woman attorney general in the US. The crisis appeared to set
the seal on the expected replacement of the embattled FBI director, Mr
William Sessions.
'I approved the plan and I am responsible for it,' Ms Reno said.
Ms Reno said the FBI plan had been part of a 'coherent and continuing'
effort to bring a peaceful end to the 51-day siege of the cult group's
compound.
The plan was gradually to 'compress the perimeter' of the compound. She had
discussed and questioned the details with various experts over the last
week.
Ms Reno said President Bill Clinton had been 'mindful' of the mass suicide
of a religious group in Guyana in 1978. The emphasis in Washington had been
on achieving a peaceful resolution. Ms Reno said: 'I advised the president
but I did not advise him of the details.' When a reporter asked whether
there was an effort to shield Mr Clinton from any blame, she said: 'I'm
accountable, the buck stops with me.'
However, there will be much second-guessing now by politicians in
Washington. Mr Clinton was told of the plan and approved it, although the
Justice Department had 'operational control'.
There may be questions about whether the FBI's moves to ram holes in the
religious group's bunker and to throw tear gas into the holes were not an
attempt to do more than shrink the perimeter of the compound.
If 'today was not to be the day' for final action - as Ms Reno indicated to
the press - but just an attempt to force the cult members into an ever
smaller area, this appeared hard to reconcile with the broadcasting of
directions over a loudspeaker about how to surrender.
The FBI spokesman, Mr Bob Ricks said: 'Our desire was to get them out of
there in a non-lethal, systematic manner.' He added: 'I have no doubt that
our plan was correct.'
The FBI had acted with bravery, even refusing to return fire coming from the
cult members, he said. One FBI agent even left his vehicle to grab a burning
woman and take her, against her will, to safety.
Although he voiced regrets, anger appeared Mr Ricks' uppermost emotion. The
cult leader, 33-year-old David Koresh, had 'lied' as his last act, telling
the FBI before the inferno that group's children were safe in underground
bunkers. Instead, there were upstairs in the compound.
'We hoped the women would grab their children and flee out,' he said. In
fact, he said, there were reports that the children may have been given
poison or injections to quieten them.
The FBI's tear gas had 'absolutely nothing to do with the suicide,' he said.
It was the cult leader, who gave the order to commit suicide. 'He played the
game,' Mr Ricks said. 'He never intended to come out. He wanted to kill some
FBI people first.'
In Waco, the blaze left the cult compound a smouldering ruin - a grim
testimony to Mr Koresh's claims to be a new Messiah come to warn the world
that its end was near. In the eyes of FBI spokesman Ricks, mass suicide was
what Koresh wanted all along.

VENEZUELA'S ruling Democratic Action (AD) party has chosen a black ex-mayor
as its presidential candidate in national elections scheduled for December
this year.
Mr Claudio Fermin, 43, easily beat three other candidates in Sunday's
primary. Although known as a populist, Mr Fermin has not had time to put
together a comprehensive political programme.
After winning the primary he said he would not change any national policies
producing positive results.
The Social Christian party, second largest after the AD, is due to vote for
a presidential candidate on April 25. Former president Mr Rafael Caldera and
Mr Andres Velasquez, a leftist state governor, are the principal candidates.
Despite inroads by other parties, AD and the Social Christians dominated
state and local elections last December.
AD has won five of the seven presidential elections held since the last
military dictator was ousted in 1958. This year, however, the ruling party
is facing serious challenges as voters grow disenchanted with the
traditional political leaders. Military rebels tried twice last year to
overthrow the government.
AD is viewed as corrupt and inefficient and is blamed for the tough economic
reforms that President Carlos Andres Perez, a founder of the party, began
implementing in 1989.
Mr Fermin is the first black to run for president in Venezuela. He has
degrees in sociology and law and has spent his life working as an official
in the AD.
In 1989 he was elected mayor of west Caracas, Venezuela's largest
municipality.

FT  20 APR 93 / World Trade News: US and UK plan air traffic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the UK set themselves a one-year deadline yesterday to replace
the existing rules that govern air traffic between the two countries.
Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, set what he called 'an
ambitious time-frame' at a meeting in London with Mr John MacGregor, the UK
transport secretary.
Their negotiating teams will reconvene in London on May 5.
Mr MacGregor said the agenda for the talks would include details of how to
deregulate air traffic, foreign ownership of airlines, dealing with
'anti-competitive practices' and the numbers of cities in each country to
which airlines from the other country could fly.
A new regime is likely to be far more liberal than the existing rules, which
date from the late 1970s.
'There will be difficult decisions by both sides,' he said. Resolving US
airlines' demands for better access to Heathrow, the world's busiest
international airport, is likely to be one of those decisions.
Mr MacGregor said an interim agreement might be needed to meet the deadline
and deals on individual items might be struck in less than one year. It
could also pave the way for rule changes in bilateral agreements between the
US and France, Germany and Japan.
Mr Pena said he hoped that the speed with which the UK and US reached an
agreement 'would encourage France and the US to come to the negotiating
table'.
He said it was 'unfortunate' that talks with France on renegotiating the
bilateral accord broke down earlier this month.
France wants tight limits on US carriers' share of the France-US market.

FT  20 APR 93 / World Trade News: US and EC start new trade talks -
Sanctions may follow if Kantor and Brittan fail to reach agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INDUSTRY representatives were anxiously watching for signs yesterday that
Mr Mickey Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, the top trade officials of the US and
EC - who began a two-day meeting in Washington - would make progress in
efforts to eliminate tariffs on a wide range of products.
There has been little news out of preliminary meetings held over the weekend
between Mr Warren Lavorel, the US Gatt co-ordinator, and Mr Hugo Paemen, the
chief EC trade negotiator.
Much could depend on the outcome of the dispute over the EC Utilities
Directive, which, the US argues, makes it difficult for US companies to win
telecommunications and electrical equipment contracts. A settlement could
produce momentum in the multilateral procurement talks in Geneva and in the
Uruguay Round of talks as a whole.
Failure to reach agreement, followed by US sanctions against EC companies,
might dampen the mood, although US officials say they will try to segregate
the issue from the rest of the round.
On the market access package, agreement was reported to be near on
pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and construction equipment. However, the
question of including scientific and agricultural equipment must still be
aired.
The talks on forest products have been in some trouble. The EC has
complained about export restrictions of logs from the US, Malaysia and
Indonesia, making elimination of the restrictions a condition to reduce or
eliminate tariffs.
This was 'a red herring' as far as the US is concerned, said Mr Stephen
Lovett, of the National Forest Products Association. US logs were of 'little
economic significance' to the EC, although Indonesian exports were more of a
problem.
Chemical tariffs are also at issue, with the EC disagreeing about some
exceptions the US wants to take. The Community also could demand more from
American 'donor industries' - those such as textiles, ceramics and glassware
which will be forced to give up tariff protection.
Mr Lovett and Mr William Lane, government affairs representative for
Caterpillar, stressed the necessity of producing 'a major market access
package' containing a 'very strong zero tariff component', to make the
Uruguay Round of talks saleable to Congress.
'Overnight the business attitude would change from ambivalence to
enthusiasm,' Mr Lane said.
Caterpillar and other big US equipment makers face tariffs of 4-10 per cent
in most developed countries and over 15 per cent in developing countries.
'It's difficult to offset the extra burden of import tariffs,' the company
said in its proposal to reduce tariffs to zero on construction equipment,
diesel engines, lift trucks, and industrial gas turbine engines.

ITALTEL, the Italian state-controlled telephone equipment group, and
Ericsson Fatme, the Italian subsidiary of Ericsson of Sweden, have won a
L100bn (Pounds 41.4m) order to supply mobile telephone equipment for the new
second network in Greece.
The concession to operate the Greek system, based on the new GSM standard,
was won by the Italian state-controlled Stet telecommunications group last
August.
Stet is also the main shareholder in Italtel.
Italtel and Ericsson will supply Stet-Hellas, Stet's Greek operation, with a
full turnkey mobile communications package over the next two years. The
contract envisages preliminary coverage of the main areas of demand, notably
Athens and Salonica, in the country within the first year. The network will
be subsequently expanded gradually to cover most of the Greek mainland and
the main islands.
Saipem, the drilling and construction subsidiary of Italy's Eni state energy
and chemicals group, has won a contract worth over L200bn to lay an undersea
gas pipeline in the South China Sea between Hong Kong and the Hainan oil
fields.
The 707km pipeline, commissioned by the US Arco oil group, will supply gas
for electricity generation in Hong Kong.
Saipem said the deal had helped push new orders in the first four months of
this year to L678bn, slightly ahead of the L650bn in the same period last
year.
The company has recovered sharply in the past year from the crisis in the
industry, with turnover of about L2,000bn in 1992, allowing a return to
profits after three consecutive years of losses.

<TEXT>
CHINA, striving to improve its trading rules to bolster its attempt to
rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has finished drafting its
first foreign trade law, Xinhua news agency reported, Agencies report from
Beijing.
Yesterday, the China Daily quoted Ms Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and
economic co-operation, as saying China hoped to increase foreign trade to
Dollars 200bn (Pounds 132.4bn) by 1995 and enter the ranks of the world's
top 10 trading countries. It was the world's 11th largest trader in 1992
with a volume of Dollars 165.6bn, ahead of Taiwan, Singapore, and South
Korea but behind Hong Kong, Xinhua News Agency recently reported.
Xinhua quoted Ms Wu as saying the law was an effort to develop trade based
on international norms.
It will soon be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, the parliament, for deliberation after being approved by the State
Council, or cabinet.
Other laws relating to foreign trade such as anti-dumping and subsidies were
also under consideration.
China is anxious to rejoin Gatt to protect its booming trade, now about 40
per cent of gross national product. But it must first satisfy the US it has
established a market economy that does not distort trade with unfair
subsidies or secret regulations. US negotiators last month dashed Beijing's
hopes of an early return to the world fair trade body by saying China was
refusing to make concessions.
China was a founder member of Gatt in 1948 but quit the following year after
the Communist revolution. It is keen to rejoin before Taiwan, which has a
strong case to support its application.
The minister said China would try to diversify its markets, paying greater
attention to countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States, eastern
Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Xinhua reported.

FT  20 APR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese turn attention to a burgeoning
Asia - A manufacturing powerhouse and growing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Mitsubishi Motors, Aiwa, the audio manufacturer, and YKK, the
world's leading maker of fasteners, have this month all unveiled plans to
expand production in Asia.
Last week, car maker Suzuki followed suit, signing an agreement with the
China North Industries Group to become the first Japanese car maker jointly
to produce passenger cars in China, from 1995.
As Japanese industrialists ponder the prospect of persistent weakness in
their home market, a rising yen and continuing friction with key trading
partners, Asia appears to be the one bright spot in an uncertain future,
representing both a manufacturing powerhouse and a potentially vast market.
The Asian Development Bank last week forecast 7 per cent growth this year in
the Asia-Pacific region, compared with less than 2 per cent in developed
market economies.
The proportion of total Japanese investment that went into Asia rose from 12
per cent in 1989 to 14 per cent in 1991. North America saw its share of
Japanese investment fall from 50 per cent to 45 per cent over the same
period, and Europe held steady at about 22 per cent, according to the Japan
External Trade Organisation.
And while Japanese overseas investment has shrunk 30 per cent in the past
two years, as a result of economic downturn, the fall in Asian investment
has been markedly less, at 15 per cent. In recent months, the rapid rise of
the yen has enhanced the incentives for moving Japanese manufacturing
abroad.
Another reason why Japanese manufacturers are turning their eyes to Asia is
that long-term changes in Japanese society are threatening to deprive them
of a stable source of labour in their own country.
The growing rejection by Japanese youth of manual labour, including skilled
technical work, coupled with the trend towards having fewer children has
made it difficult for manufacturers to find workers in Japan willing to take
on factory work.
While the current recession has masked the trend somewhat, small to
medium-sized subcontractors, the foundation of Japan's manufacturing
success, are founding it difficult to attract workers and there is talk
among Japanese industrialists of a 'parts crisis'.
'In 10 years it will be impossible to produce parts in Japan,' says Mr
Yoshio Sakakibara, director of the Asia-Oceania Division, Overseas Research
Department, at Jetro. 'The only place where Japanese industry can take that
work is Asia.'
A good proportion of Japan's manufactured goods is already coming out of
Asia. For example, 60 per cent of products sold by Sanyo, the electronics
group, in the UK are made either in the EC or in Asean countries, and that
trend will intensify, says Mr Yasuaki Takano, Sanyo's president.
'We can no longer speak of Japan's consumer electronics industry. It is the
world's consumer electronics industry.'
Asia is also attractive to Japanese manufacturers who may feel culturally
closer to the region than other parts of the world, Mr Sakakibara says.
A further factor, which may take on a more important role as cost
considerations weigh heavily on Japanese companies, is that past experience
has shown the profitability of Japanese companies in Asia to be much higher
than in other parts of the world.
Whereas the ratio of revenue to pre-tax profits for manufacturing companies
was 3.2 in Europe and a negative 0.9 in North America, it was 5 in Asia,
according to a study by the Japanese government.
'I think there is a reassessment of the geographic portfolio with Japanese
companies giving more weight to Asia than Europe and the US,' says Dr J
Malcolm Dowling Jr, assistant chief economist at the ADB. As Asia becomes a
global base for certain industries, it is also attracting investment from
subcontractors and manufacturers in related industries.
YKK, for example, says it is increasing production in Asia by 50 per cent
because China has become the world's base for clothing manufacture.
So far Japanese investment in the region has been concentrated in Hong Kong,
Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. But with greater
liberalisation, countries such as China and Vietnam are expected to win a
substantial amount of future Japanese investment.
China has already become the second largest exporter to Japan after the US
and in 1991 Japan overtook the US to become the second biggest investor in
China, on a cumulative basis.
The Asian response to Japanese investment appears so far to be favourable.
But Mr Sakakibara warns that 'environmental pollution could become an
increasing problem'. Japanese industrialists may need to tread carefully as
they build their dreams on Asian soil.

IT'S GOING to be a Yes this time - so said the Copenhagen taxi driver.
But his assertion came with more conviction than is mustered by the

year when voters ignored their advice and refused to approve the Maastricht
treaty on European union in a June referendum.
A new referendum will take place on May 18, and although the opinion polls
so far have shown a comfortable majority in favour of union, there are still
many voters who are undecided. A Gallup poll published over the weekend
showed 47 per cent in favour, 30 per cent against and 23 per cent undecided
or not intending to vote. A poll a week earlier showed 45 per cent for and
29 per cent against.
With four weeks to go to the referendum a Yes vote seems a near certainty.
But politicians and businessmen are careful not to anticipate a result.
Stung after last year's lacklustre campaign for the treaty, the government
is leaving less to chance and is mounting an energetic campaign in the final
stretch.
The vote will be on the Maastricht treaty as modified for Denmark at the
Edinburgh summit. This permits the country to opt out of some of the key
programmes, defence, the third phase of economic and monetary union,
supranational legal co-operation and 'union citizenship'. The
anti-Maastricht forces, dominated by the predominantly left-wing June
Movement, argue that the electorate will be voting on exactly the same
issues as last year and that the Edinburgh agreement makes no difference as
the treaty's text has not changed. 'Maastricht is not the solution, it's the
problem,' says Mr Jens Peter Bonde, Euro MP and one of the June Movement's
leading figures.
But seven of the eight parties in the Folketing which endorsed the Edinburgh
agreement believe the May vote is 'on a new basis' and is 'for something
different'.
Their arguments seem to be winning. Gallup asked voters who have switched
from a No to a Yes vote why they had changed their minds. Some 30 per cent
said it was because of the Edinburgh deal, 23 per cent because they were
better informed, and 15 per cent because they thought a Yes vote would be
good for the economy.
The opinion polls should give considerable comfort to supporters of
Maastricht for two other reasons.
First, the polls are regularly showing substantial support for Maastricht;
last spring they showed the race was neck and neck. However, some polls have
indicated an increase in undecided voters at the expense of the Yes vote.
Second, the polls show a majority for the treaty among supporters of the
country's largest political party, the Social Democrats.
In last year's referendum, when the Social Democratic party was in
opposition, its supporters voted by 60-40 against the treaty.
This spring, perhaps because the Social Democrats returned to government at
the head of a four-party coalition in January, polls indicate majority
backing for the treaty among the party's supporters; in a poll at the end of
March, 47 per cent backed the treaty and 30 per cent opposed it.
A notable difference of this year's campaign is that Prime Minister Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen is being more emphatic in warning voters of the dangers of a
No vote.
Last week he said a second No would be tantamount to telling Europe that
Denmark did not want to remain a member of the Community. In the long run a
No vote would mean Denmark withdrawing from the EC.
However, as Mr Anders Knutsen, chief executive of the television and audio
equipment maker Bang &amp; Olufsen and a prominent supporter of the Yes vote,
noted, the campaign to date has been muted. This is partly because the
voters appear tired of a subject which has dominated the headlines for more
than a year.
But this does not mean the Social Democrats have remained passive, according
to Mr Ove Fich, who is organising the party's Maastricht election campaign.
The emphasis is on small, local meetings - dozens of them every week - which
appear to be more effective than the roar of expensive advertising. The
pro-Maastricht Europe 2000 organisation, a non-party group supported by many
prominent Danes, has adopted the same strategy.
It is, of course, not too late for the voters to surprise the establishment
again. But it seem unlikely - so much so that British bookmakers will no
longer accept bets on a favourable outcome.

FT  20 APR 93 / End looms for Rome's councillors

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to keep alive the city of Rome's administration, already battered
by corruption scandals, suffered a serious setback yesterday. This time it
was the turn of Milan magistrates to take their investigations to the
capital.
Two councillors were advised by Milan magistrates they were under
investigation for alleged corruption over contracts connected with Acea, the
Rome municipally owned electricity entity. Five arrest warrants were also
issued for former members of the Lazio regional council and former members
of the Acea board.
Last night, as a result of these arrests, the Lazio administration resigned.
One of the Rome councillors, Mr Mario Gionfrida, a right-wing independent,
tendered his resignation. At the same time Mr Franco Carraro, the Socialist
mayor of Rome, commented: 'It looks as though the game is up and we will
have to dissolve.'
Among Italy's big four cities affected by corruption scandals, Rome alone
has avoided the collapse of its administration. In recent weeks Mr Carraro
has blocked a move by a reformist group to back a new Green mayor, but has
been struggling vainly to find a consensus for further rule by his
discredited Socialist-Christian Democrat alliance.
The Milan magistrates' investigations follow confessions from politicians
who have collected money on behalf of political parties from companies
supplying Acea and Rome's municipally owned transport company, ATAC. They
are said to have been taking a 5 per cent commission on such contracts.
As a sign of the way Rome's local politicians were accustomed to treat
kickbacks, the Socialist party issued a statement expressing solidarity with
two of their colleagues alleged by the Milan magistrates' investigations to
have collected L35m-L40m (Pounds 15,000) in 1988-90. 'This is an amount
which in Rome serves only to produce two manifestos on a couple of
occasions.'
Rome has been affected by the investigations less than Milan, Turin and
Naples. It is thus significant that the new push in Rome comes from Milan,
raising once again delicate issues of the territorial competence of
investigations. The main Rome investigations are into Anas, the state road
building authority, the misuse of overseas aid funds, and fraud in
subsidiaries of Efim, the state industrial holding now in liquidation.

FINLAND IS over the worst of its economic problems, Mr Esko Aho, the
country's prime minister, said yesterday.
He cited a 24 per cent increase in exports in February and a 4 per cent rise
in industrial production since the beginning of the year as evidence that
recovery had begun. Finland has been in deep recession since 1990, with
gross domestic product falling by 10 per cent last year and the year before.
'We are on the way up,' claimed Mr Aho, who viewed the 5 per cent rise in
the value of the markka since Easter as a clear indication of improving
sentiment.
Finland has benefited from a surge in exports after a 40 per cent currency
depreciation since November 1991. Recovery has also been helped by a halving
of interest rates to from 17 per cent last autumn.
Mr Aho added that 'on the basis of current trends, the balance of payments
should be back in equilibrium next year'. But, on a gloomier note, he
predicted that Finnish unemployment, which currently stands at 18 per cent,
would continue at a high level.

<TEXT>
Italy's industrial production fell 5.1 per cent during February compared
with the same month in 1992, writes Robert Graham.
Figures released yesterday by Istat, the national statistics institute,
showed production fell 7.7 per cent during the first two months of 1993
against the same period last year when there were two extra working days.
The worst affected sectors continued to be engineering and transport,
followed by textiles and clothing. The only area where production did not
decline was foodstuffs. Despite lower production, Confindustria, the
industrialists' association, believes the first modest signs of an
export-led recovery are beginning to appear.

Switzerland's decision not to join the European Economic Area will probably
be less damaging to its economy than originally feared, the Basle Business
Cycle Research Group said yesterday, Reuter reports.
It reported that the economy was likely to contract by around 0.4 per cent
this year, before recovering in 1994 with 1 per cent growth. But it thought
the growth gap with the rest of western Europe would be only 0.6 percentage
point, compared with the 1 per centage point it estimated last October.

The index, which hit an all-time high on Friday, sank 767.23 points or 10.45
per cent to 6,574.14. 'This is the biggest slump in the history of the stock
exchange,' said broker Mr Bulent Yanaray at Pay investment house.
Mr Ozal's death also stimulated dollar buying, forcing the central bank to
intervene several times to halt its surge. Brokers expected stock market
turmoil to continue, albeit less intensely, until nominations for the
presidency are put forward during a 10-day period from next Tuesday.

FT  20 APR 93 / Aid blocked as Croats turn on Moslems
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIERCE fighting between Croat and Moslem-led Bosnian forces in central
Bosnia paralysed key aid routes yesterday, and further undermined the
prospects of the hard-pressed Moslem forces, already reeling from the
virtual loss of Srebrenica in the east.
Relief officials said the fighting had nearly depleted stocks of food in
Tuzla, in north-eastern Bosnia, which is preparing for the arrival of tens
of thousands of starving refugees from Srebrenica.
Diplomats say Croat forces are now trying to establish unchallenged control
over parts of central Bosnia and Hercegovina.
The clashes between the former allies forced British United Nations soldiers
based in Croat-held Vitez, 60 miles northwest of Sarajevo, to seek shelter
from shells exploding near their camp.
Amid conflicting reports which could not be independently confirmed, each
side blamed the other for the outbreak of fighting. Bosnian radio said the
Croatian Defence Council (HVO), the military wing of the self-styled Croat
state of Herceg-Bosna, had fired on surrounding Moslem villages. Croatian
radio said Moslems detonated a car bomb in Vitez that killed many civilians.
UN officials in Vitez say the fighting over the past four days has left some
150-200 people dead and scores wounded.
A car bomb did explode near a mosque in Vitez on Sunday, killing three
civilians and seriously wounding eight people, officials said. Six others
were slightly injured. Many houses in the old part of Vitez were badly
damaged by the blast.
Fighting between Bosnian Croats and Moslems broke out around Vitez and
surrounding villages on Friday.
According to Mr Laurens Jolles, a senior official of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees: 'It can threaten the survival of people in
Zenica. It has become extremely difficult to deliver food because of the
clashes.' Bosnian radio said 13 people had been killed and 30 wounded
yesterday when Bosnian Croat forces launched an artillery attack on Zenica.
Hina, the Croatian news agency, claimed six soldiers had been killed and a
number of civilians hurt in a Moslem attack on Croat-held Kiseljak just
outside Sarajevo.
The renewed fighting shattered a strained alliance patched up in January by
Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the international mediators. Its eruption did
not surprise members of the mainly Moslem Bosnian forces, following as it
did a Croat ultimatum.
The HVO order demanded Moslem soldiers withdraw by April 15 from provinces
designated as 'Croat' under the Vance-Owen plan. That plan divides
Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 provinces roughly along ethnic lines.
Diplomats say Croat forces have taken advantage of international outrage
about the Serb onslaught on eastern Bosnia. They moved last week to cement
their control over parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
While Serb forces have expelled or killed hundreds of thousands of Moslems
in eastern Bosnian, their Croat counterparts have done the same on a smaller
scale further west. Supported by the armies of their neighbouring patron
states, they are pitted against the Moslems in an intention to divide up
Bosnia-Hercegovina.

FT  20 APR 93 / EBRD to tighten budget process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday agreed to
tighten its budgetary procedures after pressure from its directors, who
represent the countries and international agencies that own it.
An EBRD board meeting, attended by all 23 directors, yesterday laid down new
procedures for preparing the 1994 budget.
A director said the most important change was that the budget-making process
would begin in July, several weeks earlier than last year.
In addition, the board's audit committee was directed to examine, within six
weeks, allegations that the bank's Pounds 55.5m budget for fitting out its
new London headquarters was excessive.
The committee's investigation will include examination of the Pounds 1.25m
spent on marble for the building, which includes Pounds 750,000 for
replacing existing marble.
A number of directors were also concerned that the bank's control of
administrative costs had not been tight enough. From April 1991 to the end
of last year the EBRD spent more than Pounds 200m on its running costs and
fitting out its building.
The bank's president, Mr Jacques Attali, will today meet Mr Theo Waigel,
German finance minister and chairman of the EBRD's governors, in Bonn.
An EBRD director said he 'could not imagine' that Mr Waigel would ask Mr
Attali to resign. He added that although Mr Waigel did not want to ignore
German public opinion that the bank's costs should be tightly controlled, he
was anxious to avoid any public blood-letting before the annual meeting
later this week.
Germany's stance on the EBRD is particularly sensitive in view of Mr
Attali's close links with President Francois Mitterrand. Any suggestion that
Bonn was seriously displeased with Mr Attali's stewardship of the bank could
have deep repercussions on the Franco-German relationship.
Mr Waigel and Mr Attali are expected to concentrate on discussing the
general operations of the bank, rather than going into detail on the
allegations of EBRD overspending.

BRITISH and French helicopters of the United Nations forces yesterday flew
more than 350 seriously wounded and sick people from the besieged town of
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. The local Moslem authorities were refusing to
let more civilians be taken out by road although the UN was hopeful of doing
so in a couple of days.
As the second day of air evacuations got under way under a ceasefire plan
agreed by the Bosnian Serb and Moslem commanders, UN peacekeepers in
Srebrenica asked the Bosnian Serb army to allow the Wednesday deadline for
disarming Moslem forces to be extended by 24 hours.
The commander of the Canadian UN battalion deployed in Srebrenica as part of
the ceasefire agreement argued that there was not enough time for the
disarmament orders to be passed down.
However, General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, said he would
stick to the letter of the agreement he had signed with the Moslem
commander. He also denied an assertion by General Philippe Morillon,
commander of UN troops in Bosnia, that the besieging forces would withdraw
as soon as Srebrenica was demilitarised.
'The agreement says that combat operations are frozen at current lines
around Srebrenica,' he said.
Meanwhile, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, suggested that a
high-level meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the Yugoslav
conflict could be convened in Srebrenica. Alternatively, the London
conference which launched the Yugoslav peace process last August could be
reconvened.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton was said to be 'actively considering
more options' to pressure the Bosnian Serbs into accepting the
internationally brokered peace settlement in Bosnia.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday reiterated his call
for a complete economic blockade of Serbia , after cabinet ministers again
rejected early military action.
Following a special cabinet committee meeting, Mr Hurd said continuing Serb
intransigence 'will bring Serbia to economic disaster'. But he did not rule
out air strikes against Serb supply and communication lines or even
supplying arms to the Bosnian Moslems.
He had a smooth reception from Conservative MPs in the Commons, some of whom
had previously expressed impatience with what they considered Britain's too
timid stance.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday criticised the United Nations Security Council for showing
undue haste in tightening sanctions against Serbia at the weekend. It also
warned that western military intervention against the Serbs might risk
provoking an all-out Balkan war, with grave consequences in Russia and
elsewhere in Europe.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, deputy foreign minister and President Boris Yeltsin's
special envoy, told a news conference in Moscow that the Security Council's
decision on Saturday to bar all commerce with the rump Yugoslavia from April
26 had reduced the chances of achieving a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian
conflict.
'We are concerned at certain military thinking and some diplomatic talk
about strikes and blows in Bosnia,' he said in an oblique reference to
proposals mooted in the US and by Lord Owen, the European Community
mediator, that UN forces should step up the pressure on the Serbs by bombing
their supply lines.
'The international community should decide: does it want a war in the
Balkans or an international settlement?' he asked.
But Mr Churkin combined his warnings against further punitive action by the
UN with a fresh appeal to the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace
plan without delay, and with an 'absolute minimum' of proposed changes.
While he admitted that they had some legitimate concerns about the proposed
map of Bosnia-Hercegovina, under which the country would be divided into 10
largely autonomous cantons, they could not expect to restart the
negotiations from scratch. 'In the next few days you must reach a settlement
or you will suffer a defeat that will be a tragedy for the Serbian people,'
he said.
The Russian government abstained in Saturday's vote, as did China. It had
been hoping that a vote on the new sanctions resolution could be delayed
until next week for fear of undermining President Boris Yeltsin's position
in the April 25 constitutional referendum.
In explaining the position, Mr Churkin trod what has come to be a
customarily delicate line for Mr Yeltsin's government between appeasing
conservative critics at home, who urge all-out Russian support for the
Serbs, and seeking to calm fears in the west that Russia is on the verge of
breaking ranks on the Yugoslav conflict.
Asked by a hostile Serb questioner at yesterday's news conference why Russia
had not vetoed the Security Council resolution, Mr Churkin replied bluntly:
'Russia has its own foreign policy priorities. It will not enter a
confrontation with the international community just because agreement cannot
be reached on a map of Bosnia-Hercegovina.'
Foreign policy analysts in Moscow agree that western concerns about Russia's
attitude to Bosnia are probably overdone.
'Almost nobody's interested in Serbia here, but the opposition is playing it
up to make things difficult for the administration, and the administration
has to bow to that,' said Mr Sergei Karaganov, deputy director of the
Institute of Europe and a presidential adviser on foreign affairs.

THE European Commission called yesterday for a 2 percentage point cut in

Mr Henning Christophersen, European Commission vice-president, told EC

increase by 0.7 per cent.
Germany had earlier successfully blocked inclusion of Commission growth
predictions in an 88-page report on the EC's new 'growth package' published
yesterday. The package is an action plan by member states to use supply-side
measures to stimulate economies.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said interest rates in Germany were
coming down gradually. 'If everybody (in the EC) had similar policies,
everybody would have similar interest rates.'
The polite criticism of German policy was echoed by Mr Norman Lamont, UK
chancellor of the exchequer, who said interest rates were too high to be
compatible with a recovery. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the new French finance
minister, said lower rates were the sina qua non for growth in Europe.
The growth package unveiled yesterday is the culmination of a six-month
Commission campaign for member states to shift from current to capital
spending, pursue wage restraint and take advantage of modest Community
powers to lend to small and medium-sized businesses.
Mr Christophersen valued the package at Ecu35bn (Pounds 27.89bn) - a mixture
of national measures, extra private investment generated by lending by the
European Investment Bank and a new European Investment Fund. An estimated
450,000 new jobs were likely to be created in 1993 and 1994, while growth
was likely to be 0.6 points higher next year than the present forecast of
1.75 per cent.
However, doubts remain about the package's value.
Mr Christophersen was unable to give a precise breakdown between member
states' contributions and Community-led efforts. He also left open the
possibility of revising downwards the Commission's forecast of 0.75 per cent
growth in the EC this year.
But ministers stressed the package shows member states are able to act
collectively - a point underscored by the presence of finance ministers from
the European Free Trade Area at yesterday's meeting.
The Commission also hopes the package will persuade the US and Japan to
stimulate their economies at July's G7 meeting in Tokyo.

CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday warned that military
intervention in former Yugoslavia would not bring an end to the war and
could lead instead to further bloodshed.
'A full military involvement, as some are calling for. . . will not bring a
solution to the conflict in former Yugoslavia which has historical roots,'
Mr Kohl said.
'In light of the chaotic situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina, one can fear a
higher death toll for both the civil population and the international
military forces there,' he added.
Mr Kohl said he fully supported the resolution of the UN Security Council to
apply tougher sanctions against Serbia. He also favoured suspending Serbia's
membership of international organisations.
The chancellor reiterated that, for historical reasons, German soldiers
would not participate in military activities in former Yugoslavia.
'The presence of German forces would serve the Serbian war propaganda and
would worsen the situation and the international peace efforts,' he said. A
Nazi-backed regime was set up in Croatia during the second world war.
Germany is prevented by its constitution from sending soldiers to
territories outside the Nato area, although Mr Kohl and his party, the
Christian Democratic Union, want greater German participation in UN
peacekeeping operations.
At the weekend, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, also warned that air
bombardments would lead to an escalation of violence. 'The risks could be
incalculable. The situation and the security of Unprofor (UN protection
force) soldiers must above all be looked after,' he said. Mr Kinkel also
called for the withdrawal of all diplomats from Belgrade.

Bosnian Serbs to accept peace plan
</HEADLINE>

RUSSIA yesterday criticised the United Nations Security Council for showing
undue haste in tightening sanctions against Serbia at the weekend. It also
warned that western military intervention against the Serbs might risk
provoking an all-out Balkan war, with grave consequences in Russia and
elsewhere in Europe.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, deputy foreign minister and President Boris Yeltsin's
special envoy, told a news conference in Moscow that the Security Council's
decision on Saturday to bar all commerce with the rump Yugoslavia from April
26 had reduced the chances of achieving a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian
conflict.
'We are concerned at certain military thinking and some diplomatic talk
about strikes and blows in Bosnia,' he said in an oblique reference to
proposals mooted in the US and by Lord Owen, the European Community
mediator, that UN forces should step up the pressure on the Serbs by bombing
their supply lines.
'The international community should decide: does it want a war in the
Balkans or an international settlement?' he asked.
Later Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, said a meeting of Security
Council foreign ministers to discuss the sanctions issue could be held in
either Sarajevo or besieged Srebrenica. He also voiced unease at the UN vote
to tighten sanctions against Serb-led Yugoslavia.
Mr Churkin combined his warnings against further punitive action by the UN
with a fresh appeal to the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan
without delay, and with an 'absolute minimum' of proposed changes.
While he admitted that they had some legitimate concerns about the proposed
map of Bosnia-Hercegovina, under which the country would be divided into 10
largely autonomous cantons, they could not expect to restart the
negotiations from scratch. 'In the next few days you must reach a settlement
or you will suffer a defeat that will be a tragedy for the Serbian people,'
he said.
The Russian government abstained in Saturday's vote, as did China. It had
been hoping that a vote on the new sanctions resolution could be delayed
until next week for fear of undermining President Boris Yeltsin's position
in the April 25 constitutional referendum.
In explaining the position, Mr Churkin trod what has come to be a
customarily delicate line for Mr Yeltsin's government between appeasing
conservative critics at home, who urge all-out Russian support for the
Serbs, and seeking to calm fears in the west that Russia is on the verge of
breaking ranks on the Yugoslav conflict.
Asked by a hostile Serb questioner at yesterday's news conference why Russia
had not vetoed the Security Council resolution, Mr Churkin replied bluntly:
'Russia has its own foreign policy priorities. It will not enter a
confrontation with the international community just because agreement cannot
be reached on a map of Bosnia-Hercegovina.'
Foreign policy analysts in Moscow agree that western concerns about Russia's
attitude to Bosnia are probably overdone. 'Almost nobody's interested in
Serbia here, but the opposition is playing it up to make things difficult
for the administration, and the administration has to bow to that,' said Mr
Sergei Karaganov, deputy director of the Institute of Europe and a
presidential adviser on foreign affairs.

FT  20 APR 93 / IG Metall moves closer to strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EASTERN Germany's steel and electrical sectors yesterday moved closer to an
all-out strike after IG Metall, the country's powerful engineering union,
decided to hold ballots in support of higher pay claims.
The ballots, to be held between April 26 and 28, will take place throughout
the region's steel industry. However, ballots for the metal and electrical
sector will be restricted to the northern state of Mecklenberg-Western
Pomerania, which specialises in shipbuilding, and the eastern state of
Saxony, the core of eastern Germany's heavy industry.
'These ballots are a first step,' said Ms Dagmar Opoczynski, a spokesperson
for IG Metall. She added: 'We will have to see if we obtain 75 per cent of
the vote of all IG Metall members in these factories. If we do, we could
hold strikes on May 3.' IG Metall's membership in eastern Germany has fallen
sharply to 400,000 from 760,000 in 1991.
Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of Gesamtmetall, the national
electrical and metal employers' association, claimed IG Metall was
committing 'economic suicide' by balloting for an all-out strike in eastern
Germany.
The threatened strike is intended to put pressure on the employers to
rescind their decision to end a contract aimed at equalising eastern and
western wages by April 1994. Wages in eastern Germany's metal, electrical
and steel industry are about 70 per cent of western German levels, but
productivity in the eastern states is only 30 per cent of that in the west.
Under the March 1991 contract, wages in the steel sector were due to rise by
21 per cent, beginning April 1, and for the electrical and metal sectors by
26 per cent. This would have brought eastern German wages up to between 80
and 82 per cent of western German levels respectively.
But Gesamtmetall and Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, its steel counterpart, last
month legally invoked a special 'revision clause' in the contract, signed by
the employers, IG Metall, and eastern German factory managers.
That enabled either side in the agreement to challenge the contract because
of changed economic expectations. The employers have since recommended wage
increases of 9 per cent, in line with the rate of inflation in eastern
Germany.
But IG Metall, desperate to boost its support in eastern Germany, say
workers there have the right to income parity next year as they are already
paying western German prices for most goods.
Union officials also believe that the employers want to use the economic
climate in eastern Germany as a means to break the collective bargaining
system in the region and later in western Germany.
Gesamtmetall yesterday again denied any hidden agenda. 'The collective
bargaining system in the west will not be changed,' the association's
president said.
Economists have also warned that eastern German industry has little chance
of becoming competitive if it fails to widen the gap between output per head
and labour costs.
Union officials, however, are increasingly aware of the economic
consequences of such a strike. 'We do not want to harm the Mittelstand, or
small and medium-sized private enterprises,' said Mr Michael Bohm, IG
Metall's spokesman in Berlin. 'But we must fight for the basic wage in the
east,' he said.

President Boris Yeltsin, campaigning for popular support in a referendum
next weekend, won the backing of some of Russia's most powerful trade unions
yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
'The free trade unions call on all their members and other Russian citizens.
. . to confirm their political trust in the president and to vote for early
parliamentary elections,' the Itar-Tass news agency quoted a union appeal as
saying.
Next Sunday's referendum will ask the people if they support Mr Yeltsin and
his reform policies and whether they favour early presidential and
parliamentary elections.
Mr Yeltsin yesterday met representatives of about 30 unions in the Kremlin.
They included miners from western Siberia's Kuzbass field, traditional
supporters of the president, as well as dockers and civil aviation workers.

PRESIDENT Turgut Ozal's death at the weekend sent shares tumbling on the
Istanbul stock exchange yesterday and spurred dollar buying on fears of a
political crisis, Reuter reports from Istanbul.
The index, which hit an all-time high on Friday, sank 767.23 points or 10.45
per cent to 6,574.14. 'This is the biggest slump in the history of the stock
exchange,' said broker Mr Bulent Yanaray at Pay investment house.
Mr Ozal's death also stimulated dollar buying, forcing the central bank to
intervene several times to halt its surge. Brokers expected stock market
turmoil to continue, albeit less intensely, until nominations for the
presidency are put forward during a 10-day period from next Tuesday.
Parliament will then have until May 27 to choose a new president in up to
four rounds of voting.
Turkish newspapers yesterday named Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister,
Mr Minister Erdal Inonu, his deputy, and Mr Husamettin Cindoruk, the
parliamentary speaker, as possible candidates. See World Stock Markets

FT  20 APR 93 / EIB agrees Pounds 98m funding for Jubilee Line extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, RICHARD TOMKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Investment Bank yesterday agreed to provide Pounds 98m of the
private sector's Pounds 160m contribution towards the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee
Line underground extension.
Bankers said this meant that the most important hurdle in providing the
Pounds 160m contribution to the Jubilee's costs had been cleared. The
government had been insisting on Pounds 400m from the private sector but
this is spread over 30 years, so is worth little more than Pounds 160m at
today's value. The EIB is owned by European Community member states.
Last night Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said: 'Today's decision
marks a significant milestone. The next will be for the private sector to
conclude with London Transport a satisfactory funding agreement covering the
basis of their contribution to the Jubilee Line extension.'
The EIB said its decision completed the financing arrangements necessary for
Canary Wharf and meant the government could begin construction of the
Jubilee Line extension.
London Underground, which will build the line, welcomed the EIB's decision
to approve the payment, but remained cautious over an early start on
construction of the Pounds 1.8bn extension to Docklands. It said other
hurdles, including government approval, needed to be cleared before the
go-ahead could be given.
The banks also have to reach agreement with London Underground on the
construction contract, including setting a deadline for completion of the
project.
If these obstacles are overcome, work on the line could start almost
immediately, London Underground said.
Last night the Labour MP Mr Rhodri Morgan said: 'It is the good old public
sector that has come to the rescue of a crashed private sector project, and
no amount of flannel can hide that.
'It is not possible to argue that the private sector is providing the
commitment that Norman Lamont promised to the House of Commons that he would
insist on when he gave the go-ahead to the project in the Autumn Statement.'
Negotiations between bank lenders to Canary Wharf and the government on the
private sector contribution for the Jubilee line extension have been going
on for almost a year, following the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian
company which built Canary Wharf, the East London property development.
The banks hope the building project will soon be able to come out of
administration, a form of insolvency protection.
Construction of the line is expected to employ 12,000 people through the
lifetime of the project. If approval comes soon, the line could open in
1997.
The EIB loan was agreed as part of its remit to speed the financing of large
infrastructure projects to encourage European economic growth.

FT  20 APR 93 / Italians vote decisively to change polling system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN VOTERS yesterday responded to the country's deepening political
corruption scandal by voting overwhelmingly for a change to the way they
elect their politicians.
Preliminary projections of the eventual referendum result gave 82 per cent
in favour of replacing a system of proportional representation with a system
of majority voting for the senate. This was much higher than predicted by
opinion polls and by Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement.
In effect, it has ended the system of proportional representation that has
produced 51 unstable post-war coalition govern-ments.
There was a high turn-out of 76 per cent for the latest referendum which was
Italy's ninth since the second world war and included eight separate issues.
The most important was introducing a first-past-the-post system for 238 of
the 315 senate seats, the remaining 77 still being covered by proportional
representation.
The referendum result underlined the demand by an impatient electorate for
rapid political change and electoral reform. A separate question on ending
public funding of political parties was expected to be endorsed by more than
90 per cent of voters. Illicit funding of political parties has been the
main element in the corruption scandals.
'This is a victory for all Italians,' said an exultant Mr Segni, who has
emerged as a key figure ahead of a difficult period which must see agreement
on a new government and the precise nature of electoral reforms.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, met President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro just before polling closed yesterday afternoon. He said holding the
referendum had ended the main duty of his four-party coalition, formed last
year and including Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and
Liberals.
Parliament and party leaders must decide between two options. Either they
back Mr Amato to head a new government or they accept that only a new
figure, untainted by the scandals, can have the moral authority to carry out
electoral reform.
The next government's main task will be to produce new electoral laws on
which the country can go to the polls.
Yesterday Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Lombard League, called
for such laws to be introduced in the next three months. But many
politicians predict it would be difficult to agree in time for an autumn
poll.
The most controversial item - depenalising drugs for personal use - received
by far the lowest vote in favour, of only 54 per cent.
The Christian Democrats campaigned hard to prevent the abolition of the
ministry of agriculture, a key source of their patronage. But only 28 per
cent voted against the proposal. The ministry's functions will be
transferred to the regions.
Abolition of the ministry of state shareholdings, another referendum issue,
has in effect already occurred. The other two matters approved were the
removal of environmental issues from the control of local health authorities
and an end to political control over appointments to the savings bank
boards.

EIGHT-SIX people were feared to have died in an apparent mass suicide
yesterday when the 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian religious cult near
Waco, Texas, ended in an inferno, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
The compound housing an estimated 95 followers of religious zealot Mr David
Koresh was destroyed after three fires were started by members of the cult,
possibly with kerosene, according to the FBI. The blaze followed an attempt
by the federal agency to end the stand-off.
The FBI said it believed Mr Koresh ordered a mass suicide and that there had
been 'massive loss of life'. Mr Koresh and all but nine of his followers
were presumed dead.
Seventeen children under 10 years old were believed to be in the compound
when the blaze (pictured above) began. The FBI said that among the nine
survivors were an Australian and two of the 26 Britons believed by the
Foreign Office to have been in the compound.
One survivor was quoted as saying that, after the fires were lit, Mr Koresh
advised his followers to 'relax' because they would soon be seeing 'the face
of God'.
Attorney-general Janet Reno, who took responsibility for the FBI action,
last night said the plan to move against the compound had appeared the best
way to end the stand-off without bloodshed. She absolved President Clinton
of blame, saying he knew only generally of the plan, and added that the FBI
had 'acted professionally and with remarkable restraint'.
The blaze spread swiftly, punctuated by explosions - possibly from the
cult's ammunition stores. It started several hours after the FBI rammed the
compound with tanks and fired tear-gas in an attempt to end the siege. By
the time firemen arrived little was left of the cult's large compound.
The incident appeared to echo the 1978 Jonestown massacre, where more than
800 people died in a mass suicide at a cult centre in the jungles of Guyana.
Only last week Mr Koresh warned FBI agents that they would be 'devoured' by
fire if they tried to harm him. He disappointed federal agents by failing to
surrender, as he had hinted he would, on weapons and other charges, saying
he had yet to receive his instructions from God.
The charges resulted from a raid to confiscate weapons from the cult. The
raid began the stand-off and left four agents and several cult followers
dead.
At the weekend Mr Koresh requested a word processor to enable him to record
his revelations. But the FBI was evidently no longer prepared to wait.
At 5.55am local time yesterday the cult was telephoned and informed that the
FBI would begin to fire teargas into the compound.
Agents moved an armoured vehicle to the corner of the compound but were met
with gunfire.

FT  20 APR 93 / Lamont sees two years of fast growth in economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is likely to grow faster than other European economies in 1993 and
1994, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday in his most upbeat
assessment of the economy for some months.
Speaking after a meeting in Luxembourg of European Community and European
Free Trade Area finance ministers, he said: 'The prospects for Britain are
very encouraging, even though the outlook for much of the rest of Europe
remains of concern.'
His remarks coincided with a forecast from the European Commission that
growth in the EC this year was likely to be 0.75 per cent.
Growth could rise to 2.3 per cent in 1994, taking into account the EC's
package of measures agreed at the Edinburgh summit last December to improve
the performance of member states' economies and provide for more flexible
Community lending to small and medium-sized businesses.
Further evidence of recovery in the UK came yesterday in a Confederation of
British Industry survey showing that retail sales grew strongly in the year
to March.
The CBI reported that sales were up year-on-year for the third consecutive
month, although the improvement was not yet firmly established.
Another note of caution was sounded by Gallup, the market research company.
Its latest consumer confidence survey found that the public was very unsure
about the strength and durability of any recovery. Although sentiment about
the general economic situation has improved, people are still wary about
their own financial prospects.
The latest UK Treasury growth forecast is 1.25 per cent in 1993, and an
annual rate of 3 per cent in the first half of 1994 compared with the first
six months of this year.
At the Luxembourg meeting, Mr Lamont vigorously denied that the UK was
pursuing growth through a competitive devaluation of sterling. The pound has
been floating along with the lira since both currencies were forced out of
the European exchange rate mechanism last September.
The chancellor indicated that the UK government would like to see sterling
appreciate, partly to offset inflationary pressures. He noted that UK
inflation had not risen as sharply as many had expected, but added: 'I
welcome strongly the recent strength of sterling.'
The relatively strong UK economic performance since the exit from the ERM
has caused some irritation inside the EC. Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission, has attacked 'wildcat devaluations' which had
artificially boosted competitiveness.
In Luxembourg yesterday, Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics
commissioner, said there was 'nothing astonishing' about Britain starting to
regain its economic potential after a protracted recession. 'It would be
much more catastrophic if there was no sign of recovery in the UK after a
long period of negative growth,' said the Danish commissioner.
Mr Christophersen also predicted that the UK would eventually have to return
to the ERM because, he said, staying out was 'not a viable long-term
strategy'.
Although the UK government has insisted that sterling will not return until
what it says are fault-lines inside the ERM are corrected, Mr Christophersen
said the only viable strategy was to take part in European monetary
integration, even if members could discuss the speed of membership.

FT  20 APR 93 / Blaze ends Texas siege as FBI moves on compound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian religious cult near Waco, Texas,
ended in an inferno yesterday following an attempt by US law enforcement
agents to halt the stand-off.
A fire, which the White House said was deliberately started by followers of
religious zealot Mr David Koresh, destroyed the compound where the cult
members had been holed up.
The White House said FBI agents were doing everything possible to rescue the
95 cult followers from the compound and that at least 20 people had left.
Seventeen children under 10 years old were believed to be inside the
compound with Mr Koresh and his followers.
'They're still pulling people out,' a White House official said, adding that
the FBI did not know how many would survive the fire. FBI agents pulled out
of the compound one reluctant woman who did not want to leave.
The blaze, which razed all the buildings in the compound, prompted fears
that the cult may have embarked on either a mass escape through tunnels or
mass suicide several hours after the FBI fired teargas at them in an attempt
to end the siege.
President Bill Clinton yesterday said he had advance notice of the assault
on the compound, but that attorney-general Janet Reno made the decision to
begin the operation. The president brushed off questions on the subject,
telling reporters: 'I want you to. . . talk to the attorney-general or the
FBI. I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was entirely theirs.'
In London the Foreign Office said 26 British residents were thought to be in
the compound at the time of the blaze. There was no immediate indication of
what happened to Mr Koresh, the religious leader who believes he is the
incarnation of Jesus Christ.
The blaze spread swiftly, punctuated by explosions - possibly from the
cult's vast ammunition stores. By the time firemen arrived little was left
of the cult's large compound.
Mr Koresh last week disappointed federal agents by failing to surrender on
weapons and other charges resulting from the raid, which left four agents
dead, that began the stand-off. He said he had yet to receive his
instructions from God.
Over the weekend Mr Koresh sent a request for a word processor to enable him
to record his revelations. The FBI was evidently no longer prepared to wait.
At 5.55am local time yesterday the cult was telephoned and informed that the
FBI would begin to fire teargas into the compound. Agents moved an armoured
vehicle to the corner of the compound but were met with gunfire.
An estimated 75-80 rounds were fired during the initial engagement.
Occupants were advised by loudspeaker: 'This is not an assault. Do not fire.
If you fire your fire will be returned. We are introducing non-lethal
teargas. Exit the compound now and follow instructions. . . you will not be
harmed.'
Mr Bob Ricks, the FBI agent in charge of the operation, said the teargas was
fired to 'make them as uncomfortable as possible'.

FT  19 APR 93 / International Company News: Europa Metalli tumbles into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPA Metalli, the industrial arm of Societa Metallurgica Italiana,
Europe's biggest maker of semi-finished copper and alloy products, plunged
to a L67.4bn (Dollars 44m) loss last year owing to the recession and
problems at its big French subsidiary.
In 1991, net profits at the company, which controls Kabelmetal in Germany
and Trefimetaux in France, amounted to L10.9bn.
Sales in 1992 rose by about 3 per cent to L3,112bn, based on average
exchange rates for the year. However, the decline in demand was reflected in
turnover in Ecu terms, which fell by about 0.5 per cent.
Mr Luigi Orlando, chairman and main shareholder, attributed the sharp fall
in earnings to financial factors and the recession. Extraordinary items in
1992 resulted in a loss of L3.2bn, compared with earnings of L32bn in 1991.
Operations in France reported a heavy loss, while activities in Germany,
which had buoyed other parts of the group, also witnessed a downturn in the
second half. Meanwhile, the group's defence business, principally
ammunition, remained heavily in the red owing to stagnant demand.
The group forecast an upturn this year thanks to a restructuring plan
involving investments of L150bn over the next two years to improve
productivity and product quality, and lift sales. It also plans to cut its
workforce, now about 11,000. by 14 per cent, with the sharpest reductions in
France.
Net group debt rose to L1,043bn from L863bn in 1991, although much of the
increase was due to exchange rate factors.
New Holland, the farm and construction equipment business formed from the
acquisition by Fiat of Ford's New Holland subsidiary, is buying 50 per cent
of Fabrica de Tractores Agricolas, a leading Mexican farm equipment maker.
No price for the deal has been revealed. FTA, owned by the Mexican Barrera
group, had sales of about Dollars 100m last year and controls around 40 per
cent of the Mexican farm equipment market.
The deal envisages the transfer of Fiat technology to FTA for tractors of
between 65-100 horsepower and offers FTA access to the international New
Holland sales network for its products.

RESULTS DUE
ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS, the bread to sugar group, reports interim results
today and is likely to show little change on the Pounds 175.2m pre-tax in
the comparable period. While baking margins are still under pressure, the
group's British Sugar division is expected to have gained from the green
pound devaluation.
Hammerson, the UK's third biggest property company, will tomorrow reveal the
damage inflicted by the collapse of the property market in the UK, Canada
and Australia, its main markets. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to fall
from Pounds 55.5m to around Pounds 43m, while net assets per share may fall
from 637p to 470p. It is expected to unveil a cut in its 1992 dividend
payout from 20.5p to 10p, as indicated by its interim results in October.
Smiths Industries, the defence and aerospace components group, is expected
to report on Wednesday a drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 44m to
about Pounds 40m. Analysts believe restructuring could lead to significant
exceptional costs.
Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, reports interim
results on Thursday, with the City expecting a drop in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 37.2m to about Pounds 25m. Some expect the interim dividend to be
reduced (1.85p last time).

Referendum

<TEXT>
THE chairman of Russia's Central Bank has described the agreement between
the government and the bank on limiting credit expansion as meaningless, and
predicted it will be broken.
The agreement has been represented in meetings between the Russian
government and leaders and officials of the Group of Seven industrialised
countries as evidence of increasing control over the bank. The government
has accused the bank of fuelling inflation and undermining reforms by
issuing large credits to state enterprises.
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the bank chairman, confirmed at the weekend he had
agreed with Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister in charge of economics
and finance, that credit expansion in the second quarter be limited to an
additional Rbs2,800bn-Rbs3,000bn, a 30 per cent rise.
But Mr Gerashchenko - who has clashed with Mr Fyodorov since the latter
demanded his sacking - said the agreement was 'really a trap' for Mr
Fyodorov because he would not be able to keep government spending within
these limits.
'We at the bank reckon that the budget deficit in the second quarter of this
year will stand at about Rbs2,500bn. So he will need to ask us for more
credits, I would think, by the middle of May.'
The position of Mr Fyodorov, the cabinet minister most closely identified
with economic reform since the forced resignation last December of Mr Yegor
Gaidar, former acting prime minister, may also be undermined by the
appointment at the end of last week of Mr Oleg Lobov as a first deputy prime
minister with a brief to take charge of the economy. Mr Lobov's rank puts
him above Mr Fyodorov.

   PALERMO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE voters trickle into the cavernous school building, converted into a
polling station, with the solemnity of people attending Mass. Wailing sirens
suddenly puncture the tranquility of this balmy Sunday morning in Palermo.
'He's coming,' a plain-clothes policeman announces importantly and clears
the school entrance of curious voters.
Then, amid a screech of brakes, a stocky figure steps out of an
armour-plated Fiat Croma, surrounded by bodyguards. Mr Leoluca Orlando,
former mayor of Palermo and founder of La Rete, the rapidly growing movement
for clean government, has come to cast his vote in Italy's ninth post-war
referendum.
Mr Orlando is bundled forward, scarcely given time to greet a few
supporters. An implacable opponent of the Mafia, he is the politician most
at risk in Sicily.
Inside an upper room, election officials respectfully check his identity
card against the electoral register (one for men, another for women). He is
handed eight coloured folders, a different one for each of the referendum
proposals, then disappears into a small booth. Only his legs are visible.
To read the fine print of the proposals should take an average of eight
minutes, but he emerges after little more than one.
The first slip he casts into the line of eight boxes is yellow - the key
ballot for ending proportional representation and introducing a system of
majority voting in the Senate.
Although he originally backed the referendum movement, led by former
Christian Democrat Mr Mario Segni, Mr Orlando has since come out against the
majority vote proposal, claiming electoral reform has been hijacked by the
traditional parties.
'If the majority system is accepted,' he told a packed crowd on Friday
outside Palermo's decaying opera house, 'in the north we will have the
regions nearly all represented by the Lombard League and in the south by the
(Christian Democrat) old guard. The yes vote will mean that wholly
discredited people will be called on to carry out electoral reform.'
Mr Orlando has acquired some odd political bedfellows in his campaign - the
Mafia, closely linked to the old guard among the Christian Democrats; the
neo-fascist MSI, also strong in the south; and some Socialists and elements
of the former Communist party.
This assortment of protest could well lower the expected margin of victory
for majority voting to below the 70 per cent predicted by some opinion
polls.
Smiling nervously as he comes away from voting, Mr Orlando declines to offer
a prediction: 'We concentrated on getting the vote before the poll, we must
now concentrate on the counting.'
Once he has left, the election officials relax. They have been on duty since
6.30am, greeted the first voter at 7am, and will not be finished until 2pm
today collecting the ballots of a segment of Palermo's 562,000 potential
voters.
'It's a fine day - who knows how many will come? Whatever the outcome of the
vote, change is on the way, even here in Sicily,' says one young woman.
'We owe it to people like Falcone and Borsellino (the two anti-Mafia
magistrates assassinated last year).'
Mr Paolo Borsellino was killed last July by a huge car bomb while visiting
his mother on a quite Sunday not far from the school. Yesterday, the small
shrine erected in the street to him and his bodyguards had a bunch of fresh
flowers.

FT  19 APR 93 / Rumbles of discontent from the coal miners: Russia -
Referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUZBASS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN President Boris Yeltsin last battled the Communist party, back in 1991,
Mr Yuri Lutskii, a mine union leader from the Siberian region of Kuzbass,
joined a 100,000-strong miners' strike to support the president.
Two years later Mr Lutskii is one of a growing number of miners who could
turn violently against him.
For, if the Russian government sets about implementing the fiscal reform
that the west is now demanding, cutting credit to inefficient enterprises
and staging model bankruptcies, enterprises in regions such as the Kuzbass
stand in the firing line.
Mr Yuri Shafranik, Russian energy minister, told Kuzbass leaders last week
that many of the region's ageing and inefficient mines will have to be
closed this year. Although details of the planned closures have yet to be
revealed, the proposition leaves mine leaders such as Mr Lutskii
increasingly fearful for the future - and so their support for Mr Yeltsin
cools.
'If they do not develop programmes to find work for those who will lose
their job, there will be a social explosion here,' warns Mr Lutskii.
Viewed against Russia's spiralling budget deficit, the case for reform in
the Kuzbass region is undeniable. Russia's coal industry is one of the most
heavily subsidised branches of the economy.
Since the collapse of trade and transport links in the former Soviet Union
have left many mines unable to sell what coal they still produce, they are
left with stockpiles of unused coal, and increasing debts.
Local leaders insist the problem is that the government is demanding they
operate under a market system while the price of coal, unlike many other raw
materials, is still fixed at a low level by the state.
Although the government then tops this up with subsidies, and lets the mine
sell some of its coal on the open market, the mine managers say this does
not even cover the payroll cost, coal miners' wages in Russia being
traditionally high.
The region, like many industrial centres in Russia, is trying to survive by
withholding taxes from the centre, and seeking export markets. Some of the
more modern mines on the region's rich seams have attracted foreign capital
and some 20 per cent of the coal is now being exported.
However, the region's administration is insisting that Moscow should provide
full guarantees for the thousands of miners who will lose their jobs.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (22): Increasingly hostile
dogfight - Airline slots / A place on the tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE captain of the British Airways shuttle to Belfast was apologetic. 'You
could be forgiven for thinking we were going via Rome,' he told his
passengers. 'We have taxied about four miles around Heathrow, but we have
the next slot in the queue.'
Flight BA4572 operates in one of the many slots which together give BA a
commanding share of traffic at Europe's busiest international airport.
Slots, a prized possession at busy airports, give carriers access to runways
where air traffic is limited because of congestion. The Belfast shuttle is
one of thousands of flights in Europe which depend on traffic flows
controlled by slot schedules.
The system regulates departures and arrivals at London's Heathrow and
Gatwick, Frankfurt, Milan and Munich.
By 1995, increasing congestion is expected to require slot restrictions at
Geneva, Rome, Stuttgart, Paris Orly and Dusseldorf.
Increasing frustration at slot restrictions has now prompted several
carriers to seek changes in the traffic management of Europe's air space.
Aware of complaints that smaller airlines get a poor deal in the share-out,
EC transport ministers last year decided to tighten the rules so that
airlines would lose slots they don't use. But some operators, such as Virgin
Atlantic Airways, claim the moves do not go far enough. It wants slots
confiscated from large carriers to make way for new ones.
For the business traveller, the argument turns on whether a more equitable
distribution of slots would provide more choice and better service for the
consumer.
Independent carriers such as Virgin at Heathrow and ANA at Tokyo Narita
argue that airlines operating existing routes would be forced to improve
services with more direct competition. That competition depends on rival
carriers being awarded slots at the right time to mount an effective
challenge.
The bodies governing slot allocation are not so sure. They are reluctant to
endorse a sweeping upheaval of the slot allocation system and prefer instead
to increase availability through piecemeal improvements in air traffic
control and terminal capacity.
In terms of consumer choice and service, it is questionable whether
travellers would see an immediate benefit if the authorities embarked on a
Robin Hood strategy of taking slots from the rich - mega-carriers such as
United, American, BA and JAL - to give to the poor.
The small independents, however, claim their whole future depends on slots.
Without them their hopes for expansion and a larger route network will be
frustrated. Virgin, for example, has route licenses to fly to San Francisco
and Washington but cannot begin services from Heathrow without slots. The
equation is quite simple: no slots, no service.
The European Commission is now considering a complaint that slot allocation
at Heathrow is unfair. Virgin hopes the ruling, expected in the summer, will
transform take-off and landing patterns at London.
Whatever the Commission's decision, the big carriers will fight
tooth-and-nail against surrendering slots. They are a heavyweight lobby and
many, including BA and Lufthansa, will argue that their sizeable share does
not inhibit fair competition.
BA is extremely reluctant to give up its hold on 39 per cent of Heathrow
slots and says it compares favourably with the control exercised by US
carriers at their home hubs.
American Airlines controls 65 per cent of slots at Dallas; United 68 per
cent at Washington and 48 per cent at Chicago; Delta has a 70 per cent share
at Atlanta. The best bet for smaller carriers seeking slots lies not with
allegations of market-rigging and complaints to Brussels. They should
concentrate instead on making gains out of the increasingly hostile dogfight
being waged by the mega-carriers under the auspices of air liberalisation.
United, for example, has decided to test Britain's commitment to
liberalisation by agreeing to buy the Gatwick-Philadelphia licence from
USAir on condition it can transfer the route to Heathrow and use it to serve
Chicago.
If the move is approved it could create opportunities for other airlines to
press their case.
In the end, however, Heathrow will reach saturation point and there will be
fewer slots.
For all their lobbying of politicians and transport user groups, the
airlines seeking clearance at the world's most popular hub will have to wait
for gradual improvements in technology and runway capacity that should, in
time, make more slots available.
At Heathrow, this piecemeal expansion is overseen by three different bodies:
the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), in charge of air traffic control; BAA,
the airports operator which provides gates and terminal capacity; and
Airport Co-ordination Limited (ACL), the final arbiter of UK slots.
Under the system, no slots can be allocated without the approval of two men.
Dr Peter Brooker, chief scientist at the CAA, decides the sustainable runway
capacity at Heathrow and Gatwick.
He has set the runway rate at Heathrow at 76 movements an hour. This
compares with 67 an hour in 1981 and reflects improvements in air traffic
control and the use of 'fast taxiways' that enable aircraft to join or exit
runways with greater frequency.
Mr Peter Morrisroe, managing director of ACL, is Britain's independent slot
co-ordinator. He decides where to allocate capacity following bi-annual
meetings with the CAA, BAA and the airlines concerned.
Most slots at EC airports are in the gift of co-ordinators employed by
national flag carriers. Britain - reacting to complaints of slot rigging -
has now urged its EC partners to follow Heathrow's example and set up an
independent body to make allocations.
According to Virgin, however, London's independent co-ordinator is too
partial in favour of BA and it wants a radical change. 'We believe slots
should be allocated for a 10-year period and should be handed back if there
is a change of use,' the airline says.
Such initiatives are not welcomed by all the independents. British Midland,
the short-haul carrier with 14 per cent of Heathrow slots, is pursuing
another course. It wants to see US-style 'mixed-mode' operations which allow
aircraft to take off and land on the same runway. At present, Heathrow's two
runways are reserved for one or the other.
Sir Michael Bishop, British Midland's chairman, argues that such a system
would free more slots for some of the 62 airlines operating out of Heathrow.
But the CAA says there is no leeway for mixed-mode operations. 'A take-off
between two landing aircraft would be difficult to introduce because of the
Vortex Separation Standards which ensure a three-mile gap between each
aircraft movement,' it says.
Mixed-mode slots are also constrained by environmental regulations designed
to minimise the airport's impact on residential areas. Any change would
require political intervention, according to the authority.
'The biggest move to get more slots is to extend the working day. With only
an extra half hour in the morning and in the evening you'd get an extra 74
movements,' the CAA adds.
The proposal is backed by British Midland, which says it would create slot
vacancies by enabling long-haul flights to land earlier.
Sir Michael claims European airports are also following US trends by
allowing slots to be leased or sold by one carrier to another.
In the US a peak period slot at a leading hub has an estimated value of
Dollars 1m. An American carrier may own 20 or more gates at a particular hub
which it can sell or lease to its rivals. But the European Commission is
opposed to the idea.
'The pricing mechanism used in the US is not considered appropriate for
Europe because it would increase the costs considerably and would not be in
line with the policy of the Community to increase competition,' Commission
officials say.
The system of buying and selling slots is fraught with difficulties because
most European carriers do not own airport gates; they share them. Gate
control lies with the airport operators.
Limitations on use of gates and runway capacity has forced airlines to
maximise the use of existing slots by switching routes and introducing
larger aircraft into their schedules. British Midland, for example, has
abandoned services from Heathrow to Liverpool and used the slot to serve
Frankfurt.
Using bigger aircraft for existing slots might avoid increased congestion on
the runways but can lead to jams in the terminals. To solve that problem a
number of European hubs including Paris Charles de Gaulle and London
Heathrow have embarked on ambitious plans to create more terminal capacity.
BAA says its proposed fifth terminal will handle a further 10m passengers by
the turn of the century and 30m by 2015 - without any increase in the number
of slots available.
'Overall, the planes coming in are going to get larger,' says BAA. 'We
expect an increase of 2 per cent in average size by the time the new
terminal opens.
'Until then we have to hope that slot allocation will be more flexible. But
aircraft will still be stacking at the runway for some time to come.'

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (20): Well-established pattern
 -Hubs / Manchester Airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN British Airways' inaugural inbound flight from Los Angeles arrived at
Manchester airport last month, it contained a surprise. Forty of the 218
passengers were en route to Munich, transferring to BA's early morning
service on arrival.
BA had not been expecting Manchester to start playing its hub-and-spoke role
so quickly - before advertising and promotions had exerted their full effect
in California - but the service seems to have tapped a pent-up demand.
With 30,000 advance bookings already, BA's target of 70,000 passengers
flying Manchester-LA looks easily attainable.
It fits a now well-established pattern. Qantas was the first international
carrier to give Manchester a proper test with a scheduled long-haul service
10 years ago.
This has since proved to have been the critical first step towards a
remarkable progress.
In 1985, the airport had 2.4m scheduled passengers, 3.7m chartered, and
114,000 in transit, making a total of 6.2m.
By the end of last year numbers had doubled, with 4.8m scheduled, 6.9m
chartered, and 747,000 in transit, totalling 12.4m.
The three categories grew by 100 per cent, 88 per cent and more than 500 per
cent respectively over the eight years.
This means that the scheduled traffic, which carries business travellers, is
growing faster than the holiday traffic, while rapidly rising numbers of
transit passengers are proving Manchester's emergence as a hub.
Last month, Manchester opened the Pounds 265m first phase of its Terminal
Two, so it can grow to 18m passengers a year. There are now 94 airlines
serving 166 destinations.
Most of Europe is now covered - with day trips to, for example, the main
business centres of Germany, France or the Netherlands exploited by growing
numbers of business travellers.
But it is the growth of worldwide connections which is establishing
Manchester's international credibility.
Manchester's attraction is 20m people within two hours' driving.
Qantas tested a research finding that most of the 50,000 northerners then
travelling to Australia via other airports each year would prefer not to
change aircraft.
'They got 28,000 in the first year; now it's up to 75,000,' Mr Gil Thompson,
Manchester airport's chief executive, says. 'Qantas proved that the
northerner rewards the airline that flies to his doorstep. Our research
shows that if airlines come in here, people will move their itineraries
around to use the services.'
Manchester was also helped by a cross-party lobbying group called the
Northern Consortium, formed by local authorities throughout the north of
England.
It helped Manchester airport's designation by the government as both an
international gateway and the UK's northern hub.
The airlines soon got the message. The airport itself always offered BA
first crack at any new potential route, but knew foreign airlines were eager
to step in if BA did not want the route because of its commitments at its
Heathrow headquarters.
American Airlines was therefore the first US carrier to fly direct into
Manchester, opening a daily route to Chicago in 1986.
Mr Iain Burns, a former Manchester airport employee who now works for
American, says: 'There was a huge untapped market of business travellers in
the north of England. There was, and still is, a pronounced feeling among
businessmen in the north that they should not have to travel to the US by
way of London.'
Manchester to Chicago is one of the airline's most profitable routes, with
flights close to full.
Mr Burns says: 'The attraction of Chicago for the business traveller is that
it is an important hub. New York is essentially a point-to-point airport.
From Chicago it is possible to fly to 114 other destinations. Only 30 per
cent of our passengers finish their journeys in Chicago. The other 70 per
cent fly on somewhere else.'
Delta Airlines is also happy with Manchester, from where it has been flying
daily to Atlanta for nearly two years.
An official said: 'This flight is very profitable. We carried 136,000
passengers last year, which means pretty full payloads. It did not start
quietly, then limp along and finally pick up. We did well from day one.'
Cathay Pacific has three flights a week to Hong Kong. Mr John Paterson,
Cathay's manager for Britain and Ireland, says: 'The problem of going via
Heathrow is that you have to change terminals and flights. From Manchester
you can fly direct, with one stop in Frankfurt.'
This creates the minimum of disruption for travellers but also enables
Cathay to top up with passengers in Frankfurt. Profitability is encouraging
Cathay to increase to five flights a week in July, followed by daily
services when it can get the slots.
Mr Thompson says: 'We have then been able to prove if that airline were
minded to fly direct from Manchester, it would carry at least 50 per cent
more than our market research first indicates is available.
Chicago is a case in point: there were 40,000 when American Airlines
started, then 60,000, then 80,000, then 90,000. . and now it's 130,000
people.'
Competition is also effective: 'When American Airlines started a daily
service to New York - as British Airways already offered - BA was afraid it
would halve the cake. What has it done? It has doubled the traffic. Instead
of 100,000 passengers a year to New York from Manchester, there are now
200,000.
'Our research has shown that direct, particularly non-stop services,
multiply the traffic. We are not in the business of putting airlines on the
margin by trying to cut the cake into too many small slices,' Mr Thompson
adds.
As well as passengers driving to Manchester, the airport also promised
airlines it would use valuable air traffic slots to improve feeder services.
This has also paid off.
'There are now more domestic passengers feeding Manchester as a hub than any
other airport in the country, including London,' Mr Thompson says.
'We have 19 domestic routes. We feed them in from places such as Dundee,
Edinburgh, Exeter, Southampton, Belfast, Cardiff and Newcastle. It's
expensive in terms of slots, but it's our investment in the future  - to be
a hub, rather than an airport that flies from point to point.'
About 250,000 extra passengers have therefore been delivered to the
long-haul scheduled carriers, the bulk of them business travellers.
Manchester also offers another advantage - it is up to an hour nearer New
York than London is, partly because of less air traffic congestion. Business
leaders point to a 5 1/2 -hour journey time eastbound.
There are still gaps in Manchester's schedules, such as Vienna and Japan,
but Mr Thompson and his team are working on them, with a regular return
service to Osaka by All Nippon Airways the best bet for the next new
long-haul route.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (21): Busiest in south-east
Asia - Hubs / Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Planning, planning and more planning has been the secret of Singapore's
success. Over the past 30 years, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime minister,
and his team of technocrats and planners have turned Singapore from a
neglected post-colonial outpost into one of the world's most dynamic
economies, with the second-highest per capita income level in Asia.
Changi airport, Singapore's international air terminus, is just one example
of the meticulousness of the city state's planners. Changi, more than half
of it built on land reclaimed from the sea, was opened in 1981. A second
runway began operating three years later. In 1990, a second terminal was
opened. Changi is consistently voted by international travellers to be among
the world's best airports.
According to the civil aviation authority of Singapore (CAAS), Changi
handled 18.1m passengers and more than 700,000 tonnes of air freight last
year, registering growth rates of 11.8 per cent and 11 per cent
respectively.
Changi is now served by 59 scheduled airlines linking it to more than 100
cities in 54 countries. Each week nearly 2,500 scheduled flights land at
Changi, making it the busiest air hub in south-east Asia.
Existing facilities at Changi can cope with as many as 24m passengers a
year. But the CAAS planners are looking far ahead. Under the terms of a
master plan originally conceived back in 1975, work is beginning on a third
terminal and there is already talk of building a fourth terminal around the
turn of the century.
A frantic bout of airport construction is now taking place in east Asia to
cope with a rapid rise in air traffic. The international air transport
association (Iata) says only two air traffic 'hubs' in the region -
Singapore and Taipei - have the facilities in place to deal with projected
growth in passengers.
A recent Iata report forecast that airline passenger numbers in the
Asia-Pacific region will double over the next six years. By 2000, the region
will account for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide passenger traffic and by
the year 2010 that figure will be more than 50 per cent - representing 375m
passengers.
In south-east Asia, Iata predicts that passenger traffic will increase by
more than 9 per cent per year up to 1995, compared with an annual growth of
3.9 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in North America.
Airport overcrowding and various infrastructure bottlenecks threaten to hold
up passenger growth in the region. Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Hong Kong, Bangkok
and Kuala Lumpur are all planning or actually building new airports. But if
passenger growth continues to climb in line with Iata projections many of
these facilities will be operating at virtually full capacity from the day
they open.
Singapore is making full use of the advantages of its superior aviation
facilities to establish itself as a hub not only for the region, but for
worldwide airline traffic.
Singapore Airlines (SIA) has been at the centre of Changi's development as a
hub. Over the years SIA has rapidly expanded both its regional and long-haul
operations. At the end of last year SIA had flights to 66 cities in 40
countries with more than 400 weekly services. In the past two years alone,
nine new destinations have been added to the SIA network.
SilkAir, a wholly-owned SIA subsidiary, has concentrated on pioneering
various regional routes out of Singapore. These services link into SIA
services.
Mr Michael Tan, SIA deputy managing director for commercial affairs, says
the primary aim of the airline's route planning is to gain access to both
key and developing markets, offering passengers and freight customers a
comprehensive network with a high frequency of fast, non-stop services.
'Our scheduling strategy emphasises the integration of the long haul and
regional services, SIA to SIA and SIA to SilkAir, thus building a strong hub
at Changi airport, which is the ideal airport given its modern and efficient
facilities,' says Mr Tan.
But Changi's hub operations are not exclusive to SIA. Singapore's planners
realise that if the airport is to develop to its full potential, other
airlines must also use it as a hub for their flight operations.
In 1989, Singapore signed an agreement with Britain which allowed British
Airways hubbing rights out of Singapore. In time BA will be able to base
fleets of smaller aircraft at Changi servicing regional routes, which will
then link up with the airline's longer-haul flights.
At the time the agreement was described as a model for other countries to
follow. Mr Lim Chin Beng, SIA's deputy chairman, says the future of aviation
rests on developing such a hub-and-spoke system at airports.
In return for use of its facilities at Changi, SIA has pressed for increased
traffic rights and hubbing at other centres. Other airlines have been
approached by Singapore's civil aviation authority to use Changi as a hub,
including United Airlines, Qantas and Japan Airlines.
SIA recently lost a battle with British Airways for a stake in Qantas. But
the Australian carrier is already using Changi as a hub or 'feeder' airport
for its rapidly-expanding regional services. Qantas flights between
Singapore and Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta are being linked
in to the airline's long-haul services between Australia and Europe.
Last year, Singapore and Australia agreed to a 50 per cent increase in air
traffic between the two countries up to 1995 in order to boost tourism and
trade.
In tandem with Changi's development as a passenger traffic hub, moves have
also been made to increase Singapore's importance as an international
freight hubbing centre.
In late 1990 the air transport agreement between Singapore and the US was
revised, allowing US carriers extensive hubbing rights for freighter
services out of Singapore. US airlines can now operate up to 42 B747 cargo
services between Singapore and other destinations in the Asia Pacific
region. These services can then feed cargo to their long-haul flights.
In return, Singapore secured an Atlantic routing with access to four points
in the US, including New York, and onward services into Canada. Certain
restrictions on the Pacific route into the US were also lifted.
Increased maintenance facilities at Changi have also helped Singapore's
development as an aviation hub. A large number of airlines now use Changi's
sophisticated technical facilities.
In a recent statement, Boeing noted that an increasing proportion of its
orders came from the Asia Pacific region. Of the 226 747-400s so far
delivered, 53 per cent have gone to carriers in the region.
Singapore is the main location for Boeing's spares support facility in the
Asia-Pacific region. A new centre near Changi will operate round the clock
to service the needs of carriers using Singapore.
Mr Karmjit Singh, assistant director for corporate affairs at SIA, says all
these factors have helped strengthen Changi's role as a hub. 'A hub does not
just happen,' says Mr Singh. 'It is the product of a strategic vision, sound
long-term planning and meticulous implementation.'

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (17): This airport makes its
city tick - Hubs / Atlanta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Atlanta, born humbly as 'Terminus' at the end of a railroad line in the
early 19th century, has long seen that its fortunes are tied to
transportation. Today, no Atlantan would deny that Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport, the world's fourth-busiest, is what makes this
flamboyantly commercial city of 3m tick.
In a conscious strategy to make Atlanta the business capital of the
south-east, Hartsfield was built from the 1950s through the 1980s into the
leading commercial and passenger air hub of the region. It is credited with
being the city's main economic generator, pumping an estimated Dollars 7bn
into the local economy annually.
But this has not been enough to satisfy the city's ambitions. It now wants
Hartsfield to become an international hub - matching its aim to be one of
the world's top cities.
To this end, Atlanta's Hartsfield is completing a new Dollars 300m
international concourse which is scheduled to open next year. It is expected
to have the latest in accommodation and amenities for international
travellers and to be the largest 'all in one' international terminal in the
US.
Since 1980 when it was revamped, Hartsfield has claimed it has the world's
largest passenger terminal, covering 2.2m square feet. The new international
terminal, which will have 12 baggage carousels and be able to accommodate at
one time as many as 24 narrow or 18 wide-body aircraft, will add an
additional 1.2m sq ft.
The new international terminal is largely an outgrowth of the city's
increased international business. The Atlanta metropolitan area is home to
more than 500 international companies and 39 international banks. Foreign
investment in the state of Georgia, of which Atlanta is the capital, reached
a cumulative Dollars 7.5bn from 1984 through 1991, according to a recent
study of KPMG Peat Marwick.
With 10 international carriers, including British Airways, Lufthansa, Japan
Airlines, and Swissair, and services to 27 cities in 18 countries,
Hartsfield already handles more than 2m foreign travellers a year.
Atlanta has also had a special spur for its expansion of Hartsfield for
foreign travellers. It will be the site of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games and
is girding itself with a number of large public projects for the onslaught
of tens of thousands of foreign visitors.
Hartsfield handled a total of 48m passengers last year, back up to its 1990
level after weathering a drop in traffic in 1991 to 37.9m. The decrease in
1991 came generally as a result of the US airline industry's problems, but
most particularly from the demise of Eastern Airlines, the only US carrier
other than Delta Air Lines (the third-largest US airline, whose headquarters
are in Atlanta) that a operated out of Hartsfield as a hub.
The failure of Eastern, which had handled one third of of Hartsfield's
activity, left 33 gates open, four of which have now been taken over by a
revived TWA.
A gradually recovering US economy no doubt lifted passenger traffic at
Hartsfield last year. But the bounce back was also helped by that fact that
Atlanta is one of the largest convention and business meeting centres in the
US, rather than a tourist destination, which has a higher level of
discretionary visitors.
The bulk of Hartsfield's passengers are on business. While many gripe about
the droning electronic voices on its people movers and its lack of creative
concessions, the business travellers who use Hartsfield rate it highly. In a
recent survey for the magazine Business Traveller International, Hartsfield
ranked as the best airport in North America for the fourth consecutive year.
It was followed by Dallas-Fort Worth, Tampa, Chicago and Washington-Dulles.
Unfortunately, while the airport wins much praise, all is not as rosy at
Hartsfield as Atlanta's city fathers would wish.
Most importantly, Delta, which has lost more than Dollars 1bn since the
airline industry began its slump in 1990, is being forced to cut staff and
service.
In a break with its 36-year-old policy not to sack permanent employees, it
announced last month that it would lay off some 600 pilots.
It will also reduce its fleet by 28 aircraft and eliminate some unprofitable
flights, both foreign and domestic.
As Delta is the dominant carrier at Hartsfield - accounting for 80 per cent
of the airport's connecting and originating traffic - this is unwelcome news
for Atlanta.
Hartsfield's officials, who were already working hard to bring in new
foreign airlines to use its new international terminal, will now face added
pressure to step up their domestic marketing efforts.
They are likely to find it an uphill battle, given that the airline industry
on the whole is losing money and downsizing. Other airlines have also stayed
away from Hartsfield because of the entrenched position of Delta which, as
one of the city's largest employers, can influence decisions in its favour.
At the moment, Mr John Braden, marketing chief, is focused on drumming up
new Latin American cargo customers and luring Latin American airlines, which
would normally use Miami. He hopes, for example, to have Varig, the
Brazilian national airline, flying four jumbos into Hartsfield soon.
To add to Hartsfield's worries, the city of Atlanta has failed for more than
a year to appoint a new aviation commissioner to run the airport. Mr Max
Walker, who had retired as deputy commissioner, has been standing in as
acting commissioner.
The city's search has been complicated because it has been unwilling to pay
an annual salary of about Dollars 120,000 which is what airport chiefs make
elsewhere, offering instead only some Dollars 80,000.
Despite these concerns, the airport is soldiering on and attracting more, if
small, airlines. AeroCancun, for service to Mexico's resort of Cancun;
American Eagle, the commuter affiliate of American Airlines; GP-Express,
another commuter carrier; and Kiwi, a small East Coast airline, have set up
at Hartsfield over the past year.
Yet, perhaps more importantly, with the south-east as the fastest growing
region in the US, Hartsfield seems on a relatively sure footing for the
future.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (19): Rival bibles for
travellers - Airline guides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF you are a business traveller working out of London or any other European
capital, the bible for you is probably still the ABC World Airways Guide,
published by the Reed Travel Group. And If you are business person based in
the US you would probably regard the Flight Guide, published by Official
Airline Guides as an indispensable prop.
OAG was part of the group of companies controlled by the late Robert
Maxwell. According to Mr Jolyon Neely, sales and marketing director -
business sector, the company is profitable and effectively controlled by the
banks to whom Mr Maxwell owed money.
The point is that these two companies virtually have a duopoly on scheduled
airlines guides, but have relative strengths in different markets.
On the face of it, OAG has the larger share of the market. It claims sales
of 430,00 units against about 120,000 for ABC.
These figures are not strictly comparable because OAG has a heavy emphasis
on the US market, while ABC has more of a dominance in Europe and the rest
of the world. Moreover, the two companies produce slightly different
products for different markets so comparisons on units of sales is not very
meaningful.
Suffice to say the two companies dominate a market which is worth at least
Pounds 100m and has been growing at between 5 and 10 per cent a year for the
past five years. Much of the growth has come from the corporate sector, ie
business travellers.
Mr Ron Spiers, publishing director at Reed Travel Group, estimates there 735
scheduled airlines in the world. He says: 'We lose some each year and gain
some; we are about 10 down on last year.'
He adds: 'There are 122,243 unique flight numbers each day. If you break
these down into sectors, say London, Paris, Johannesburg, then there are
671,000 sectors each day. These sectors are what the monthly guides would
catalogue in some way or other each month.'
Last year, ABC updated its flagship World Airways Guide and now calls it ABC
World Airways Corporate Edition. This is the large tome to be found in many
offices. It costs Pounds 330 for an annual subscription and is published
monthly in two volumes. ABC says it sells about 71,000 of these.
Much of the growth in the corporate market is in the pocket guides, called
flight planners. These are condensed versions of the World Airways Guide and
cover Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas. ABC sells
a total of 26,278 of these around the world, in various editions and
different markets. The pocket guides cost Pounds 73 for an annual
subscription of 12 volumes.
These are the main products of the Reed Travel Group. There are other
publications covering hotels, and guides such as the ABC Rail Guide for the
UK. This includes timetables and fares. Updated each month it covers all
services in London and southern England, with complete details of the rail
services between Britain's main towns and cities.
The Reed Travel Group can be contacted in Church Street, Dunstable,
Bedfordshire LU5 4HB (Telephone: 0582 600111) The flagship guide at OAG is
the Flight Guide. This is published in two editions, a North American
edition and a worldwide edition. The North American edition sells 106,000
copies each year and costs Dollars 310 for an annual subscription. The cost
of the worldwide edition, which sells 40,000 copies, is Dollars 382.
OAG, like ABC, publishes pocket guides. These cover the North Americas as
well as Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific. As with the
standard desk Flight Guide, the emphasis on OAG's pocket guides is on the
Americas. OAG's pocket flight guides cost Dollars 103 for a 12-month
subscription. They appear each month. In the UK it is possible now to buy
individual monthly editions at selected bookshops. They retail at Pounds
4.99 each.
Again these are the main publications put out by OAG relating to the airline
business. There are other products covering hotels, shipping and cargo. In
Britain, OAG can be contacted at Bridge House, 4 Lyons Crescent, Tonbridge,
Kent TN9 IEX. Telephone: 0732-770655.
Both companies are now going electronic. OAG has developed a system of
computer discs for IBM-compatible personal computers. This is essentially a
floppy disc which is grafted onto a hard disc and is updated each month. The
cost of 12 monthly discs is Dollars 250.
ABC has chosen a different route via CD-Rom. This means that the purchaser
will also have to buy special equipment akin to a compact disc player to use
these discs.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (18): A natural market - Hubs
/ Iberia's Links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iberia, Spain's national carrier, has betted strongly on what it likes to
call its natural market. During the 1990s it intends to make the airline
synonymous with travel to and within Latin America.
Iberia is traditionally the most frequent European flier to Latin America
and it has stolen a march on its European rivals by establishing a hub in
Miami that distributes passengers arriving on the daily flight from Madrid
to seven destinations in Central America.
In Buenos Aires and Caracas Iberia has created distribution services to the
southern cone and to the Andean countries respectively. These hubs are being
built on the back of an ambitious attempt to establish associations with as
many Latin American airlines as fit in with Iberia's growth strategy for the
continent.
Iberia currently has management control of Aerolineas Argentinas, in which
it has a 30 per cent stake, and of Venezuela's Viasa where it now owns 45
per cent of the equity. The airline also has a 35 per cent stake in Ladeco,
the Chilean airline; is negotiating the purchase of the Dominican Republic's
Dominicana de Aviacion to boost its Caribbean presence; and has explored
potential acquisitions in the Andes, specifically in Bolivia.
A measure of Iberia's designs on the Latin American continent is provided by
its recent creation of a subsidiary in Argentina called Inter Austral to
provide a commuter service linking the cities of Salta, Mendoza and Cordoba
as well as Buenos Aires. The airline believes that it is worth exploiting
the large-scale cutbacks that are being implemented in Argentina's railway
system.
Already Iberia is working on plans for a corporate image that will bind its
Latin American offshoots together. The individual airlines that are now
associated to the Spanish carrier are proud of their identities and wary
about losing them. In Madrid, Iberia executives say the image is necessary
in order to foster client recognition but that it will be introduced
gradually.
At present the general framework of Iberia's Latin American operation
consists of transporting passengers from Europe and then quickly spreading
those that are in transit to further destinations around the continent. From
Miami they are flown on a daily basis to Cancun, Mexico, for example; from
Caracas to La Paz in Bolivia and from Buenos Aires to Santiago de Chile or
to Asuncion, Paraguay.
From such Central and South American locations, travellers are pooled
together in the three hubs for the transatlantic flight. Iberia refers to
its base at Madrid Barajas airport as Latin America's gateway to Europe;
Spain is the continent's main European destination, followed by Italy,
France and the UK.
Iberia's ultimate aim, however, is to gain a substantial quota of the
lucrative Latin America traffic to the US. Other European airlines approach
North America across the Atlantic; Iberia, as it sets down roots in its
'natural market', has chosen to enter it primarily from Central and South
America.
The Spanish company has few rivals in its transatlantic routes to Latin
America but its attempt to capture a significant stake of the North-South
market brings it into direct competition with the US carriers, notably with
American Airlines. Continuing disputes with American Airlines over
reservations and the possibility of a developing price war illustrate the
extent of the competition.
The Miami hub is the key to Iberia's North American ambitions. Under a 1991
agreement with the Department of Transportation, Iberia is entitled to fly
on from Miami - with US pilots and with US-registered aircraft - to 18 US
destinations.
In return for Iberia's Miami facilities, the Spanish authorities have
awarded Delta, United and Continental, as well as American Airlines,
transatlantic routes to Spain. Iberia has effectively given away a big share
of its North Atlantic traffic - it is likely to maintain links only to New
York, relinquishing Chicago and Los Angeles - in order to build up the
North-South trade in America and the Miami hub.
So far, Iberia has put a pilot scheme into operation that is based on an
agreement with Carnival, the US luxury pleasure cruise conglomerate which is
based in Miami. The Spanish carrier has hired two aircraft from Carnival
airlines which it has decked out in Iberia colours and with which it flies
both its own passengers and the pleasure cruise clients from Miami to
Chicago, New York, Houston, New Orleans and Los Angeles.
This is the embryo of what Iberia's Miami hub should become. With a further
13 US destinations available to it, the airline seeks to establish a secure
niche as a primarily Latino carrier distributing passengers across the US.
American Airlines does not like the prospect one bit. It is at present
filing against Iberia which it claims is monopolising computerised
reservation and information systems in Spain.
Iberia, which has in the past made similar accusations about American
Airlines, says the suit is a disguised attempt to force the transportation
authorities to reduce or even withdraw the operational permits it enjoys in
Miami. The Spanish carrier had these facilities confirmed last year when the
transportation authorities disregarded a set of allegations by American
Airlines that were not unlike the present ones.
Iberia can expect a lot more acrimony in the future from US rivals. This
will be in direct proportion to its success in building up its Latin
American presence. The Spanish carrier has nevertheless chosen the market
that it wants to operate and it is unlikely to be deterred from it.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel 15): Aeroflot break-up fails
to halt chaos - Air travel in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One endured flights with Aeroflot, the all-purpose airline of the former
Soviet Union, which treated everyone with equal contempt.
By comparison, flying with eastern European airlines such as Poland's LOT,
Czechoslovakia's CSA and Hungary's Malev was an eye-opener. Although hobbled
by the command economy, they often managed to provide excellent service and
food while being forced to use inefficient Soviet-built aircraft.
These east European airlines, at least, have benefited enormously from the
transition to the market economy. Aeroflot's unlamented break-up might have
been expected to raise a cheer among its domestic and foreign victims. But
anyone attempting to book flights within present-day Russia and the other
CIS states soon discovers that air travel has become even more chaotic than
in the Soviet era.
Although Aeroflot was hacked up into more than 100 successor airlines in
Russia and the CIS, only a few of them such as Estonian Air are much of an
improvement on the old monopoly carrier. Passengers still wait for flights
in austere nakopitel, the quaint Russian word for waiting room which
translates as accumulator.
Passengers lucky enough to corner a round-trip flight from Moscow to Kiev
may well discover in the Ukrainian capital that all flights to Moscow have
been cancelled because of an acute shortage of aviation fuel. As a rule of
thumb the reliability of local fuel supplies and their cost often determines
whether one will get back to Moscow from any CIS destination.
Aviation fuel which costs Dollars 200 a ton in Moscow may cost Dollars 320
in Kiev and Dollars 600 a ton in Alma Ata in Kazakhstan and is unlikely to
be available because of Russia's reluctance to sell at subsidised prices.
In the old days, westerners flying Aeroflot could at least be assured a
ticket for a fixed price in hard currency and therefore enjoyed automatic
priority over Soviet passengers who were dumped at will. Now the price of a
ticket for an internal Russian or CIS flight is determined by what the
market will bear and is often sold by scalpers at many times the stated
fare.
Last February the Russian government slashed subsidies to airlines and
allowed them to raise prices. But an eight-hour flight from Moscow to
Khabarovsk was still recently quoted at 40,000 roubles - about Dollars 50
for Russians - although it cost many times this by the time it reached the
end user.
Settled into their aircraft seats after testing the often dicey toilets,
travellers find themselves confronted with the same insolence they
encountered from flight attendants who flew the skies with Aeroflot. Now,
though, stewardesses peddle everything from western magazines to cosmetics
and even lottery tickets which they buy for resale on their own account.
A nucleus of the old Aeroflot continues in the form of Aeroflot Russian
International Airlines which maintains air links between Russia and the rest
of the world with just over 100 aircraft, including five leased Airbus A310s
on routes to south-east Asia and other long-haul destinations. Plans exist
to lease three or four additional Airbuses and Aeroflot has ordered five
Boeing 737s. Aeroflot RIA was to have been privatised last October but has
become the object of many conflicting interests seeking to place it under
their control. Small wonder that Air Russia, a joint venture with British
Airways which is expected to become operational before the end of this year,
is viewed as having far greater potential than the rump of Aeroflot.
The most lucrative routes for Aeroflot RIA are those connecting Moscow and
St Petersburg with Germany, according to Mr Nikolai Lebedev, head of the
Aeroflot RIA office in Berlin. He points out that western passengers make
the difference because they fork out DM1,000 for a ticket from Berlin to
Moscow - many times what Russians pay to fly to Berlin. Not surprisingly,
the airlines of eastern Europe have made enormous progress in improving
their efficiency by slashing personnel levels and buying or leasing
fuel-efficient western aircraft while maintaining and improving standards of
service.
All three east European carriers have made a special pitch toward
business-class passengers, offering reduced fares, special gifts and a whiff
of old-fashioned, pre-war-style gentility. So far they have attracted two
western airlines to invest in their future.
A 32.20 per cent share of CSA Czechoslovak Airlines, which had net profits
of Kcs8.4m last year, is now held by Air France and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. Alitalia gained a 30 per cent stake in Malev
Hungarian Airlines which earned Dollars 8.1m last year before taxes and
prides itself on being the east European carrier with the highest
productivity.
LOT is to be partly privatised in the next two years by linking forces with
a western carrier while the Polish state wants to retain a 51 per cent share
in the airline.
LOT was quick off the mark to sell most of its lumbering Soviet-built
aircraft and now operates three Boeing 767s, with a fourth to be leased and
five more on order, as well as seven Boeing 737s and five ATR-72 turboprops
together with its remaining Tupolevs. Unprofitable domestic destinations
were dropped and emphasis placed on lucrative western routes, especially to
Germany.
CSA, which for the time being still bears the Czechoslovak Airlines label
despite the split into Czech and Slovak Republics, has two Airbus A310-300s,
five Boeing 737-500s and four ATR 72s but retains several solidly-built
Ilyushin 62s, Tupolev 134s and Tupolev-154s. As with LOT, Frankfurt is the
most frequent foreign destination for CSA passengers followed by Paris,
London and New York. Malev has also held on to its TU-134s and 154s while
acquiring six Boeing 737s and ordering two B767-200s for the inauguration
next month of service to New York. LOT was a pioneer in catering to ethnic
Poles in North America for its North American flights and was therefore
spared some of the most ruinous competition across the Atlantic.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (16): Creating and maintaining
an image - In-flight catering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When passengers complain, it is usually because they did not get the special
meal they ordered, says Mr Kurt Hafner, British Airways' Swiss-born director
of catering. 'But then some people tell us that their doctor has prescribed
them caviar.'
Airline catering is a frustrating business. Food is difficult to prepare at
40,000 feet, fish dries out in the arid atmosphere, omelettes harden, wine
loses its bouquet, champagne fizzes a little too energetically for its own
good.
The habits of the passengers are no help. How does one keep food fresh when
Scandinavians want to lunch at 11am while Spaniards want it at 3pm. . . just
when the British are beginning to think about tea? Americans are ready to
sleep at 10pm when the Spaniards, again, are ready to launch into a
full-scale dinner.
Yet the caterers have come a long way from the days when airline food was
often a flying fiasco. Today you can eat caviar on Cathay Pacific, lobster
in brandy sauce on Singapore Airlines and drink classed-growth Bordeaux
wines on British Airways. Even economy class has been known to be on the
receiving end of a little smoked salmon.
BA spends Pounds 25m a year on beverages alone. Champagne accounts for more
than 40 per cent of the wine budget and less than 20 per cent of the volume.
The airline has placed the largest order on record with a New Zealand
winery, Nobilo, and each year goes through 18,000 cases, at nine litres a
case, of its white wine.
Air France has just 'redefined the whole of in-flight catering after a
long-term study'. It now has 'an energy brunch, because the passengers are
really preparing for a competition.' The afternoon sees a gouter d'affaires
or business tea-time. It claims to be the biggest single buyer of champagne
in the world, but is still worried about competing with Cathay Pacific and
Singapore Airlines on the level of its first-class wines.
Airlines employ famous chefs as consultants. These include Alice Waters of
California's Chez Panisse (American Airlines), Shaun Hill of Gidleigh Park,
in Devon (United Airlines) and Michel Roux of London's Le Gavroche (British
Airways).
Their wine advisers include British Masters of Wine and US professors of
oenology. These experts hold blindfold wine tastings, some after the wine
has been on a transatlantic flight, in the hunt for the right drink with
which to toast that business deal.
Surely no one chooses to fly on an airline because they had a nice drink
last time? Maybe they do. The latest survey of business air travellers by
the International Air Transport Association (Iata) show meals to be the
fourth most important aspect of travelling in business class. It comes after
seat size, faster check-in and lack of crowds, but ahead of frequent flyer
programmes and ticket flexibility.
There is also evidence to suggest that passengers are hesitant about
admitting that food and wine are important. In spite of advance market
research, Virgin Atlantic has found it necessary to introduce a welcome
glass of champagne on its Mid-Class - a business class-sized seat on a full
economy fare ticket - after pressure from passengers accustomed to the treat
in business class on other airlines.
Catering has also become a means for airlines to stamp individuality on a
service. This is important in an era when safety is taken for granted,
delays are usually out of airlines' control and schedules and destinations
can vary little between airlines.
Airlines are therefore taking an ever-more marketing-oriented approach to
catering. Food is served as a 'destination feature' with hamburgers or
pizzas to the US, for example. Cathay Pacific is using illawarra plums and
ground wattle seeds as part of an Australian theme this spring.
Airlines take notice of consumer surveys of the quality of food and wine on
aircraft. BA, by its own admission, used to have a haphazard wine operation
until the mid-1980s. It was shocked out of its complacency by a magazine
survey which placed its wines 16th in a list of 16 airlines, according to Mr
Peter Nixson , BA's head of wine and beverage development.
Now BA serves 7,000 cases of one premier cru white Burgundy a year and would
consider serving a grand cru if it could be sure of delivery in high enough
volumes.
The effort in airline catering is being redoubled now that the recession has
encouraged companies to demand better value for money for their
business-class and first-class tickets. Traditional high luxury is being
replaced by lighter fare. Many airlines are considering extending their
services to airport lounges so that passengers on short overnight trips can
eat before take-off and use the flying time to sleep.
Yet despite the need to be especially cost-conscious during the world
economic slowdown, airlines remain convinced of the importance of catering
in creating and maintaining an image.
'Food has a powerful residual effect on the memory of a flight,' says Mr
Hafner.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (14): A more stable
environment - Business Travel in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS travellers in the US may be biting their nails at present. After
three years of intense price competition in the US airline industry - which
has contributed to the sector's Dollars 10bn-worth of losses over the
period, but been a boon to corporate travellers - there are signs of a more
stable environment and higher fare levels.
The first big blow for the business community was probably struck a year ago
when American Airlines, one of the nation's largest carriers, announced its
fare simplification programme.
Superficially, this appeared to benefit the business traveller. Out went a
whole raft of special promotional fares, and instead American said it would
focus on four core ticket classes - namely first class, coach, seven-day
advance purchase and 21-day advance purchase. Fares within these classes
would be generally lower than for comparable existing classes. First class
fares under American's 'Value Pricing' scheme, for example, were to be 20-50
per cent lower than existing full first-class fares.
The drawback was that American also announced that it was discontinuing the
discounts offered to leading corporate travel buyers and was imposing a
Dollars 25 fee on every rescheduling or refunding of a ticket.
Unfortunately, while the simplified fare structure proved short-lived in the
face of an intense bout of summer ticket promotions, the removal of
corporate discounts and the Dollars 25 fee for ticket changes have tended to
persist.
Now, as the industry has escaped the bleak winter travel period and is
scrambling to repair some of the damage wrought over the past three years,
there are clear signs that airlines are trying to push their prices higher,
particularly where the business customer is concerned.
Whether these higher fares persist in an often-kamikaze industry remains to
be seen. But there is reason to think that they probably will.
For a start, the slow improvement in demand - coupled with the cutbacks
which some carriers are threatening to make in domestic schedules - may pull
demand and supply into better equilibrium. Perhaps even more significantly,
the number of bankrupt airlines - whose cashflow needs have often triggered
the intense fare wars - looks likely to diminish.
Continental Airlines and Trans World Airlines are both poised to emerge from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, leaving only America West with an
unresolved future.
Certainly, the business travel lobby is already girding up for action. The
National Business Travel Association, for example, makes the point that
travel is the third-largest operating expense for many big companies and
that - in a straightened, albeit improving economy - increased ticket prices
will either lead to reduced travel budgets or a halt to travel altogether.
'In either case,' says the NBTA, 'airlines are deprived of customers and so
are hotels, car rental companies, restaurants, airports and other suppliers
in the private sector who depend on the dollars our members spend in the
travel network'.
How the needs of the airline sector and the business community generally can
be meshed will form part of the raft of issues addressed by the new
commission set up by Mr Federico Pena, Transportation Secretary, to examine
the US commercial aviation industry's problems.
Already, some pre-emptive lobbying is under way. The NBTA, for example, is
anxious to secure some fiscal breaks. It recommends reducing the domestic
ticket tax from 10 to 8 per cent, claiming that this would encourage an
additional 6.5m passengers annually, creating 7,500 jobs and profits of
Dollars 300m.
It also suggests that passengers should be taxed according to actual usage -
that is that taxes should be imposed on a cost-per-mile basis, at 5-6 cents
per mile. This would also benefit the business traveller.
A more fundamental question is whether the commission recommends some form
of 're-regulation' of domestic fares, and how this might help or hinder the
business traveller. The airlines are generally opposed to any capping or
even underpinning of fare levels by a federal body; they remember the
bureaucracy and inefficiencies which existed prior to deregulation of the
domestic fare environment in 1978, and are not anxious to return to this
situation.
The business travel lobby is inclined to support this position. The NBTA,
for example, acknowledges that some financial stability in the industry
might be a good thing, but is equally aware that deregulation has pushed
down fare levels for business as well as leisure travellers.
Finally, there is little sign that service levels have altered significantly
over the past 12 months. Despite the efforts of some carriers to justify
their higher fares by boasting about seat comfort, food service and so on,
most passengers are probably more conscious of the shrinking size of meal
portions.
According to Department of Transportation figures, punctual arrivals and the
reliability of baggage handling have generally improved - although the
statistics themselves have been subject to criticism in the past.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (13): Signs of an upturn
detected - Charter sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's air charter business, battered and bruised by the recession, has
emerged a fitter sector after months of falling demand and increasingly
cut-throat competition.
The cost has been high: the business is littered with the wreckage of
charter companies that failed to generate enough income from hiring-out
aircraft to cover growing maintenance and operating costs. But those who
survived are beginning to see signs of an upturn as fresh demand begins to
percolate through the market.
The new business is not the result of cash-strapped companies deciding they
can afford to charter again. It reflects moves by companies which once owned
aircraft to dispose of their fast-depreciating assets and hire private jets
instead.
BP and Smith Kline Beecham are among companies that have recently sold
corporate aircraft. They have opted to charter aircraft rather than pay
several thousand pounds a year to keep in a hangar aircraft they used only
occasionally.
BP, which until last year owned three jets worth more than Pounds 40m, said:
'We got rid of the jets and are using charters where necessary. We decided
we could not justify having our own fleet; they were just too expensive and
it was not economic.'
All this is good news for companies with aircraft of the range and speed to
meet the long-haul requirements of multinational companies. According to Air
London International, UK-based brokers for executive aircraft, there is
steady demand for jets capable of intercontinental flights. It predicts
growth this year of 15 per cent.
Mr David Savile, Air London's operations director, foresees particular
growth in executive trips to the CIS, where Aeroflot's erratic timetable
does not lend itself to the itineraries of businessmen hoping to invest in
the former Soviet Union.
'It's an operator's dream because there's no practical alternative. No-one
would opt for an internal flight with Aeroflot,' he says. 'We're seeing
substantial growth in that market. Three years ago the only place we could
fly to was Moscow but now we can go almost anywhere.'
His assessment is echoed at Air Hanson, the subsidiary of the UK
conglomerate, which has seen increased demand in the former communist bloc.
Ms Brenda McCune, operations manager at Air Hanson, says: 'There is a
definite upturn in fixed wing activity into eastern Europe, largely as the
result of more airfields becoming accessible.'
Although demand is picking up for charters to outlying destinations such as
Tbilisi or Tashkent, the trickle-down effect from big companies selling
aircraft and entering the charter market has not yet reached the smaller
operators.
Such operators are dependent on medium-size companies which in the past
chartered private aircraft but are now booking senior managers on commercial
flights. This cost-cutting has had a direct knock-on effect on air charter
companies operating short-range turboprops.
These operators, often the first call for companies seeking an alternative
to airlines, have seen profit margins squeezed and business dry up. Several
small operators, such as Rogers Aviation at Luton and Skyline Aviation at
Southend, have not survived. Others are diversifying into maintenance and
aircraft sales to stay in business.
One of the survivors, RM Aviation, has concentrated on other sources of
income, such as developing aircraft equipment and in-flight computer
software, to offset the charter downturn.
Mr Peter Roberts, RM's managing director at Leavesden Airport, north of
London, admits: 'We haven't had an easy time and I wouldn't be surprised if
more companies folded.
'Unless you diversify in this business you are very vulnerable. Companies
that are just into chartering could suffer badly because there's a price war
looming, with some operators flying aircraft at below cost just to get the
business.'
Among its five aircraft, RM operates a turboprop owned by Rothmans
International which it also charters to Whitbreads, the brewers, and Argyll
Group.
The company is benefiting from a new market trend imported from the US. This
involves a company which owns its own aircraft giving a charter operator a
management contract and permission to dry lease it to other users.
RM Aviation operates an aircraft owned by Rothmans International, the
tobacco company, which it also charters to Whitbreads and Argyll.
In the US the system, pioneered by Ohio-based Executive Jet Aviation, is
seen as the next development in air charters. Under the scheme, the charter
company buys an aircraft and then sells a share to one of its clients.
Executive Jet, for example, will sell a 12.5 per cent share in a Cessna
Citation for Dollars 315,000. The client is guaranteed access to any of the
jets managed by the company without incurring crew or maintenance costs.
Since 1988, more than 50 companies have joined the so-called Netjets
programme, generating Dollars 25m dollars in revenue.
Few British charter companies, however, are thought to have the financial
muscle required to start such a scheme. And Mr Savile at Air London warns
that until there is a sustained recovery most operators will continue to
struggle.
'Margins are very tight and prices have not increased at all,' he adds.
The pressure on operators has been further increased by the lack of landing
and take-off slots at Britain's most popular hubs: London Heathrow and
Gatwick. This has prompted operators to move their business aviation
facilities to alternative sites such as Stansted and the City Airport in
London's Docklands.
More than 50 executive aircraft are now based at Stansted, where Esso has
redeveloped the old passenger terminal as a business aviation centre. But
the recession has led to a 5 per cent decline in executive charter
passengers at Stansted, while expansion at London City remains restricted by
limitations on night flying and aircraft movements.
The growing number of airports offering business aviation facilities - in a
sector where operators are chasing demand and fuel prices are falling -
means the executive charter business has become a buyers' market. Clients
can pick and choose from a glut of available aircraft which operators are
anxious to get in the air; some companies are offering attractive
charter-lease schemes; and there are more take-off points and destinations.
'Operators will be under pressure to cut prices further and although the
recession may be ending in the wider economy, it will take some time for
this market to feel the benefit,' says Ms Ingrid von Hentschel industry
analyst at Beeson Gregory.
Ms von Hentschel, predicting only a small increase in demand at the top of
the market, warns: 'The conditions remain for more companies to go out of
business. The casualty list is going to be a long one.'

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (12): No-frills, anti-glamour
ethic seems to prevail - Commuter and executive aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALONG with elegant offices, there is perhaps no other greater sign of
corporate prestige and well-being than private aircraft.
In addition to conferring status, they absolve senior managers from the
time-consuming procedures of commercial air travel, they can deliver
managers more rapidly and closer to their destinations and allow them to
make multiple stops in a day and still be home for dinner.
Glitz aside, these advantages tend to add up to greater managerial
productivity and efficiency. Yet, while such corporate goals might be highly
desirable, over the past several years companies in straightened
circumstances or faced with difficult economies have been unwilling to make
the extra investment in private aircraft.
Moreover, in the 1990s, a no-frills, anti-glamour ethic seems to prevail. At
Beech Aircraft, the market leader in turboprops, for example, officials say
they've recently seen companies turn in their higher-priced fan jets (also
more costly to operate) for cheaper and more work-a-day turboprops.
'It looks more prudent to the stockholders,' said Mr Michael Potts,
spokesman for Beechcraft.
This kind of thinking in corporate boardrooms has led Cessna, owned by
Textron and the leading jet maker (with about 60 per cent of the market), to
make a cheaper aircraft, the CitationJet.
At just Dollars 2.7m - the bottom of this jet line's price range - it aims
to reach down into the turboprop market, says Mr Philip Michel, Cessna's
director of marketing. 'They can get the advantage of a jet without the big
price tag,' he said.
Choosing the right aircraft depends on a company's needs and its budget. For
trips of 200-400 miles a turboprop - which travels more slowly than a fan
jet - is probably adequate. Turboprop prices can start at less than Dollars
250,000. Beech, however, does manufacture a turboprop for the image
conscious. The Starship, made of composite material and brandishing a price
tag of about Dollars 4.9m, is the top of the line.
Jets are usually preferred for trips of 600 miles or more. Business jets
come in three classes, light, mid-size and large, according to speed,
comfort, size, avionics and price.
Light jets are the most popular selections but the mid-size market seems to
be growing. In January, Lear Jet delivered the first five of its new Dollars
8.3m mid-size model, and Cessna is developing a mid-size Citation X, which
will sell for about Dollars 14m.
For large business jets, Gulfstream Aerospace leads the category with its
Gulfstream IV, which can take a dozen passengers comfortably across the
Atlantic. It sold 25 last year, at an average cost of about Dollars 21.5m.
The selection of a helicopter rather than a fixed-wing aircraft tends to be
dictated by the availability of heliports. In New York, where rooftops can
serve as landing pads, helicopter use - especially for flights to airports -
is fairly common. But in many other locations heliports are scarce.
Mr Frank Jensen, president of the Helicopter Association International, says
that helicopters suffer because they are perceived as 'a convenience tool of
the rich and famous.' Mr Donald Trump, the 1980s real estate magnate, no
doubt contributed to this image problem. He flies a 44-passenger Boeing
'Chinook.'
Nonetheless, helicopters are the only choice for some companies,
particularly those in oil and mining, which work in areas where landing a
fixed-wing aircraft is impossible.
Business aircraft manufacturers say their sales generally reflect the ebbs
and flows of the world economy. Total worldwide shipments of 46 US
manufacturers fell 5.8 per cent last year compared to 1991.
But in the US, where the economy is picking up steam, sales are starting to
revive.
Mr Bill Robinson at Lear Jet said: 'We took 32 new orders in December and
January and we haven't had two months like that in a long time.' Although
Lear Jet is based in Wichita, Kansas, it is owned by Bombardier of Canada.
The uptick in American sales is also being prompted in part by anticipation
that the new Clinton Administration will reinstitute an investment tax
credit. If an ITC goes through, the General Aviation Manufacturers
Association, the industry lobby group in Washington, believes its members
will see a further jump in sales. Meanwhile, it is fighting hard to make
sure that the ITC does not somehow exclude aircraft.
By contrast, in Europe where recessionary gloom is colouring corporate
outlooks, sales have been drooping. The sales figures from Cessna tell some
of this story.
Since 1988, Cessna's balance between US domestic sales and those overseas
has been moving from its traditional 70 per cent-30 per cent split to closer
to 50-50. But in 1992, the division swung back to 66 per cent domestic and
34 per cent foreign.
While leading business aircraft companies such as Cessna and Beech say the
European market has considerable potential, they do not believe that their
level of penetration there will ever reach that of the US. In the total of
the world's business aircraft fleet, Europe only accounted for some 13.4 per
cent last year while the US claimed 65.8 per cent.
A key factor limiting the business aircraft market in Europe is that Europe
is a smaller land mass. Also, its biggest commercial centres are already
well served by commercial carriers. European company headquarters are also
more often located in leading business centres than in the US, where
increasingly companies are choosing semi-rural sites.
The liveliest foreign markets for aircraft, say manufacturers, are now in
the newly industrialising countries. The countries of the Pacific Rim and
Latin America, once largely buyers of used aircraft, are now purchasing new
private aircraft. Mexico is mentioned as an especially dynamic market.
There is some speculation, too, that eastern Europe, underserved by
commercial airlines, may become a good market.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (11): Claims and
counter-claims - Luxury at 40,000 feet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHY MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a curious irony that airlines are waging some of the industry's most
intense competitive hostilities over cabin hospitality for the relatively
small pool of business travellers in these days of global recession.
It is a rivalry over inches of in-flight leg room and video channel
selections as well as the squashiness of chairs.
The elusive corporate cash has reduced airlines to making claims and
counter-claims about who introduced which feature first as they compete to
seat board members.
Mr Mike Batt, British Airways' newly-appointed marketing director, claims to
have started the trend for airlines to focus less on first class and more on
improved business class.
He says: 'In 1988 we were the first to re-launch our long-haul business
class as a 'diluted' first class.'
BA spent about Pounds 25m on its ClubWorld in 1987: 'Before that it was a
sort of beefed-up economy class. There has been a step-change in quality.'
He says the improvements have increased revenue and the number of
passengers: 'In the first year, revenue went up about 24 per cent.'
BA's move forced all other airlines to match the new standard and more than
20 airlines were forced into re-launching their business air travel
services, Mr Batt says.
Today, BA is in the throws of a further Pounds 100m re-vamp spanning all its
premium brands which it styles as a big assault on the world's business air
travel markets. Much of the new service was launched on April 1, with the
remainder coming into cabins from April 15:
'In 1988 we thought the seat was great; fours years later we realised it
doesn't really suit people over six feet one inch. Also, the cradle for the
head could have been softer and the foam on the base of the seat seemed a
little too hard,' Mr Batt says.
BA is also introducing between six and eight new video channels - beaming
out an estimated 60 hours of programming on a loop which will bring the
executive everything from BBC documentaries to Hollywood films.
Aside from the comfort required by harassed executives who need to be fresh
for their foreign business affairs, Mr Batt believes that business air
travel facilities offer clients the reliability they need:
'We maintain back-up aircraft in case a plane goes down on us. You can't
just say to the business traveller 'Sorry, the plane's sick, you can't go to
New York today.' '
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airlines takes an equal pride in
pandering to the tastes of those able to pay more for their tickets, in
spite of his egalitarian, balloon-and-sandals public image.
A straight comparison between Virgin's Upper Class and BA's Club World is
not appropriate because, like several other airlines, Virgin today offers a
cheaper version of first class while BA and others have stayed closer to
their executive class services.
Coincidentally, however, Virgin also plans to make an announcement about
improvements to services in the next couple of months, timed to coincide
with the addition of new aircraft to the fleet.
'We were the first to introduce seat-back TVs in all the cabins of the
aircraft and we will shortly be offering up to 14 video channels and 12
audio channels,' the company says.
It plans to offer 'interactive systems' which will allow customers, for
example, to book hotels at 40,000 feet presumably while watching TV from
their reclining seats.
Virgin says it is the market leader in seat space: 'We offer 55 inches in
Upper Class which Continental have just copied from us. In terms of
MidClass, we re-designed a business-class seat to give the most comfortable
economy seat with 38 inches of leg room.'
Virgin appears to have a particular concern for its clients' looks. It
provides a care-pack of cosmetics including a facial spray, moisturiser, a
toothbrush and a comb.
The airline offers business travellers the services of an in-flight beauty
therapist who can provide manicures, facials as well as neck and scalp
massage, on selected flights.
The company says it aims to help the business traveller forget about flying:
'It is tiny touches like offering travellers a choc-ice during the films,
and complimentary drinks throughout the flight, which are designed to hide
the fact that they are airborne.'
Virgin believes that ultimately it is the flexibility of service that
attracts business traveller to its cabins: 'Businessmen need that
flexibility. They need to know that if they don't show up they have not lost
their ticket.'
Continental Airlines, USAir and SAS Scandinavian have improved their
long-haul business class to a standard similar to the first-class services
they have abandoned, according to a recent survey of 12 airlines' business
travel services conducted by Executive Travel Magazine.
Last year, Continental launched its BusinessFirst service which does indeed
match Virgin's 55 inches, but both have been outdone by Sabena's
announcement of plans for a luxurious 62-inch stretch across the Atlantic.
BusinessFirst tactfully offers 'extra wide', electronically-adjustable,
sleeper seats (which cost Pounds 5,000 apiece), with six-channel videos
built into the armrests. One programme, called 'Air Show' is a map showing
where the aircraft is at any given point.
Continental's pitch is explicitly about comfort rather than the ease of
in-flight working. Services such as faxes, computers and telephones, for
example, have been ignored on the basis that passengers prefer to leave work
behind.
At the time of the launch, Mr Robert Ferguson, the airline's chief
executive, said the new service would 'deliver far more value for the
traveller's money.'
The push that many airlines have made to improve in-flight entertainment has
been marred by their poor performance, which Executive Travel puts down to a
misguided attempt to install new technology in old cabins. Emirates is the
exception in this.
The success of these Disneyesque efforts to conjure a wonderful world which
will lead executives to one airline's seats rather than another's is
difficult to gauge. Research commissioned by Mintel the research group from
Oliver &amp; Company, however, last year concluded that no single factor
influenced choice of airline.
One 35-year-old resource director who makes more than 15 air trips a year
said: 'I wouldn't go with a Mickey Mouse airline but in terms of reliability
and scheduling, I think so much is in the hands of the air traffic
controllers rather than the airline that whether you fly Lufthansa, KLM, or
BA makes absolutely no difference to whether you are actually going to get
off the ground on time.'

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (10): Is there room for plane
and train? - The Channel Tunnel Challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The journey between London and Paris must rank as one of the most
frustrating in the world.
In terms of distance, the two capitals are separated by just 300 miles - a
trip of perhaps three hours by conventional train or nearer two by France's
Train a Grande Vitesse. But the irritating intervention of a strip of water
called the Channel stretches the train-and-ferry journey to a marathon seven
or eight hours.
Not surprisingly, business people travelling between the two capitals choose
air transport every time. But this could change. Business people are about
to discover a new way of travelling between London and Paris (or Brussels)
called Eurostar - the brand name of the international express train service
due to start running through the Channel tunnel in June next year.
Eurostar has the potential to bring drastic changes to the cross-Channel
travel market. Its attractions are clear: instead of having to make the
journey out to an airport, allowing an hour for checking in, undertaking the
air journey and transferring from the airport to the city at the other end,
people will be able to travel directly from city centre to city centre in a
single leap by Eurostar.
The trains themselves - 31 of them - have been specially designed for
international services. Each will have a power car at each end and 18
carriages in between, producing an overall length of a quarter of a mile.
Ten carriages will be first class, with seats for 210 passengers; six will
be second class, with seats for 584 passengers; and two will be bar-buffet
vehicles.
In the second-class area, seats will be mainly airline-style, facing in the
same direction, although some will face each other across tables. Food will
be available from the buffet, and a trolley service will serve snacks.
Multilingual personnel on board will offer information and help.
Clearly the first-class accommodation will be the main focus of competition
for the business travel market. Here, Eurostar will offer what it calls
'high quality service in a relaxed and sophisticated ambience'. Seating will
be spacious, with three reclining seats across the width of the carriage.
There will be a choice between seats facing each other across a table and
seats facing the same direction. Hot meals will be served to passengers at
their seats.
Rail travel therefore looks likely to be highly competitive with airlines in
terms of space and comfort. It will also be competing on price, although
both sides are keeping their pricing strategies under wraps. But what about
speed and frequency?
If, as planned, the services start in June 1994, the initial timetable is
expected to offer one train an hour each way between London and Paris.
Services will run between Waterloo Station in London and Gare du Nord in
Paris, with some trains stopping at Ashford on the British side of the
tunnel and at Frethun (near Calais) or Lille on the French side.
The trains, modelled on the French TGV, will be fast: they will travel at
speeds of up to 300kph (186mph) on the high-speed TGV Nord line between
Paris and Frethun.
On the British side of the tunnel, however, they will be unable to get up to
anything like their top speed because they will have to use the existing
tracks between London and the coast, sharing them with Network SouthEast
commuter trains. The result is that the total journey time for non-stop
trains will be three hours.
Eventually, this should change. Britain says it plans to build a new 140mph
railway between London and the coast to take the Eurostar trains and some
fast commuter trains. Still to be determined is how the line will be funded
or when it will be built, but the British government is hoping it will be
ready to open by around the turn of the century. If and when it does, a
London-Paris non-stop journey will take 2hrs 27mins.
Even at the slower speed, however, it can be seen that the train service
will be very competitive with air travel on city centre to city centre
journeys. A typical weekday trip by air from London to Paris might consist
of an hour's journey from London to Heathrow airport, an hour's wait at the
airport, an hour on the aircraft, and an hour to get into Paris at the other
end: four hours in total. The train will also enable people to work or relax
without interruption from one end of the journey to the other.
On the face of it, then, Eurostar would seem set for easy victory in the
London-Paris market.
But it would be a mistake to write off the airlines too soon. Mr Richard
Hannah, transport analyst at UBS, points out that people's decisions about
whether to use train or aircraft on a journey from London to Paris will
depend very much on where their journey starts from.
'Clearly the train is quicker from city centre to city centre, but in real
life that's not necessarily where people's journeys begin and end,' Mr
Hannah says.
'If everyone started their journeys from Trafalgar Square, for example, then
the train would be quicker. But if you are a businessman setting off in the
morning from your home in the Surrey or Hertfordshire commuter belt, the
idea of travelling into London to take the train might be less attractive
than driving to Gatwick or Heathrow airport.'
In other words, there will be room for both the train and the plane after
the tunnel opens. Inevitably, though, the airlines will suffer a sharp
diminution in their market. If they have not been complaining too loudly,
then Mr Ian Wild, transport analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, says it is
not altogether surprising: profits on short-haul European services are
notoriously so small that most airlines would be only too glad of the
opportunity to reallocate aircraft and slots to more lucrative routes.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (9): Stay in touch from almost
anywhere - Office in the sky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rapid advance of silicon technology over the past decade has enabled the
travelling businessman to stay in touch with the office from almost anywhere
on the globe.
Over the past decade the advent of high-powered lightweight notebook
computers in particular has made portable computing a real option. By using
a modem, the user can remotely send and retrieve information from virtually
anywhere there is a telephone line.
Today there is nothing surprising in the sight of a business executive
struggling with a shoulder bag bursting at the seams with electronic
gadgetry or opening a briefcase to reveal the latest in slimline notebook
computers - and perhaps even a portable printer or fax machine.
Soon, a new generation of pocket-sized machines called personal digital
assistants will add a further dimension to the concept of the mobile office
by combining the functions of a pen-based computer system and a mobile
telecommunications device.
Voice and data communications services are becoming more international. For
example since last September it has been possible to contact business
travellers in five European countries - Germany, France, Italy Switzerland
and the UK - by pager using the Euromessage service provided by Hutchison
Paging.
Similarly, the introduction of digital cellular telephone services across
Europe based on the pan-European GSM standard means that travellers will
soon be able to use their mobile phone or even more conveniently, their GSM
smartcard, anywhere in Europe.
These terrestrial telecommunications developments are being mirrored by the
introduction of new systems and services in the air. On many airlines,
particularly in North America, the business air traveller will soon be
offered all the voice and data telecommunications available in the office
from the comfort of his airline seat.
These new digital telecommunications services range from high quality voice
telephony to facsimile and computer data links, together with a wide range
of entertainment and information services.
A basic air-to-ground public telephone service based on VHF radio has been
available to passengers on many US carriers' domestic flights since the
mid-1980s. The first passenger telephone call from an airliner was made in
October 1984 on an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Chicago using the
Airfone service.
Until the beginning of last month, more than 26m calls had been made using
the GTE Airfone system which is now installed in almost 2,000 jets operated
by 11 US airlines. Most of the systems are seat-based, although a few of the
earlier installations feature cordless bulkhead-mounted equipment.
But despite the popularity of these services, which cost about Dollars 2 a
minute for a domestic call, the technology behind them has some serious
limitations.
In particular, because it is based on older analogue radio
telecommunications technology - like most terrestrial cellular telephone
systems - call quality is not always what it should be. And because it
relies upon the signal being passed from one ground station to the next,
calls are sometimes dropped.
In addition, the equipment on the aircraft is limited in its range to the
line-of-sight between the aircraft and the nearest ground station - a
maximum of about 200 miles. This means the service is limited to flights
above continental America and up to about 200 miles out to sea.
Most of these problems are being addressed by the introduction of new
air-to-ground systems based on digital technology, and by satellite
communications. Digital systems not only provide much clearer call quality,
they also enable a wide range of value-added services to be offered.
In the US, In-Flight Phone, an Illinois-based company, was the first to
develop a digital communications system for aircraft passengers. Its
Flight-Link system is based on 50 US ground stations and was developed over
three years at a cost of Dollars 65m. Last month, following operational
trials, USAir decided to install it in up to 402 of its aircraft by the end
of 1994.
In addition to air-to-ground, ground-to-air, air-to-air and seat-to-seat
calling, the in-seat system can also provide a wide range of other services
including facsimile and computer data transmission, computer video games,
news and stock quotes and mail-order services. Credit cards are used to pay
for all the services.
FlightLink is being evaluated by a number of other US airlines and several
in the Middle East. Meanwhile, GTE Airfone will introduce its own digital
system, called GenStar, in mid-year. Like FlightLink it will also provide a
host of new services including fax services and personal computer
connections. GTE plans to have all existing Airfone installations converted
to GenStar equipment by mid 1996.
Meanwhile, Claircom Communications, formed in 1990 as a joint venture
partnership between McCaw Cellular Communications and General Motor's Hughes
Network Systems, has launched a service aimed at providing digital
telecommunications systems for corporate jets as well as the commercial
market. The company launched its AirOne system in 1992, with orders from
Alaska, Southwest and Northwest to equip a total of 550 aircraft.
All three US digital service providers are also linking up their systems
with emerging satellite-based digital telecommunications systems to provide
worldwide access. They will be compatible with the planned European
terrestrial flight telephone system (TFTS).
Unlike the competing US systems the TFTS will be a single system, initially
covering all of western Europe. Competing service providers will use the
same network of ground stations which will be operated by the national
telecommunications organisations.
However, delays in its construction have hampered the growth of passenger
aircraft telecommunications in Europe. Indeed there is some doubt about
whether such a system is needed at all.
Although air-to-ground telephone systems will probably continue to provide
the lowest-cost services and are most suited to short-haul flights, their
limited coverage means that digital satellite-based service providers - such
as the Skyphone consortium comprising British Telecom, Norwegian Telecom and
Singapore Telecom - also have a key role to play, particularly for long-haul
operators.
The Skyphone consortium developed the first satellite-based passenger
telephone service using International Maritime Satellite Organisation
(Inmarsat) satellites in 1990.
Singapore Airlines was the first commercial carrier to use Skyphone and is
installing the service on all its long-haul fleet. According to Mr Graham
Lamble, manager for Skyphone marketing support at BT, the Skyphone service
is available on more than 100 aircraft today, most of them business jets.
Skyphone provides both voice and data telecommunications and is due to add a
facsimile facility in the near future.
Another significant trend is that passenger telecommunications systems are
being integrated with the increasingly sophisticated in-flight entertainment
systems which most airlines are installing in their business and first-class
cabins.
But not all carriers believe that their customers want office-style
telecommunications facilities at their airline seats. Some carriers,
particularly those in Europe and many in east Asia, believe that their
business customers would rather relax than work during flights. In research
conducted by several airlines including Virgin, Cathay Pacific and British
Airways, passengers put business services near the bottom of their list of
priorities.
BA conducted detailed interviews with 80 frequent business fliers 18 months
ago and discovered that its passengers most wanted to use the time to relax
before their next appointment. The passengers also emphasised that they
wanted to manage their own time and be treated like individuals 'rather than
pin-striped businessmen.'
'They do not want the seat turned into an office,' said Mr David Charlton,
group brand manager for BA's long-haul fleet.
Accordingly BA is trying to turn their seats into 'their favourite armchair
in the sky.' Based on the research and trials, BA is still considering
whether to install passenger telephones in business and first-class cabins
for occasional use.
Instead, it is emphasising passenger well-being and comfort by installing
new Club World seats and a state-of-the-art eight-channel seat-back video
system providing passengers with an unrivalled choice of viewing
entertainment.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (8): Focus is on a second
generation - Supersonic travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
By the end of the 1990s, Concorde will have been carrying commercial
passengers at supersonic speeds for almost a quarter of a century, having
entered commercial service in 1976.
Normally 25 years is about the maximum life-span for an airliner, but
Concorde's relatively low annual utilisation rate, compared to subsonic
jets, and its intensive maintenance schedule mean it will probably be able
to continue flying well into the next century.
Nevertheless, Concorde was designed in the 1960s and inevitably even its
most ardent admireres are beginning to ask what comes next.
There is already much interest in the world airline and aerospace industry
in the development of a second-generation supersonic airliner - or High
Speed Commercial Transport - to replace Concorde.
It is unlikely, however, that any HSCT could emerge before the year 2005 at
the earliest. Before any successor to Concorde could be built, key
technological, environmental and commercial economics issues must be
addressed.
The HSCT would be expensive to build - some estimates have suggested it
could cost Dollars 15bn or more to develop - and it is likely to face even
more severe environmental restrictions than Concorde in terms of noise
levels and pollution.
No single company can afford that sort of money - particularly with other
large subsonic aircraft studies such as the 800-seat Ultra-High Capacity
Aircraft under way.
A single US-led international effort to share the research and development
costs of the HSCT probably stands the best chance of success, but
multinational consortia are notoriously difficult to assemble and manage.
Nevertheless, an informal start has already been made.
The leading airframe manufacturers in the US (Boeing and McDonnell Douglas),
western Europe (Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace) and
in Russia and Japan have been working on many aspects of the HSCT for some
time, together with the engine manufacturers.
Among the issues, noise will be especially critical. The HSCT's engines will
need to be much quieter than those of Concorde in order to use existing
airports and meet international aircraft noise regulations which have been
progressively toughened in recent years.
The engines will also have to be much more efficient, in order to save fuel
and keep down operating costs while also reducing, if not eliminating,
pollutant emissions, especially nitrous oxides in the upper atmosphere.
This may mean turning to new forms of engine, perhaps using combined-cycle
turbofan-ramjet technology which is being studied in Japan and elsewhere.
The aircraft will also need to make considerable use of low-weight, high
temperature-resistant materials, such as ceramics and new composites capable
of coping with the extremely high temperatures that will be generated both
inside the engines and on the aircraft skin during the longer periods of
sustained and faster supersonic cruise that Concorde is called upon to
perform.
But although there are still many unresolved technical and other problems,
the aerospace industry's general view appears to be that none of these are
insurmountable.
Probably the most critical factor in the final decision on whether to go
ahead with an HSCT is the likely market for supersonic travel.
Although Concorde has been operated profitably by British Airways and Air
France since the mid-1980s, no provision has been made for depreciation
costs on an aircraft that cost Pounds 1.2bn to develop.
With its payload of only 100 seats, Concord may be an engineering triumph,
but its premium fares have always limited its market appeal.
To be commercially viable, the industry believes that the next generation of
supersonic airliners will probably have to be much bigger than Concorde, fly
slightly faster and have a significantly longer range.
The HSCT probably needs to seat 250 to 300 people in several classes, cruise
at around Mach 2.4 (1,500mph) compared to Concorde's Mach 2, and have a
range in excess of 5,000 miles compared to Concorde's 3,500 miles.
The range is critical because it would open up new high-density routes such
as the trans-Pacific routes from America's west coast to Asia.
For example, the Los Angeles to Tokyo route could be flown non-stop in about
4.3 hours, instead of today's subsonic 10.3 hours.
However research suggests that most passengers are willing to pay only a
relatively modest 'supersonic premium' of 10-20 per cent over subsonic
fares.
There are strikingly different estimates of the potential market size for a
new HSCT. The most optimistic suggest that demand in the first quarter of
the next century could reach as many as 1,000 new supersonic aircraft, worth
some Dollars 200bn-Dollars 300bn.
However, more conservative estimates suggest that if such an aircraft could
be built at an economic cost the market might run to several hundred
aircraft at most.
While small in comparison with many subsonic jets built over the past 40
years, that would still make it exceptionally successful compared with the
total of 16 Concordes that originally entered service with BA and Air France
 -reduced to 13 in use today by the need for spares.
The requirement for a 'spares pool' serves as a reminder of Concorde's
creeping middle age.
Perhaps the real challenge for the manufacturers and the airlines will be to
keep Concorde flying until a second-generation supersonic airliner is ready
to replace it.
Last year, BA's seven Concordes completed 250,000 commercial supersonic
flying hours - more than the combined air forces of the west since the
introduction of supersonic combat aircraft.
In some areas the strain is beginning to show. Last year, BA began even more
frequent checks following a series of incidents since 1989 in which parts of
Concorde's rudder fell off during supersonic flight.
None of the incidents represented a serious risk to the aircraft, but they
were an embarrasment. Subsequently, BA asked British Aerospace, responsible
for the original rudder design, to manufacture a new series of rudders for
its Concordes for a total cost of about Pounds 5m.
Each Concorde is at present cleared by the UK and French airworthiness
authorities to fly a total of about 7,000 supersonic flights.
BA's fleet of Concordes has already completed more than 4,000 flights and is
expected to reach its current operational limit by 1998-99.
The airline operators, the airframe manufacturers (BAe and Aerospatiale) and
the engine suppliers (Rolls-Royce and Snecma), have been working to try to
extend Concorde's life into the next century. The airlines in particular
hope to stretch the life of Concorde until 2010.
In the meantime, BA's Concorde fleet is being given an interior facelift.
Eight years after the last refurbishment Concord is getting improved seats -
with a folding central arm rest - new decor and galleys.
The 1980s provided Concorde with a significant boost as captains of industry
and finance, pop stars and sports personalities climbed aboard to cross the
Atlantic in style and on time rather than worry about the cost.
Inevitably, the recession and the cost-consciousness of the 1990s has forced
some companies to reconsider the expense of flying senior executives by
Concorde. But Concorde still attracts its regular fliers.
Mr W. D. (Jack) Lowe, BA's director of flight crew for Concorde, says the
airline remains 'very happy' with the Concorde operation and is confident
that the service will continue well into the next century. He says the
transatlantic flights are currently achieving an average load factor of 60
to 70 per cent.
Apart from regular transatlantic services, BA has run scheduled winter
flights to Barbados for the past four years which Mr Lowe says 'are busier
than ever,' and both BA and Air France have also developed successful
charter businesses for their supersonic jet.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (6): Fierce battle for hearts
and wallets - Ground Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE desperation of airlines to lure back the lucrative business traveller
can be reflected in one simple statistic: in the past two years, carriers
worldwide have managed to lose every penny of profit made since the Second
World War - an estimated total of about Pounds 7bn.
It is against that background - and the knowledge that business class
provides about 50 per cent of profits while taking just 20 per cent of the
space - that airlines have been waging a fierce battle for the hearts and
wallets of the executive traveller.
That war has so far been fought largely in the air, with airlines offering
roomy sleeper seats, televisions and 'haute cuisine' en route to tempt the
more discerning traveller.
However, the battlefield of the 1990s is almost certain to be on the ground.
Increasingly carriers are focusing on the pre- and post-flight needs of the
business traveller.
Mr Colin Ellson, deputy editor of Executive Travel, the magazine which
caters for business passengers, describes it as the 'total journey concept'.
In a survey recently published by Executive Travel, airlines are judged on
many factors, including how completely they have adopted the philosophy.
It would appear that many carriers are going to great lengths to take the
hassles out of a business journey as early as possible. This has
traditionally meant limousine or helicopter transfers from home, or between
airports, with airlines such as Quantas, Cathay Pacific, Virgin Atlantic and
Continental all offering at least the chauffeur option.
Such luxury is viable, however, for only the smaller airlines. It would be
too expensive for the larger carriers which have more daily flights.
The larger airlines have begun to hit back with their own weapons. British
Airways, for example, is investing Pounds 30m in its Airport 95 programme,
in addition to a Pounds 100m investment in brands. The concept, to build
customer loyalty 'by creating a distinctive personal and enabling experience
that is reliable, seamless and hassle-free', hangs on the conviction that
passengers want a real change to their experiences on the ground.
There are plans are to relieve clients of their baggage as early as possible
 -at hotel and underground check-ins, for example - and deliver it to the
business passenger's final destination. The carrier is also trialling a
mobile check-in service carried out by attendants with portable computers,
which is expected to reduce queues. BA has also introduced Time Saver, a
self-service ticketing and check-in facility for those who want the quickest
route through airport red tape.
BA already has a fast-track service for executive passengers at Gatwick,
which gives them priority for security, immigration and customs. The airline
plans to introduce this at other airports soon.
The terminals have become the most important areas of competition, with
millions being spent on offering business travellers facilities they never
even knew they wanted.
Virgin has led the field with its Pounds 1m lounge at Heathrow, opened just
two months ago. 'We decided to turn the convention on its head,' said a
Virgin spokesman referring to the unusual nature of the lounge. The opulent
facility at Terminal Three, for Virgin's Upper Class passengers, has seven
different areas to cater for whatever mood they are in.
This includes a model railway bar where the train delivers the drinks, a
panelled library with 5,000 books - although users would have to be
speed-readers since the books may not be taken away - and a darkened games
room with the latest in computer entertainment.
Other facilities include an observation deck, a sound-proofed music room and
a bathroom where travellers can soak to the sound of singing whales.
BA also has its own new state-of-the-art lounge facility, opened last month,
at Terminal Four. The facility has been described by BA officials as more
like a hotel lobby than existing airport lounges. 'People can use the
lounges as an extension of their travel,' says Mr Dave Bevan, senior manager
of BA's service delivery systems. 'If they arrive early at a destination,
they can now go to the lounge, shower, change and then go on, fresh for
their meeting.'
Many other airlines, such as United and British Midland, have invested in
their own lounge facilities.
Yet the airlines are not the only ones which feel the pressure to fight for
executive business. Aware that the carriers will be looking for more space
for these customers, the airports have met the challenge with enthusiasm.
At Heathrow, for example, BAA is investing Pounds 12m in adding 90,000 sq ft
of private lounge space in Terminal Three for first-class and business-class
customers. Airlines intending to take up the new space include American,
Cathay Pacific, Korean, Malaysia, All Nippon, Air Canada, SAS, Singapore,
Thai, JAL, Kuwait, Quantas, and a range of other smaller carriers.
Gatwick is also investing Pounds 3m in facilities dedicated to the business
traveller, to be completed this spring. It will include access to showers,
laundry and breakfast. The lounge is being developed in conjunction with a
Pounds 12m investment in Gatwick's North Terminal.
Eventually, however, the war will have to move from behind the velvet
curtains of increasingly plush lounges and out into the open. Possibilities
being mooted include ground-to-air communication, or even
aircraft-to-aircraft, links. Virgin is already investigating options for
'interacting' with services on the ground, or vice versa.
Whatever the airlines dream up next will prove of little use, however,
unless companies allow their executives that extra perk of flying business
class. According to a recent Mori poll, half the executives questioned had
downgraded their class of air travel and more than a third were making fewer
trips. Until that changes, the whales in Virgin's lounge may find they are
singing to thin audiences.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (7): Conquering the world -
Frequent Flyer Programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PASSENGERS like them. Airlines do not, but embrace them anyway. Frequent
Flyer Programmes (FFPs) have spread from their humble beginnings in the US
to conquer the world, despite the misgivings of industry executives who
thought that giving away seats might be bad for business.
Invented more than a decade ago in the US, they were designed to to create
and maintain customer loyalty. The idea was for regular passengers to
accumulate points which could eventually be exchanged for free flights.
The cost of an FFP to the airlines, that of filling seats that would
otherwise be empty, was marginal.
Their success was staggering: American Airlines, which started its scheme in
1981, now has about 20m members.
In recent months, some of the last pockets of resistance to this marketing
tidal wave have surrendered. The likes of Air France and Lot Polish Airlines
have joined in, Japan Air Lines has extended its FFP to Europeans, and
British Airways this month opens its scheme to residents of Australasia, the
Americas and South Africa.
FFPs are now the airline industry's most tried and tested marketing tool. US
members of FFPs have already earned more than 600bn miles' worth of free
travel, according to one industry estimate, enough to fill more than 500,000
transatlantic Boeing 747 flights.
Yet this very success brings problems. US airline executives acknowledge
that accounting standards bodies are asking whether the financial liability
tied up in seats owed should be included in company accounts. 'One of the
big concerns is this contingent liability,' concedes Mr Richard Mound, head
of relationship marketing at British Airways.
Tax authorities, too, are looking at the value of the giveaways for both the
airlines and their customers. The power of FFPs to attract members would be
hit if passengers were taxed on the value of private flights they earned
through company travel.
Perhaps worst of all for the airlines is the clear risk that they will be
forced to turn away fare-paying passengers to meet their obligations to
travellers redeeming frequent flyer points.
Airline executives are reluctant to concede publicly this danger to their
revenues. However, some have already blamed low yields - low turnover per
seat - on FFP members exercising their rights to free seats.
Their concerns can be inferred from the structure of recently-launched FFPs.
Lufthansa, the German carrier, is typical in stipulating a two-year time
limit to control the flow of free seats.
Passengers are also being dissuaded by a variety of means from cashing in
their points for free flights. 'It would be highly desirable from our
perspective if customers used their points to buy upgrades rather than free
tickets,' says Mr Chris Gilbert, UK sales manager of American Airlines.
The strategy seems to be working, according to Mr David Perkins, managing
director of Carlson Marketing which operates several FFPs for airline
customers. 'Almost half air miles points are now being used for upgrades,'
he says.
Some airlines offer rewards completely unrelated to air travel. KLM, the
Dutch carrier, for example, offers two-day music master classes in Vienna
and cordon bleu cookery classes.
The search is also on to extract more value from the huge amount of
information available from FFP databases.
While airline tickets are anonymous, FFP databases allow airlines to find
out who their passengers are and what are their patterns of travel. They can
then use direct mail to send sales and marketing information to particular
groups of customers.
Airlines can also identify their best customers and tailor services to them.
Many of British Airways' top 1,000 customers, who are estimated to spend on
average Pounds 50,000 a year on air travel, now hold a BA Premier Card. This
unpublicised card earmarks a group that BA consults directly about the
services it offers.
Smaller airlines can in principle make equally good use of such information
but suffer from having a much smaller database to play with. Cross-airline
allegiances are one solution: Virgin and British Midland share an FFP in the
UK, while Singapore Air Lines, Swissair and Delta of the US have linked
their FFPs across their respective continents.
Cross-company links are being used by airlines big and small to extend the
scope of their FFPs and with it their attractiveness to passengers. Car
rental companies and hotel chains are among those to share FFPs and award
schemes with airlines. Avis, for example, has agreements with 11 airlines
ranging from Iberia, the Spanish national carrier, to Manx Airlines, a small
UK regional carrier.
Even Asia may eventually succumb. After years of decrying the idea, Cathay
and Singapore are opening up their FFPs for Asian residents on intra-Asia
flights for the first time.
Airline executives are reluctant conquerors of the world with their
double-edged marketing sword. Many hope that when all airlines have FFPs,
their usefulness to distinguish one airline from another will diminish.
They may have the help of the tax authorities, if the frequent flyer
benefits become taxable. And companies, too, may press for better deals on
fares and forego their frequent flyer points.
But until then, the continuing advance of the frequent flyer programme seems
inevitable.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (5): Manufacturers have forged
ahead - Wide-bodied aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deep recession in the civil aircraft industry has not modified the
longer-term expectations of the big three manufacturers - Boeing, Airbus and
McDonnell Douglas - for continued growth in air travel and demand for new
commercial jets.
Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of airliners, is now forecasting
new aircraft deliveries totalling more than 12,000 jets valued at Dollars
815bn over the next 18 years. The European Airbus consortium estimates
demand for 13,500 aircraft over the next 20 years, while McDonnell Douglas
is forecasting a total requirement for 14,000 new jets during the same
period.
All three manufacturers also expect bigger wide-body aircraft to take an
increasingly large share of total deliveries over the next 10 to 20 years.
In its latest study of the market, Boeing says larger aircraft will account
for 58 per cent of all seats delivered between now and 2010, and that the
average size of airliners will grow from 176 seats in 1980 and 193 seats in
1992 to about 227 seats by 2010.
This trend towards larger wide-body airliners is essentially driven by two
factors: long-range, non-stop travel is expanding while on shorter routes
big aircraft are seen as a way of beating congestion at busy airports.
Although the turmoil in the industry has forced manufacturers to cut
production following a wave of order cancellations and deferrals from
financially hard-pressed airline customers, all three big manufacturers have
forged ahead with development of new, large wide-bodies.
The Airbus A340 entered service with Lufthansa and Air France this year.
This four-engine wide-body boasts the longest range of any civil aircraft;
it is capable of flying non-stop with a full load for 16 hours or more. The
aircraft, which is also extremely quiet, has been designed for very long
routes such as London-Johannesburg or Paris-Singapore. Airbus will also
start delivering to customers later this year the first A330s, the
twin-engine sister of the A340.
Boeing, which has dominated up to now the long-haul wide-body market with
its 747 jumbo, is in advanced development of the 777, a new family of
twin-engine wide-body airliners with versions for medium-range flights and
others for long routes.
McDonnell Douglas is competing against both Boeing and Airbus in this market
with its MD11 three-engine jet. It has plans to stretch this and also
develop a new, bigger, four-engine jumbo, the MD12. However, these plans
hinge on the Long Beach, California, group being able to complete the
restructuring of its commercial aircraft activities and find new
international partners to invest in these operations and help fund the
costly and risky development of a new large aircraft.
The Russian aircraft industry, long present in the very large jet segment of
the market, is also vying for a slice of the new wide-body business by
attempting to forge alliances with western partners to develop new aircraft
for both the Commonwealth of Independent States as well as other world
markets. The first concrete example is the new Ilyushin 96M four-engine
wide-body with seating capacity for 386 passengers.
The aircraft, which will compete against the A340 and the 777, made its
maiden flight at the end of March. It is the product of close co-operation
between the Russian industry and US manufacturers. Ilyushin's main partners
on this ambitious project are Pratt &amp; Whitney, the US aero-engine group
providing the power plant for the new aircraft, and Rockwell-Collins which
is supplying the avionic equipment and systems.
But perhaps the most significant development of the past few months is an
agreement between Boeing and the four Airbus partners (Aerospatiale of
France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace, and Casa of Spain) to study
jointly the development of an extra-large aircraft, or super-jumbo, capable
of seating between 550 and 800 passengers.
This unusual collaboration between traditionally fierce competitors reflects
a general feeling among manufacturers that the development of a super-jumbo,
whose cost aerospace industry analysts estimate at more than Dollars 10bn,
can only be viable through the broadest of international partnerships.
Indeed, other manufacturers could ultimately join the Boeing venture with
the Airbus partners, including McDonnell Douglas and the Russians.
The industry believes there will be demand for a super-jumbo by the turn of
the century. Airbus says that the development of an ultra large-capacity
aircraft is the 'next big challenge' facing the commercial aerospace
industry. But it also agrees with Boeing that there is unlikely to be room
for more than one project.
Several airlines have already shown interest in such an aircraft, especially
in the Asia-Pacific region which is expected to continue showing
above-average air travel growth during the next 10 years. British Airways,
which is also interested in the super-jumbo concept, has already done some
studies on the configuration of a very large aircraft and the new facilities
it could bring to travellers - including lounges and exercise rooms - to
make long-distance flying more enjoyable.
At Long Beach, McDonnell Douglas has a mock-up of its MD12 super-jumbo
concept. On the top deck, it has fitted a small gymnasium as well as a
business centre where passengers could send faxes and use computer
facilities while flying on very long routes.
But apart from the huge cost of building such an aircraft, the development
of a new generation of super-jumbos will also require significant new
airport infrastructure to accommodate these jets at airport gates. Airports
will also have to adapt their facilities to cope with much greater flows of
passengers disembarking or boarding such aircraft.
With congestion becoming an acute problem at a growing number of large
international airports, demand for wide-body aircraft is expected to
increase over the next few years. In the shorter term, this demand will be
met by the new big twin-engine aircraft such as the Boeing 777 or the Airbus
A330 now in advanced stages of development. In the longer term, the
super-jumbo could become a familiar sight at leading airports.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (4): Busiest long-haul
business corridor - The North Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The north Atlantic air travel market has become like the gladiatorial
contests in the Roman colosseum with protagonists prepared to slug it out in
a grand setting. For the gladiators, the prize was freedom. For the
airlines, it is profitability.
The north Atlantic divides the two greatest economic entities on earth. It
is not surprising, therefore, that the roads of European and US commerce
lead there: it is the busiest long-haul business air traffic corridor in the
world.
Governments take a close interest in the rules of the game. Heavily
loss-making airlines in the US and Europe are pressing their political
leaders to renegotiate bilateral deals with foreign countries to improve
their competitive positions. The deals are now likely to be renegotiated,
setting a new framework for transatlantic air travel for the next few years.
The most important changes are in prospect on the link between the UK and
north America. Britain is easily the most important gateway between the two
continents, accounting for about one third of traffic. At peak times, 100
flights a day on 12 airlines link the two.
The competition is healthy enough for the passengers. But the airlines lurch
from one price war to another and this spring saw them once more
leapfrogging each other downwards in the price of economy class tickets.
If you had the flexibility to conform to strict timings and had a voucher
given out by a large UK supermarket chain, you could buy a return ticket
from London to New York for Pounds 169.
Price has also become a factor in business class and first class. By
scanning newspaper small advertisements this month, you could pick up a
business class return to New York for less than Pounds 1,000 on Kuwait
Airlines, compared with the Pounds 2,100 officially charged by the likes of
British Airways or its two main US rivals, United Airlines and American
Airlines.
That level of discounting hurts, but it is more than just the slack demand
and low fares that upsets the airlines. For years, the US and UK carriers
have felt that the bilateral arrangements between the two countries favoured
the other side's carriers. BA has said that it is at a disadvantage because
it is not allowed to carry passengers beyond the first airport at which it
lands in the US. Its US rivals, by contrast, have first call on anyone who
wants to fly onwards within the US.
US carriers argued that BA had too strong a grip on the landing rights at
Europe's most important gateway, London's Heathrow airport. Good slots mean
frequent departures at convenient times, factors that are high up the list
of priorities for the business traveller.
The bilateral debate came to a head in the last year when BA signed a deal
to give it a large stake in USAir, a carrier which has a large domestic US
network.
Although the stake did not give BA direct control of USAir, it promised to
provide it with the opportunity to feed passengers into USAir's domestic
network. The big US carriers objected to the deal on the grounds that it met
BA's concerns without addressing theirs. The US government agreed and BA was
forced to take a smaller stake in USAir with some aspects of the deal given
only one year's approval. Mr Federico Pena, the new US transportation
secretary, said he wanted to use the revised BA-USAir deal as a vehicle to
rewrite the bilateral agreement.
Although talks, due to start early next month, are unlikely to reach a
conclusion until next year, both governments in principle want further
liberalisation. In an extreme case, this could mean abandoning the notion of
airline nationality altogether. Today, UK and US airlines have about half
the market each, which is the aim of existing rules. Under complete
liberalisation, such targets would be dropped. Governments would not concern
themselves with the market share of nations, only the market shares of
airlines, to maintain a competitive market.
BA would view such a move sympathetically, perhaps because it is the most
profitable airline in the western hemisphere. Its strength might help it win
a greater share of the business.
But governments in the rest of Europe are unlikely to want greater
liberalisation for their own links to the US. The French government has
called for a renegotiation of its US bilateral to cap the US market share at
60 per cent.
Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman of Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, has called
on the German government to cancel its air transport agreement with the US.
He says that cancelling the aviation deal will clear the ground for a fresh,
more even-handed agreement than the one which has limited German airlines'
access to a dozen US destinations. These developments irk US airlines. 'The
majority of European carriers are being propped up (by their governments) in
one way or another', says Mr David Coltman, vice-president of US carrier
United Airlines' Atlantic division.
But they will have a tough fight on their hands to persuade Germany and
France to allow more competition across the north Atlantic.
They may use free market arguments to suggest that business travellers in
France and Germany will suffer. If the rules on flights to the US are
tightened, then competition will be limited and fares could rise. By
contrast, if the UK-US bilateral is further liberalised, then the
competitive pressure on prices should at least be maintained.
One consequence could be that more passengers from continental Europe will
consider flying to the US through the UK. This is not only to save money.
Further liberalisation of the UK bilateral should bring more frequent
flights to more US destinations, while European deregulation should allow
more flights from more European cities to come to the UK.
The consequence of changes mooted in bilateral regulations should be that
the UK will remain the foremost staging post on the north Atlantic route,
and possibly the cheapest from which to fly.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (3): Market expected to grow
6% - East Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASIA, as one of the most promising growth markets for the international
airline industry, has attracted a host of airlines from east and west, all
vying to claim their share of the pie.
While other markets for air travel have been depressed amid slow economic
activity in leading industrialised countries, the Asian market is expected
to grow by about 6 per cent, according to some industry estimates.
Air travel in the Asia Pacific region will grow to 40 per cent of
international air traffic by the end of the century, compared with 31 per
cent today, Singapore Airlines reportedly forecasts.
Against this background, airlines are competing to expand their share of
market demand while several countries are stepping up investment in airports
to ensure that a proportion of the greater flow of air traffic comes their
way.
Japan Air Lines, for example, is increasing flights to China, a
predominantly business market which it expects to be the largest growth area
in the region. The Japanese airline is also looking to the resumption of air
travel between Japan and Vietnam for the first time since the Vietnam War.
The two countries are in negotiations to discuss specific routes, JAL says.
The Japanese government also announced recently that it would hold civil
aviation talks with Brunei with a view to starting a regular air route.
At the same time, there is increasing traffic between regional cities in
Japan and other parts of Asia. JAL expects to see more flights to south-east
Asia from regional cities such as Kagoshima and Fukuoka on the southern
island of Kyushu.
Meanwhile, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea are busy building new airports
to meet the challenge of what is expected to be growing competition for
business and tourism air travel in the region.
With a number of competing facilities coming on stream later in the decade,
Japanese airlines are worried that unless timely progress is made in the
extension of Narita Airport and the construction of the New Kansai
International Airport, Japan's share of traffic in the region could be
diverted to Korea.
The competition is all the more intense because lower corporate profits have
meant a decline in more profitable first-class and business travel.
At JAL, the overall volume of traffic has increased but yields have fallen
as a result of business travellers switching to economy class. Last year,
the carrier saw business travel fall by 16 per cent while first-class travel
fell by 18 per cent.
However, while undue competition and excess capacity are real dangers, the
most tangled issue facing the airline business in Asia today is that of
'beyond rights' claimed by the US. The issue of beyond rights stems from
bilateral air agreements formed between the US and individual countries in
Asia several decades ago.
Under those accords, a certain number of US airlines are granted the right
to fly to specific destinations in the countries concerned and from there to
a third destination.
A number of Asian countries, including Japan, contest that the US is abusing
its beyond rights by taking traffic away from local carriers which should
have first priority over routes connecting their home market to foreign
destinations.
Thailand, for example, abrogated its bilateral aviation accord with the US
in 1990 while the US and Hong Kong have also been in disagreement over
beyond rights.
Japan has warned the US that it cannot accept the use of beyond rights in a
way which threatens the business of the carriers of the countries concerned.
Japan has refused to grant United Airlines permission to fly between Tokyo
and Sydney on the grounds that United will be taking business away from
Japanese and Australian airlines.
Although the Japanese authorities have allowed Northwest Airlines to fly a
New York-Osaka-Sydney route, they have done so on condition that the number
of passengers boarding at Osaka be restricted to less than 50 per cent.
The Australian government is also upset at US attempts to capture some of
the market for travel between Japan and Australia, and has told Northwest
that only two of its three Osaka-Sydney flights could carry passengers
boarding at Osaka.
The US side takes the position that since it has been granted the right in
aviation accords signed by each side to extend a US-Japan route to a third
destination, it should be able to exercise that right in full. Any attempt
to restrict that right is a unilateral violation of the accord, the US
believes and US aviation authorities have gone as far as to threaten
immediate sanctions against Japanese airlines.
However, in this particular case Japan refused to bow to US pressure. US
claims to beyond rights are based on an outdated agreement which does not
reflect the current reality, Japanese officials say.
What is particularly annoying to Japanese carriers is the fact that the US
is flexing its muscles over beyond rights in the region at a time when US
passenger traffic to south-east Asia has declined dramatically.
In 1990, for example, 5 per cent of visitors to Thailand were American
compared with 41 per cent in 1965, according to the Teiki Koku Kyokai, an
industry association.
Japan has so far allowed Northwest to continue flying its New
York-Osaka-Sydney route in spite of the fact that about 70 per cent of
passengers on the Osaka-Sydney leg board the aircraft in Osaka, supporting
Japanese claims that the US airline is taking away business from Japanese
and Australian airlines.
If the situation does not improve it is quite likely that Japan will
withdraw Northwest's right to fly that route and tensions between the two
sides could flare up.
Whatever happens, one certainty is that competition for the Asian air travel
market is bound to increase as new facilities come on stream.
The opening of the Kansai International Airport in the summer of 1994 will
give foreign airlines a greater number of landing slots than ever.
Seoul's Kimpo Airport, which the Koreans would like to see becoming Asia's
hub, is scheduled to open in 1998 with one runway and will eventually expand
to four runways.
As capacity increases, and competition sharpens, there is a danger that
airlines could be drawn into a costly price war.
Such a scenario may be of short-term benefit to travellers but will severely
undermine the health of an industry which is already seeing a growing number
of casualties in the economic downturn.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (2): New competitive forces at
work - Western Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liberalisation of the European air transport market, coupled with the
continuing impact of the general economic slowdown, has had significant
repercussions on Europe's airline industry this year.
The deregulation of air fares on January 1 has already sparked a price war
in Europe. Lufthansa of Germany was the first to take advantage of the new
liberal regime in Europe, cutting fares from Germany and the UK. It has been
followed by other airlines which have also extended the cuts to business
class in an effort to attract higher-yielding customers.
British Midland, the second-tier UK carrier, introduced a new business fares
policy with price cuts of 30 per cent on its routes from London to other
European cities. Price cuts followed at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Aer
Lingus.
Sabena of Belgium launched a season ticket for regular business travellers
on its services from the UK to Brussels while Swissair last month
inaugurated its new business class cabin with bigger and more comfortable
seats. Air France is offering reductions on its European business class
while British Airways is promoting its new European services from London's
Gatwick airport following its acquisition of Dan-Air last year.
As Sir Michael Bishop, the chairman of British Midland, recently put it:
'Battle has at last been joined on Europe's busiest air routes'.
Under the EC's third and most radical phase of liberalisation of European
air travel, airlines are now free to set their fares according to their own
commercial judgment rather than by regulators. Although there are still some
transitional restrictions for cabotage or services operated by an airline
from one country in a different state, EC-licenced carriers are free to fly
on virtually any route in the Community.
'With the introduction of the third package, I believe what has happened is
nothing short of a revolution, albeit a relatively peaceful one,' says Mr
John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary. Until the advent of
liberalisation, Mr MacGregor says European air services had been carved up
between national flag carriers and competition was 'simply not on the
agenda'.
But in introducing more competition in Europe, the EC has been anxious to
avoid the experience of 12 years of deregulation in the US which has seen
the industry consolidated around a handful of large carriers. 'In our
efforts to free up the market, larger airlines must not be allowed to abuse
their privileged position and the interests of smaller airlines must be
safeguarded,' insists Mr MacGregor.
The UK is particularly concerned that the new single EC aviation market will
be distorted by governments continuing to support financially their
respective national flag carriers. 'Cash injections made to state-owned
airlines on terms not available in the private sector risk placing private
sector airlines at a distinct competitive disadvantage,' Mr MacGregor
argues. The UK also believes the existing EC guidelines to evaluate state
aid to airlines are outdated and need to be reinforced.
Another significant problem threatening to undermine competition is the
question of providing smaller airlines and new entrants with adequate access
at busy airports. This issue has become acute because European air travel
continues to be plagued by congestion both in the sky and on the ground at
some large airports such as London Heathrow or Frankfurt.
One solution to these problems is the modernisation and harmonisation of
Europe's inadequate air traffic control systems as well as the construction
of new airport terminals and runways. But efforts to improve air traffic
control and provide more ground infrastructure have been handicapped by
frustratingly long lead times.
The construction of a fifth terminal at Heathrow, for example, is expected
to take at least 10 years from the planning application, which was filed
this year, to completion. In the meantime, new airlines are scrambling to
gain take-off and landing slots at Heathrow while the established carriers
at the airport are jealously guarding their positions.
The EC has introduced fresh regulations to ensure that new entrants are
given the opportunity to operate services out of congested airports. The
system is based on giving them priority on new slots when these become
available. However, smaller airlines have continued to complain that access
at busy airports will remain a problem so long as established carriers
through their so-called 'grandfather rights' are entitled to claim
automatically the same slots from one season to another.
'Aviation's most common competition killer is historical precedence,' says
Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic. 'The rule makers ensure
their own failure by continuing to tolerate the allocation of scarce
resources on the basis of who had them first: that guarantees that nothing
can change,' he says. Mr Branson, whose airline has specialised on long-haul
services, says he would be interested in operating short-haul European
services if he could secure the necessary, competitive slots at Heathrow.
The new competitive forces now at work in the European airline industry are
putting increasing pressure on smaller airlines and accelerating the growing
trend of consolidation in the industry.
The big European carriers have already been positioning themselves in what
they regard is rapidly becoming a global airline market by acquiring stakes
and forging alliances and partnerships with other international carriers. BA
has bought minority stakes in USAir and Qantas as well as stakes in small
European airlines to strengthen its presence in the EC market. Apart from
absorbing Air Inter, the domestic French carrier, and UTA, the French
independent long-haul carrier, Air France has acquired stakes in Sabena of
Belgium and CSA of Czechoslovakia.
Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and
Austrian Airlines are in the throes of partnership negotiations which could
eventually lead to a merger to form a 'fourth force' in Europe to compete
against BA, Air France and Lufthansa of Germany, Europe's big three
airlines. Meanwhile, Alitalia has acquired a stake in Malev, the Hungarian
carrier, while Iberia is building up its links with Latin American carriers.
Smaller carriers continue to see opportunities to operate in niche markets
alongside the big airlines. But they are increasingly likely to be pushed
into partnership with one of the bigger groups to survive in the longer
term. Despite all the EC's efforts to encourage the development of smaller
airlines and new entrants, Mr Jan Carlzon, the chief executive of SAS,
believes that by the end of the decade the European industry will be
dominated by four or five large groups of airlines.

FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (1): A time for fresh ideas -
The airlines and their corporate clients both believe that the business
travel budget will be spent more carefully in the 1990s than in the
high-spending 1980s. They must either push for cheaper seats or implement a
more radical change

THE recession has splintered the conformist world of business air travel. It
has drained first-class and business-class cabins of serious fare-payers and
filled the seats with frequent flyer upgrades. Deprived of high-paying
passengers, the airline industry is losing money fast - Dollars 10bn in the
past three years.
At the same time, the tide of aviation deregulation has divided airline
executives over which strategy to adopt in order to return their business to
profit. Should they follow accepted wisdom learned during decades of growth
before the recession? Or has the world changed, demanding fresh thinking?
The debate is yet to be resolved, but at stake is a large chunk of more than
Dollars 150bn a year spent by Europe's businesses on travel and
entertainment.
Among the airlines, the protagonists fall into three camps.
There are the traditionalists such as British Airways, American Airlines and
Swissair. They continue to raise standards, even though this means
maintaining high prices and perhaps frightening off cash-strapped customers.
The logic is simple. Regular surveys of business passengers' preferences by
the International Air Transport Association (Iata) show that seat size is
the top priority. This year's survey, just published, says that more than 88
per cent of travellers in business and first class rated the size of their
seat as their 'preferred aspect of business-class travel'. They ranked
physical discomfort as by far the worst aspect of long-haul travel.
Knowing what their customers wanted, airlines have charged an ever-widening
premium for the privilege of space. Even after two years of recession, a
first-class return between London and New York on British Airways costs
Pounds 3,870; business class costs about Pounds 2,100. By contrast, the Apex
economy fare is Pounds 399 and in this spring's price war a ticket can be
had for Pounds 259.
Even on short-haul routes, some airlines consider they can sell higher-price
tickets on the basis of providing more leg-room. Swissair is building
separate business-class cabins for short-haul services and charging
appropriately for the privilege of sitting there. On most short-haul
flights, business-class passengers sit in the same size of seats as
economy-class passengers. Their ticket buys a faster check-in, bigger
baggage allowance and slightly better food.
The traditional airlines strive to maintain their premium prices for
heavily-advertised products. But they are occasionally forced to follow the
moves of the second group of airlines, the old-style entrepreneurs such as
British Midland and KLM, the Dutch carrier. Old-style entrepreneurs want to
sell on price competition, even though this puts at risk the perceived
quality of their product and hurts revenues per seat. It is a high-risk
strategy, however.
Several old-style entrepreneurs have in the past few weeks launched products
aimed at the budget-conscious business traveller. On short-haul routes in
Europe, for example, British Midland, in which Scandinavian Airline System
(SAS) has a 40 per cent stake, cut many of its fares. It was followed
rapidly by KLM, the Dutch flag carrier, Aer Lingus, the Irish state airline
and Air France, normally one of the traditionalists. Finally, this month BA
cut its fares to match its rivals.
These cuts come on top of the general price lowering effect of old-style
entrepreneurs. On London-Frankfurt routes there are just two traditionalists
flying, BA and Lufthansa, and both charge more than Pounds 350 for a
standard business-class return. The return business-class fare for the
slightly shorter London-Amsterdam route, on which four airlines including
British Midland an KLM compete, is Pounds 218.
Long-haul has seen price cuts, too. Singapore Airlines and Qantas have been
battling it out on routes between Europe and south-east Asia. The price of a
London to Singapore business-class return ticket fell this winter from
Pounds 2,200 to about Pounds 1,500.
Finally, the third group of airlines is the radical entrepreneurs such as UK
carrier Virgin Atlantic Airways and Continental of the US. In the battle
against the high-investing big guns, they are prepared to abolish the
traditional class structure of aircraft and try to sell something entirely
new. These two carriers offer, for example, a combination of a first
class-size seats and business-class levels of service.
The strategy is not wholly new. Since 1984, Virgin has been selling its
Upper Class with first class-style sleeper seats at business-class prices.
Upper Class does not offer many of the luxuries, such as second helpings of
caviar or Krug champagne found on other carriers. Nevertheless, it has been
successful enough for Virgin to launch its Mid-Class service last summer
with business class-sized seats selling at the price of a standard economy
fare.
But Virgin is a relatively small airline. Rivals did not feel a need to
match it, until now. In January 1993, Continental, the US carrier which is
operating under the protection of Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy laws,
launched Business First. The strategy, like Virgin's, was to abandon
first-class fares. Continental's business-class fare-payers now get first
class-style sleeper seats and a crew-to-passenger ratio of 1:6, compared
with a typical 1:10 ratio on most north Atlantic business-class routes.
Why are there such diverse responses among the airlines to a simple fall in
demand?
One reason is that the phenomenon is new. Every year since the Second World
War until 1991, global air traffic grew. With the growth came a culture of
discounting to attract economy-class passengers and luxury at a price for
business and first class. As Air France puts it: 'the people at the front of
the plane paid for those at the back.'
As the flow of profits from the front has dried up, many big-name airlines
found it hard to run economy class for profit. Their losses have been
embarrassingly high, compared with the performance of some budget carriers
that have always run economy for profit. Two airlines that caught the
envious attention of their big brethren by making money from cheap seats are
Dallas-based Southwest Airlines and Corse Air in France.
Even the most traditional of airlines now admits that it may eventually have
to turn to radical solutions. They acknowledge that the high profit margin,
super-luxury product they have been offering may no longer be appropriate.
'Some airlines may follow Continental (and drop first class). Some seem to
be holding on for recovery but nevertheless concede that there is a chance
they will reduce the number of first class seats,' says Mr David Coltman,
vice-president of US carrier United Airlines' Atlantic division.
Some airlines want to keep a top price product but are repackaging luxury as
something more businesslike. Air France is one: 'In the past we have
marketed Concorde as lavish and unobtainable. We now want to market it as a
business tool, perhaps as a westbound flight combined with an overnight
return in first class,' says the airline.
Air France's desire to make Concorde more accessible is clear in its fare
structure: its Concorde return trip from Paris to New York costs little more
than a first-class ticket - and is about Pounds 2,000 cheaper than BA's
Concorde flight from London.
A solution which can be more widely adopted is the running of classes as
separate profit centres. If this were to happen, the subsidy that
business-class passengers effectively paid to economy passengers should
shrink. Instead of lifestyle marketing, they could be on the receiving end
of more discounting and special offers.
Some travel agents are already preparing for such changes. Thomas Cook, for
example, this month launches itself as a cost-cutting agent for companies.
It will charge a fee based on the savings it makes for companies rather than
as a percentage commission on the price of the ticket from the airline.
The airlines recognise this heightened cash consciousness among their
business customers. 'Companies are now having to take a more disciplined
approach to spending,' says Mr Chris Gilbert, UK sales manager of American
Airlines.
Both the airlines and their corporate clients believe that the business
travel budget will be spent more carefully in the 1990s than in the
high-spending 1980s. They must choose whether to push for cheaper seats to
cut industry's costs, or to implement a more radical change away from air
travel as a luxurious experience to its use as part of a business, more like
the car or the computer.

FT  19 APR 93 / Monday Interview: Evangelist of good sense - Derek Keys,
South Africa's finance minister, talks to Patti Waldmeir and Philip Gawith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derek Keys, South Africa's finance minister, makes everything he says sound
both simple and obvious. In the mad world created by apartheid - where
concepts have been twisted and language deformed to fit the needs of an
impossible ideology - that is a considerable strength. In the 11 months
since becoming finance minister, Mr Keys has used it to advantage.
He has used common sense - the moral good sense of the Bible, from which he
quotes liberally, and the commercial acumen developed over 30 years as one
of South Africa's top businessmen - to induce sanity among the country's
fractious politicians. At a time last year when they had sunk to new depths
of squabbling, Mr Keys told them a few choice economic truths - that unless
they moved quickly, South Africa would not be worth fighting over; it would
become a wasteland of high unemployment and low growth, decaying industry
and departing skills. The politicians listened, and democracy talks began in
earnest. The message is reinforced, if anything, by last weekend's
assassination of African National Congress leader Chris Hani.
'I'm the minister of the bloody obvious,' he says. 'I see myself as someone
who jollies people along to do what common sense dictates they ought to do.'
He is someone (he does not say it) who has not only the clarity of vision to
see what needs to be done but the political skill to persuade the ANC, the
black trade unions, the business community and the cabinet that they saw it
first themselves.
He relies on candour, confidence and his commanding presence - critics call
it arrogance - to carry the day. When he speaks, people listen.
The message he delivers is a tough one: the economy must undergo radical
restructuring; government consumption spending must fall sharply to boost
critically low investment; civil service numbers and pay have to be cut
sharply; unions must agree a virtual wage freeze; interest rates must remain
high to tame inflation.
The first difficult steps have already been taken. Last month's budget
raised value-added tax by 4 percentage points to 14 per cent and cut
government current expenditure significantly in real terms, in an attempt to
wrestle down a budget deficit equal to nearly 9 per cent of gross domestic
product.
In his first budget, Mr Keys reduced the corporate tax rate from 48 to 40
per cent to boost investment - though much of it will be clawed back through
a new company tax on profits distributed to shareholders and the abolition
of other company tax breaks, making the effect more psychological than real.
That is scarcely surprising, for Mr Keys' campaign is overwhelmingly
psychological. Put simply, he aims to persuade South Africa to believe in
itself. Investors must believe in investing; bureaucrats must believe in
giving the civil service their best efforts by cutting waste and
inefficiency; the liberation movements must believe in the virtues of a free
market; the unions must believe they have a stake in growth; and all of them
must believe in Derek Keys.
So far, he can boast a surprising degree of credibility even in the most
radical circles. The ANC's economic policy chief, Mr Trevor Manuel, is known
to respect him, and Mr Jay Naidoo, militant general-secretary of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the largest union
federation, happily tolerates him, after viciously attacking his
predecessor.
Mr Keys repays the compliment. He often invites Cosatu to 'correct' his
economic plans, and says he thinks the behaviour of organised labour in the
tripartite economic negotiating body, the National Economic Forum (involving
business, unions and government), has been 'outstanding'.
Business is delighted to have a voice in Pretoria. (Mr Keys came to the job
from the post of executive chairman of Gencor, the country's second-largest
mining house.)
The technocrats of the Finance Ministry seem somewhat in awe of him. Never
before have they had a minister who had no desk. ('A desk is separation,
assertion of authority, subservience to constraints, secretiveness.') Or a
boss who throws away every report they give him. (Keys says he hates filing
and so reads and discards nearly every paper put before him.)
The Keys mystique has yet to impress taxpayers, however. They have already
felt the pain, and many doubt there is pleasure to follow.
Winning over the people will ultimately determine whether Mr Keys can
complete the difficult economic restructuring task he has set himself, at a
time of great political upheaval, and under a multi-racial power-sharing
government (due to be phased in from later this year) which could prove weak
and divisive.
'Government is in a typically feminine role,' he says, sheepishly
acknowledging that some might find the comment sexist. It is 'trying to
create a situation attractive enough to stimulate some initiative from
another party (the private investor). Once you commit yourself to relying on
the private sector because only it can produce the investment directions
with adequate yields, then you put yourself in this situation. How can I be
more attractive? That's the heart of the problem.'
Investors, both domestic and foreign, must start investing, growth must
resume (after four years of recession), jobless totals must drop (some 40
per cent of the labour force is without a formal job) or the Keys structural
adjustment programme is dead.
'The guide has to have some credibility,' the minister volunteers. 'I've
been in this job nearly a year and I don't have anything to show. If I'm in
this job for another year with nothing to show, what are the grounds for
confidence?'
His basis for optimism is, oddly for a businessman and government minister,
partly religious. Mr Keys consults the Living Light, a publication which
provides daily lessons from scripture, every night before retiring and upon
rising every morning. He acts according to its guidelines.
That, he says, is his recipe for health. 'When I was at Gencor I had to go
for the annual check-up and the doctor said to me: 'I'm impressed. How are
you handling this stress so well?' I said: 'It's my daily exercises.' He
said: 'Oh, what do you do?' I said: 'On my knees, twice a day.'.'
His faith in Mr F W de Klerk is also unshakeable. He describes the South
African president as 'a political genius'.
But his confidence in the entrepreneurial skills of the South African
businessman, white or black, is less strong. 'You once became an
industrialist (in the highly protected South African economy) by taking an
existing stream of products that came into the country, stopping it and
replacing it with a stream of your own. That doesn't require an enormous
amount of marketing sense,' he says. But the export-oriented growth areas
'that we now have to benefit from are totally dependent on marketing
sensitivity,' he points out.
'There are also community attitude problems. Who wants to be rich in a
community where wealth is a stigma,' he asks, noting that both the Calvinist
ethic of the Afrikaner and the communal ethic of Africans act against the
pursuit of wealth.
So how will South Africa prosper, in an atmosphere of low labour
productivity, social strain and potential economic conflict? 'The question
is not, can these people be like the Japanese,' he says somewhat irritably,
'but can they improve? And they can improve, and they are here and so are
we, so I think if I were to approach my job on the basis that I had to
produce Korea in three years, of course I'd be on the wrong tack. But you
say you have to produce something noticeably better in three years, then
we're away.'
In the end, Mr Keys says, it's all 'a function of hope and faith . . . You
don't stay in this business unless you believe in God'.

FT  19 APR 93 / The limits of voting reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eight referendums now under way in Italy, and the four scheduled for
next Sunday in Russia, are two very strange events, but they have one thing
in common: they are both taking place because the national system of
government is in crisis. Needless to say, these referendums cannot repair
the old system nor provide a new one. But with luck the voters may provide
some general sense of their preferences for the way ahead.
In Russia, even this modest hope may prove to be out of reach, so deep is
the disarray of the political system. President Yeltsin is hoping to
reassert his authority by asking the voters to declare their 'trust' in him.
But it is not clear what this question really means; even if the answer
should be 'Yes' by a large margin, this may not be enough to end the
paralysing stalemate between the president and the parliament.
The Italian referendums should have better prospects because Italy's
problems are much less serious. The political parties and their leaders are
horrendously corrupt; but the system itself is still essentially democratic,
and the machinery of the state is a long way from total breakdown. Italy's
magistrates have taken the first vital step in exposing the filth in the
Augean Stables; today Italy's voters will show whether they support a
far-reaching clean-up.
The principal indicator will be the verdict on electoral reform. The
question is disconcertingly modest: do the voters want to change the way the
Senate is elected, from proportional representation to a large dose of
majority voting?
On the face of it, this seems disarmingly irrelevant, in relation to the
political crisis, since real political power is held by the lower chamber,
not the Senate.
But the political symbolism will be clear to all: a vote against
proportional representation will be a vote against the whole of the
machinery which fostered the system of partitocrazia and all-pervasive
corruption. And the political establishment could not then avoid a parallel
reform in the voting system for the lower house as well. The question is:
what kind of voting system would bring the most beneficial reform?
At this point your liberal pluralist might seek to dissuade the Italians
from leaping from an Italian frying pan into a British fire. He would point
out that while Britain has had many decades of so-called strong government,
it has had almost no good government in living memory; the present phase
exemplifies the worst of all worlds.
Yet this is not the place to rehearse again the arguments on the theoretical
merits of different voting systems. On the contrary, any given voting system
is less important than the larger political equation; if radical political
reform is possible in Italy, it will not be determined solely or even mainly
by detailed voting rules.
Look, for example, at the French voting system, which is apparently among
those under discussion in Italy. For 25 years it has worked rather well,
with extended periods of stable government, with reasonable majorities, and
with alternations between left and right. But in last month's elections the
system blew a fuse, with a result which is so unbalanced, even by British
standards, that it may well contain the seeds of dangerous instability.
In the first round of voting, the conservatives got 39 per cent of the valid
votes cast, or 25 per cent of the electorate; but in the second round, after
elimination of the also-rans, they ended up with 78 per cent of the seats.
This must be an alarming result, even for the conservatives.
In principle they should rejoice at the decimation of the Socialist Party;
in practice, they know their real support in the country is less than in
1981, when it was the Socialists who won a landslide.
Moreover, they must be disturbed by one indicator of popular anger: the
number of spoiled ballot papers, which in most past elections has tended to
fluctuate between 300,000 and 600,000, but which soared last month to a
record 2.1m.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the very moderate new prime minister, has refused to
promise economic miracles, or even a change in the Socialists' conservative
economic policy. But an unreasonable majority will set up unreasonable
expectations, and the first expectation must be that this government will
bring faster growth and lower unemployment.
Unless policy changes, however, the chances are that unemployment will
continue to rise. With such a large majority to satisfy, and with
presidential elections looming two years from now, there must be a real
prospect that the populist tail will wag the conservative dog, if not in
parliament then on the streets.
As it is, the government's programme is already a mongrel mixture of
moderate conservatism and raw populism. The moderates get monetary
stability, fiscal rigour and European integration; the populists get threats
of protectionism in agriculture and other trade, and a law-and-order
campaign against drugs, delinquents and illegal immigrants which has already
resulted in several police shootings. This could be an explosive mixture.
What makes it explosive, however, is popular alienation from a traditional
political establishment which has failed to deliver France from the pain of
restructuring and unemployment.
This alienation shows up in protest votes, protest abstention, protest
spoiled ballot papers, and the desertion of the Socialist Party. Mr Balladur
is sitting on a crisis which is just waiting to explode; but this cannot be
blamed on a majority voting system which is unrepresentative.

FT  19 APR 93 / Revolutionary talk in Wisconsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a 1939 trade fair, a New York Times reporter dismissed the likely impact
of television, arguing that the average American family was too busy to sit
glued to a flickering screen. It was not an unusually poor judgment: myopia
is the occupational hazard of journalism which lives so completely in the
present that it is rarely able to comprehend the forces that are shaping the
future.
Trying to avoid this trap, I flew to chilly Wisconsin last week to attend a
conference on 21st-century infrastructure sponsored by the Diebold
Institute, a thinktank run by Mr John Diebold, a US management expert.
Appropriately enough it was held at Wingspread, a futuristic-looking house
built half a century ago by Frank Lloyd Wright, the American architect. The
building seemed to serve as a metaphor for the topic: the narrow, low-ceiled
wings representing particular aspects of information technology and the
soaring central dome the uplifting vision of 'information superhighways'
articulated by Mr Al Gore, the vice president.
Forty years ago, Mr Diebold coined the word 'automation'. He now believes a
new word, 'infostructure', is needed as a shorthand for the diverse bits of
hardware and software that will comprise tomorrow's information-based
infrastructure. Although keen on free enterprise, he is convinced that in
this sphere co-operation between the public and private sectors is
unavoidable; US and European experts were assembled at Wingspread to help
set an agenda for action.
Everybody came away with fresh insights. Americans discovered that the US is
lagging in some fields. The Netherlands, for example, is far ahead in
computerising medical records. Leading German companies, meanwhile, are on
the verge of introducing electronic traffic management systems, using
in-vehicle navigational aids linked to a central computer. US entrepreneurs,
by contrast, are lamely awaiting a lead from public agencies.
Europeans, on the other hand, were pleasantly surprised by what they saw as
a 'cultural shift' following President Clinton's election victory. None of
the US participants seemed remotely interested in the dogmatic free-market
ideology of the Reagan/Bush years. The issue was not whether government
should be involved in infostructure, but how and to what extent.
Special interest groups - such as computer companies - are doubtless talking
up information superhighways in the hope of winning big public subsidies.
Yet modern society probably is on the edge of an industrial upheaval
comparable with railways or electricity. In the next decade or so, the White
House expects every US business, government department, library, school and
home to be plugged into a high- speed, interactive communications network.
With high-capacity, fibre-optic cabling, a single terminal would serve as a
conduit for information of every description - words, music, colour images,
medical information, manufacturing blueprints and much more.
It is hard to exaggerate the impact of such a two-way universal network.
Much existing technology would be redundant, including separate televisions,
telephones, faxes and computers. Familiar services would probably vanish;
with everybody electronically connected, physical delivery of mail and
newspapers would become prohibitively expensive. Many of us would
'telecommute' from home rather than travel to a distant office, and do much
of our shopping and banking electronically.
Equally far-reaching change is likely in social services such as education
and medical care. With children (and adults) able to communicate
electronically with teachers and libraries from home terminals,
individualised home-based learning might eventually replace much
conventional schooling. People might also increasingly rely on
'tele-medicine': the first reaction to illness would be to seek advice from
an electronic medical databank; this could be followed, if necessary, with a
video-conference with a physician, to whom one could instantly transmit
one's medical record.
At Wingspread there was general agreement that government has to be heavily
involved in this industrial and social transformation. The presence of 'free
riders' (the fact that no single company or industry can capture all the
profits from information superhighways) justifies public subsidies for
research and development of the underlying hardware and for pilot projects
illustrating potential benefits in fields such as education, transport and
healthcare. The public sector should also provide a 'demand pull' by
subsidising the costs of connecting various bodies into a national
information grid. The scale of subsidies is debatable although nobody
blinked at the Dollars 1bn-plus (Pounds 600m) a year proposed by the Clinton
administration.
Subsidies are the easy part. The more difficult long-run challenge is to
establish a regulatory framework that encourages maximum competition between
potential providers of information services, while strengthening existing
privacy and freedom of information laws. At present the development of
markets worth a big chunk of US national income is hampered by anachronistic
laws, such as those that prevent local telephone companies challenging cable
TV monopolies. It is this regulatory tangle, as much as lack of capital,
that is cramping the development of Mr Gore's information superhighways and
the marvels that will flow from them.

FT  19 APR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Awaiting M3 data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET'S focus will be on events in Germany this week, and in particular
on this Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting, writes James Blitz.
This week's meeting is the first for three weeks, and there was speculation
brewing last week that the Bundesbank would introduce another cut in
official rates.
Underlining the importance of the council is the fact that the figures for
M3 monetary supply in March are also due out this week - and this data may
move the Bundesbank in the direction of easing policy again.
The February figure for M3 growth was some 0.1 per cent below the
Bundesbank's target base, compared to an annualised target range of +4.5 per
cent to +6.5 per cent.
Another low figure for M3 could give council members an excuse to cut either
the Lombard or discount rates.
If the Bundesbank leaves policy unchanged, the French franc should be
unaffected. The French currency is now trading as comfortably as it has at
any time this year in the exchange rate mechanism.
Instead, tight German monetary policy might have a depressive effect on the
Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo both of which have come under
selling pressure recently in the ERM.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, did not help the cause of
either the peseta or the escudo last week by saying that weak ERM currencies
would have to be devalued if high interest rates failed to underpin them.
The dollar's exchange rate should also be sensitive to the Bundesbank's
decision. The US currency has lost ground against the D-Mark in recent weeks
because many dealers believe that the differential between short term US and
German rates - which is a little below 5 percentage points  - is unlikely to
narrow in the near future.

FT  19 APR 93 / Economics: Signals may point to UK recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARCH unemployment figures will be the main focus of attention in the UK
this week. Economists are waiting to see whether February's surprise 22,000
drop in the jobless total heralded a turnaround in the employment picture.
Most believe it was erratic and that last month unemployment climbed again
by about 25,000.
Other UK figures this week may, however, add to the fairly convincing signs
of recovery in the economy. Retail sales are expected to be roughly flat,
month on month, but the annual rate of increase is forecast to rise to over
3 per cent. There is also a survey of the retail sector from the
Confederation of British Industry this week, and figures for bank and
building society lending.
The picture in Germany is likely to be less rosy with inflationary
indicators this week forecast to reflect the recessionary forces gripping
the west German real economy. Pay settlements in the 1993 pay round have
tended to run at about 3 per cent, there is virtually no producer price
inflation and money supply growth appears to be falling into its target
range.
Other economic highlights and figures this week follow. The figures in
brackets are the median of analysts' forecasts, provided by MMS
International, a financial information company.
Today: Switzerland, Monthly BIS meeting of G10 central bank governors;
Luxembourg, EC and EFTA finance ministers discuss initiatives to promote
economic growth; Denmark, March consumer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on
month, up 1.2 per cent on year); Sweden, March unemployment (7.5 per cent);
Canada, March department sales (down 2.5 per cent on year), February
manufacturing new orders (up 0.8 per cent on month), February manufacturing
shipments (up 0.9 per cent on month); Australia, February housing finance;
Japan, March money supply - M2 and CD (up 0.1 per cent on year), March broad
liquidity.
Tomorrow: UK, March Confederation of British Industry distributive trades
survey, March public sector borrowing requirement (Pounds 8bn); France,
February industrial production (down 0.2 per cent on month, down 4.3 per
cent on year); Sweden, March trade balance (SKr5.5bn surplus); US, March
housing starts (1.17m), March building permits; Canada, February building
permits (down 2 per cent on month).
Wednesday: Germany, Bundesbank monthly report for April released; US, March
Treasury budget (down Dollars 40bn); Canada, March CPI (up 0.4 per cent on
month, up 2.5 per cent on year), excluding food and energy (up 2.2 per cent
on year).
Thursday: Germany, French prime minister Balladur meets chancellor Kohl,
Bundesbank council meeting to include establishment of the 1992 Bundesbank
profit; UK, March unemployment (up 25,000), February average earnings (4.5
per cent), February unit wage costs (down 1.3 per cent in latest 3 months);
Sweden, government presents supplementary budget to parliament; US, sate
benefits week ended April 10, initial claims week ended April 17 (350,000),

FT  19 APR 93 / US Money and Credit: Calm returns as fears of reflation
dissipate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in US Treasury bonds have calmed down over the past 10 days.
Their exaggerated and mistaken fear of reflationary pressures - based on
scattered price statistics, overdone concern about the impact of the Clinton
administration's fiscal stimulus package and a belief the US economic
recovery was getting stronger - has dissipated.
As the inflation concerns have subsided, the market has entered another
rally cycle, although this is one in which price and yield movements occur
amid relatively thin and choppy trading volumes.
The market's fears of inflationary pressure have, among other things, been
assuaged by new consumer price statistics and the statement last week of
President Bill Clinton's willingness to cut by 25 per cent the size of his
proposed fiscal stimulus package.
It now seems inevitable that the size of the public spending package will be
substantially cut. The broader view of some economists - that the US
economy's recovery may be picking up but remains fragile - would explain why
the danger of reflation has been overdone.
A more considered analysis of the US economy suggests structural problems in
the financial services and manufacturing sectors are being addressed, but
slowly; that consumer confidence has by no means returned in any great
measure; that the US housing and commercial property markets remain weak and
bumpy; and that the US trade deficit cannot be easily vanquished in the near
term, and certainly not during a period of economic weakness in Japan and
protracted recession in Europe.
But the Treasury sector is a market which is almost always governed by
knee-jerk reactions.
On Friday, the price of the 30-year benchmark Treasury bond declined by
7/16 of a point, to yield 6.75 per cent, only slightly above the 6.71 per
cent level of Thursday, which was the lowest yield for the 30-year paper in
16 years. Although trading volume was reported to be thin, Friday's yield
was none the less 20 basis points lower than the previous week's level,
which was a substantial improvement for investors.
This week the menu of statistics to be digested by bond traders will include
tomorrow's figures on US housing starts in March; ; ; no great change is
expected from the previous month's 1.19m units.
Durable goods orders in March will be disclosed on Friday, and are expected
to be down by 1 per cent.
The outlook for a continuing bond market rally is enhanced by the prospect
of a further easing of monetary policy by Germany's Bundesbank, a move that
could come later this week.
Looking beyond this week it seems quite possible that yields in the longer
end of the US Treasury market will fluctuate between 6 per cent and 7 per
cent.
That would be the likely trend during a period of stop-go recovery, with
jobs data, inflation figures, consumer confidence and housing statistics
bouncing around between stasis and prospective growth.
Separately, last week's ruling by the US Financial Accounting Standards
Board that banks and insurers must mark-to-market their bond holdings - show
current market rather than book values each quarter - seems unlikely to pose
structural problems.
The changes could lead some insurers and banks to shorten the maturities in
their portfolio, and could even cause some to reduce the absolute quantities
of bonds held.
But the FASB rule is not likely to have a big impact on the overall Treasury
market; it is more of a challenge for accountants, company controllers and
preparers of balance sheets.

FT  19 APR 93 / Belgian Government Bonds: Investors sense stark sentiment
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time in years, uncertainty, scourge of the financial markets,
is stalking Belgian government bonds.
The change in sentiment is all the more striking because it followed a new
year surge of investment, encouraged by the authorities' informal commitment
to keep the franc close to the D-Mark. By January, the yield on the 10-year
Belgian benchmark bond had narrowed to 40 basis points over its German
equivalent, compared to a spread of more than 120 basis points last August.
But speculative challenges to the currency in February shook the Belgian
franc's reputation as a surrogate for the D-Mark. Then, at the end of last
month, Belgium's fragile centre-left coalition submitted its resignation
after failing to agree on how to curb the growing budget deficit.
In the event, it took only a week for Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime
minister, to forge a new agreement on austerity budget measures, aimed at
raising or saving some BFr113bn up to the end of next year. The Belgian
National Bank, keen to revive confidence, was able to drop interest rates
back to below pre-crisis levels.
But although the government has avoided elections and agreed an austerity
package, the bond market could take much longer to recover.
Belgium is a small country, often riven by disputes between Dutch-speaking
Flemings and French-speaking Walloons. In theory, its financial markets are
accustomed to political turmoil. What makes the latest crisis different is
that it has drawn investors' attention to worsening public finances, and has
raised questions about the federal future of the country.
Belgium's budget deficit last year rose to BFr485bn, or 6.9 per cent of
gross domestic product. Other economic indicators - such as inflation and
current account surplus - look healthy, but analysts expect total government
debt to increase by at least the same amount again this year.
Meanwhile, plans to devolve more powers to Belgium's regions have raised
fears that regional governments will allow debt to spiral out of control,
and increase the possibility of Belgium splitting into two or more feuding
regions.
In fact, the constitutional reform proposals which are passing through the
national parliament will hardly alter the central state's control over
public finances. But the effect on bond market sentiment has been dramatic.
The yield spread on the 10-year bond rose to 90 basis points over the German
10-year bond at the height of the crisis, slipping back to 80 basis points
by last week.
The question is whether the government's austerity package will bring the
deficit down to 5.8 per cent of GDP this year and 4.7 per cent next, as it
has forecast. Analysts think not. They fear some of the most important
measures will not be implemented quickly enough to put Belgium back in line
with the EC's target for monetary union of a 3 per cent deficit-to-GDP ratio
by 1996.
JP Morgan warns that yield differentials with Germany could return to three
figures. 'I don't see a lot of upside potential, and a lot of downside if
things are seen to be going wrong,' says Mr Jacques Longerstaey, head of
bond sales and trading with JP Morgan in Brussels.
On the other hand, Mr Roger Rosier of the Belgian bank, Generale de Banque,
believes an 80 basis point spread over German bonds makes Belgian government
bonds quite attractive. But he agrees the yield spread is unlikely to narrow
to less than 75 basis points, and could rise as high as 100 in the coming
months.
In the meantime, the government is not afraid to introduce two new bonds at
its next auction on April 22. One of those - carrying a 7 per cent coupon
and maturing in 2004 - is expected to become the new benchmark 10-year bond.
As Mr Rosier of Generale de Banque points out: 'It's obvious that the
mini-crisis we have seen has raised certain questions. People will
definitely watch what's going on very closely in future.'

FT  19 APR 93 / UK Gilts: Inflationary pressures cloud over the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about demand pressures took centre stage on the back of
higher-than-expected inflation data.
The frowns in the bond market are likely to perplex many consumers and
industrialists who still see little sign of any UK recovery. None the less,
talk of a return to UK growth later this year, and its effect on depressing
bond prices, has become a feature in the financial community.
Accordingly, after months in which gilt investors were extremely relaxed
about possible inflationary pressures, the market was taken aback by the
announcement on Friday that the retail prices index rose in the year to last
month by 1.9 per cent, from 1.8 per cent in February.
More frissons of concern were sparked by news that the underlying measure of
inflation, as registered by the RPI less mortgage costs, rose to a
year-on-year 3.5 per cent last month from 3.4 per cent the month before.
Long-dated gilts lost about 1 point on the day, with investor sentiment
being further dampened by the Bank of England's announcement that it will
auction a further tranche of gilts on April 28, when the conventional stock
on offer will have a maturity between 1996 and 1999.
The Bank will announce further details tomorrow. Many are assuming that it
will sell between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 3bn of relatively short-dated stock
as part of the effort of funding this financial year's government deficit,
expected to be about Pounds 50bn.
Over the week as a whole, gilts at both ends of the yield curve were pushed
up, by about 20 basis points for short-dated maturities and roughly half
that at the long end. The yield on a 10-year gilt was quoted on Friday night
at just above 8 per cent, after a long spell at lower levels.
The changes during the week at the short end of the curve were due largely
to impressions that, with a number of signs of increased demand pressures,
the UK government was unlikely to sanction an imminent cut in base rates
from 6 per cent.
Indeed, in money markets on Friday there was even talk, somewhat far-fetched
on the grounds of the subdued state of much of the economy, about the need
for a base rate rise in order to stem possible inflationary pressures.
According to Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Midland Global Markets, the
inflation figures were 'quite worrying'. Many in financial markets believe
the government might be forced to abandon its target of keeping underlying
inflation at below 4 per cent.
That is even though the introduction this financial year of the council tax
as opposed to the more expensive poll tax is expected to reduce the tax
burden on the average household and thus help to put a ceiling on the
measure for underlying inflation.
Mr Leo Doyle, an economist with Kleinwort Benson, said he was particularly
concerned about the increase in prices of items such as household goods,
clothing and footwear.
Clothing and footwear prices rose by 1.9 per cent in March from February
after a 1.8 per cent month-on-month rise in February, underlining that
shopkeepers are feeling more relaxed about increasing prices in a bid to
rebuild profit margins.
Food prices have also been pushed up, partly due to the devaluation of the
green pound following the UK's departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism. Meanwhile, the signs of improved economic activity, including
higher house sales and a 4.5 per cent year-on-year rise in the week to April
14 of notes and coins in circulation, may have given a general boost to
price pressures throughout the economy.
Even so, concern about inflation may be slightly overdone.
According to a Midland inflation index, which strips out erratic changes in
prices and accounts for about 75 per cent of the RPI, underlying inflation
has increased from a year-on-year 2.5 per cent in January to 2.9 per cent in
March. However, in September last year inflation on this measure was 3.7 per
cent and in October it was 3.4 per cent.

FT  19 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Signs of revival in
syndication sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the syndicated loans market is starting to pick up with several
European borrowers waiting to tap the market, according to bankers.
Ayuntamiento de Madrid, the Madrid council, is launching a deal expected to
raise about DM160m to finance its 1993 capital expenditure programme. It is
being lead-managed by Banco Central Hispano, Sumitomo and West LB.
The six-year deal has a margin of 27.5 basis points over D-Mark Libor, which
some European bankers regard as tight pricing.
However, others point out that pricing on loans has already started to edge
lower.
Another Spanish borrower, the motorway operator Aumar, is also expected to
tap the market soon with a deal of between Dollars 80m and Dollars 100m.
JP Morgan expects to launch its Dollars 500m deal for Vattenfall, the
Swedish power group, this week. The deal is a five-year loan priced at 40
basis points over Libor, with a commitment fee of 20 basis points on the
undrawn amount.
Investcorp, the Arab-led investment consortium, has signed a Dollars 330m
loan facility, its largest to date, which will be used partly to refinance a
Dollars 250m revolving credit as well as to provide additional funds for
general corporate purposes.
The deal, arranged by Bankers Trust International and Chemical Bank, is a
three-year term loan with a margin of 87.5 basis points over Libor. There is
a commitment fee of 37.5 basis points on the undrawn balance, and management
fees range from 45 basis points for participants to 80 basis points for
senior lead managers.

FT  19 APR 93 / International Bonds: French franc Eurobonds attract strong
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG international interest in French franc Eurobonds is being fuelled by
the likelihood of further interest rate cuts. Real interest rates in France
are among the highest in Europe, and the strength of the franc since the
elections has restored confidence in the currency.
New issue volume has already reached FFr60bn so far this year, almost half
of last year's total, according to IFR Securities Data.
With rates set to fall further, some borrowers may bide their time. But
further cuts are likely to have limited impact on the long end of the
market, as the yield curve is widely expected to steepen.
Several French borrowers are looking at the long end, following a highly
successful 19-year issue by Electricite de France last week.
'There has been consistent demand at the long end of the market, while
buying at the short end is more speculative,' said Mr Luc Cardyn, head of
syndicate at Banque Paribas.
The anticipated cuts are expected to complete the transformation of the
yield curve from negative to positive, making the market easier to trade.
Currently, a trader holding 10-year French bonds yielding, say, 7 1/2 per
cent, has to fund that position in the money market at, say, 9 per cent.
This is called a negative cost of carry and it deters traders from holding
inventory.
Foreign borrowers have been encouraged by the narrowing of the yield
differential between German bunds and French OATs, which is at a
historically tight 50 basis points for 10-year bonds.
This means some sovereign borrowers, which had found the market too
expensive, are now reconsidering. However, there is still a lack of swap
opportunities in the French market, which is likely to deter borrowers who
do not want to take French francs.
Nevertheless, the recent decline in rates has encouraged Spain to look again
at the market, with a view to raising 20-year funds, without swapping the
proceeds, bankers said. Other sovereign borrowers, such as Finland and
Sweden, have also been eyeing the market.
But the French market is less dependent than most on attracting foreign
borrowers, since it boasts a wealth of strongly-rated French borrowers with
a heavy requirement for French franc funding, mainly state-owned monopolies
and financial agencies.
The existence of a core of French borrowers has helped establish a strong
domestic market. But the strength of investor demand from overseas investors
has shifted attention from the domestic market.
So far this year, there has been FFr46bn worth of domestic issues, compared
with FFr52bn during the same period last year, according to Credit
Commercial de France.
Stronger demand from international investors has caused a tightening of
yield spreads in the Eurobond market relative to the domestic market.
Dealers said that new issues in the Eurobond market can be launched as much
as five basis points tighter than in the domestic market. In spite of the
potentially higher cost, the European Investment Bank is expected to launch
a domestic issue this week.
In practice, the dividing line between international and domestic issues has
been largely eroded, as many overseas institutions now buy both Eurobonds
and domestic bonds. The main technical difference between the two markets is
that Eurobonds are in bearer form and domestic bonds are registered. More
importantly, Eurobonds cannot be marketed by French banks through their
retail networks, so domestic bonds are more widely held by small investors.

FT  19 APR 93 / Risk and Reward: High-tech path to holy grail may lead up a
blind alley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN obscure corners of the investment world in the US and the UK, the first
products of a new generation of investment technology are being put to the
test. Experience seems to have been mixed, in spite of the claims of
enthusiasts. Even the experts disagree on whether the latest thinking is
leading down a blind alley, or whether it will open the way to the holy
grail of investment management - higher returns without higher risks.
The latest products revolve around so-called 'non-linear' methods of
analysing economic and financial data. Traditional statistical methods - the
sort of procedures underpinning most quantitative investment models, which
attempt to predict movements in financial markets based on historical data -
have several flaws.
Perhaps the most serious is that the relationship between market prices, and
the factors that determine them, changes over time. The only sure thing is
that what happened before will not happen the same way again.
Theories and techniques developed in branches of science far removed from
the financial markets are now being brought into play. To orthodox capital
market thinkers, they are based on a heresy: that market prices do not
follow a 'random walk', where it is impossible to tell from the last price
what the next one will be.
The approaches being used include the use of 'neural networks' (networks of
computer processing units whose interaction is meant to replicate the
learning process of the human brain) and 'genetic algorithms' (a method of
generating better hypotheses about how markets work by starting with a wide
range of assumptions and using them to 'evolve' new and better views). Chaos
theory - which holds that it is often possible to identify short-term
patterns in apparently random data - is also being put to work.
The first products of this thinking are finding their way out of academia
and research labs and into investment management and trading houses. The
UK's Department of Trade and Industry last month agreed to fund a Pounds 1m
'club' aimed at finding financial market applications for work on neural
networks being undertaken at University College, London.
Several investment houses, including County NatWest Investment Management,
have shown an interest. Citibank in London has been investigating the use of
such methods for foreign exchange trading since the late 1980s.
Mr Paul Refenes of UCL says a New England insurance company using a
fixed-income fund management model since late last year has outperformed the
JP Morgan world government bond index by a factor of two.
The Prediction Company in Santa Fe is typical of the new rash of hopefuls.
Formed by experts from the physical sciences less than two years ago, it has
received backing from O'Connor, the Chicago-based derivatives firm, to
develop new investment management approaches.
The question posed by each of these is the same: is there a pattern or
structure to movements in financial markets that can be isolated and used as
the basis for investment or trading? Mr Ben Peters of PanAgora, a
Boston-based asset management company, claims stock markets move in clear
cycles - four years in the US and Japan, two and a half in the UK and six in
Germany. Foreign exchange markets, though, are closer to the 'random walk',
though with certain biases reflecting central bank steering of rates.
'It is still an open question whether the structure in financial data is
caused by chaos or some other underlying factor,' says Mr Norman Packard of
The Prediction Company, which has concentrated on foreign exchange and
futures markets.
Ironically, the current generation of technical trading models may give the
'rocket scientists' something to feed off. Markets where technical trading
plays a large part, such as the futures markets, might show a clearer
structure than others, says Mr Packard.
The same could be true of indexation and active quantitative investment
management.

Sales rose 4.2 per cent to DKr7.4bn. At 1991 year-end exchange rates,
turnover would have been DKr8bn, an increase of 13 per cent on the previous
year. Mr Hans Werdelin, chief executive, added that Rentokil group sales
increased by 19.8 per cent to Pounds 465m (Dollars 702m), but translated
into kroner the increase was only 2.7 per cent, to DKr4.4bn.
Earlier this month the Danish group took over the fluid power division of
Lucas Industries in Canada.

THREE foreign brokerages have been granted seats on the Shanghai stock
exchange trading floor, marking another step towards the
internationalisation of China's leading bourse, Reuter reports.
Jardine Fleming, Standard Chartered Securities and Baring Brothers will take
up their seats this month, trading special B-shares for foreign investors,
the English-language China Daily reported yesterday.
Analysts said the move would boost the B-share market, which has been in the
doldrums in the past several weeks, depressed by earnings reports from some
of the 10 listed B-shares.

<TEXT>
SAPPI, the forest products group in the Gencor stable, surprised the market
with better-than-expected results for the year to February and with a final
dividend cut of only a third, following predictions it would be passed.
The final dividend was reduced to 80 cents per share from 120 cents,
bringing the payment for the year to 160 cents - a cut of 20 per cent on the
1992 figure.
Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman, said Sappi, which derives 63 per cent
of its turnover overseas, had suffered from the turmoil in European currency
markets which had driven world paper and pulp prices to uneconomic levels.
He added that the adverse trading conditions had hit all areas of the
group's operations.
Hannover Papier, the German coated wood-free paper manufacturer, acquired
last May, suffered from the recession and adverse exchange rate
fluctuations. Mr Van As said it would achieve results close to break-even in
the year under review.
Sappi Europe, which holds Sappi's UK mills, made a loss while Sappi Trading,
the international trading arm, traded profitably.
Turnover for the year rose by 28.5 per cent to R4.7bn, reflecting for the
first time the inclusion, for six months, of Hannover Papier.

<TEXT>
THE German Federal Cartel Office has rejected the planned takeover of
General Motors' Allison transmission division by Zahnradfabrik
Friedrichshafen, the German automotive supplier, Reuter reports from Berlin.
The takeover would have created a leading business worldwide in terms of its
range, technological competence and its service and sales network, the
office said.
It added that ZF was a leading international supplier of drive, steering and
wheel technology with group turnover of almost DM6bn (Dollars 3.7bn), while
Allison's domestic sales made up only 1 per cent of its total turnover of
more than Dollars 800m.
With the strong market position of ZF and the already high degree of
concentration, any further amalgamation would have represented a
considerable deterioration in competition, the office maintained.
It said ZF had already announced it would appeal. Dr Klaus Bleyer, chief
executive, of ZF, said the deal promoted 'ZF's long-term strategy of
providing world-class powertrain products to a global customer base'.

THE ALBERTA government is selling its 36 per cent interest in Alberta
Energy, the Canadian resource company, for CDollars 476m (USDollars 378m).
Mr Peter Lougheed, former Alberta premier, set up AEC 20 years ago, when oil
and gas prices were booming, as a vehicle for Albertans to share in the
prosperity. About 7.5m shares were sold at CDollars 10 each to Alberta
residents.
The 36 per cent interest is held by the Alberta Heritage Fund, a CDollars
7bn investment pool set up by Mr Lougheed to invest excess oil and gas tax
revenues after the energy crisis in the 1970s.
About 25m shares are to be offered at CDollars 19 each with payment of
CDollars 9.50 each on May 11 next and May 11 1994. Albertans are being
offered 40 per cent of the block.
AEC stock closed at CDollars 19 1/4 on Friday, up from a 52-week low of
CDollars 9 3/4 with the turnround in the oil and gas industry and a better
outlook for the company's newsprint investment.
The company swung back to strong profitability last year.

FT  19 APR 93 / International Company News: IBM prepares to launch Dollars
4.6bn syndicated loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, and IBM Credit Corp, its
leasing subsidiary, are preparing to launch a Dollars 4.6bn syndicated loan,
according to banking sources.
The financing, in the form of a revolving credit facility, is being arranged
by Credit Suisse First Boston.
The company is currently approaching its key relationship banks in the hope
of obtaining commitments of around Dollars 500m from each of them.
The deal may be launched as early as this week.
Officials at IBM refused to confirm the transaction but, according to
bankers involved in the deal, IBM itself is setting up a Dollars 3bn line,
while IBM Credit Corp, its wholly-owned leasing organisation, has access to
a further Dollars 1.6bn.
Each portion is understood to consist of 364-day and three-year tranches. A
revolving credit is a loan facility which can be repaid and re-borrowed
throughout its lifetime.
Both IBM and IBM Credit Corp are familiar borrowers in the public markets
where they have launched bond issues. However, bankers point out that this
loan would be IBM's debut in the syndicated loans market. IBM Credit Corp
launched a Dollars 500m, five-year revolving credit in 1986 which was
arranged by Salomon Brothers.
Last month, Moody's, the international credit rating agency, downgraded
IBM's long-term debt as well as that of its financially-supported
wholly-owned subsidiaries, IBM Credit, IBM International Finance and IBM
Japan, to Single-A1 from Double-A2. The downgrading affected about Dollars
18bn of debt, the agency said.
IBM reported a net loss of Dollars 4.97bn for 1992, the biggest annual loss
in its history, as sales of mainframe computers dropped sharply in the
fourth quarter.

<TEXT>
OCE-VAN der Grinten, the Dutch office equipment and photocopier maker, saw
net profit tumble by nearly 50 per cent in the 1992-1993 first quarter as
the economic slowdown in Europe hit sales.
Net profit was virtually halved to Fl 10.8m (Dollars 6.0m) from Fl 21.1m a
year earlier.
Sales were down 7 per cent at Fl 609.2m, with European sales in particular
under pressure because of generally weak economic conditions.
In the US, sales and profits rose, the company said.
Operating profit plummeted by 56 per cent to Fl 14.6m, though this was
partly balanced by a rise of more than one-third in interest income from
financial leases to Fl 22m. However, the higher trend in financial leases
also caused financing charges to rise by Fl 3m to Fl 23.3m.
In the engineering system market, encompassing both copying and plotting
equipment, sales tumbled by more than 10 per cent.
Oce said it expected several new machines launched recently at the Hanover
Fair to make a 'clear contribution' to sales in the second half.
In office copying and printing equipment, the sales decline was more
moderate, at 3 per cent.
The company did not comment on the outlook for profits later this year. In
February, Oce had warned it expected to see lower results in the first six
months of 1992-1993 and an improvement in the second half.

FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: An acquisition with eastern promise -
BICC's purchase of KWO Kabel, Germany's third largest cable maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Hingston shrugged off the small demonstration outside the factory
gates of KWO Kabel, the east German cable maker which BICC, the
British-based cable and construction group, acquired in February.
The demonstrators, led by IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering union, were
demanding that employers honour a contract aimed at bringing eastern German
wages up to western German levels by April 1994.
As chairman of the management board of KWO, a factory located on the banks
of the river Spree in Kopenick, east Berlin, Mr Hingston would prefer the
timetable towards income parity to be postponed. That would mean that he
would not be obliged to pay his employees a 26 per cent pay increase this
year as outlined in the contract.
But these, and other problems, are now in the hands of Mr Rainer Hemmann,
who BICC poached from Siemens, and who took over KWO's day-to-day operations
in March. Mr Hingston, in the meantime, will turn his mind to BICC's other
international operations.
Mr Hingston, who knew about KWO's operations before German unification, had
no illusions about the effort it would take to turn the company round.
Before 1989, the Soviet and eastern European market accounted for the bulk
of KWO's turnover. Monetary union in June 1990, and exposure to competition
soon put paid to that market. By February 1992, trading losses totalled
DM9m.
Despite the collapse of the Soviet market, and trading losses, BICC decided
to buy KWO in late-1991 after a western German company lost interest. KWO
had been taken over in 1990 by the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the
privatisation of the eastern German economy, which reduced its workforce
from 9,500 to 3,800.
BICC took the plunge for two reasons: it believes that eastern Europe will
eventually develop a vast market for telecommunications and cable power
equipment, making KWO's traditional links in the region invaluable. More
importantly, BICC wants a much bigger foothold in the German market.
But the negotiations with the Treuhand were long. There were many property
claims on the four sites which BICC eventually bought. Even though BICC, as
an investor, had priority over claims registered by former owners, the
Treuhand, and the city of Berlin, wanted watertight assurances that BICC was
not buying for the 'quick buck'.
'Some people in the Treuhand were obsessed about property speculators. I
think they had gotten their fingers burnt before. They needed a lot of
convincing that we would not shell the site, and then sell it for a big
profit.
In the end, because we were going to rationalise our operations, which meant
we only needed 105,000 square metres of the 230,000 square metres we bought,
it was agreed that we would offer any excess land back to the city of Berlin
at the price we paid for it, plus inflation,' explained Mr Hingston. BICC
paid an estimated DM63m for KWO.
Another lesson BICC learnt in the process of trying to complete the KWO deal
was the importance of detail. 'No foreign company should apply for planning
per-mission with vague outlines. Detail is a premium in this country,' said
Mr Hingston. Patience with the bureaucracy is another necessary virtue,
quipped a BICC senior official.
BICC completed the acquisition of KWO in March, almost a year since it
started negotiations, which at that time, gave it the right to manage the
company.
Under the terms of the contract, BICC is committed to investing DM80m
(excluding grants) until 1994, and it is entitled to obtain grants from the
Senate of Berlin of about 23 per cent of the capital costs. In addition,
BICC will receive an 8 per cent investment premium from the government for
fixed production costs.
BICC is also committed to employing a total of 2,200 people until the end of
1994. Mr Hingston says there is still a small amount of unemployment. 'We
have nearly reached our target of 2,200.' The Treuhand subsidised excess
labour until last October. It will meet redundancy costs until the middle of
this year.
Rationalisation has been completed. Mr John Woodthorpe, director of
strategic planning at Kopenick, says KWO has now been divided into three
divisions - energy cables, telecommunications, and material.
'KWO, in principle, is like any other factory. The only thing is that you
have to make an allowance for the past 40 years: the staff has to appreciate
the value of profit, money, property, and above all, the importance of the
consumer,' said Mr Hingston.
Needless to say, the marketing department has been overhauled. 'Before 1989,
there was a sales department of 30 people, who we still employ. They were
instructed in one style of marketing: they had to visit the shops, check the
stock, and then tell the retailers what they could and could not have. That
was what was known as marketing . . .' explained Mr Hingston.
As a result of training, and a smaller workforce, sales per person have
doubled over the past year, and productivity has risen from about 35 per
cent to 65 per cent.
By the end of 1992, turnover amounted to DM320m, and could reach DM400m this
year. Germany, and European Community countries, already account for 80 per
cent of turnover.
But there are signs that KWO's market in the former Soviet Union is
reviving. And most important of all, there is even talk of a 'small profit'
for 1993. 'Things are improving,' said Mr Hingston.

FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: Apax says price for Gabicci is too high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APAX Partners, a venture capital company, has withdrawn from talks on making
an offer for Gabicci, the casual clothing company which agreed last month to
an all-share bid from Helene, the clothing distributor.
The Helene bid is opposed by two dissident directors, Ms Ana Dodosh and Mr
Gordon Lawrence, who have criticised the absence of a cash alternative. They
deny any association with the Apax initiative.
It is understood that Gabicci's former managing and finance director, Mr
Michael Abrahams, was part of the management team leading the mooted
management buy-in.
The Helene bid is 2.043 shares for every Gabicci share, and carried a value
of about 50p per Gabicci share against a closing price on Friday of 46p.
'Apax withdrew basically because it had a look and it just felt for this
kind of price it's not worth it,' said the company, which had discussed a
price of about 45p.
Mr Norman Fetterman, managing director of Helene, said his company held
about 31 per cent of Gabicci as of last Friday. He added: 'A number of
institutional shareholders had been waiting to see what happened to Apax.'
Mr Jack Sofier, chairman of Gabicci, said he believed shareholders would now
accept the Helene bid by the closing date next Wednesday: 'There's nothing
else on the table. They should all accept now.'
Mr Lawrence, described Apax's departure as 'a major disappointment'. He
believed Helene had not won as many acceptances as it had expected: 'We
still maintain the offer is not a good one.'

FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fine Decor coming to market with Pounds 25m
tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINE DECOR, a maker of wallpaper which exports to 30 countries, is set to
come to the market in June through a placing that will value it at Pounds
25m.
The Cheshire-based company demerged from Boots in 1991 via a management
buy-out, six months after the chemist and DIY business acquired it as part
of Ward White.
Mr Harry Morgan, chief executive, who spent 16 years with Unilever before
joining the group, says Fine Decor has no pretensions to the exclusive
market addressed by Colefax &amp; Fowler or Osborne &amp; Little.
'We are trying to appeal to the international mass domestic market,' he
says. 'The secret of our success is that we have identified areas of common
ground (in our export markets) in terms of design and colour.'
Given the sorry history of Coloroll - a company that looked very similar to
Fine Decor when it set out - Mr Morgan is also keen to scotch ideas that it
will try to grow quickly through acquisition, although some of the proceeds
will be used to that end. 'It is not our intention to change the company
other than its balance sheet.'
Fine Decor will be coming to the market on the back of a forecast of interim
results for the six months to July 1993. In the year to the end of January,
sales increased 16 per cent to Pounds 33.2m and operating profits rose 83
per cent to Pounds 3m. Pre-tax profits were held back by the interest charge
to Pounds 2.1m.
The company is raising about Pounds 10m though the float - half of it for
existing investors. The balance will repay the Pounds 5m of MBO debt,
leaving the group broadly cash neutral. The MBO team paid Pounds 9m for the
business, what Mr Morgan calls 'a 1980's price in 1991'.
The MBO team will not be selling any shares and will end up with 20 per cent
of the company - down from 30 per cent just before the float.
About 40 per cent of Fine Decor's product is exported, most to North America
followed by the EC.
Mr Morgan says the company has grown despite the recession by taking market
share, growing sales of co-ordinated textiles - which now appear alongside
the wallpapers in the sample books - and by boosting sales of borders.
The group has also sharply reduced its dependence on sales to FADS to only
20 per cent of total sales.
Samuel Montagu is sponsoring the flotation.

FT  19 APR 93 / Cross Border M&amp;A Deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The expansion and contraction of UK and US companies generated a number of
last week's cross-border mergers and acquisitions, writes Brian Bollen.
Royal Bank of Scotland took another step forward in its long-term strategic
US expansion programme by agreeing to buy Boston Five Bancorp. Hanson
described its purchase of Watt Housing Corporation in the US as a bolt-on
acquisition as part of its continuing programme of expanding its core
businesses. The latest deal in the telecommunications sector saw AT&amp;T of the
US buy Shaye Communications, the UK-based wireless telephony specialist.
Siebe, the UK's largest engineering business, strengthened its position in
the temperature, appliance and industrial process control markets with the
acquisition of two European controls companies. It is paying a total of
about Pounds 25m for Eberle of Germany and Schmidt Amaturen of Austria. The
week's non-core and debt reduction disposals included the sale by Ashley
Group of the UK of Distribuciones Gimenez y Compania, a Spanish food
retailing operation, to Parafax. The buyer is a Hong Kong company formed for
the purpose of acquiring retail companies by a consortium of investors
including Sir Ralph Halpern.
Smith &amp; Nephew completed the sale of its interest in Smith &amp; Nephew Plastics
in Australia as part of its strategy of concentrating on its core worldwide
health businesses. ICI completed the disposal of its Canadian-based nitrogen
products business.
Inchcape, the international services and marketing group, said it was moving
into Turkey's expanding market for consumer goods by taking a 55 per cent
stake in Inchcape Retrans.

FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: A leading light under its new ownership -
How Technology has survived and prospered after last July's traumatic events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE letter from International Business Machines arrived, hand delivered, in
the reception area of Technology on July 10 last year.
It gave notice that the world's largest computer manufacturer had decided,
unilaterally, to terminate its contract with Technology, one of the UK's
largest and most successful personal computer distributors.
It was a sharp rebuff for Technology's audacity in allowing itself to be
acquired the week before by ICL, the UK computer maker in which Fujitsu of
Japan has a majority stake.
The same day, Digital Equipment, the US minicomputer manufacturer, said it
would not renew its distribution contract.
A year on, Mr Derek Lewis, chairman and chief executive of Technology, still
resents the cavalier way in which Big Blue ended the relationship: 'We had
been working with them for nine years and sold half a billion pounds worth
of IBM equipment'.
Mr John Gardner, chairman of ICL (UK), recalls the shock of Black Friday:
'It was traumatic; it stopped Derek's business dead in its tracks, but in
hindsight it was the best thing that could have happened'.
It was hardly unexpected, though. ICL bought Technology for Pounds 30m with
the aim of becoming the largest supplier of personal computers in the UK,
ahead of IBM, Compaq and Dell.
It was a controversial move which always courted the risk that major
personal computer makers would not want to deal with a distributor owned by
a rival and selling ICL products in direct competition.
'The chances were we would lose one personal computer manufacturer,' Mr
Lewis says. 'But IBM was not the most likely.'
Today, Technology has not only survived but prospered, and its lean and
hungry business methods are the model for the rest of ICL. Operating
margins, for example, are typically less than 10 per cent. Mr Lewis pays by
results; low salaries and high commissions mean that overheads are always in
line with sales.
By comparison, ICL as a whole is working hard to drive operating expenses
below 23 per cent of sales.
In the year to June 1992, before the ICL takeover, Technology made sales of
Pounds 147m, of which some Pounds 70m was IBM and Digital Equipment
business. Despite the pull out, in the six months from July to December last
year revenues totalled Pounds 110m with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.5m. For
the full year the target is revenues of Pounds 250m.
Of the Pounds 110m, Pounds 40m was ICL equipment; the rest came from sales
of systems from other suppliers: Compaq, Sun, Hewlett Packard, Toshiba, and
Groupe Bull.
Digital Equipment never, in fact, cut off supplies of its systems. Now
Technology is able to sell IBM mid range machines through an agreement with
Bull of France, which sells the US manufacturer's machines under its own
name. If a customer insists on IBM personal computers, Technology buys them
from brokers: 'It only amounts to sales of Pounds 200,000 or so a month,' Mr
Lewis says.
ICL bought Technology because, in common with other large computer
manufacturers, it had to find a cost effective channel to market low cost
systems which could not command the profit margins necessary to support a
direct sales force.
The problem is complicated because many large customers like dealing
directly with the manufacturer. By buying Technology, ICL brought together
in one step the dealer-only channel and the manufacturer's direct channel.
For significant sales accounts, ICL takes the lead but passes the
implemen-tation over to staff at Technology once the contract is signed.
The company recently concluded a deal worth Pounds 6m for the supply of
2,000 Toshiba notebook computers to NatWest Life Insurance. The ICL account
team handled the sale; Technology staff are to implement it.
The intention had been to run the company as a separate division, but the
fracas with IBM and Digital forced a rethink and Technology was integrated
into the overall company structure: 'It was more a merger than an
acquisition,' Mr Gardner says. ICL is now the sixth largest personal
computer supplier in Europe.
ICL, with turnover of Pounds 2.48bn and pre-tax profits of Pounds 38.6m last
year, is now developing its business in three directions: computing
services, business solutions (including the mainframe business) and volume
products; the latter are the responsibility of Technology.
Personal computer manu-facturers these days are segmenting their product
lines into systems which command premium prices - IBM's PS/2 line for
example, and commodity systems which sell at the lowest possible prices.
Last week ICL took a further step in acknowledging the increasing tendency
for computer hardware to become a commodity product by introducing a low
cost version of its high powered mid range machines which run the Unix
operating system.
A typical Unix system sells for Pounds 250,000. ICL's value for money
machines - the Technicl range - sell for between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds
50,000, making Unix computing accessible to a broad range of small business
customers.
All ICL's personal computer and Unix systems are handled by Technology. The
difference between a premium Unix computer and a Technicl product is simply
packaging. The Technicl system comes in fixed configurations; it can be
ordered, sold and delivered in 48 hours.
The logical conclusion is that most of ICL's hardware will eventually be
sold by Technology: 'The sooner the better,' Mr Lewis says.

FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Swallowfield declines to Pounds
1.27m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A REDUCTION in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.27m, was
announced by Swallowfield, the Somerset-based personal care products
manufacturer, for the year to end-December.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 22.9m).
Mr Terry Organ, the chairman, said that Pounds 1.8m of turnover had come
from Parbel Belgium, acquired in July, which had provided an opening to
continental Europe.
He said the group was still working to turn Parbel round. Its losses were
shown as Pounds 37,000.
Interest charges rose following the acquisition and gearing was back up to
84 per cent, he said. However, he expec-ted that figure to fall this year.
Earnings per share slipped to 7.3p (13p) and the proposed final dividend is
cut to 2.2p (3.9p) for a reduced total of 4.4p (6.1p).

FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fyffes silent on its rejection of IPounds
420m Dole bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FYFFES, the UK and Irish fruit and vegetable distributor, remained
tight-lipped at the weekend over the reasons for its rejection of the
IPounds 420m take over bid by Dole, the California-based fresh fruit
distributor, after a week of talks between the two managements.
Mr Carl McCann, finance director at Fyffe's, was emphatic that discussions
with Dole have been terminated, but was not prepared to go into any further
details. He did point out, though, that it was the first time Fyffes had
been the subject of a bid. Significantly, he did not describe it as
'hostile'.
Reports at the weekend suggested that Dole's senior executives believed that
the bid was going to be accepted, but then it fell at the last hurdle when
rejected by Fyffes on Friday afternoon.
The most likely reason is the surge in the price of Fyffes shares for two
days prior to its announcement that it had received an approach 'which may
or may not' lead to an offer to buy the company at 115p per share.
Its shares closed at 122p on Friday. It is thought the board considered the
bid undervalued the company, although according to weekend reports Dole is
not prepared to go any higher.
Main shareholders in Fyffes are the McCann family, which holds 9.3 per cent
of the 280m ordinary shares in issue, and DCC, an Irish holding company led
by Dublin entrepreneur Mr Jim Flavin, which owns 11 per cent. About 70 per
cent is held by institutional holders according to brokers.
DCC has been a strong supporter of the McCanns, helping them bring their
original company, FII, to the stock market in 1981, and in their purchase of
Fyffes in 1986. It has a seat on the board and is a financial adviser.
Fyffes has been keen to expand into the market on the European mainland, and
since its IPounds 60m rights issue in June 1991, has kept the market
guessing over likely acquisitions. It suffered two setbacks last year when
Del Monte was sold to a Mexican concern and when the ERM crisis forced it to
abandon a IPounds 52m deal with Saba Trading.
The company has some IPounds 90m in cash, and negligible debt. Last December
two of the McCann directors sold off a quarter of their holding to repay
borrowings, at a market low of 64p per share. DCC bought 7.7m of the 11m
shares sold by the McCanns.
Dole has been building up its banana interests in France, and clearly views
Fyffes as a company which would mesh well into its European strategy.

FT  19 APR 93 / Seat freezes investment after fall into loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEAT, the Spanish carmaker owned by Germany's Volkswagen group, suffered
losses last year for the first time since 1988 after being hit by high debt
servicing charges, a weakened peseta and a shrinking market.
Mr Juan Antonio Diaz-Alvarez, chief executive, said the company would freeze
a third of the Pta120bn (Pounds 682m) investments planned for this year and
for 1994 and would shed 4,000 jobs from its 24,000 labour force.
The Barcelona-based company reported after-tax losses of Pta12.7bn last
year, against 1991 net profits of Pta2.4m.
Mr Diaz-Alvarez said the shortfall, which had been anticipated, had been
caused by financial charges totalling Pta16bn, accumulated from Pta400bn
worth of investments over the past five years.
Nearly half of Seat's investment to date has been financed by D-Mark loans
and the German currency appreciated sharply against the peseta in the second
half of 1992.
Seat, which exports 80 per cent of the nearly 600,000 units it produces
annually, did not benefit from the weakened peseta.
The company's exports grew 23 per cent in the first half of last year when
the currency was strong. But they fell 15 per cent, because of the depressed
market, in the last quarter of 1992 after the peseta had devalued by 11 per
cent against most European currencies. Mr Diaz-Alvarez said he expected car
sales to drop during 1993 and Seat could at best hope to be breaking even at
the end of the year.
Car sales were up by a modest 4.7 per cent last year but the company's
cashflow fell 59 per cent to Pta7.9bn following an investment outlay of
Pta191bn in 1992, 56 per cent up on that of 1991.
Under the reduced investment programme, Seat will be concentrating on a new
version of the Volkswagen Polo model, built at the Spanish company's plant
in Pamplona; on a bigger version of the Ibiza model, to be unveiled at next
month's Barcelona motor show; and on a new small car being developed jointly
with Japan's Suzuki group.
Mr Diaz-Alvarez said part of Seat's industrial costs could in the future be
passed on to suppliers under the strategy developed by fellow Spaniard Mr
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who recently joined Volkswagen from General
Motors.

are saving on ACT
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the institutional investor, the thought of earning higher dividends
subsidised by tax receipts is tantalising.
This pleasant situation has become a reality, thanks to a structure
pioneered by Barclays de Zoete Wedd which allows companies with unrelieved
Advance Corporation Tax to offer enhanced scrip dividends instead of cash,
offering enormous tax savings to the issuer.
'We don't object to these at all,' said the manager of one large industrial
pension fund. 'It seems to us to be a transfer from the taxman to the
shareholder.'
However, the new twist on dividends has ominous implications for many other
shareholders. The Association of British Insurers, one of the UK's most
influential shareholder groups, is seeking a meeting with the Confederation
of British Industry to underline its view that it does not wish to see
companies habitually issuing their dividends in shares instead of cash.
The ABI fears that, while corporate earnings initially get a big boost from
the scrip dividends, issuers may find a few years later that they do not
have enough money to pay cash dividends on the increased share capital and
will have to cut payouts.
'These are like ice cream,' said one member of the ABI's investment
committee. 'They glisten at first but after they've sat in the sun for a
while they don't look so good.'
So far, seven companies have proposed enhanced scrip dividend schemes, and
most have seen their share prices rise on the announcement. The schemes are
conditional on shareholders approving special resolutions, requiring a 75
per cent majority of votes cast, a permission which will have to be renewed
if the companies wish to offer the schemes again next year.
The scheme is only of interest to companies with unrelieved advance
corporation tax. Companies pay ACT to the Revenue when they pay a dividend
to shareholders; they can reclaim it against the corporation tax they pay on
their UK profits. But companies which earn much of their profits overseas
end up paying ACT they are unable to reclaim.
Scrip dividends avoid this problem. As ACT is not payable on such dividends,
companies can save tax, as well as retaining cash, if their shareholders can
be persuaded to take paper.
On Friday, BICC, the cables and construction group, became the latest
company to offer an enhanced scrip dividend. BICC said that if half its
shareholders took up the scrip offer, it would increase earnings per share
for the year by 1.5p and save Pounds 12m to Pounds 13m in unrelievable ACT.
Under the scheme, companies offer shareholders the choice of a cash dividend
or a 50 per cent higher scrip dividend. Shareholders who take the scrip
dividend can use a facility provided by the brokers to sell the new shares
at a 5 per cent discount to the scrip value, free of dealing costs, enabling
them to take nearly the full scrip value in cash.
However, those shareholders taking the cash options will find their stake in
each company has been diluted. The new stock could dilute issuers' share
capital by as much as 5.5 per cent, according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Shareholders say they view scrip issues as a thinly veiled rights offering;
effectively they are surrendering cash to take up new shares in proportion
to their existing holdings. Thus, those companies with coherent strategies
for investing the cash they raise have received the warmest reception from
shareholders. However, if issuers were to offer the option at every
dividend, it would become little more than a rolling rights issue and
shareholders say they would object to constant calls for capital.
Investors also say the securities can be used as a kind of fudge which
allows a company short of cash to pretend it is raising its dividend when it
is not. Criticism in particular has been levelled at Forte, the hotels
group, which cut its cash dividend and then announced an enhanced scrip
offering. 'Companies which can't afford to pay a dividend shouldn't pay a
dividend and that's that,' said one shareholder. 'Otherwise the scrip
dividend is nothing more than a fiddle to disguise the fact that the company
has run out of cash.'
'If I want a company's shares I'll go out into the market and buy them,
thank you very much,' said Ms Caroline Burton, investment director at
Guardian Royal Exchange. 'In the meantime, I'd like my cash.'
Historically, UK institutions have steered shy of scrip dividends. The
average take-up of optional offers has been no more than 5 per cent. For one
thing, tax-exempt investors, such as pension funds, have been able to
reclaim an additional 25 per cent (20 per cent after the Budget) from the
Inland Revenue representing the ACT due on cash dividends - something they
cannot do with scrip dividends.
But the new structure offers the opportunity for an enhanced dividend and
allows the company effectively to raise cash by cutting its tax bill, and
that has put scrip dividends in quite a different light.
BAT, for instance, a company with large overseas earnings, will save Pounds
97m in ACT alone. Mr Michael Perry, assistant director at BZW, said the cash
savings can be reinvested to provide sufficient returns to cover the cost of
future dividends on the new shares.
The extra 50 per cent on the dividend more than compensates tax-exempt funds
for the loss of the tax credit, while taxpayers can gain even more,
depending on individual tax positions.
Some shareholders, while enthusiastic about the opportunity to cut their tax
charges, view the securities with mixed feelings. Among other things, some
have complained that because the enhanced dividend was in some cases
announced after the ex-dividend date, there was effectively a false market
in the shares.
Share prices have tended to rise after companies have announced an enhanced
scrip dividend scheme; so those who sold after the ex-dividend date but
before the announcement could have missed out on a profit. Several
institutions said they plan to take the matter up with the Stock Exchange.
The Stock Exchange said that in some cases, the scrip offer had not been
decided until after the dividend dates had been set. 'We didn't wish to tell
the companies they couldn't issue the scrip offer,' it explained. However,
it said that if shareholders expressed concern about the announcement, it
would consider whether companies should be required to announce scrip
dividends at the time of the ordinary dividend announcement.
While enhanced scrips are enjoying a burst of popularity now, that may be
shortlived because the tax structure which gave rise to their creation is
about to be scrapped. The March budget proposed a new 'foreign income
dividend' scheme which might get around the ACT problem faced by companies
with a high proportion of overseas profits, the very companies for which the
scheme is interesting.
For investors, the question is whether the short-term gains offered by
enhanced scrip dividends are overshadowed by their detractions in years to
come.

FT  19 APR 93 / Economics Notebook: West can help make Russia's reforms
stick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russia's finance minister and deputy prime minister,
complained recently that ever since the old state-planning system had
started to collapse, no single government had been given the freedom to
conduct any consistent policy for any period of time.
'Give six months to somebody, give it to the Bolsheviks for all I care,' he
said.
A big frustration about Russia, the heart of the former Soviet Union, is
that it has indeed become ungovernable, not least because it has been so
badly governed of late. As a result, the country runs on a mixture of
inertia and anarchy, while the parliament and government squabble about who
understands the Russian people better.
Now, even as he returns from Tokyo with a new package of support for Russian
reforms, Mr Fyodorov admits the economy is unlikely to 'stabilise' any time
soon because Sunday's referendum will probably be followed by early
elections in the autumn.
But still he soldiers on, saying that for the time being there is no
alternative to President Yeltsin if reforms are to be carried forward.
As an illustration of the sort of political manoeuvring which is likely to
continue for the foreseeable future, President Yeltsin appointed a
conservative as first deputy prime minster, directly above Mr Fyodorov, just
as he was negotiating with the G7 in Tokyo.
But by placing their bets on President Yeltsin and the programme drawn up by
Mr Fyodorov, western leaders hope that the referendum will at least clear
some of the cobwebs and give Mr Yeltsin a mandate to move ahead with stalled
reforms.
If this indeed happens, two fundamental problems will still need tackling.
One is the need to develop efficient mechanisms for unfolding western
assistance, which would be tied to reforms continuing. The other is to boost
the Russian state's ability to implement reforms.
Given western traditions of efficiency, rapid progress can be made on the
first front now that the west has been frightened into action by fears of
President Yeltsin being removed by an inchoate parliament.
The Russians are also beginning to understand that they are in a position
where they have the leverage better to formulate and make demands of the
west.
At a recent Moscow dinner party, a group of young Russian politicians asked
angrily why 'the west' had not told the government this time last year what
it was doing wrong.
They cited as an example the fact that Russia tried to start financial
stabilisation on its own when 15 central banks of the former Soviet Union
could still issue roubles.
For its naive faith in western omniscience, the question was more
interesting than any embarrassed answer to the effect that there had been no
united view in the west about how Russia should best go about launching
reforms, although Mr Yegor Gaidar at least had the merit of starting the
process.
Now the west too is learning from the past and is less afraid to interfere.
But the Russian people remain plagued with inefficient government in the
broadest sense - from the top of the pyramid in Mr Yeltsin's Kremlin offices
to the grass-roots, whether in tax collection or law enforcement.
Mr Fyodorov estimated recently that only 60 per cent of tax revenues are
collected. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister sacked as part of the
business of trying to improve the government's efficiency, recently shared
an insider's view of the problems. He singled out, for instance, the fact
that the cabinet's work was duplicated and sometimes superseded by parallel
presidential policy-making structures such as the Security Council.
But perhaps the biggest threat to both coherent policy-making and the very
unity of the country are the numerous exemptions to federal taxes and other
political and economic concessions granted to various regions and
enterprises to buy political support.
Both the president and government have recently vowed to do away with this
practice even though their whole power base has so far relied on it in the
absence of institutions capable of making reforms binding for all.
The system whereby benefits are granted not on the basis of a selective
policy but, as Mr Yeltsin himself put it, to 'whoever pays a bribe, has the
sharpest elbows or the loudest voice', is mirrored at local level.
In spite of justified accusations of inefficiency at his own institution, Mr
Jacques Attali, the visionary chairman of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, is right to stress the need to help Russia
build an efficient administration.
'We advised them to dismantle the old system but they have nothing to put in
its place,' he said during his last visit to Russia.
But there is going to be no quick fix in attempts to push forward Russian
reforms with western help.
Robert Conquest, the historian, provides an ironic picture of what happened
to western aid when the Bolsheviks starved peasants in 1921, and the US
responded generously to Soviet appeals for help.
Whereas a 1926 Soviet encyclopaedia acknowledged that US relief workers fed
10m people at the height of their activity, subsequent editions reported
that they had been a front to support western counter-revolution and
sabotage.
Even though some Russian politicians, in the time-honoured practice of
looking for the external enemy, are even today trying to blame the west for
Russia's problems, closing off the country again is no longer a real option.
But an erosion of the west's ability to influence events remains a distinct
possibility unless it can provide the glue to make reforms stick.
The west is rightly nervous about being drawn into the Russian mire.
However, the advantage of it doing so is that it makes it increasingly
difficult for Russia to wriggle out of an embrace it cannot do without.

FT  19 APR 93 / New trial in AMD and Intel dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US COURT ruling has opened the the way for Advanced Micro Devices to
compete with Intel in the lucrative market for microprocessor chips used in
the latest generation of personal computers. This follows a US judge's
decision to set aside the verdict reached last year in a copyright dispute
between the two companies and order a new trial.
The ruling means AMD could immediately begin production of a clone of
Intel's top-selling 486 microprocessor chip, rather than having to develop
its own version of the 'microcode' software instructions that control the
chip. The company is expected to announce its plans today.
Competition between Intel and AMD in the 486 market could lead to lower
prices for the devices and personal computers in which they are used,
analysts predicted.
AMD already sells its own version of Intel's earlier 386 microprocessor and
has claimed more than half of the world market for that device.
However, the 386 is rapidly being displaced by the more powerful 486 as the
standard microprocessor for desk-top computers.
AMD has developed its own version of the 486, but has been prevented from
introducing the product by the outcome of last year's trial, in which the
court rejected its claims that it had the right to use Intel's microcode
under the terms of a 1976 agreement between the two companies.

FT  19 APR 93 / Berisford bid for C&amp;J Clark detailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
C&amp;J Clark, the UK shoe manufacturer riven by board dissent, is poised to
inform shareholders of the details of a bid from Berisford International,
the property and agribusiness company.
The bid is believed to include a clause whereby Berisford would have the
right to purchase the assets and brands of Clark if it wins more than 50 per
cent of the company, but does not achieve outright control.
Berisford is reported to have made an offer of about 205p per share, which
values Clark at Pounds 158m, against the latest trading price of 90p.
The board met on Friday to approve the final details of a circular which
will recommend the bid price as fair and reasonable to Clark's 4,000
shareholders early this week.
However, three of the 11-strong board are not recommending the offer, with
one further abstention.
The sale is being opposed by a group of shareholders and board members who
claim to represent at least 30 per cent of the company.
Berisford was optimistic of winning the support of Clark's shareholders. 'I
have every confidence that this fair, reasonable and recommended offer will
be accepted by Clark shareholders,' said Mr Alan Bowkett, Berisford's chief
executive.
He said that the problems of corporate governance which have plagued Clark
for many years would continue if the Berisford bid failed. 'We are offering
a solution to that problem,' he said.
At an extraordinary general meeting on May 7, shareholders will be asked to
vote on a sale of Clark's assets and brands to Berisford. If that is
approved, Berisford would then make a full offer for the company comprised
of cash, shares, or loan notes. If the offer does not win 90 per cent
approval, Berisford is expected to revert to the option to purchase the
assets and brands of the business at a price similar to the full offer.
Mr Michael Markham, who was a board appointee at the extraordinary general
meeting called by the rebels last autumn, said the bid was unacceptable.
'This is not in the spirit of the Companies Act. If this company was covered
under takeover rules, they could not do this and I hope shareholders will
fight every way they can to prevent it.'

FT  19 APR 93 / Company directors accused of greed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of Britain's largest organisation representing managers has accused
company directors and managers of greed after a survey by the organisation
showed that they received higher average pay increases than their employees
last year.
The survey, to be published today by the Institute of Management, finds that
directors' sal-aries rose 5.5 per cent on average, while managers' pay
increased 4.5 per cent. Directors' increases exceeded 10 per cent in some
sectors.
Mr Roger Young, director-general of the institute, said: 'Directors and to a
lesser extent managers are still receiving rises well over the rate of
inflation, even though up and down the country other employees are being
forced to take pay cuts and pay freezes.
'This situation cannot continue. Directors and senior managers must be seen
to take a lead when it comes to pay restraint if we are to beat this
recession. Employees are being asked to accept pay freezes and cuts - greedy
managers and directors should be prepared to swallow the same medicine.'
The biggest increase, 15.3 per cent, was for directors in chemicals and
allied industries. Other large average rises were 12.4 per cent for
directors in the public sector, 11.6 per cent in distribution and 10.9 per
cent in energy.
This year the government is seeking a 1.5 per cent pay rise limit on workers
in the public sector.
Managers in mechanical engineering and production received an average 9.6
per cent rise, while those in electrical engineering secured 8.2 per cent
and consultants 7.4 per cent.
The institute's survey covers 25,180 individuals in 392 companies employing
more than 2m people.

FT  19 APR 93 / Conspiracy fears mounton eve of Hani funeral: 15 are shot
dead as tension rises in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTEEN people, including three children, were killed and 12 wounded in
shootings in a black township near Johannesburg last night, as tension in
South Africa rose on the eve of today's funeral of the assassinated activist
Mr Chris Hani.
Tens of thousands of grieving blacks yesterday paid their last respects to
Mr Hani, whose body lay in state near Soweto. His funeral, one of the
largest political events ever in South Africa, comes as evidence is emerging
that his death may have been part of a right-wing conspiracy to destabilise
democracy talks.
In last night's shootings, black gunmen opened fire on people in the
township of Sebokeng. Police said the shootings started when the men killed
two people and stole their car, which was later found burnt out. A motive
for the attacks was not known.
The shootings heightened the atmosphere of emotion and turmoil as South
Africa prepared for Mr Hani's funeral, to be held in the mainly white,
working-class town of Boksburg, where he was shot by a white assassin on
April 10. Boksburg residents have been barricading their homes and putting
up razor wire for fear of clashes between black mourners and local whites.
A crowd of 30,000 gathered to honour Mr Hani as his body lay in an open
casket at a soccer stadium outside Soweto. They sang songs in praise of
Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the African National Congress
military wing.
ANC leaders filed past the coffin of the man who once commanded Umkhonto in
exile. Some touched the body which was dressed in military fatigues and
surrounded by flowers.
Police meanwhile interrogated a prominent right-wing white, Mr Clive
Derby-Lewis, who they said was a suspect in Mr Hani's assassination.
Mr Derby-Lewis is a leading figure in the Conservative party, the official
parliamentary opposition, and member of the advisory President's Council,
part of the government's executive branch. He regularly made news headlines
for racist comments, including an incident in 1989 when he commented 'what a
pity' on hearing that an aircraft had braked to avoid a black man on the
runway at Johannesburg airport.
His arrest raises fears that the murder was part of a conspiracy extending
beyond the lunatic white fringe to the top of the right-wing establishment.
The other suspect, Mr Janusz Walus, is a member of the ultra-right Afrikaner
Resistance Movement.
Political analysts say involvement of the Conservative party, which polled
800,000 votes in last year's white referendum, would be far more worrying
than that of the AWB, a militarist organisation which has vowed to carry out
a 'Third Boer War' against blacks. As well as Mr Derby-Lewis, police held a
second right-wing supporter, who shot two black protesters on Saturday.
The murder of Mr Hani has proved a strategic coup for the ultra-right. The
resulting violence has pushed whites further to the right, weakening the
ruling National party, and the ultra-right has lost its image of inactivity.

FT  19 APR 93 / Italian PM to quit as voters signal support for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister, said last night he intended to
resign amid the country's widening corruption scandals, as voters appeared
to signal strong support for electoral reform.
Mr Amato, whose shaky four-party coalition has led Italy through almost 10
months of unprecedented political upheaval, will consult President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro today. But he indicated he was ready to lead a new
short-lived government.
Asked in a television interview whether he would head the next cabinet, Mr
Amato said: 'It would be completely wrong for me to speak about it when my
government is about to resign. I know my name is being mentioned and I would
be ready to do it for a short while, if necessary.'
Mr Amato, who said earlier that he believed his government had reached its
end, will see the president immediately after polls close in the two-day
series of referendums on Italy's electoral practices.
With a strong turnout, voters appeared to be showing their backing for
electoral reforms and the ending of state funding for political parties. The
referendums on those issues were the first national test of public reaction
to the wave of corruption scandals which has seen the arrest of some of
Italy's leading politicians and businessmen.
Italians have been voting in eight separate referendums, which are also
about abolition of three ministries and reform of the laws on drugs, the
environment and state bank appointments.
Although exit polls will not be available until later today, it is expected
that there will be support for the two main referendums, which concern
changing the electoral system for the senate, the upper house of parliament,
and abolishing state funding for parties.
At 5pm yesterday, 30.7 per cent of the electorate had voted, 8 percentage
points more than at the same stage in the last referendum two years ago.
In an address to Confindustria, the employers' federation, Mr Amato
emphasised that the mandate of the next government would be to push through
electoral reform.
Political observers are divided as to whether Mr Scalfaro will ask Mr Amato
to stay on, leading a government that might be bolstered by the small
Radical party and a few independents, or seek a wider coalition under an
'institutional' figure such as the leader of the chamber of deputies or the
senate.

FT  19 APR 93 / Matrix purchaser accused of default on payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Iraqi-owned company that sold Matrix Churchill, the former Coventry
machine tool manufacturer, two years ago is taking legal action against the
buyer for allegedly defaulting on a staged payment due in January.
Matrix Churchill was bought from TMG Engineering, its Iraqi-owned parent, by
Automation Investments, the holding company for BSA Tools, the Birmingham
lathe maker, in February 1991 at the time of the Gulf war.
The deal was a complicated transaction, hampered by the imposition of UN
sanctions and the freezing of Iraqi assets in the UK.
Details of the deal have never been disclosed by the buyer, but it is
understood to have involved a Pounds 1.8m payment due at the end of January
with a further payment of Pounds 1.2m if the net asset value of the company
rose above Pounds 6m at a certain stage.
The payments would have gone into a bank account supervised by the Bank of
England. The account would remain frozen until the sanctions against Iraq
were lifted, but the sellers say that they have not yet received any payment
from Automation Investments.
Mr Keith Bailey, chairman of Automation Investments, said an initial
consideration was paid for the company but he could not give details at
present. Mr Bailey said: 'I can't tell you precisely what has been paid
simply because the contract has clauses of confidentiality.'
He added: 'I don't think there is anything owing to them under the terms of
the contract at the moment.'
Mr Robert Koshaba, who is assisting TMG, said: 'I am not aware of one single
penny that has been paid.' He confirmed that legal action had been taken
under British civil law and expected a judicial hearing next month. The
action was between TMG and Automation Investments.
'There is money to be paid and it hasn't been paid,' he said.
He added: 'I think the Iraqi owners were very reasonable. They got kicked
out, they sold the damned thing and the least they would have expected is
that they get paid.'
Matrix Churchill itself was placed in the hands of receivers in July 1992.
The lathe-making operations were sold back to Automation Investments. The
thread grinding and spare parts operations were bought by Transfer
Technology, the specialist engineering group chaired by Mr Geoffrey
Robinson, Labour MP for Coventry North West.
Mr Koshaba said the receivership had complicated the original sale
agreement, since it affected the asset value of the company. That had a
bearing on the second staged payment.

FT  19 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Waste Management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Solid first quarter figures today from Waste Management may stop the rot in
its share price this year, but the shares peaked against the US market in
1990. That suggests a creeping disillusionment. Recession is partly to blame
by reducing the volume of waste - especially high-margin industrial waste -
churned out by the US economy. But more efficient companies will produce
less rubbish and effluent even when the economy turns. Over-capacity in
areas such as incineration may thus persist beyond recession. Tougher
environmental standards are also steering waste management companies towards
unknown areas such as recycling.
Recession aside, the outlook in Europe should be brighter. Legislation in
most European countries is some way behind the US. Profitable landfill
should have years of good growth before regulations become too onerous.
Quality landfill sites and incinerators are also in short supply, so prices
might hold up better through the downturn. Yet shares in Waste Management
International, which operates in Europe and Asia, are well below the price
at which 20 per cent of the equity was offered last year.
The US flavour of the share register may be to blame. A stronger dollar cuts
the value of European earnings to US investors. The shares of UK companies
which paid full prices for a position in waste - notably Severn Trent and
Wessex Water - may escape unscathed. But weak prices and the proposed UK
government levy on landfill dumping are uncomfortable echoes of the US.

FT  19 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Petroleum Revenue Tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BP's annual report, published three days before the Budget, highlights the
words Profitability, Reputation and Teamwork on the cover. Conspiracy
theorists will doubtless observe BP is the most spectacular beneficiary of
the Budget reform of Petroleum Revenue Tax, and draw their own conclusions.
The company vigorously denies it put the Treasury up to the changes - or
even that it had any idea such windfall gains were on the way.
Still, the improved cash flow comes in handy at a difficult time. The
dividend cut, asset sales and reduced capital expenditure are needed to stem
the cash outflow and cut gearing. Even so progress will be slow. The company
has set its face against a rights issue, partly it seems to keep the focus
on increasing efficiency. With borrowings of Dollars 15bn every little
helps.
That benefit to BP may be enough to sink opposition to the reforms. Given
that the proposals have survived in-tact in the published finance bill,
lobbying seems to have had little impact. BP argues that the changes are
good for development in the North Sea. Wasteful drilling will be eliminated
and big new finds may be brought on stream quickly because companies will
only have to pay corporation tax on the revenue. However, some small-er
prospects seem destined not be investigated. It would also be naive to
assume the government will be content to tax new finds at 33 per cent if
discoveries like those west of Shetland prove to be large and very
profitable.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T's application for a telephone licence in the UK is pretty clearly a
response to BT's similar application in the US a few weeks ago. It seems
likely that the next move on this crowded chess board will be an attempt to
get government approval for AT&amp;T and BT to lease lines in each other's
markets. International calls could then be handled by one company along the
entire route, bypassing the current cartel system.
In the first instance both AT&amp;T and BT will be interested in operating this
for the largest corporate customers, and call rates will fall sharply. But
there are wider implications. The UK-US link is already the busiest
intercontinental route and it may suck more business out of continental
Europe as companies re-route calls to the US via cheaper UK lines.
Continental telecoms companies may thus be forced to open up to similar
leasing deals to avoid losing call traffic. Such pressure is likely to
spread, and the cartel system will slowly crumble.
That is a mixed blessing. International calls are highly profitable, so
while AT&amp;T will not have to give up profits to other national telecom
companies, overall revenues will be under pressure. Large companies will
need growing call volumes or increasing market share to benefit. AT&amp;T and BT
clearly think they have the muscle to win. Presumably BT's enthusiasm can
only be increased by the thought that in the early stages AT&amp;T will go after
the same corporate customers which Mercury has tried to make its own.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was well-prepared for Forte's dividend cut last week, thanks
partly to a string of items in the weekend press and a shift in sentiment
among analysts in the previous week. There is no evidence at all that Forte
deliberately set out to leak the news, but this is a pattern which recurs in
the UK equity market. The British Aerospace rights issue of 1991 is another
celebrated case in point. Perhaps the frequency with which such corporate
events are foreshadowed simply reflects the hard work of British broking
analysts. To the trained eye, Forte's cut looked obvious after the debacle
at Queens Moat.
But that does not alter the fact that brokers' ability to predict depends on
close and regular contacts with companies over a long period of time. To
some in the City these cosy relationships appear at risk in the proposed new
insider legislation. That would be damaging, the argument runs. There is
nothing investors like less than a surprise. When news is filtered out
slowly there is time to adjust and understand. Share prices are less
volatile as a result. Even small investors benefit from the absence of
shocks.
Or do they? To those with the long horizons of many small investors it makes
no difference how a decision on a dividend or a rights issue reaches the
public domain. Over time the effect on the share price will be the same. The
people who have more interest in speedy information are active institutional
investors to whom broker research is directed. That is fine when the
research contains original conclusions based on publicly available
information. In the context of the new legislation it is more awkward to
defend research that is simply a collection of semi-private hints, nods and
winks relayed to an exclusive clientele.

FT  19 APR 93 / Ultra-right suspected of Hani assassination: Evidence of
plot to hold up democracy in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENS OF thousands of grieving South African blacks paid their last respects
yesterday to assassinated guerrilla leader Mr Chris Hani, as evidence
emerged that his death may have been part a rightwing conspiracy to
destabilise democracy talks.
Mr Hani, idolised by township blacks as one of the greatest heroes of their
liberation struggle, lay in state throughout the day in an open casket at a
soccer stadium outside Soweto. As the 30,000-strong crowd sang songs in
praise of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the African National
Congress military wing, ANC leaders filed past the coffin of the man who
once commanded Umkhonto in exile. Some touched the body which was dressed in
military fatigues and surrounded by flowers. Female mourners wept.
The elder statesmen of the ANC, former leader Mr Oliver Tambo and long-time
political prisoner Mr Walter Sisulu, led the sad cortege. Mr Nelson Mandela
viewed the body last night.
After an all-night vigil at the stadium, Mr Hani's body will be buried later
today in the mainly white, working-class town of Boksburg, where he was shot
by a white assassin on April 10. It will be one of the largest political
events ever in South Africa, and may spark clashes between white residents
and black mourners.
As Boksburg residents prepared for today's funeral, barricading homes and
drafting in friends to protect their property, police were interrogating a
prominent rightwing white, Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, who they said was a suspect
in Mr Hani's assassination.
Mr Derby-Lewis is a leading figure in the Conservative party, the official
parliamentary opposition, and member of the advisory President's Council,
part of the government's executive branch.
Mr Derby-Lewis regularly made news headlines for his racist comments,
including an incident in 1989 when he commented, 'what a pity' on hearing
that an aircraft had braked to avoid a black man on the runway at
Johannesburg airport.
His arrest raises fears that the murder was part of a conspiracy which
extends well beyond the lunatic white fringe - the other suspect, Mr Janusz
Walus, is a member of the ultra-right neo-Nazi group, the Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) - to the top of the
rightwing establishment.
Political analysts say the involvement of the Conservative party, which
polled 800,000 votes in last year's white referendum, is far more worrying
than that of the AWB, an militarist organisation which has vowed to carry
out what it calls the 'Third Boer War' against blacks. As well as Mr
Derby-Lewis, police were holding a second rightwing supporter, who murdered
two black protesters on Saturday.
The murder of Mr Hani has proved a strategic coup for the ultra-right.
Resulting violence has pushed whites further to the right, weakening the
ruling National party; and the ultra-right has lost its inactive image.
However, the ANC says it will continue to negotiate with the Conservative
party and the transition to democracy seems likely to be accelerated as a
result.

FT  19 APR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's trade results
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD has been waiting several months to discover Mr Clinton's trade
policy. Now, after his meeting with the Japanese prime minister, it knows
what it is. Mr Clinton believes in managed trade. Many will try to play the
dangers down, noting that US demands are limited to its trade with Japan.
They may even feel pleased that Japan is under attack. Such complacency
would prove a mistake. 'Results-oriented' trade would not be limited to
trade with Japan. Nor would its effects be confined to the relationship
between the US and Japan. Its poison would spread far wider.
The president's complaints start with Japan's bilateral surplus of Dollars
49bn (Pounds 32bn), which he deems 'unacceptable'. But he is not concerned
with that surplus alone. He wants to obtain specific results in specific
sectors of the economy as well. But the president is also supposed to
believe in free trade. How, one wonders, can someone who believes in free
trade fail to see that bilateral imbalances are a natural consequence of
multilateral trade? How can he fail to realise that a market economy can
only generate government-mandated outcomes after it ceases to be a market
economy?
If this new approach to trade were indeed restricted to Japan, many might
feel it has much to commend it. The Japanese political system needs to be
shaken out of its current torpor. The world also needs imaginative Japanese
political leadership. For that matter, so does Japan. The Clinton demarche
will certainly disturb Japanese politics. Perhaps it will galvanise Japan to
a suitably creative response.
Unfortunately for those who feel this way, the effects of the envisaged
approach are unlikely to be restricted to US-Japanese relations. One reason
is that it would impair the integrity of Gatt rules and norms. The figleaf
of anti-dumping covered the nakedness of the semiconductor pact. If the US
were to act without such cover, why should others take these rules
seriously? Yet another reason is that the European Community would seek to
follow any precedent set by the US. Sales would then be won by competitive
coercion, not by market competition. A final reason is that these 'voluntary
import expansions', as Professor Jagdish Bhagwati has called them, would
spread to trade with other countries, just as voluntary export restraints
started with Japanese exports and spread to the exports of other countries.
The ideal of a rules-governed, global market economy - the aim of half a
century of trade diplomacy - would be in ruins.
Japan should suggest a powerful Gatt mechanism as an alternative to managed
trade. If this idea does not divert the US from its course, others must come
to Japan's aid. They should do so regardless of what they feel about Japan,
because more than its fate is at stake. Japan must say 'no' to import
targets. It will need the help of other major trading powers if it is to
make its 'no' stick.

FT  19 APR 93 / Observer: Olympic bid?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the mysteries of the 13-year-old London Marathon is why Chris
Brasher, the Olympic gold medallist who has masterminded the highly popular
event from the very beginning, has never been honoured.
In fact it seems that he was offered a gong back in the 1980s but turned it
down on the grounds that he didn't like Margaret Thatcher, the prime
minister at the time. 'That bloody woman did nothing for British sport,'
says Brasher in yesterday's Mail on Sunday. And in case the current
sport-loving prime minister thinks of renewing the offer, Brasher is of the
view that as he has to deal with politicians one shouldn't accept honours
from people you deal with. How honest.
However, there is a theory abroad - not denied by Brasher himself - that he
would like the chairmanship of the British Olympic Association if it was on
offer. The problem is that he is now 64 and the new BOA chief Craig Reedie a
mere 51 and digging in for a decade's service.
It has been rumoured that Brasher's Olympic ambitions are now sublimated
into vigorous support for Manchester's bid to stage the 2000 Games. But if
Manchester gets the nod in September, Brasher could re-emerge as a runner
for the top job on the grounds that it would be nice to have an Olympian in
charge, especially if Britain is going to host the turn-of-the-century
games.

Things must be looking up at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the worldwide advertising
giant. The Saatchi Brothers are starting to generate Big Ideas again.
Maurice Saatchi, who once toyed with the idea of buying Midland Bank for
Pounds 3bn, appears to be getting itchy fingers once more.
Ivan Fallon, the Saatchis'J well-connected biographer, reported in
yesterday's Sunday Times that Maurice wants to buy Express Newspapers, the
two national flagships in Lord Stevens' United Newspapers empire. A price of
around Pounds 200m has been mooted but this is a fraction of what they are
worth and there is no sign of any backers.
It sounds like this might have been one of those rather long cocktail
conversations that got out of hand. Lord Stevens has chatted with Maurice
but is still not sure whether he was joking or not.
Could this be a smokescreen while Sir Nicholas and Lady Lloyd, the husband
and wife team editing the Daily and Sunday Express, dream up their rumoured
management buy-out?

Is it true that things really go better with Coke? That seems to be the
assumption of Herb Allen, president of Allen &amp; Company, the slick New
York-based investment bank to the entertainment industry.
Allen has recruited the 66-year-old Donald Keough, the president of
Coca-Cola who retired last week after 40 years with the world's famous soft
drinks firm, to be chairman of Allen &amp; Company.
He joins a cast of executives who were previously involved with Columbia
Pictures, the Hollywood studio that Coca-Cola sold to Sony in 1988. Last
year Coca-Cola hired as a media and advertising consultant Allen's friend
Mike Ovitz, whose Creative Artists Agency is the most influential talent
firm in Hollywood.

So why has Britain's Engineering Union abandoned its old stomping ground of
Eastbourne in favour of the more bracing atmosphere of Llandudno for its
annual conference this week?
The official line is that the facilities are much better in North Wales. But
Observer hears that the decision to give Eastbourne a miss was strengthened
by the embarrassing antics of the mayor of the popular Sussex resort at this
year's conference of the union's women.
The sisters were celebrating their 70th such conference, but their festive
mood turned sour after His Worship's opening remarks. 'Looking at you, I
think you must have all attended the first such conference,' he joked.

questions, confident that the nation would hear his answers rather than some
biased hack's version of them.
The need for a change does not result solely from prime ministerial concern
about the bad press he has been getting lately. He feels that the present
'lobby' system is outdated and inappropriate for a government supposedly
commited to openness. The question is: how can the system be reformed?
The biggest stumbling block is sensitivity over the convention that
ministers are accountable to parliament. MPs do not like hearing about
important announcements being made publicly to newspapers or on television
before they are told.
The other problem, which might not yet have been noticed in Downing Street,
is that formal White House press conferences appear to be a thing of the
past under the new administration in Washington.
Indeed, it is rather ironic that whilst Bill Clinton can hold his own better
than most at formal press conferences, his media advisers are now advocating
a much more targeted approach to getting the presidential message across.

FT  19 APR 93 / Leading Article: The centre holds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUNERAL today of Mr Chris Hani, the assassinated African National
Congress leader, is as momentous an event as any in the country's history.
When Mr Nelson Mandela walked to freedom, millions of black South Africans
welcomed an icon who had come to life. Three violent years later, they are
mourning a man they see as a martyr, and celebration has turned to
frustration and bitterness, anger and sorrow.
These are times fraught with danger: extremists have drawn blood, black
township youth are impatient for change, and the ANC's mass action campaign
for early elections will inevitably raise the temperature. So far, however,
the political centre holds.
Some 28 deaths since the assassination are known to have been politically
related. It is 28 deaths too many; but well below the weekly average this
year. Last Thursday's tragedy in Soweto, when four demonstrators were killed
and hundreds injured by police fire, illustrated again that the security
forces' first instinct is to shoot, often without provocation.
But on a day when more than 1m protesters took to the streets, tragedy could
have become catastrophe were it not for the marchers' restraint, the
presence of ANC marshalls, and the moderating role of the country's
political leaders.
Mr Mandela has been at his best, striking the right note in a television
address to the nation last Wednesday as important for its symbolism as its
substance. It not only confirmed his elder statesman status that, for a
while at least, transcended his party loyalty; it was recognition of the
reality that underlies the negotiating process: white South Africa can no
longer govern on its own.
For his part, President F W de Klerk has been treading a tightrope,
resisting calls for a crackdown and countrywide state of emergency from the
right, but reinforcing security where needed. And Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, accompanied his tribute to
Mr Hani with an appeal for calm.
What above all may have kept black anger in check, however, is the progress
apparently made at the negotiating table. The expectation that the talks,
due to resume soon, will set a date for elections was a vital safety valve.
Optimism may be misplaced, for key issues - control of the security forces
during the extended transition; how executive power is to be shared in the
envisaged coalition - have yet to be resolved. Additionally, Chief
Buthelezi, who seeks what amounts to autonomy for Natal, has not been
accommodated.
It is well nigh inevitable that there will be further strains on stability,
whether assassinations or political violence. But unless the next round of
talks produce tangible progress, there will be no safety valve. The real
test of South Africa's centre may be yet to come.

FT  19 APR 93 / Doubts about the price of peace: Israel's cautious approach
to Middle East talks could strengthen the hand of extremists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the nature of Middle East politics that the closer Israel gets to
achieving most of what it has sought since independence, the less appealing
is the prospect of having to pay the political price.
The extent to which its Arab neighbours, for four decades implacable
enemies, have become supplicants has never been more obvious. Their refusal
to resume negotiations with Israel in Washington as requested by the US,
cannot disguise the fact that eventually, probably within a few days, they
will be back at the table.
Four months of protests and appeals to the international community over the
mass deportation by Israel of Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and
Gaza, and warnings that the process could be close to collapse, have
achieved little. Just how little was emphasised yesterday by Israel's
refusal to consider doing anything more to make it easier for the Arab
delegations to continue negotiations.
No country is more anxious to resume than Syria, so recently the main
standard-bearer of anti-Israel rhetoric, and all are propelled by the same
reluctant acceptance that the gains needed to bolster their own domestic
political credibility will only come through negotiation.
Yet the sombre mood in Jerusalem appears to recognise little of this.
Eighteen months into the peace process, the question that will increasingly
have to be addressed is whether the Israeli electorate feels the need to pay
any sizeable price for a formal peace. Or, put another way, whether an
Israeli government feels it can ask that price and still be confident of
surviving.
The doubts have been fostered in part by the widespread public
disillusionment with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister. He won
last summer's general election on the dual pledge, appealing to both hawks
and doves, that he would deliver peace and security. So far, he has done
neither.
Worse than that, by seeking to fulfil his pledge to crush Arab defiance in
the occupied territories, Mr Rabin may have set back the prospects of
reaching an agreement with more moderate Palestinians, enhanced the status
of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two factions opposed to the entire process,
and contributed to the sense of insecurity within Israel itself.
Nothing has done more to heighten this than the wave of random stabbings in
Israel carried out by individual Arabs, acting for the most part without
apparent political direction. The attacks appear to spring from the same
well of frustration that has marked the relentless decline of the Gaza Strip
into impoverished semi-anarchy.
More Israelis have officially been encouraged to carry guns, more Jewish
settlers in the occupied territories have extracted their own revenge, and
the government has now imposed an indefinite ban on most Palestinians
entering Israel proper, thereby cutting them off from their work and
worsening economic conditions in the territories.
At the same time, Mr Rabin and his colleagues insist that the best way to
break the cycle of violence is by improving living conditions in the West
Bank and Gaza and by negotiating a peace agreement. But even if the public
fully accepted the argument, it would not lessen the demand that security
has to be the first priority. And Mr Rabin has to assume that the more he
gives at the negotiating table, the more vociferous his domestic opponents
will become and the more violent extremist Arabs will be in their efforts to
derail the entire process.
How courageous Mr Rabin will be in attempting to break out of this dilemma
should become clear in the next few weeks. For the first time since the the
opening conference in October 1991, this next and ninth negotiating session
will be open-ended. President Bill Clinton has also promised that the US
will be a 'full partner' in the process, which means that, unlike the
previous Bush administration, it will actively seek to bridge differences
between the delegations and put forward its own proposals.
Nowhere could this approach bear fruit more quickly than in the bilateral
Syrian-Israeli negotiations where a substantial degree of understanding has
already been reached. Mr Rabin and his colleagues know that if they agree to
a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, occupied in 1967, Syria is
prepared to sign a peace treaty.
'The issue is now largely technical,' said a senior Egyptian official. 'It
is a question of timing, of security arrangements, of agreeing what, from a
Syrian point of view amounts to full withdrawal, and from Israel's position,
the content and commitment to a full peace. But the essence of what Syria is
offering is thoroughly understood.'
The Israeli government, however, is very far from throwing its hat into the
air over an offer which, even two years ago, would have been greeted with
incredulity. A generally defensive Mr Rabin understandably wants to delay
the moment that he stirs the wrath of the right wing in general and the
settler community in particular.
In Mr Binjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the opposition Likud, he faces an
opponent well versed in stoking public fears with simplistic assertions.
Nothing better illustrated Mr Netanyahu's style than his opposition to Mr
Rabin's concession last week that Mr Faisal al-Husseini, who has been the
key behind-the-scenes co-ordinator for the Palestinians, could become the
leader of their delegation.
Mr al-Husseini comes from East Jerusalem. According to Mr Netanyahu, merely
talking to him indicated that Israel was willing to consider handing back
the eastern half of the holy city, captured by Israel in 1967 and
subsequently annexed. However gross the misrepresentation of Mr Rabin's
intentions, it is but a small foretaste of what will follow should the prime
minister move towards a deal on the Golan Heights, including the removal of
nearly 10,000 Jewish settlers.
Such a move would simultaneously sound alarm bells throughout the West Bank
and Gaza, where well over 100,000 Jews have settled, and which for Mr
Netanyahu and the Likud is an essential God-given part of Israel. Not only
would the settlers and Likud fight concessions to the Palestinians which
even hinted at any eventual loss of control, but will hope within three
years to have captured the government. The new electoral system, under which
the prime minister will be directly elected, may well favour the younger Mr
Netanyahu and his polished television skills.
It is another irony of Middle East politics that increasingly Mr Rabin is
finding an identity of interests with Mr Yassir Arafat and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation. Labour leaders acknowledge that progress in the
peace negotiations would provide the platform needed to win the next
election. Mr Arafat similarly needs urgently to show the benefit of
negotiations if he is to halt the erosion of support for the PLO in the
occupied territories.
President Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, their
plate heaped high with complex international crises, are ultimately stuck
with the task of making the two sides understand their mutual dependence. If
neither can publicly concede to the other, they can separately deliver
concessions to Mr Clinton as Egypt and Israel did for President Carter
during the Camp David negotiations in 1978.
Successive US administrations have operated on the basis that Israel should
be reassured and often rewarded in advance for offers of co-operation in the
future. Mr Rabin's election victory was greeted by President Bush last
August with US pledges to guarantee Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in loans.
His meeting with Mr Clinton last month brought reassuring political
reaffirmation of strategic co-operation, and assurances that the annual
Dollars 3bn in military and civil aid would continue.
Mr Clinton announced then that he was convinced Mr Rabin was ready to take
chances for peace. However, the interpretation of what constitutes political
risk may not translate well from Washington to Jerusalem, and Mr Rabin so
far has shown little enthusiasm for anything more than the most narrow
definition. Until he broadens its scope, all parties to the peace process
will remain vulnerable to the extremists working for its collapse.

FT  19 APR 93 / Leading Article: Landing capital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD BANK is being usurped. Its reports, while still interesting
reading, no longer provide the only authoritative judgment of the
performance and prospects of developing countries. In these days of
increasingly mobile global capital flows, the judgments of international
investors are more visible, and more damning for those countries that fail
to make the grade.
The World Bank's latest report, Global Economic Prospects and the Developing
Countries, provides a fascinating appraisal of the recent explosion in
private-sector financial flows to developing countries, both portfolio
capital and foreign direct investment (FDI). The main success story of
recent years is the emergence of Latin America, phoenix-like, from the ashes
of the commercial bank debt crisis of the early 1980s. It now has a chance
of joining east Asia as a second engine of developing country growth, with
the Bank expecting Latin American growth to double this decade compared with
the 1980s.
The combination of debt reduction with liberal financial and trade policies,
some of which would put the US and the European Community to shame, has
transformed investment opportunities for global investors in Latin America.
Flows of portfolio equity capital to Latin America have grown from Dollars
434m (Pounds 287m) in 1989 to Dollars 5.6bn in 1992. Mexico, Brazil and
Argentina, along with China, Malaysia and Thailand, are also the prime
beneficiaries of the renewed flow of foreign direct investment to developing
countries. This has risen by 50 per cent since 1990 and now accounts for
over a fifth of global FDI, compared with 12 per cent in 1987.
Greater exposure to international capital flows brings costs too. Changes in
the world economy, or in the judgment of investors about domestic policies,
can have devastating effects on economic management for countries dependent
on short-term portfolio capital. These judgments are also a fact of
developed country life, as the British government can testify. It is better
to respond to market fears about the dangers of an overvalued real exchange
rate or a fiscal crisis than wait for the damage to be done.
The answer cannot be autarky. For, as the Bank points out, the alternative
to financial integration is not self-sufficiency but capital flight. Much of
the new capital inflow into Latin America is, in fact, the return of capital
that had taken wing when domestic prospects looked particularly bleak.
By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa is still trapped in the vicious circle of
heavy external debts, external non-viability and domestic economic decline.
The Bank estimates that the stock of flight capital from sub-Saharan Africa
is a staggering 80 per cent of gross domestic product. Only a package of
debt reduction and radical domestic reform can revive prospects of these
unhappy countries. One of the World Bank's prime tasks remains unfulfilled.

FT  19 APR 93 / Personal View: Private functions in public education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EVAN DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's private sector is being asked to help build tunnels under the
Channel, railways across London and possibly even jails and hospitals. It is
unfortunate, then, that it is being made to feel so unwelcome in the sector
that needs it most - state education.
There are plenty of good reasons for thinking that there is a role for
government in education. But all these reasons lead to the same conclusion -
the primary government role should be to pay the bills. The state need not
be in the business of running schools or even in making important
educational decisions. These are both activities at which the authorities -
at local and national level - have failed to excel, and both can perfectly
well be devolved to private agents. In fashionable jargon, splitting the
functions of educational purchasing from the functions of educational
provision could improve the incentives of suppliers and improve the
allocation of resources.
The key to creating a more privatised system of education lies in the
management of capacity. It is decisions about which schools should open,
which should expand and which should close that need to be delegated to
mechanisms of the marketplace, rather than to the might of government. The
fact that J Sainsbury has been able to open new stores, and that the Co-Op
has had to close them, has at least fuelled a process of improvement in
retailing standards over many years. If only the same improvements in
schools were evident over that period.
Unfortunately, if we want capacity decisions of schools to be made on a
similar basis to those of supermarkets the management of capacity needs to
be taken out of the hands of the authorities. And so must the discretionary
allocation of capital.
New schools should be allowed to open - as long as they can attract a
licence from educational inspectors - and old schools should be allowed to
expand, without the permission of the secretary of state. In either case,
schools should be allowed to use their own capital, or sometimes borrow it
from the state. If they can then attract enough pupils, they should be
rewarded with an annual return large enough to compensate their lenders for
the cost of capital.
Meanwhile, existing state schools should be told to use their assets
efficiently, and that if they fail to educate the number of students for
which their capital was designed - if they become overendowed with capital
for their size - they will face a penalty in the form of a reduced
maintenance grant. It would not be impossible to design practical systems of
financial control that deal with the undoubted complexities of the education
sector, while nevertheless retaining the essential underlying mechanisms
that ensure dynamism in the supermarket sector.
Unfortunately, the 1993 Education Bill leaves control of all capital in the
hands of administration. The reason that the Department for Education feels
such a strong need to maintain control of schools' capacity is its near
obsession with what it calls surplus places. Quite apart from the fact that
in a system of parental choice, it is inevitable that there have to be
surplus places (it would otherwise be quite fortuitous if a significant
proportion of parents could exercise much of a choice), the method chosen
for dealing with surplus capacity is hopelessly overcentralised.
If private promoters were to be encouraged into schools, perhaps using their
own capital, what would the state have to pay them? At the moment,
government annually spends about Pounds 2,000 a student on the running costs
involved in teaching, with some small portion of this devoted to capital
investment; but the state also devotes a stock of about Pounds 8,000 worth
of land, buildings and equipment to each student. At a 10 per cent rate of
return on that capital, the true 'market price' of educational services in
the state sector is near Pounds 3,000 a head. At that rate, private capital
may find it attractive to enter the market.
Unfortunately, the thrust of John Patten's Education Bill is not an attempt
to replace local education authorities with private agents in education
decision-making, but to replace local education authorities with John
Patten. It is possible that the superior administrative skills of Mr Patten
and his agents will exert a beneficial influence on the schools system, but
it is equally possible that his detachment from educational realities will
undermine it. Replacing one set of administrators with another set of
administrators is not as effective as dispensing with the administrators
altogether.

FT  19 APR 93 / Letter: Trade route through Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AHMET ERSOY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Steve LeVine is not entirely accurate when he says that Armenia's
efforts to find a trade route through Turkey have been hampered by that
country's long enmity with Armenia ('Armenia battles on two fronts,' April
7).
In fact a certain amount of trade from the Caucasus and central Asia has
already reached the outside world through the Turkish Black Sea port of
Trabzon. Since Armenia declared its independence nearly two years ago,
Turkey has worked hard at building up good relations with this country.
This involved a good deal of pragmatism, not least since it is only few
years since Armenian terrorists gunned down more than 40 Turkish diplomats,
members of their families, and staff in cold blood in cities across the
world. Some of the Armenian leadership have welcomed Turkey's attitude.
Turkey watches with concern the Armenian attacks which began in
Nagorno-Karabakh and later escalated in other parts of Azberbaijani
territories, and wishes the killings and the bloodshed to be stopped
immediately.
In spite of this, it is hard to find anyone in Ankara who does not believe
that there is much more to be gained by co-operation, including trade, with
Armenia.

FT  19 APR 93 / Letter: EBRD - a meaningless comparison of estimates and the
need for broader remit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER MANSER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The major failing of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development in the ex-Soviet Union and eastern Europe was not discussed in
your article ('Spending at the European Bank', April 13). It relates to the
rules, approved by its founder governments, that 60 per cent of the loans go
to private-sector projects and 40 per cent to the public sector.
Private sector loans/equity investments are in effect only being made by the
EBRD to bankable projects with a substantial export component and with a
western joint venture partner. However, western investors do not want to
invest because the risks are too high and few east European enterprises have
so far been privatised. In essence there are too few good projects to fund.
To be successful, the bank needs to be able to fund smaller projects run by
state-owned enterprises meeting local as well as export needs. It needs to
be pro-active to be able to fund feasibility studies and then bring in one
or several western joint venture partners to manage and restructure the
operation.

   From Mr DAVID H RUMLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On reading the article on the Bank of European Reconstruction and
Development, and its London headquarters ('The bank that like to say yes -
to itself', April 13), I was surprised to find a figure I had given as a
general estimate for fitting out a city institution building was being used
as part of a detailed article investigating a particular project.
Though I was pleased to see reference in the article to the estimate
containing neither furnishings nor mechanical and electrical equipment, its
use as a comparison to the very specific criteria of the EBRD's headquarters
renders it totally meaningless.
When looking at an individual case such as the EBRD's headquarters, there is
a whole range of specific needs that should be considered. The items
generally include security, boardrooms, computer and telecommunications
facilities, conference halls, etc, all of which add considerably to the cost
of normal fitting out.
Gleeds has worked on a number of projects throughout Europe with the EBRD.
Its very use of such firms as Gleeds points to its acknowledgement of the
importance of the correct apportionment and control of funds.

FT  19 APR 93 / Letter: Keep talent from emigrating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AMORY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer argues persuasively ('Convenient cracks in the wall',
April 15) for an EC 'managed immigration' policy. But by syphoning off those
with 'the needed skills and allowing them to come in legally', western
Europe would be depriving eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (FSU)
of precisely the individuals - hard-working, youthful and skilled - that are
essential to economic regeneration in these regions. More than 8,000 Russian
scientists have emigrated to New York alone in the last two years. Multiply
that across the entire FSU's territory and sphere of influence, and it is
clear that managed immigration will degrade even further the ability of the
ex-communist world ever to catch up with the west, which will simply feed
the emigration cycle later on. A more powerful case can be made for
targeting western aid to jobs that 'anchor' talented people from the FSU
where they can best do good - in their home countries.

FT  19 APR 93 / Northern light at the end of tunnel: A ray of hope in the
Nordic banking crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the depressed world of Nordic banking a little good news goes a long way.
So the reduced losses for 1992 reported by Norway's commercial banks were
warmly greeted by the country's central bank as an indication that the
sector's five-year crisis might be drawing to an end.
But with similar optimism lacking in either Finland or Sweden, it is still
too early to call the turn in the wider banking crisis which has ravaged the
region.
The sector's difficulties are a result of financial deregulation throughout
the region during of the late 1980s and the deep recession which followed
it. Norway's banks were the first to feel the pain, and may be the first to
recover, although they are still a long way from a sustained level of
profitability. Banks in Sweden and Finland, meanwhile, have just reported
their worst-ever results, and with both countries still in deep recession,
there is little to suggest that the 1993 figures will be much better. The
leading banks in neighbouring Denmark have also reported heavy losses for
1992.
The Danish banks, though, are better capitalised than those in other Nordic
countries, and are likely to survive the crisis without state assistance.
That is not the case in the other three countries, where governments have
been forced to intervene to maintain domestic and foreign confidence in
their financial systems and to ensure their banks continue to meet
international capital adequacy requirements.
Huge sums of taxpayers' money have already been invested, with Sweden
providing SKr67.5bn (Pounds 5.85bn) in support, Finland FM38bn (Pounds
4.43bn), and Norway NKr27bn (Pounds 2.57bn). Further substantial injections
of government funds are likely as the process of restructuring and winding
down problem loans continues. This is certain to put further strain on state
finances at a time when budget deficits in Sweden, Finland and Norway are
swelling in face of rising unemployment and falling tax revenues.
At the heart of the crisis is the financial deregulation of 1980s, which
included the relaxation of foreign exchange restrictions and a lifting of
official guidelines on lending. The subsequent credit expansion was further
fuelled by advantageous tax rules for borrowers and a scramble for new
business. But banks found themselves with little protection when recession
arrived and many loans fell into default.
Despite such common factors, differences between the countries are
significant. Norway's problems began in 1986 when oil prices sharply
declined; Finland's only really became apparent in 1991 following the
collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union; Sweden, where the crisis
only fully materialised in 1992, has been hit most heavily by plunging real
estate values.
Last year was the worst so far, with total write-offs of problem loans
across the Nordic banking sector amounting to more than SKr100bn. Sweden was
the most severely hit with credit losses of SKr70bn, followed by Finland
with nearly SKr30bn. Norway's credit losses were halved last year, from
NKr17bn in 1991 to NKr8.7 last year, largely because its problems began and
were addressed earlier.
Such figures explain why governments have felt compelled to intervene.
Failure to act would have brought the risk of a domestic credit crunch and
shaken international confidence in their financial systems.
The result of the capital injections is that Christiania Bank and Fokus
Bank, two of Norway's top three banks, are now 100 per cent state-owned
while 70 per cent of the biggest bank, Den Norske Bank, is controlled by the
government. Two of the five biggest banks in Sweden are fully in state
hands, while the country's most prestigious bank, Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken, is negotiating a support package. In Finland, the two savings banks
groups, Skopbank and Savings Bank of Finland, have been taken over by the
state.
Relations between the banks and their new public-sector owners are proving
tricky, particularly in those countries where governments otherwise
committed to privatisation, as in Sweden and Finland, have been forced to
extend state ownership.
'We want to reprivatise the banks but to what degree and at what speed, it
is far too early to say,' says the Norwegian finance minister Mr Sigbjorn
Johnsen.
The rescues have been complicated by what are often conflicting objectives:
getting the best value for the taxpayer, maintaining a level playing field
within the sector and minimising state involvement.
A good illustration of the dilemma is provided by the current talks between
SE Banken and the Swedish government. The finance ministry expects the bank
to do as much as possible to solve its own problems by raising capital from
private sources. But the bank believes that before it can attract private
capital the public support it can expect to receive must be quantified.
There is little doubt that private share capital will be required to get
Nordic banks back on their feet. But investors will be wary of ploughing
more money into institutions which have already cost them a great deal and
where dividend prospects are uncertain. None of the leading banks paid a
dividend on their ordinary shares in 1992.
The alternative to raising new capital is simply to slash lending
activities, but that would mean cutting back on loans at the very time when
fresh financing is needed to support economic recovery.
The prospect of raising private capital is not entirely gloomy, however.
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, has been the
first of the big banks in the region to launch a share issue, and its
current FM930m offer has been well received.
Recovery could also be assisted by rationalisation and mergers. In Norway,
restructuring is already underway, with the merger of Bergen Bank and Den
norske Creditbank. It is likely to gain momentum as the most unprofitable
portions of the banks' business - such as property portfolios - continue to
be hived off and the process of returning banks to the private sector
begins.
In Finland a merger between KOP and the savings banks groups is currently
being considered. Norway has commissioned the UK-based consultancy firm,
Davis International Banking Consultants, to look at its banking problems,
and expects recommendations that will form the basis of a restructuring
programme to be presented to parliament in mid-May.
However, sustained recovery in the banking sector largely hinges on broader
economic recovery. The worst may be over in some sectors of the economy, but
unemployment is rising. Joblessness in Norway, at 8.7 per cent, is at its
highest level since the second world war high, while in Finland more than 18
per cent of the workforce is out of work. In Sweden, official unemployment
stands at 7 per cent, but the figure would be much greater if those in
training schemes were included.
With so many people out of work, many are having difficulties repaying
loans. The corporate sector, meanwhile, is squeezed by low demand and real
interest rates that remain high. In Sweden the central bank's marginal
interest rate is being held at 9.75 per cent to squeeze inflation and
protect the value of the krona. But the Finnish central bank reduced its
base rate to 7.5 per cent in February, while in Norway the central bank this
year has gradually eased its official rate to 8.5 per cent.
Most analysts believe the leading banks in Sweden and Finland face at least
two more years of heavy write-offs of problem loans, although recovery may
come more quickly in Norway. '1993 will be a better year for the Norwegian
banks, but the problems in Swedish and Finnish banks started later, so the
real recovery will not be evident as early,' said Mr Torstein Joerstad, a
bond credit analyst at UBS Limited in London. Of the big Swedish banks,
Handelsbanken is an exception and it may return to profit as early as this
year.
Yet even if the Nordic banking sector rebounds during this year and next,
the region's financial problems will not be resolved soon. The task of
rebuilding financial strength, restructuring and winding-down problem
credits is likely to last into the next century.

FT  19 APR 93 / Letter: Nothing comic about wasted initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANSEL HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Pounds 1.5bn Training and Enterprise Councils initiative was
launched in the UK on March 10 1989 - coincidentally Comic Relief day. For
many in the private sector involved in some of the earlier initiatives such
as the Small Firms Service, Enterprise Agencies, Business in the Community,
the Business and Education Initiative, the Training Commission, the Manpower
Services commission, and Pickup (Professional, Industrial and Commercial
Updating Programme), the Tecs did, indeed, promise relief.
The Tecs were intended to rationalise what the then chairman of Courtauld's
described as 'the great variety of initiatives now around'. Many of us
involved in them greeted them with sceptical optimism. At least an umbrella
organisation was in place and it should be given a chance. You yourselves
had doubts. And within two years of the Tecs going live your own survey
described 'widespread dissatisfaction over the levels of government
funding'. On February 28 1992 (Management: 'Making it a game of skill, not
of luck') you reported 'a great deal of frustration over the inability of
the Tecs to fulfil the valuable role for which they were established'.
You now report ('Pilot 'one-stop' business advice centres chosen', April 15)
a further umbrella initiative. Five Tecs and other bodies 'are to carry out
a Pounds 500,000 study part funded by the government. . .aimed at
establishing a central London one-stop shop' (business advice centre).
If the costs of these abortive initiatives were totalled, the EBRD
extravagances would pale into insignificance. Ansel Harris,

FT  19 APR 93 / Maverick poses an interesting question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAVE been several attempts to provide British chancellors with
independent outside advice. Nigel Lawson had a Group of Independent Economic
Advisers (soon christened 'Gooies'). This had the advantage that it
discussed a wide range of economic questions and did not confine itself to
forecasts. Its disadvantage was that its proceedings were oral and that no
record was available to members.
Norman Lamont's Panel of Independent Forecasters has the advantage that its
members submit papers which are published in a convenient volume. Its
disadvantage is that the chancellor has tried to confine it to forecasts, a
much overrated activity.
There is, however, a chance that the Lamont panel will turn out to be more
interesting than either the chancellor or the official Treasury intended.
This is because of its three maverick members - in alphabetical order, Tim
Congdon, Patrick Minford, and Wynne Godley - who show no intention of
confining themselves to a series of numerical guesses about GDP a few
quarters ahead.
Indeed Congdon has just made a strong attack on the present fashion of
simply looking for predictive indicators and has insisted on understanding
the forces behind economic changes in a paper in the April issue of the
Gerrard &amp; National Economic Review. He is concerned to argue that excessive
or deficient money balances are the causes of changes in the national income
and not merely an advance warning.
But is not this what all monetarists believe? Apparently not. For Congdon's
main argument is not with the orthodox panellists, but with fellow
monetarists such as Minford who discuss the money supply mainly as an
indicator of present or future activity. Indeed they have little option. For
Minford's favoured indicator has been 'M0', which is mainly notes and coins
and which no one in the British debate has claimed is an actual cause of
changes in activity or prices.
Although I have some sympathy for Minford on another issue - the supply side
changes since 1979 - Congdon seems to me more nearly right on the monetary
side. For if you can identify some of the causal processes you are much more
likely to understand the economy and to avoid policy mistakes than if you
simply go by the economic tea leaves.
None of this means that any school of monetarists has at last found a key to
securing stability at low inflation. Congdon's own greatest triumph was his
diagnosis of inflationary overheating in the mid-1980s - when neither
Minford-type monetarists nor the official Treasury could see cause for
concern.
Unfortunately, however, a detail of definition played a crucial element in
Congdon's predictive success. His diagnosis was made in terms of Pounds M3,
which had been the target aggregate for well over a decade. But this
aggregate was becoming more and more unsuitable as it omitted for instance
building society deposits which were becoming an increasingly important part
of the money supply, as Congdon himself came to recognise. The broader
aggregate, M4, which takes these into account, and for which the Treasury
now has a monitoring range, did not give nearly as clear cut a sign that
something was wrong.
Some kind of test is now looming. M0 is above its monitoring range. What its
most discerning supporters claim is that it is a good indicator of what is
already happening. If they are right the turn-up in economic activity now
taking place is much more vigorous than the modest sprouting of green shoots
which is all that the government claims.
On the other hand, if the advocates of broad money targeting are right,
whatever recovery is now happening will turn into dust and ashes before the
year is out.
Congdon is, however, careful to avoid saying just this. He reminds us that
'the drop in interest rates has made interest-bearing deposits a less
attractive asset to hold . . . this behaviour may be able to stimulate
demand for a few quarters even if money growth is modest'.
One can agree with him that 'eventually' faster broad money growth will be
required to sustain recovery. But broad money growth is not something that
either just happens. It would be most likely to occur if there is a rise in
business borrowing which the government does not need to knock on the head
by high interest rates. So no school of monetarists has got the causality
quite right.

FT  19 APR 93 / Arts: Urban under-class Boheme - Opera North
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the resurgence of tuberculosis as a serious threat to health in the
West, the fate of poor consumptive operatic heroines is no longer the stuff
of dewy-eyed romantic legend. It is easy to imagine a production of La
Boheme set in the present-day - a tale of the urban under-class, in which
any aspirations for the future are smothered by a life of poverty and decay.
As it happened, the new production by Opera North did not go that far.
Phyllida Lloyd, the producer, stopped short of bringing the opera right
up-to-date and stayed (less persuasively?) in the period of beehive hair-dos
and teenagers' motorbikes. Marcello, the painter, decorated his spartan
living space with pop-art images of his girlfriend in the style of Andy
Warhol. His student friends looked a fairly leftish lot, who pinned a
cartoon of their landlord, marked 'fascist', up on the wall.
None of this was really controversial, as it turned out; more a case of
good, clean fun. A producer of this opera has to make sure that the scenes
of young people's horseplay have plenty of energy to them, if the right
contrasts of mood are to be set up, and Phyllida Lloyd does so with
conviction. The scene outside Cafe Momus was great fun: the cafe itself is a
gaudy coffee bar, while the winter crowds skate past the window on an ice
rink outside.
The end of the scene is marked by a parade of Father Christmases, which adds
to the Anglo-Saxon flavour of the evening. Kerouac's On the Road is
mentioned in the programme and Anthony Ward's settings are duly brashly
American, but the good manners and palpably modest niceness of the leading
couple make them seem distinctly English. (There is no red-blooded Italian
feel to the production at all, despite the opera being sung in the original
language.)
What is important, however, is the way that this Mimi and Rodolfo win over
one's sympathy from their first scene together. The Canadian soprano Jane
Leslie MacKenzie was a genuinely touching Mimi, the singing sincere and
nicely shaped. Her American partner, William Burden, proved a very
interesting find, not a truly Puccinian Rodolfo, as the voice is too small
and English (Mozart and Britten material) in sound, but everything he did
was tasteful and vocally well produced.
One really cared about both of them. The gaucherie with which they embark on
their affair, the nervous smiles, the awkward wringing of the hands, all
worked in the most charming way. They contrasted well, too, with Rodolfo's
more outgoing friends - Robert Hayward's forceful Marcello and William
Dazeley's Schaunard, who brought off his return from a fancy-dress party in
drag with some elan. Juliet Booth made a lively, unexaggerated Musetta.
Despite signs of immaturity (Rodolfo's sobs at the end and the silent
circling of the other characters are overdone) the production hits its
target. When Mimi enters in the last act, deathly pale, and lurches forwards
to be sick in the kitchen sink, a shudder of realism goes down the spine.
This is real verismo - a reminder that such illnesses are marching out of
operatic fiction and back into real-life documentary.
Production sponsored by Yorkshire Television. Further performances in Leeds
until 22 May, then Manchester, Nottingham, Hull and Sheffield.

FT  19 APR 93 / Arts: Dramatic talent, step forward / Review of the Humana
Festival of new plays, Louisville
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 17th annual Humana Festival of New Plays at the Actors Theater of
Louisville looked and sounded, to its credit, more like America than the
fare of theatres in many of this country's major urban centres. Its nine
playwrights, including four women and three writers of colour, took on some
of contemporary society's most pressing issues in productions that upheld
the high standard of acting and design that we have come to expect from
America's best-known new plays festival. Though not all of its risks paid
off this year, its unceasing commitment to producing work that pushes the
boundaries of traditional playwriting keeps the Festival vital.
Humana's most conventional play this year was also its most successful: Joan
Ackerman's Stanton's Garage, a two-act comedy set in an auto repair shop in
rural Missouri. It is a big, overstuffed sofa of a play: too long, but
comfortable, packed full of interesting characters and witty dialogue.
Car failure maroons Lee (Priscilla Shanks), a successful but uptight doctor,
at Stanton's Garage with her fiance's bookish teenage daughter, Frannie
(Jessica Jory), who is so involved in caring for her father that she has not
developed a life of her own. Lee and Frannie never get to their destination
 -needless to say the mechanics in the garage have never seen a Volvo before
 -but two sweaty midsummer days in Stanton's Garage thaw these frosty,
defensive women. Frannie gets her first kiss from the garage's junior
mechanic, in a charming scene sensitively played by Jory and Rob Kramer, and
Lee realises that she has spent her life defining herself by outside
standards and decides to leave Frannie's father.
Local colour transcends any cliche through the actors' excellent
performances, particularly Adale O'Brien as the garage's wisecracking
receptionist. In Steven Albrezzi's adept production the play's potentially
confusing plot lines crack along with perfect clarity. Scenic designer Paul
Owen matches the naturalism of Ackerman's writing with a garage perfectly
observed.
This year's most talked-about offering was Keely and Du, a play about
abortion by one of the Festival's most prolific and mysterious writers, Jane
Martin. Jane Martin is a pseudonym, and it is widely believed that 'she' is
Actors Theater Artistic Director Jon Jory, who directed Keely and Du.
Keely and Du is similar in its spareness to David Mamet's recent two-hander
about sexual harassment, Oleanna; but unlike Mamet, Martin's pared-down
style does not expose the heart of the debate he tries to dramatise. The
play opens in a barely furnished cell in which a young woman, Keely (Julie
Boyd), is handcuffed to a bed. Impregnated when her former husband raped
her, Keely was on her way to an abortion clinic when she was abducted by a
radical anti-abortion group. Walter (Bob Burrus), the evangelical pastor
responsible for Keely's capture, tells her that they plan to force her to
carry the baby to term. Supervising Keely is an elderly woman, Du (Anne
Pitoniak), whose growing fondness for the younger woman leads her to deviate
from her orders.
Keely and Du is so well-plotted and the Humana production so tightly
directed and intently played that its build up is inexorable and gripping,
its denouement at once inevitable and shocking. But Martin's technical
writing skills and this strong production cannot make up for Keely and Du's
failure to talk about what it is really talking about: a political issue.
Humana's presentation of ten-minute plays this year was almost a non-event:
one-idea situations the writers have tried to stretch, unsuccessfully, into
plays. Deadly Virtues, a collaborative creation of its five-person ensemble
that was adapted and directed by Brian Jucha, was Humana's most
non-traditional offering. Though well-performed, painstakingly choreographed
and gorgeously produced, this collage of movement, song and text came off as
pretentious and meaningless - the kind of thing that gives performance art a
bad name.
Another interesting idea gone awry was Shooting Simone, Lynne Kaufman's
investigation of the ambiguities in feminist Simone de Beauvoir's
relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre. Kaufman's reductive treatment of her
subject matter was matched by a shallow production - Paul Owen's
unimaginative set, Lazlo Martin's scattershot direction, and the actors'
brassy performances - that played like a bad TV movie.
Far more exciting were works by two talented young writers testing the
bounds of the traditional narrative play. Kevin Kling's Ice Fishing Play is
an intriguing overlay of situational comedy, memory play, and meditation on
mortality. Kling's convoluted storytelling calls out for a clarity of
production that it did not receive from Michael Sommers, but the freshness
of this writer's voice is indisputable.
Any disappointment in Jennine's Diary, a jumbled travelogue/memory play that
was the first of Regina Taylor's brace of one-acts billed as 'Various Small
Fires', was quickly eradicated by the second, Watermelon Rinds. In Novella
Nelson's production, Taylor's hilarious and harrowing reinvention of the
family drama for contemporary urban Black life exploded with imagination and
verbal dexterity. We should be hearing more from Taylor, who is an
accomplished stage and television actress as well as playwright.

Monday night is rather an over-egged pudding these days for anyone who
prefers factual programmes to drama or light entertainment, and often the
pudding has a strong American flavour. Today's Horizon sounds as though it
will complement Channel 4's current Tuesday night series in 'Without Walls'
which is looking at some of the more scary effects of recent technological
advances. Horizon considers the possibility of benevolent effects from
'intelligent technology' created by the 'new alchemists' in Britain, Japan
and, of course, the US (8.00 BBC2). World In Action (8.30 ITV) promises to
expose 'a secret group of right wing fanatics waging a campaign of political
terrorism in Britain'. Channel 4 begins a series called Naked Sport produced
by Nicholas Kent who made the memorable 'Naked Hollywood' series. This
series, about sport in the US begins with boxing. Channel 4 offers States Of
America (11.55) the second debate, with Camille Paglia, Robert Hughes and
Edward Said on political correctness with Christopher Hitchens.

FT  19 APR 93 / Arts: A conversion to sculpture - Colin Amery visits the new
Henry Moore Institute in Leeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday the Henry Moore Institute opens in Leeds. The opening event is
an important occasion for two reasons. Firstly, the new institute is the
headquarters of the Henry Moore Sculpture Trust, which has the exciting
remit to encourage the appreciation of sculpture of all periods; secondly,
the inauguration will unveil to the public an intriguing and original new
building by the architects Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones.
'New building' is not quite an accurate description of the centre, which is
a conversion of three 19th-century wool merchants' office buildings at the
end of Cookridge Street, next door to the Leeds City Art Gallery. Leeds has
some marvellous architectural set pieces from the last century, especially
the proud, bombastic Town Hall by Cuthbert Broderick (1858). Its great tower
rising out of the vast columned base is grander than Greenwich and redolent
of Halicarnassus, despite being in the Corinthian mode.
Broderick's oval Corn Exchange in Duncan Street is also a remarkable
structure and has been well adapted to its new retail uses. The City Square
demonstrates the pride the city fathers of Leeds had in their urban
improvements, and the statuary - particularly the equestrian statue of the
Black Prince and the rows of bronze maidens holding their lamps - are
effective sculptural elements in the townscape.
Sculpture is a growth industry in Yorkshire, largely because of the
activities of the Henry Moore Foundation. Henry Moore was born in 1898 in
Castleford near Leeds, the son of a Yorkshire coal miner. He went as a
student to the Leeds art college after his demobilisation in 1919, and later
to the Royal College of Art in London. At the Royal College he was to meet
Barbara Hepworth as a fellow student - she had been born in Wakefield and
was a scholar supported by the West Riding County Council. Coincidentally,
their joint creative careers are both marked this year by the opening of
this centre in Leeds and by the opening of the Tate Gallery in St. Ives,
Cornwall, where Hepworth worked.
All this Yorkshire creativity has come home to roost in Leeds, where the
Henry Moore Foundation has spent Pounds 5m on the new centre. It has one of
the very few new galleries in Europe designed specifically for the display
of sculpture. Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones are clearly inspired by their
frequent visits to the US. They seem to have absorbed that particularly
American art gallery 'feel': in their conversion, the immaculate, minimally
detailed white rooms gently smooths away the past of the old houses. It is a
feeling I like for its neutrality and coolness, which demands great care
from the architects and the project builders, depending as it does on
precision.
The major shock is the facade that greets you as you arrive on The Headrow.
The long square from the Town Hall to the war memorial is a recent creation.
Many of the buildings that face onto it were not designed with any civic
presence. The new entrance facade of Moore Institute was originally the
naked cut-off gable end of a partly demolished row of houses. The
architects' bold decision to make this wall the entrance to the Institute
demanded some architectural imagination to create a suitably civic facade.
Not surprisingly they opted for a sculptural solution, but of the most
minimalist kind. The architects have designed flights of steps mounting up
towards the shiny blank black granite, where an asymmetrically placed slot
marks the narrow entrance. The large black wall is totally abstract and
could as easily represent a Yorkshire coalface or an ancient Egyptian tomb.
It is to my eye reminiscent of the great black granite wall that forms the
Vietnam war memorial in Washington DC. Or is it perhaps inspired by those
'vest pocket parks' that utilise the end-walls of partly demolished
buildings in New York City and turn them into walls of water? Perhaps it is
none of these things, but just a suggestion of a huge block of granite
awaiting the hand of the sculptor. It is a radical and unusual solution to
the planning problem. It certainly does not look inviting; my feeling is
that it looks more like a tomb for Henry Moore than anything else.
Inside, things are decidedly more cheerful. Light breaks out in a splendid
way in the new main sculpture gallery, which has one entire wall of bronze
framed obscured glass. The opening exhibition, Romanesque Stone Sculpture
from Medieval England looks very good in this space despite the rather
heavy-handed, but presumably necessary, metal mounts and stands. There is an
opportunity to look at recently restored work from York Minster and Lincoln
cathedrals. The good level of natural light and the total absence of any
architectural detail make it possible for sculpture of all periods to be
shown here with ease. The upper floors house the archive and study centre
and the top floor has handsome administrative offices and a board room. The
whole institute is linked to the main art gallery by an elegant new bridge.
There is a lot to admire in the timber, glass and painted plaster interior
of this new institute, and pleasure to be had in the atmosphere of calmness
and contemplation that the architects have successfully created. The black
facade shows how hard it is to move beyond the vacancies of abstraction to a
convincing language for the faces of new public buildings.

FT  19 APR 93 / Arts: Song-bird of more decibels - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Song-birds in the world of opera sing out with more decibels than they used
to. June Anderson, arguably the leading soprano in the bel canto repertoire
at the moment, gave a recital at the Wigmore Hall on Saturday and the hall's
fine acoustics showed us how big this voice really is - surely several sizes
larger than singers would have been in the early 19th century.
She began, predictably enough, with Bellini and Rossini, her known strength.
The second Bellini song, 'La ricordanza', is a different working of the
ideas from the main aria of I Puritani, in which June Anderson had such a
success at Covent Garden last year. Her shining soprano, with its 100-watt
brightness, is heard to its best effect in this sort of music and the
phrasing was simpler, more effective, than she often makes it.
The only drawback in hearing this singer in recital is that she finds it
difficult to turn down the brilliance over the course of an evening. The
ears start to tire of the constant gleam in the sound, as the eyes might
looking into a strong light. Liszt's 'Die Lorelei' talks of the glow of the
evening sunshine, Duparc's 'Au pays ou se fait la guerre' of the pale
moonlight. But here the voice was always at the height of its midday
radiance.
From the items mentioned so far, it will be clear that this was not a
conventional songbird's programme. In fact, the evening was very well
planned - a Spanish group to close the first half with a flourish, French
and American songs for contrasting moods after the interval. The
accompanist, Charles Spencer, gave his singer the freedom that she needed.
For all that, in every item it was the voice that mattered most. In Ned
Rorem's 'Ferry me across the water' the last note hung suspended in the air
for what seemed an eternity, a beautiful, pure stream of sound that flowed
on and on without any change or degradation in quality to be detected.
On Wednesday the Purcell Room continued with its Song Recital Series, a
welcome enterprise which still has some way to go before it rivals the
Wigmore Hall's long-established reputation for excellence in this area. The
singer was the mezzo-soprano Fiona Kimm, unfortunately in the last stages of
a cold, which put a dampener on the evening. Nevertheless, there was some
life in it left, because Miss Kimm had put together an adventurous second
half.
Berio's Four Canzoni Populari opened with a mix of folk simplicity and
Italianate virtuosity (accompaniments played by Andrew Ball). Anthony
Payne's Adlestrop set Edward Thomas's poetry to a free vocal line
underpinned by Janacek-like motifs. John Cage's 'The Wonderful Widow of
Eighteen Springs' replied with James Joyce sung to a chant-like theme, while
the pianist taps out the accompaniment on the closed lid of the piano. Then
Jerome Kern and Cole Porter to finish. Adventure rewarded.

FT  19 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 50m Teesside development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Solid foundations are being laid by Tarmac for a Pounds 50m scheme to bring
new leisure and business interests to Teesside and the north east.
A total of 15,000 cu metres of reinforced concrete is being pumped into the
'dry' bed of the diverted River Tees for the base of the Tees Barrage, being
built by TARMAC CONSTRUCTION for Teesside Development Corporation.
The barrage, 70 metres wide and 50 metres long, is a key project in the
Corporation's regeneration of 19 sq miles of derelict land.
The barrage at Blue House Point, Stockton, will create 12 miles of clean
navigable waterway upstream for sporting and recreational activities, and
access to newly-established commercial areas.
Other amenities and leisure facilities in the barrage project include a
canoe slalom, navigation waterway and lock, a fish pass, cafeteria and a
caravan park.
The foundation work will be completed in July ready for the erection of the
bridge over the barrage structure. The bridge comprises 700 tons of tubular
steel and 64 circular one and a half tonne castings which are being
manufactured locally.
The river will be rediverted at the end of September to allow the temporary
diversion to be filled in and the navigation channel to be constructed.
Installed between the piers of the barrage substructure will be four
fishbelly gates, each weighing 50 tons, and measuring 13.5 metres long and
eight metres high. The gates will regulate the flow of river water and also
act as a barrier to prevent tidal flooding upstream. The barrage is being
designed to work automatically and will be commissioned in October 1994.

FT  19 APR 93 / People: Farmer takes over at Moscow Narodny
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Moscow Narodny Bank, the 73-year-old London-based bank which has been trying
to find a new role for itself following the collapse of the Soviet Union,
has appointed Derek Farmer as deputy general manager.
Farmer, 48, will be the senior British executive in a bank which has had a
reasonably rapid turnover of general managers over the past few years. He
will be acting general manager following the departure of Cliff Evans who
had been in the job for just over two years.
Evans, a former Citibanker, had replaced Campbell Dunford, a former Midland
Bank trade finance official, who had been doing the job since February 1988.
Moscow Narodny gave no reason for Evans' departure but it is understood that
he may be involved in setting up a joint venture bank in Moscow.
Moscow Narodny, which used to be the main overseas commercial bank of the
former Soviet Union, is recovering from a turbulent period in 1991 when it
lost Pounds 120.6m. The disintegration of the Soviet Union caused a run on
its deposits and Russia was forced to step in and inject more than Pounds
300m of new capital to guarantee its survival. The balance sheet of the
bank, which is now controlled by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation,
has shrunk from Pounds 2.5bn in 1989 to Pounds 1.1bn in 1991.
The new acting general manager started his banking career at the Royal Bank
of Scotland. Between 1970 and 1982 he worked for Toronto-Dominion Bank,
including seven years in Toronto and two years in the Middle East. He has
since worked at The Royal Trust Company of Canada, Ubaf Bank and Banque
Paribas, and has most recently worked as a consultant with Harrods Bank.

FT  19 APR 93 / People: Cooper quits Treasury for James Capel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has lost another of its top economists to the private sector in
the shape of Adrian Cooper, who is leaving to join James Capel. Cooper, the
Treasury's forecasting co-ordinator, is joining two other ex-Treasury
economists in James Capel's six-strong economists group.
Cooper, 28, has worked at the Treasury since 1986. He has played a key role
in extending the Treasury's contacts with outside economists in an effort to
improve on its poor recent forecasting record.
Cooper, who graduated from Bristol University and has a higher degree from
the London School of Economics, says he is leaving primarily to 'gain
experience of economics in a private-sector environment'. The fact that he
would be paid more at James Capel 'is not the main reason, though it is a
nice feature'. Despite criticism directed at the Treasury, morale within the
economists' department was high; 'I've enjoyed working here.'
Cooper will work in a James Capel team headed by Keith Skeoch which also
includes two other ex-Treasury econ-omists, Gwynne Hacche and Stephen King.
He will feel very much at home at James Capel's City offices, which are
shared with its sister company Midland Global Markets, also owned by HSBC
Holdings. In Midland's economics teams are a further two former Treasury
officials in the shape of Simon Briscoe and Julian Jessop.
Cooper - who leaves the Treasury in early May - has recently been working
under Colin Mowl, the Treasury's chief forecaster. He has sat in on meetings
of the 'seven wise men' of outside forecasters and was responsible for a
large amount of the draft of this group's first report issued in February.
He has also become involved with controversy over whether the Treasury might
at some point seek to contract out its computerised economic model to an
outside group. But the Treasury says it still has some way to go before
deciding on whether to ask companies to do this work.

FT  19 APR 93 / Management: The rise and rise of profit-related pay -
Carrots for employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's workers are increasingly involved with their companies through
government-backed financial participation schemes. An estimated 3m of them
are covered by various forms of profit sharing and are in receipt of shares
or options worth around Pounds 10.2bn.
The most spectacular growth, however, has been in the area of profit-related
pay (PRP). Figures due to be published by the Inland Revenue tomorrow will
reveal that about one in 20 workers - 1.3m people - are now covered by 4,500
PRP schemes. Introduced in the 1987 Budget, PRP only really took off after
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, doubled tax relief on the scheme two years
ago and the government published model rules to help employers. Since 1990
the number of PRP schemes has tripled. PRP provides all full-time employees
in a company with tax-free payments worth up to Pounds 4,000 a year or 20
per cent of salary, whichever is the lower. The scheme has to be registered
with the Inland Revenue and is subject to detailed regulations with the 20
per cent part of the worker's pay 'profit related'.
'PRP is not an incentive system but deliberately designed to make basic pay
more variable,' says Brian Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit
Consulting. 'It provides employees with tax-free money equivalent to a 7 per
cent pay rise,' he adds.
'PRP has become a major attraction of profit sharing over the past year
because it can boost net pay at a time when the cash for normal pay awards
is not available,' explains David Shonfield at Incomes Data Services.
Gallaher, the tobacco company, Norwich Union, an insurance concern, and
Nationwide Anglia, a building society, were among the early converts to PRP.
The growth has come despite last August's move by the Inland Revenue to
close a tax loophole that had enabled companies to link their annual
calculation of what was profit pay to other factors, so allowing an annual
bonus to be paid tax free. Experts thought this might slow down the spread
of PRP, but that does not appear to be the case. Up until now the vast
majority of PRP schemes have provided workers with a tax free bonus on top
of their basic pay. But there are signs of a change, particularly since the
Revenue's tightening of the rules.
Some companies in the current pay round are offering PRP's as part of the
basic pay offer. Others are introducing the concept of salary conversion.
'This is much closer to the original intention of PRP', admits Friedman.
Clearly companies in financial trouble are unlikely to win much support from
their employees for PRP, but the size of the tax advantages do provide some
flexibility for companies whose profits fall.
PRP is not the only government scheme on offer to companies which want to
involve their employees more directly in their financial performance. And in
a show of the broad industrial and political consensus on this subject a
joint bid to encourage their spread will be launched tomorrow by Lamont,
Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, and Howard Davies, the
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry.
According to the recently published official 1990 workplace relations
survey, 55 per cent of trading sector workplaces are covered by some form of
worker financial participation scheme.
The first scheme, a profit-sharing trust scheme, was introduced in Denis
Healey's 1978 Budget and came into force a year later. It enables companies
to provide a discretionary allocation of shares to full-time employees of
more than five years' standing. The maximum value of the shares that can be
given to one worker is Pounds 3,000 or 10 per cent of earnings, whichever is
the greater, up to an Pounds 8,000 ceiling. The shares are held in trust by
the company for at least two years before they can be sold, but workers must
wait a further three years before they can sell their shares without tax
liability. The latest statistics show there are 1,012 such registered
schemes in existence covering 800,000 workers.
In 1980 came the Save As You Earn Option Scheme. This also covers all
employees in a company. They pay monthly contributions of between Pounds 10
and Pounds 250 for a five-year period into a bank, building society or
national savings account. The eventual lump sum can be used to acquire
shares at a 20 per cent discount to the current market price prevailing at
the outset of the scheme. No income tax is payable on the options exercised
at the end of the five-year saving period. There are now 1,058 such schemes
covering 470,000 workers.
The Discretionary Share Option Schemes under the 1984 Finance Act is
confined to an elite of managers and directors. Options can be granted to a
full-time employee over shares worth up to four times the individual's
annual earnings, or Pounds 100,000, whichever is the greater. If options are
exercised more than three years but no more than 10 years after they are
granted, the proceeds will be tax free. According to today's Institute of
Management Survey the number of managers and directors covered by share
option schemes rose to 34.7 per cent of the sample survey from 29.2 per cent
in 1992.
Less popular in Britain because of the meagre tax benefits are Employee
Share Ownership Plans. Under these, companies establish a trust elected by
the workforce, which acquires and distributes shares to workers.
A recently published government survey suggests the majority of the above
schemes would never have been created without the lure of tax relief. But it
also points out that competitive pressures, rapid technological change and
the need for more employee flexibility have all encouraged companies to
introduce financial participation schemes.

FT  19 APR 93 / Management: Head office upheaval - Unilever's plans have
been misunderstood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a corporate giant heralds a 'review' of its head office, the outside
world takes it as a clear signal that sharp cuts are in the offing.
Expectations are inflamed if the company says that one of the purposes of
the review is 'to achieve the most cost-effective provision of essential
services'.
The precedents are legion: the blitzing of US General Electric's
headquarters staff in the 1980s; a cut of more than two-thirds in British
Petroleum's since 1990; and, most recently, a halving of the new ICI's head
office over the next two years, in the wake of its demerger. The latter
comes on top of a cut of more than 10 per cent since 1991.
With such exemplars in mind, outsiders were inevitably disappointed when the
head office review initiated by Unilever last summer culminated more than
two months ago in what seemed at first sight to be just a tidying-up
exercise of the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group's unusual dual-centre
headquarters. On a comparative basis, it entailed a net jobs cut of only 10
per cent in the core of the HQ, which has been rechristened 'the corporate
centre' and will now number 1,075. Its London arm is being reduced by 120
posts, to 675. In Rotterdam the Dutch branch will be enlarged very slightly,
to 400 people.
On the surface, the closest the reshaping has come to drama is in the
decision to transfer almost 600 of the jobs which were previously classified
as part of the group's 'headquarters' to the various operating companies
(260 jobs) and national managements (330 jobs).
But real drama may yet emerge. In an HQ which has not changed substantially
for decades, the working lives of its staff will now become more demanding.
More fundamentally, the key justification for Unilever's head office - the
ability to shape corporate strategy - may be given its sternest test in the
next few years.
Not surprisingly, the February statement about 'reshaping' provoked
irritation among investment analysts and others in the City of London. A
common complaint was that, unlike BP in particular, Unilever had not decided
to cut its headcount sharply by 'outsourcing' such support services as
accounting, tax and legal affairs. Michael Fox, the senior manager who
headed the review team, claims - controversially - that the term 'is
normally associated with cleaning and maintenance'. On what he calls
'higher-level' activities, he says 'we don't see it as a significant
opportunity for us'.
Hans Eggerstedt, Unilever's finance director, is dismissive of City
attitudes to head-office cuts.
'Macho' announcements of the halving of HQ headcounts may excite people, but
they are 'misleading', he claims. 'The City should be interested in the
total performance of the business, not in the means,' he urges.
Fox says only about half of Unilever's new corporate centre consists of
'functional departments' such as personnel, finance, tax and legal staff. It
was on this half that the review concentrated and from which all the 120 job
cuts are coming; in that sense, it represents a reduction of 20 rather than
10 per cent.
The rest of the centre consists, first, of the 'office of the (twin)
chairmen' which is being enlarged from 14 to about 20 in order to strengthen
its 'strategic support' role. Beneath that come the regional and product
'management groups', the latter are known more popularly in Unilever-ese as
'co-ordinations'. These are, in effect, the top tier of the four individual
businesses: food, detergents, personal products and specialty chemicals.
The string of detailed functional changes include: The removal of much
duplication and overlap between departments in London and Rotterdam.
The amalgamation of many senior roles to provide 'single-point
responsibility' spanning the North Sea and the globe. Reporting lines will
be simplified accordingly in various other parts of the centre.
An insistence that each department should justify fully its existence,
define its role and estimate the value it adds. The introduction of much
tougher departmental and individual performance measures plus the concept of
'continuous improvement' in productivity and service to internal
'customers'. The likelihood of further job cuts later, at least in the
functions. But some of the management groups may have to be enlarged, says
Fox. An attempt to start changing the entrenched top-down 'control' culture
of London and Rotterdam towards something more self-driven and consultative.
Beyond these issues of internal effectiveness and culture lies more
fundamental questions which will be exposed to greater outside scrutiny  -
notably from investors - now that the centre's role has been made more
transparent by the dispersal of activities which are not really corporate.
That, in turn, is likely to expose Unilever to future pressure on the most
basic and threatening question that anyone - including potential predators -
could ask about its centre: what strategic value does it really add in a
corporate sense, over and above that created in the four businesses?
Recently the international management of the businesses has been
strengthened and with it their strategic muscle. Various steps have been
taken to ensure cross-fertilisation between them occurs more naturally,
rather than having to be mediated by head office.
So what more does the corporate centre now provide than financial muscle and
 -especially vital within such a multinational company - personnel
development which spans businesses and countries?
Eggerstedt says the reshaping is intended partly to reduce further the
barriers between the different management groups, and enable synergies to
'flow easily' across them. And he says 'a major part of the discussion' has
been around the need to improve Unilever's ability 'to develop a corporate
strategy'.
That would seem to be an admission that this has been less than fully
effective in the past. It cannot have been helped by the frequent confusion
of head office managers between their corporate and other roles. The very
size of the previous head office structure - almost 1,800 on its widest
definition - was also a handicap to easy communication.
So the redefinition of managerial and support roles within the new centre's
various departments should help matters. But no amount of reorganisation
will recreate a proactive strategic role for Unilever's centre if the degree
of leadership it provided in the past is no longer needed by its businesses.

FT  19 APR 93 / AEA prepares to emerge from shadows: Michael Cassell finds
enthusiasm for the sale of the atomic energy body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a long march from Aldermaston but the UK Atomic Energy Authority
is finally preparing to break free from its sometimes shadowy state-owned
past to make its own way in the commercial marketplace.
The recent announcement that the government is to commission a report on the
case for moving the organisation - now called AEA Technology - into the
private sector is likely to signal an end to nearly 40 years of governance
by statute and ministerial diktat.
But AEA Technology is a rare specimen, presenting ministers with the
difficult task of stripping out its hugely expensive, historic nuclear
liabilities from a thriving technology transfer business so that it can be
offered for sale. The same sort of dilemma threw electricity privatisation
into chaos.
If the government faces a headache, the organisation itself - which last
year reported Pounds 28m profits on a Pounds 442m turnover - eagerly awaits
the freedom to exploit its specialist skills fully and to complete its
conversion into a world-class service bus-iness.
Although nuclear-related capabilities remain one of AEA Technology's prime
commercial strengths, many original nuclear activities have long since gone.
British Nuclear Fuels was spun off in 1970 while radiochemical work went to
Amersham International, the health science group, 10 years ago.
Responsibility for the development of nuclear devices at Aldermaston in
Berkshire - once an annual target for Easter peace demonstrations - passed
to the Ministry of Defence 20 years ago, al-though AEA Technology still has
a hand in managing the site, now part of the At-omic Weapons Establishment.
Other operations also remain obscured by the Official Secrets Act, such as
work on the strategic defence initiative - 'Star Wars' - programme for the
US government and on Trident submarine reactor safety for the MoD.
But an organisation created in 1954 to spearhead the development of UK
nuclear technology is today much more likely to be using its expertise to
create specialist products or advise industries and governments on
everything from the supply and use of energy to waste management, safety and
environmental protection. Only half its revenue now derives from the UK
government and this will fall to about 30 per cent, given the removal of its
nuclear liabilities.
Since 1986 AEA Technology, based at Harwell near Oxford, has been required
by the government to operate commercially - a shift in strategy made all the
more vital by subsequent retrenchment in the government's own nuclear
programmes.
But by the end of the 1980s, with government funding declining, the future
of an organisation boasting 3,000 graduate scientists and engineers appeared
uncertain. Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive, says: 'We reached the point where
we either devised a new strategy or faced irreversible natural decay.'
The result was further change, signalled with the creation in 1990 of a
number of nuclear-related and industrial business units. A continuing
cost-cutting programme has now reduced staff to about 8,000, one fifth of
the peak reached in the early 1960s, while several executives have been
recruited from outside.
The business is expanding overseas - particularly in east and west Europe,
the US and the Far East - and wants to see up to 30 per cent of turnover
coming from abroad within the next four years. Overseas income could reach
Pounds 70m this year.
But its ambitions hinge on the removal of legal constraints which still dog
its activities as long as it remains in the public sector, a fact
acknowledged last year in a report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
At present AEA Technology's financial limits are set by the Treasury. It
must also seek ministerial approval for alliances or joint ventures and is
severely restricted in exploiting its non-nuclear expertise.
Mr Eyre stresses that total privatisation is not essential, providing AEA
Technology is given the necessary freedoms, but there is no mistaking the
enthusiasm for going the whole way.
Neither will any plan envisaging the separate disposal of business units
regarded as totally interdependent be welcomed. 'We don't want the bits
flogged off separately. We have a much better chance of surviving if
everything is kept intact,' Mr Eyre says.
But for ministers the biggest dilemma is what to do with the unattractive
'baggage' left in the shape of nuclear installations scattered around the
country - such as the Dounreay fast reactor in Scotland - for which the
government pays about Pounds 100m a year in decommissioning and radioactive
waste management costs.
The total state bill, likely to continue well into the next century, is put
at Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn. The most likely solution will be the creation
of a residuary body to handle AEA Tech-nology's former responsibil-ities.
Independent consultants charged with examining ministerial options will be
appointed soon and should report by the late summer. A sale could be
pencilled in for 1995 or early 1996.
But while the present government looks set to extend the disciplines of the
marketplace to its old nuclear servant, any delays in privatisation would
raise the possibility of a change in administration and an alternative
outcome. Labour might be far less ready to see such a centre of technical
excellence and innovation slip entirely from its grasp.

FT  19 APR 93 / Need for more curbs on brokers questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, says the need for further
statutory regulation of general insurance intermediaries is yet to be
demonstrated.
He told the British Insurance Investment Brokers Association annual
conference in Bournemouth: 'The real question is whether there is anything
fundamentally wrong with the present position . . . in terms of the
protection it affords. I am listening carefully to views, but I . . . will
take some persuading.'
Mr Hamilton was giving his preliminary views on responses to a consultative
document issued by the Department of Trade and Industry last year. The DTI
invited comments on the European Commission's recommendation on the
regulation of insurance intermediaries.
His remarks came in the wake of a report by the Consumers' Association which
found that in a survey of insurance intermediaries - brokers and agents who
sell policies on behalf of companies - the majority breached 'virtually all
the provisions of the codes of practice which supposedly govern the sale of
non-life insurance'.
The Consumers' Association is recommending that the regulatory body the
Insurance Brokers Registration Council, or a new independent body, should
enforce regulations more actively.
Mr Hamilton said: 'I realise current arrangements for independent
intermediaries are uneven. But I am not convinced that unevenness by itself
is sufficient reason for more regulation.'

FT  19 APR 93 / Minister to set out rolling-stock plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will today give fresh details of how Pounds 150m earmarked in
last year's Autumn Statement for establishing a leasing market for railway
rolling stock is to be allocated.
Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, is expected to use transport questions
in the Commons to tell MPs which company has been chosen to build the
rolling stock. British Rail has put forward details of two competing schemes
for using the promised government funding.
The BR proposals apparently leave the government with a choice between
financing replacement trains for the London Euston to Glasgow line and
replacing outdated rolling stock on Kent coast routes.
BR believes both proposed upgrades are necessary, but does not expect the
money to be shared between them.
If the Euston to Glasgow line were selected, about 15 new InterCity 225
trains would probably be built by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering
company. If the Kent coast option were chosen the new rolling stock would be
built by ABB Transportation (formerly BREL).

FT  19 APR 93 / Reorganisation at Peat Marwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KPMG PEAT MARWICK, the UK's second largest accountancy firm, is reorganising
its consulting arm into a national practice in the first step away from its
regional structure.
Mr Bob Simm, former head of consulting for the south-east region, has become
national head of consulting and will assume partial control over the
regional heads of consulting.
The firm plans to create a growing number of specialist national centres and
encourage greater co-operation between the regional practices. The move runs
contrary to KPMG's traditional structure, which operates through six
autonomous partnerships - south-east, west, Midlands, north-east, north-west
and Scotland.
Only 'general partners' share the profits of the practice from across the
country. Their identities - let alone their remuneration - are not known by
all their colleagues. The remaining partners - about 570 - receive a share
of the profits purely from the region in which they are based. Under the new
scheme the regional heads of consulting will report jointly to the head
partners of their region and to the national head of consulting. Their
profit share will still be determined by the performance of the region, but
will include a contribution from the national consulting practice.
Mr Simm said he hoped to move to a national profit share for the consulting
division within two years. He plans several national centres to add to those
for manufacturing, the environment and health systems.
The reorganisation comes when the firm is going through a wider programme of
change called 20/20 Vision, designed to make it more responsive to the needs
of its clients.

FT  19 APR 93 / Mayflower to take over car designer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAYFLOWER, the specialist UK automotive engineering group, is to take over
the business and assets of IAD (UK), one of Europe's leading automotive
design and engineering consultancies, which collapsed into administrative
receivership less than two weeks ago.
The deal will increase Mayflower's annual turnover by 60 per cent to about
Pounds 110m. It will create a significant force among the world's automotive
design and engineering groups capable of rivalling the long-established
Italian automotive design houses such as Pininfarina, Italdesign and
Bertone, and Germany's Karmann.
Mayflower already owns Motor Panels, the Coventry-based automotive
engineering group, which operates in fields from vehicle engineering design
and development to tooling and manufacturing.
Mayflower is to pay Pounds 3.25m in cash to acquire IAD from the receiver
and the shares of IAD's overseas trading subsidiaries, which did not go into
receivership.
Mr John Simpson, Mayflower chief executive, said the combination of IAD and
Motor Panels would provide 'a world-class capability in automotive design
and engineering'.
Mayflower is already expanding rapidly and is in the midst of its second
rights issue in less than two years.
It is raising Pounds 34.6m through a one-for-one rights issue to finance its
existing expansion in the UK and the US. This includes a project to supply
the bodies for a new MG sports car being developed by Rover, the UK
carmaker.
Mayflower bought Motor Panels for Pounds 14.75m out of the receivership of
the parent company, CH Industrials. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.7m
last year on a turnover of Pounds 67.8m and has a worldwide workforce of
nearly 1,000.
IAD made a loss of Pounds 105,000 on a turnover of Pounds 62m for the year
to the end of April 1991.
Mr Godfrey Harker, IAD group finance director, said IAD was expected to make
a loss of Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.5m on a turnover of Pounds 51m to Pounds 52m
in the year to the end of this month.
IAD turnover has fallen sharply since mid-1992. The company, previously
owned 77.5 per cent by Mr John Shute, chairman and managing director, and
family interests, and 22.5 per cent by Cinven, the venture capital investor,
has been under growing financial strain for the last two years.
Mr Simpson said that Mr Shute would remain as chairman of IAD responsible
for strategy, sales and marketing. Mr John Fleming, Mayflower operations
review director, would become IAD chief executive with immediate effect.

FT  19 APR 93 / London set for patchy upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS of economic recovery are emerging in Britain's capital,the London
Chamber of Commerce and Industry's latest quarterly survey indicates.
But falling employment and investment, and tough conditions for small and
medium-sized companies, do not suggest a vigorous rise in activity.
Business activity was stronger in the first quarter of this year than at any
time in the past two and a half years, according to the survey of 250
London-based companies. Twenty nine per cent of companies reported higher
business levels, compared with 24 per cent reporting lower business levels.
The balance of 5 percentage points reporting higher rather than lower
business compares with a negative balance of 7 points in the final quarter
of 1992 and is at its highest level since June 1990.
But the aggregate improvement is not universally shared. Small and
medium-sized companies reported a further net fall in orders, while
employment is still contracting. Thirty per cent of manufacturing companies
and 18 per cent of service-sector companies reported a reduction in their
total staff in the first quarter.
Mr Simon Sperryn, chief executive of the London chamber, said: 'Recovery in
London will be patchy and growth sluggish.' He predicted that London would
lag behind other regions in the recovery's early stages. 'But this time
there are a number of positive factors which should prevent a slide back
into decline,' he added.

   THE DIRECTORS of Britain's largest companies
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
those with annual turnover of more than Pounds 600m each - secured average
pay rises of 8.6 per cent last year, more than twice the national average,
the Institute of Management's annual salary survey, published today, shows.
The average annual salary of managers is now Pounds 29,838, with 40 per cent
earning more than Pounds 30,000. Directors have an average salary of Pounds
68,722 with as many as 68.8 per cent earning more than Pounds 50,000.
The biggest average salary rises of 10.6 per cent were secured by directors
in Scotland, who now average Pounds 68,688, followed by a 10.2 per cent
increase in salaries for directors in East Anglia to an average Pounds
58,205.
Managers in the west Midlands enjoyed the biggest improvement of 7.8 per
cent in managerial grades to an average of Pounds 26,597.
The underlying rate of increase in all earnings over the same 12 months was
4 per cent.
The institute found wide salary discrepancies between different parts of
Britain. The highest-paid managers are in inner London. They received an
average 5.8 per cent increase last year, taking them to an average Pounds
37,457. Directors in inner London had a 5.3 per cent improvement in salaries
to an average Pounds 82,471.
The lowest-paid managers work in the northern region of England, with an
average salary of Pounds 24,842 after a 6.4 per cent rise. Directors in that
region were the lowest paid, with a Pounds 52,807 average salary after a
rise of 5.3 per cent.
The survey shows that the best-paid managerial jobs remain in the financial
sector, with average salaries of Pounds 35,021 a year. The lowest-paid
managers work in manufacturing, with an average of Pounds 24,533.
The highest-paid directors are in the privatised energy sector, where the
average salary is Pounds 110,981 a year. The lowest-paid directors are in
textiles, clothing and footwear, with an average of Pounds 49,835.
In chemicals and allied industries directors' pay rose 15.3 per cent,
followed by the public sector (12.4 per cent), distribution (11.6 per cent),
electricity, gas and other energy (10.9 per cent) and mechanical engineering
and production (10.6 per cent).
The survey found 'little sign of any switch to flexible benefits packages'
for managers and directors. The company car remains 'the most popular perk
on offer' with 95.8 per cent of directors receiving one. There has been a
decline in their provision among the lower managerial grades, with 59.3 per
cent now having them.
The institute's survey is the most comprehensive covering UK managerial
remuneration. It covers 25,180 individuals in 392 companies employing a
total 2m people.

FT  19 APR 93 / Union leader says end of recession is near
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE president of Britain's largest manufacturing union said yesterday that
the country is at last emerging from recession.
'The green shoots have arrived,' said Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEEU
engineering union. 'The worst is over. We are approaching the end of the
recession as the heartland of Europe goes into one.'
Mr Jordan, speaking on the eve of the union's national committee conference
in Llandudno, was responding to the union's first quarterly report on
employment trends in manufacturing, published today.
His comments are the first acknowledgment from a senior union leader that
the economy is improving.
Mr Jordan said: 'The corner has been turned against a bleak background of
massive cuts in jobs and production capacity.' He pointed out that British
manufacturing industry was starting to benefit from the 'hefty devaluation'
of the pound last autumn and the restructuring of many companies.
The AEEU president also suggested there were signs of a revival in
industrial investment.
The union's survey - compiled from area reports filed by local AEEU offices
 -found that only 17.5 per cent of companies in the report had 'poor' order
books for the first three months of the year compared with 30 per cent which
described their order books as 'good' and a further 52.5 per cent which
described their order books as 'average'.
It also reports that 17.5 per cent of companies surveyed had negotiated
multi-skilling and flexibility agreements in the first quarter of this year,
a further sign of recovery.
Job prospects do not look so healthy, however. Only 5 per cent of companies
reported any vacancies while 20 per cent had made redundancies in the first
quarter.
Union leaders acknowledged yesterday that the survey, the first of its kind,
was by no means a perfect barometer of industrial performance. Only 40
companies were included in the first sample and none from Scotland and the
London area, while 11 of the sample were from Tyneside.
Mr Jordan said the union hoped to improve the quality of the survey in as it
would become a regular source of information on manufacturing employment
trends.
Mr Jordan warned that the improvement 'had not yet been translated into the
creation of additional jobs'. Unless the right measures were taken -
including greater priority for training - 'the green shoots are in danger of
withering away'. He added: 'Within the next six months we could see serious
skill shortages in manufacturing.'

FT  19 APR 93 / House price rise of 3% predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES will rise 3 per cent across the country this year, with sales
volume increasing 10 per cent, an economic adviser to Lloyds Bank has
predicted.
Mr Patrick Moon paints a mixed picture in the April issue of Lloyds Bank's
Economic Bulletin, with some regions likely to experience further house
price declines and others seeing above-average rises.
He says the areas offering greatest scope for revival, based on an analysis
of house prices in relation to incomes, include the south-east, Greater
London and the south-west. The areas most likely to see further falls are
East Anglia, the east Midlands, the west Midlands, the north and north-west
of England, and Wales.
Mr Moon says: 'Recovery in the housing market this year will depend on a
restoration of confidence. With unemployment likely to rise further in 1993,
this will serve as a constraint on any recovery in house prices.' The
incomes of those in employment will also be influential, he adds.
Reports from housebuilders and estate agents indicate a higher level of
viewings this year compared with last year.
Last week the ombudsman for corporate estate agents reported that the number
of properties coming on to the market had jumped in the first two months of
the year, but was still below 1992 levels.

FT  19 APR 93 / Spouse's career 'limits postings'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSS OF a spouse's career is the reason most commonly given for employees
turning down a posting abroad, a pan-European survey on expatriate
management says.
In spite of the extent of the difficulty, only a minority of companies in
the survey sought to address the problem formally - for example by offering
financial compensation for loss of a spouse's income.
The survey, by Price Waterhouse, the management consultancy, examined
compensation packages, benefits and allowances offered to expatriate workers
by more than 200 companies based in 13 European countries.
Price Waterhouse said that a well-administered expatriate workforce was an
important element in the successful growth of a business overseas and the
survey highlighted the ways companies were tackling issues.
It said there were still significant barriers to the free circulation of
labour - with pension portability one of the most important.
The main findings of the survey included:
Children's education was a significant reason for turning down expatriate
assignments.
Career risk was the third most common reason for reluctance - with employees
fearing that they would be 'out of sight, out of mind'.
One fifth of companies had no dedicated member of staff with responsibility
for the management of the expatriate workforce.
Of companies surveyed, 37 per cent did not pay a financial incentive to
encourage employees to accept and complete expatriate assignments.
More than half the companies did not offer any financial compensation to the
expatriate for loss of state benefits, such as child allowance.

FT  19 APR 93 / RMT to discuss its next move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXECUTIVE committee of the RMT, the main rail union, meets today to
decide its next move in its dispute with British Rail which has already
resulted in two one-day strikes which paralysed the network.
There had been speculation that the RMT would switch the strike day from
Friday to midweek, but Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary, has stressed that
no decision on further action has yet been taken.
The prospects of an early settlement improved over the weekend after the
union leadership said it had detected signs of a change in BR's bargaining
stance over compulsory redundancies and the use of contract labour.
It wants a guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies for its
members and a moratorium on the further use of contract labour.
It is possible that BR will now be able to accept a form of words that will
satisfy the union on those two controversial issues without denying
management some room for manoeuvre in the future.
BR has started to stress that it does not envisage any need for compulsory
redundancies over the next couple of years in the approach to privatisation,
or for a greater use of contract labour in track and signal maintenance
work.
Today, Aslef, the drivers' union, is due to meet BR to try to resolve their
specific differences over the future of the drivers' national agreement. The
two sides reported progress had been made at the end of last week.
Aslef took part in the second one-day strike last week. Nearly three
quarters of pay settlements made so far this year have resulted in rises of
between 2 per cent and 4.9 per cent, new figures show.
The latest pay survey from Incomes Data Services says that negotiators in
the private sector have responded to lower inflation while the government's
1.5 per cent pay limit in the public sector is hold-ing.
Since the start of the year the level of wage settlements has fallen, with
half those concluded so far between 2 per cent and 3.9 per cent.

FT  19 APR 93 / BA offers deal for part-time working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS said yesterday that it will give a lump-sum payment of six
months' salary to any of its 6,000 ground staff at London's Heathrow airport
who accept an offer to work part-time as part of the airline's drive to cut
costs and make its operations more flexible.
It said many employees, who include baggage handlers and check-in staff, had
expressed interest in working part-time. BA wants to streamline its Heathrow
workforce to fit in better with the peaks and troughs of daily traffic.
Most flight activity at Heathrow comes in the morning, when long-haul
flights arrive from the Far East and the Americas, and in the evening, when
many depart. Shuttle and business traffic is also heaviest at these times.
News of BA's offer comes as the UK and US governments hold talks today aimed
at restarting negotiations on greater access to each other's skies. Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, is expected to repeat that more US access to
regional airports in Britain can be agreed only if the US grants the same to
UK airlines.
Mr MacGregor is likely to say at the meeting this afternoon with Mr Federico
Pena, US transportation secretary, that the UK wants to operate to
destinations beyond the 22 main hubs such as New York. So far the US has
been reluctant to allow this.
Lufthansa, the German airline, has also complained about restricted access
to airports in the US.
BA yesterday gave no indication about how many people it expected to accept
its Heathrow working proposals.
Under BA's proposals there would be two schemes for those prepared to move
to part-time working: 'Switch', for the under-50s wanting to shorten their
working week, and 'Wind Down', for those over 50 who want to work less as
they approach retirement.
The offer of six months' extra pay applies to both schemes. Those in the
'Wind Down' scheme would have their pension rights protected.
BA started asking staff earlier this year if they wanted to change to
part-time working and expects to know by the end of this month how many are
interested.
It declined to say yesterday how many employees it expected to take up the
offer, how many it would like to see on part-time working, or whether the
schemes could be extended to other parts of BA.

FT  19 APR 93 / A difficult test for the new boy: The educational challenge
facing Sir Ron Dearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR RON Dearing, a former chairman of the Post Office, today takes over what
promises to be the most difficult job in British education. He has been
entrusted by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, with reviewing the
entire national curriculum for England and Wales.
The increasingly confrontational tactics used this weekend by the government
and by the unions threatening to boycott national curriculum tests make his
position awkward.
Sir Ron wants the tests to go ahead, saying he needs them as evidence if the
system is to be improved. He said: 'I really do need that information. That
would enable me to make proposals for changes. I have views, but views
aren't as convincing, with respect, as hands-on experience and true
independent evaluation.'
He could not do an 'honest job' of serving teachers without completed tests,
evaluated by the Office for Standards in Education, he said. He has already
arranged meetings with all six teachers' unions, a move which Mr Patten has
consistently refused to make.
This moderate stance could, however, be undercut by the legal action brought
against the teachers by Wandsworth Borough Council. This reaches the Appeal
Court tomorrow. Letters Mr Patten will send to governors and head teachers
this week, telling them they are legally obliged to enforce the tests, add
to the atmosphere of confrontation.
Sir Ron's potential influence over what children are taught is
unprecedented. He takes over today as chairman of both the National
Curriculum Council, responsible for setting the curriculum, and the School
Examinations and Assessment Council, which decides on testing the
curriculum. In October these two bodies will merge into the School
Curriculum and Assessment Authority, under his chairmanship.
He wants the SCAA to be autonomous, saying: 'I've never had any political
affiliation. I'm working first and foremost for the future of our
youngsters. I regard myself as having an obligation to parents, and very
much to teachers, who are out there in the front line doing a very demanding
job, and finally to parliament.'
Previous incumbents at the NCC and the SEAC were hampered by a close
identification with government education policy.
His efforts to win over teachers appeared to make some headway after his
meeting with Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of
Teachers and Lecturers, which is not affiliated to the TUC.
Mr Smith said: 'It was a very constructive meeting and I went away confident
that he understands the reality of the immediate problems, and that he was
in the business of attempting to solve problems rather than aggravate them.'
The ATL is still, however, calling for the tests to be abandoned. Mr Smith
said: 'To put a lot of time and effort into something which everyone accepts
isn't working and is not likely to work doesn't make a great deal of sense.'
Sir Ron could yet play a crucial role in reforming the education system if
the political row abates. Whether he has the chance to play it seems to
depend on Mr Patten, and on the teachers' unions.

FT  19 APR 93 / Labour hopes to force retreat on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WILL today launch a fresh attempt at forcing ministers to back down
over Maastricht's social chapter, hoping to dent government optimism that
the bill's committee stage will end soon and without more concessions.
Mr George Robertson, Labour's Europe spokesman, will meet Mr Michael Morris,
deputy speaker, to urge him to rethink the amendments on the social chapter
selected for debate. But Labour is now looking more to the bill's 'report
stage' - likely to follow soon after the committee stage - as offering the
best chance of forcing a further government retreat.
Last week ministers agreed to support a Commons debate on the social chapter
before formal ratification but after the bill completes its Commons stage,
expected after the Danish referendum on May 18.
Labour and Tory Euro-rebel MPs agreed yesterday that the committee stage was
likely to end next week, or possibly even this week if the government won
votes allowing all-night sittings.
MPs are likely to vote on clause one of the three-clause bill today. Labour
will abstain, allowing the bill to proceed but provoking Liberal Democrat
and government accusations that they are anti-European. Mr Robertson said:
'We couldn't vote for clause one because there is still a social chapter
opt-out.'
Votes on new clauses to the bill, including on a referendum, could follow on
Wednesday or Thursday and perhaps one day next week.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, is pledged to vote against a referendum and
the rebels in his party or among Conservatives are unlikely to force a
government defeat.
One Foreign Office insider said: 'By the week and by the day, the general
confidence of the government is underpinned and reinforced.'
Labour wants the reinstatement of its amendment 27 for debate which it
believes would have the effect of forcing the social chapter on the
government and, in spite of ministers' denials, is seen by some Tory
Euro-sceptics as a possible wrecking amendment.
Mr Robertson is also urging the reinstatement of new clause 74, which would
impose tougher conditions on the debate on the social chapter than the
government conceded last week.
Mr Morris decided against selecting amendment 27 last week but Labour hopes
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker who will preside over the report stage,
will be more sympathetic.

FT  19 APR 93 / Wage-link fines under review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is 'anxiously' reviewing the system of unit fines in which
courts penalise offenders according to their ability to pay as well as the
seriousness of the offence, the Home Office confirmed yesterday.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, is looking at ways to end anomalies
such as minor offences attracting heavy penalties. The Home Office said that
new legislation might not be required.
Unit fines were introduced under the 1991 Criminal Justice Act. Mr Clarke
said in the Commons last week: 'I share the view of the Magistrates
Association that in principle unit fines are right.
'However, we know that in practice they are producing some odd results,
perhaps partly because of the way in which the rules to implement the act
have been drawn up and partly because some magistrates' courts are not
familiar with their powers.'

FT  19 APR 93 / Solicitors warned against 'sharp practices' on fees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW solicitors are using what amounts to sharp practice by substantially
increasing their original fixed fees in small cases, a representative of the
lord chancellor said yesterday.
Mr John Taylor, parliamentary secretary at the Lord Chancellor's Department,
regretted that solicitors were not required to inform clients of the likely
costs of taking on a case and the basis of charging.
Mr Taylor said at the Law Society's Oxford weekend conference: 'For the
small client - probably someone who will go to the solicitor only once in a
lifetime and that once because they have to rather than because they choose
to - the profession too often asks, as it were, for a blank cheque.'
He said it was crucial for ethical standards to have a place in solicitors'
business. Mr Taylor referred to a few cases where clients were encouraged to
enter into a fixed-fee arrangement which 'somehow becomes inappropriate and
is replaced by a much more substantial fee'.
In other cases a low-cost service was offered which was so poor it led to
continued problems and further ex-pense.
'Tales such as this smack of sharp practice rather than of professionalism.
They also do a disservice to the profession as a whole,' he said.
He thought the Law Society's remuneration certificate procedure - which
allows clients to challenge solicitors' bills without further costs - was a
'valuable safeguard'.

FT  19 APR 93 / Attali defends spending by bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES ATTALI, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, yesterday denied responsibility for the way in which Pounds
200m was spent by the bank on fitting out its London offices and meeting
overheads since its launch two years ago.
He said on the BBC TV Breakfast With Frost programme that it had not been
his role to decide on the Pounds 750,000 spent on replacing and installing
new marble at the entrance to the bank's headquarters in the City.
'My role was to decide on the budget and to get it agreed by the board of
the bank and to be sure that the cost of the building would be at the lower
range of a City average,' he said.
Mr Attali, who is to be questioned this week by Mr Theo Waigel, German
finance minister who is chairman of the bank, over the allegations of
excessive spending at the bank said he had nothing to apologise for.
He said the bank had one-off start-up costs and that by investing to create
its headquarters in the UK, the government would attract more business for
the country. He said that many countries had competed to have the bank's
headquarters in their capitals. 'I think it was a good decision for the
British government to decide to invest a lot of money in the headquarters.'
Mr Attali avoided the question of whether he should resign if that was the
price of restoring the bank's credibility.

FT  19 APR 93 / Housing cash to be 'clawed back'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INCREASE in funds for spending on local authority housing projects
announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in last year's Autumn
Statement, will be clawed back, a survey by the Institute of Housing
suggests.
The institute says today that a survey of 30 directors of housing
authorities indicated that the amount raised as a result of Mr Lamont's
decision to allow local authorities to spend all capital receipts generated
from the sale of assets in the year to December will be far less than the
Pounds 1.75bn he anticipated.
The government first estimated that of this amount, Pounds 1.1bn would be
available from the sale of housing assets, a figure which the Department of
the Environment has revised to Pounds 950m.
The institute's estimate is that housing receipts will total about Pounds
750m.
Mr John Perry, director of policy at the institute, said: 'Many local
authorities are finding that the capital receipts holiday has a sting in the
tail. The holiday is being paid for at the expense of investment in 1994 and
1995. Government will cut Pounds 441m to pay for a relatively minor boost
now.'
The survey finds that although the authorities anticipate generating Pounds
150m in receipts this year, with Pounds 80m already earmarked for housing
investment, there will be no new local-authority building and only 400
additional homes will be built through housing associations.
The institute said that every director surveyed expressed concern about the
reduction in the government's contribution to mandatory renovation grants
from 75 per cent to 60 per cent.

FT  19 APR 93 / Rail union will meet on dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXECUTIVE committee of the RMT, the main rail union, meets today to
decide its next move in its dispute with British Rail which has already
resulted in two one-day strikes which paralysed the network, Robert Taylor
writes.
There had been speculation that the RMT would switch the strike day from
Friday to midweek, but Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary, has stressed that
no decision on further action has yet been taken.
The prospects of an early settlement improved over the weekend after the
union said it had detected signs of a change in BR's bargaining stance over
compulsory redundancies and the use of contract labour.
It wants a guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies for its
members and a moratorium on the further use of contract labour.
Today, Aslef, the drivers' union, is due to meet BR to try to resolve their
specific differences over the future of the drivers' national agreement.

FT  19 APR 93 / Lloyd's urged to delay Names' writs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Association of Lloyd's Members has urged the insurance market to extend
the moratorium on writs against names in the troubled Gooda Walker
syndicates.
Mr Val Powell, chief executive of the association, made the plea in a letter
to Mr Brian Garraway, chairman of Lloyd's of London's regulatory board.
The moratorium on all writs seeking to recover funds from Lloyd's Names is
due to end on April 30.
Members of the four Gooda Walker syndicates are among the worst-hit of the
insurance market's Names - the individuals who supply its capital. Their
losses amount to more than Pounds 900m, with many individuals facing losses
of more than Pounds 1m.
Following the release of a 200-page report on the four lossmaking Gooda
Walker syndicates which was passed to the Serious Fraud Office last week, Mr
Powell argues that the moratorium on writs against the Names should not be
lifted.
In the light of the report, he says, 'It is clear that Names will have been
encouraged to join certain syndicates on the basis of a false prospectus.'
The report focuses on the use by the Gooda Walker syndicates of 'time and
distance' policies - reinsurance policies that allow Lloyd's syndicates to
manage their reserves against long-tail claims, which emerge many years
after the inception of policies - more effectively. Such deals allow
insurers to 'discount' their reserves against future claims.

The AEEU engineering union last night appealed for talks to settle the
bitter Timex dispute, and warned the row could scare potential foreign

The union issued its plea on the eve of the Scottish TUC congress in
Glasgow, where the dispute, now in its third month, is to be debated on
Tuesday.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, AEEU national executive member for Scotland, said the union
was willing to negotiate a settlement on the sole precondition that the

CUTS will claw back the increase in revenue to local authority housing for
spending on capital projects announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
in last year's Autumn Statement, the Institute of Housing says today,
Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
It says in a survey the amount raised will be far less than the Pounds

The institute's estimate is that housing receipts would total about Pounds
750m.
The survey of 30 directors of housing authorities was undertaken to
establish whether housing receipts were likely to create the investment in
growth anticipated by the government and whether there was evidence that
receipts were helping to produce more homes to rent.
It finds that although the authorities anticipate generating Pounds 150m in
receipts this year, with Pounds 80m already earmarked for housing
investment, there will be no new local-authority building and only 400
additional homes will be built through housing associ-ations.

FT  19 APR 93 / Painful reforms should yield surge in third world's growth /
Analysis of the latest World Bank report on prospects for developing
countries - with east Asia leading the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Bank is forecasting a surge in developing countries' growth rates
over the next ten years, as a result of the often painful economic reforms
they have undertaken.
Growth in the developing world is projected at 4.7 per cent a year over the
period 1992-2002, compared to 2.7 per cent in 1982-1992, according to the
Washington-based multilateral development bank's annual forecasts.*
Gross domestic product per capita is expected to grow at 2.9 per cent a year
 -more than three times the 0.8 per cent rate of the last ten years.
Mr D C Rao, the bank's acting senior economist, said much of the improvement
reflected the transformation of economic policy in the developing countries
in recent years: trade rules have been liberalised, the policy of import
substitution abandoned, over-valued exchange rates corrected, public
finances brought under control and the state's role in industry and commerce
reduced.
These policy changes have led to a 'remarkable resurgence' of private
capital flows to the developing countries, with foreign direct investment
climbing by 50 per cent over the last two years to Dollars 38bn in 1992,
with portfolio investment growing even more explosively to Dollars 34bn last
year.
The World Bank expects growth in the developing world to be led by east
Asia, where growth is projected to slow slightly over the next decade but to
remain at the high level of 7.3 per cent a year. East Asia now accounts for
a quarter of output in the developing world, Mr Rao said. Over the next ten
years, its weight is likely to rise to one third.
In Latin America, the World Bank says growth of nearly 4 per cent a year is
achievable over the next ten years, compared with a rate of 1.9 per cent a
year in 1982-92, if countries such as Chile, Mexico and Argentina persevere
with their domestic policies and if Brazil adopts credible policies of
macro-economic stabilisation.
Sub-Saharan Africa could see growth rise from 2.0 per cent over the last ten
years to 3.7 per cent in the decade ahead, largely as a result of
improvements the World Bank anticipates in prices of commodities such as
coffee and cocoa.
If their fundamental reforms succeed, the national economies of eastern
Europe and central Asia should stop contracting and start to grow at a rate
of 2.1 per cent for the next ten years, attaining a trend rate of 4 to 5 per
cent in the second half of the decade.
Mr Rao cautioned that the World Bank's forecasts were heavily reliant on the
assumption that the recovery that now appeared to be consolidating itself in
the US would spread to the rest of the G7 leading industrial nations, with a
prospect of sustained growth in the developed world over the medium term,
combined with lower real interest rates.
The forecasts also assume faster growth in world trade, a stabilisation in
real non-oil commodity prices, and a continuation of policy improvements,
especially in Latin America.
'A more pessimistic set of assumptions would halve the rate at which
developing countries' per capita income grows to about 1.3 per cent per
year,' Mr Rao said, warning that this would mean an increase of 80m in the
number of people living in poverty.
One of the most serious threats to the economic prospects of the developing
countries is the continued failure to make progress in the Uruguay Round
trade liberalisation.
Countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are hit by tariffs averaging 7 to
8 per cent on their exports to developed countries and by non-tariff
barriers on 60 to 80 per cent of the goods they export, while expanding
market opportunities are also critical for the prospects of the reforming
economies of eastern and central Europe.

JUST a quarter of the Dollars 8.6bn of western financing pledged to Poland
in the last three years, or Dollars 2.1bn, had reached public and private
investment projects by the end of last year, according to Poland's Central
Planning Office (CUP).
A CUP study has also pointed to the tying of western government loans to
purchases of equipment from specific countries as the reason for the meagre
draw-down on the Dollars 6.2bn of funds committed in support of Poland's
economic transformation programme.
Of the Dollars 5.3bn of bilateral credit pledged by western governments
since 1990, Dollars 3.6bn was made available and just Dollars 268m spent,
the report says.
In terms of tied loans, Italy was a star performer, with 78 per cent of the
Dollars 468m it said it was prepared to lend having been assigned to
concrete projects. But only 1.5 per cent of Australia's Dollars 200m credit,
which can only be used on Australian wool and hides, was spent.
World Bank disbursement has also been delayed, with Dollars 2.6bn promised
and Dollars 2.2bn committed, yet only Dollars 775m spent. Mr Ian Hume, head
of the World Bank office in Warsaw, said the delays came down to, 'in
essence, an anti-investment climate' in Poland caused by the struggle to
maintain tight monetary policies with high interest rates.
The Ecu224m (Pounds 178m) pledged by the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development to public sector projects has yet to be spent. The study did
not analyse the EBRD's private sector projects in Poland, which amount to
Ecu310m, but their draw-down should be better. Two-thirds of this sum has
been committed to western companies such as Ameritech, ABB or Pilkington
investing in Poland.

FT  19 APR 93 / Donors 'undermine their efforts' by tying aid to companies
at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AID donors are undermining their own efforts to help developing countries by
tying their assistance to requirements that goods or services be procured
from companies in their own countries, the World Bank warns, George Graham
reports from Washington.
Such donors, the bank believes, could generate another Dollars 4bn a year of
benefits for the third world by untying their aid.
Tied aid is meant to help domestic employment and exports, but may have
little effect in the donor country, the bank argues.
'The lobbying of individual sectors or business firms in the donor country
for directed subsidies is a more rational, if less laudable, explanation for
tying,' it concludes, in its annual review: Global Economic Prospects and
the Developing Countries.
For the recipient country, however, the direct cost may be more than 15 per
cent of the aid given.
'Untying all aid flows would generate economic benefits to developing
countries of as much as Dollars 4bn per year, which equals one-fifth of the
nominal increase in aid flows over the past decade,' the World Bank says.
Some improvement has occurred: 44 per cent of aid was tied in 1989, and 7
per cent partially untied, compared with 48 per cent tied and 12 per cent
partially untied in 1977-1979.
A further improvement in the percentage is likely as a result of the
agreement last year by industrialised nations to abide by new guidelines by
way of limiting the use of mixed credits, which combine aid, export credits
and non-concessional loans.

SPAIN'S general election could produce a hung parliament on June 6,
according to the first opinion polls to be published since socialist Prime

from Madrid.
A poll by the Madrid newspaper El Mundo puts the centre-right opposition
People's Party(PP) narrowly ahead of the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE),
while another in the Barcelona daily El Periodico has the ruling party
winning by a slender margin. A third poll, published by Madrid's YA

vote.
All three surveys forecast a hung parliament.

FT  19 APR 93 / Egyptian minister sacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt yesterday sacked his minister of the
interior, following rising criticism of the violent response by the security
forces to the recent wave of attacks by Islamic extremists.
Mr Mohammed Abdel-Halim Moussa had ordered large-scale police assaults
against suspected extremist hideouts in upper Egypt, and in the Cairo
district of Imbaba, during which dozens of people were killed or injured. He
is replaced by another former governor of Asyut, Mr Hussein Mohammed
al-Alfi.
The new minister immediately vowed a 'decisive and comprehensive
confrontation with the outlaws,' suggesting his predecessor had been sacked
for lack of success rather than harshness of approach.
Mr Mubarak has repeatedly blamed Iran for the terrorist attacks, which have
cost Egypt hundreds of millions of dollars in lost tourism revenue.
He said recently that the authorities knew the identities of the extremists
and that they would eradicate the problem within a few months.
The Egyptian leader also defended the tactics of the security forces and
denied that detainees had been ill-treated.
Groups of liberal, secular professionals have warned the president that his
policies were forcing Egyptians into an intolerable choice between an
incompetent government and a radical Islamic alternative.
In another appointment, Mr Youssef Boutros Ghali, an economist and a
relative of the UN secretary-general, has been appointed a minister of state
 -recognition of his key role in talks with the IMF.

FT  19 APR 93 / Arab delegations force delay in Mideast talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB delegations to the Middle East peace negotiations have forced a week's
delay in the opening of the ninth round of talks which had been due to begin
in Washington tomorrow.
After a weekend of intensive contacts, Arab diplomats said that a new target
date of April 27 had been set for the talks, in the hope that Israel could
be persuaded to ease its position on permitting home the nearly 400
Palestinian deportees who were expelled to southern Lebanon in mid-December.
The Palestinian delegation has also been angered by Israel's decision three
weeks ago to seal off the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, thereby denying
tens of thousands the opportunity to get to their workplaces. The Israeli
action was condemned by the Palestinians as another obstacle to resumption
of talks.
After discussing the issues in Damascus on Friday and Saturday, members of
the four delegations flew to Cairo yesterday for a meeting of the Arab
League. Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syrian foreign minister, told Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, that the four Arab delegations would be
unable to meet the April 20 date set for a resumption.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
said in Tunis that he was still not certain whether the new April 27 date
could be kept.
Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have all expressed a desire to resume negotiations
with Israel as soon as possible. But they also wish to preserve a common
Arab position and accept that the Palestinians have been put in a very
difficult position by Israel's actions in the occupied territories.
Extremists continued efforts to sabotage the process yesterday when an
Israeli lawyer was killed in the Gaza Strip.

FT  19 APR 93 / Mandela eases himself into S Africa's media spotlight -
Patti Waldmeir witnesses a profound shift in the balance of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT times of great national crisis, South Africans are accustomed to seeing
their leader address them on national television.
But now, as the country faces perhaps its greatest political crisis to date,
the face on prime time television screens is not Mr F W de Klerk, the
president, but Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress.
When Mr Chris Hani, the guerrilla leader, was assassinated, Mr Mandela
broadcast a live address to appeal for calm. On the eve of last Wednesday's
national day of mourning, Mr Mandela addressed the nation at 7pm, 8pm and
11pm. For his part, Mr de Klerk issued a statement from his seaside holiday
home, via his press secretary resting at another holiday resort.
There can be no clearer evidence of the profound shift which has occurred in
the balance of power between white and black.
The ruling National Party still insists that it will never 'hand over power'
to blacks; but most of their supporters think they have already done so.
Gone are the days when Mr P W Botha, the former president, would simply
declare a nationwide state of emergency and detain 50,000 people to deal
with a crisis.
Mr de Klerk's language over the past few days has recalled the hardline
rhetoric of the finger-wagging former President. But he cannot match him in
action.
The fact is that Mr de Klerk cannot rule South Africa without Mr Mandela's
help. With his dark threats against 'radicals' (which he knows he cannot
carry out without sparking civil war) and his frantic warnings of a descent
into chaos, Mr de Klerk has cut a somewhat pathetic figure in recent days.
He may be President, but Mr Mandela is South Africa's leader.
This was never more apparent than when the ANC leader dominated TV screens
on Tuesday evening (furious that his address had been cut in half for the
8pm newscast, he insisted on - and was granted - the right to broadcast
again in full at 11pm).
Speaking with all the dignity and gravitas of the tribal African chieftain
which he is, Mr Mandela tried to use his eloquence and authority to heal the
racial rift caused by the murder of one of black South Africa's greatest
heroes.
'Tonight I am reaching out to every single South African, black and white,
from the very depths of my being,' he said. He praised the white woman who
had risked her life to identify Mr Hani's assassin and condemned those who
would 'plunge our country into another Angola.'
'Now is the time for all South Africans to stand together against those who,
from any quarter, wish to destroy what Chris Hani gave his life for - the
freedom of all of us.'
Mr de Klerk's statements, by contrast, have been clearly partisan in nature,
aimed at his white constituents, who have been outraged and terrified by the
violence which has followed the assassination. He has showed little
understanding of the anger and loss felt by the black majority; his
condolences lacked sincerity.
Mr de Klerk was no doubt worried that too sympathetic a response would
antagonise whites, who largely viewed Mr Hani as a communist demon. But for
a man who portrays himself as the natural leader of a multi-racial South
Africa, he has showed little ability to bridge the racial gulf.
Mr Mandela's leadership abilities are also under severe strain. Dealing with
large, young, militant crowds is not his forte. His style of public speaking
is pedantic rather than charismatic. And he will have further enraged whites
by allowing his more militant ANC colleagues to persuade him that the ANC
should carry on mass protest actions for another six weeks.
His task is difficult: he must be seen to respond to the anger of militant
youths while keeping them under control. It will take a rare man to tread
that tightrope for a further six weeks.

FT  19 APR 93 / Ireland in drive to halve 20% unemployment rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ruari Quinn, Ireland's minister for enterprise and employment, believes
Ireland's unemployment rate can be halved by the end of the decade from 20
per cent to around 10 per cent, as a result of policies being manoeuvred
into place by the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government.
These include renewed emphasis on promoting indigenous Irish industry, on
targeting small businesses with venture capital funding, on legislating for
new investment products which will encourage equity investment by fund
managers in Irish industry, 'and massive investment in improving the skills
base of the workforce,' he said.
Until January Mr Quinn was the Irish Labour Party's spokesman on economic
affairs. Labour's breakthrough at last November's election gave it leverage
to negotiate for powerful positions in the coalition government. One of
those was Mr Quinn's, which merged the ministerial post of labour with those
of industry and commerce.
'We have merged the two departments because we want to do away with the old
adversarial approach in the process of wealth creation and replace it with a
social partnership approach. We want agreement between industry, the unions
and government on a long-term strategy - so that any foreign investor can
come here to Ireland and knock on the door of any of the three and know that
we are all talking the same langauage,' he said.
Ireland's past three finance ministers, starting with Mr Ray MacSharry in
1987, all adopted this approach, firstly through the Programme for National
Recovery, and later through the Programme for Social and Economic Progress.
The public sector pay elements of this agreement will expire at the end of
this year. Both programmes have sought to lay down macro-economic parameters
to attain price stability, reduce government debt and to improve incomes
through economic growth and gradual tax reductions. They have been largely
successful. Ireland's economy has outperformed most EC partners over the
past five years in GDP growth.
The cost, however, has been heavy in unemployment. Labour's success at the
polls last year was largely on the back of the lengthening dole queues and
the expectation that Labour would do something to reverse the trend.
'Our strategy is to build on a skill-based workforce. We are no longer a
country of low-cost labour, and we don't aspire to return to that. Low-cost
manufacturing jobs are drifting out of Europe anyway. We want intellectual
skills-based industry here, such as electronics, pharmaceuticals,
telemarketing and software. We shall continue to promote foreign investment,
but our central focus will be on building and strengthening indigenous
companies,' he said.
Where will the funding come from to finance these plans? Mr Quinn says that
the IPounds 8bn (Pounds 8bn) in EC structural and cohesion funds due to be
paid to Ireland over the next seven years will go a long way to help finance
improvements. But he hopes the bulk will come from new equity investment.

<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES is looking hard at its social problems after the verdicts in the
Rodney King case brought some relief to the city's tension and lessened, at
least for the time being, its fear of new riots.
Politicians welcomed the peaceful end to the federal court trial, in which a
jury found two policemen guilty and acquitted two others of violating the
rights of Mr King, a black motorist, whose beating by officers was
videotaped and shown on television.
Appealing for action on the city's problems, the Rev Jesse Jackson, the
black leader, said the real question was not how to relieve fears but how to
raise people's hopes.
'Hopes come in the form of jobs, and health care and education and justice,'
he said. 'If we can have a plan to rebuild Russia, it is time to have a plan
to rebuild Los Angeles.'
Some 40,000-50,000 people were left unemployed by last year's riots, sparked
off when the four police officers were acquitted in a state court. 'Hundreds
and hundreds of small latino and black-owned businesses remain nothing but
ashes and ruins,' said Mr Fernando Oaxaca of the Latino Coalition for a New
LA.
Police blanketed city streets yesterday to guard against trouble as defence
lawyers charged that the two officers convicted were sacrificed to prevent
rioting.
The jury found Sergeant Stacey Koon, who directed Mr King's beating, and
Officer Laurence Powell, who delivered most of the baton blows, guilty.
Their lawyers claimed they were convicted because jurors feared acquitting
them would plunge the city into another wave of violence. However, a juror,
who was not identified, denied on television that this had played any part
in their deliberations.
In the event, no riots occurred. But many fear that unless social problems
are tackled they will lead to new violence - perhaps this year when an
appeal by the convicted officers is heard or when black youths face trial
over the beating of a truck driver during last year's riots, in which 53
people died and nearly Dollars 1bn in damage was caused.
LA voters will go to the polls tomorrow to elect a new mayor to replace Mr
Tom Bradley, who is retiring after 20 years in office. Also on tomorrow's
ballots is a measure that would raise property taxes to pay for 1,000
additional police officers.
However, the turnout is expected to be extremely low, with the election all
but eclipsed by the trial. Two dozen candidates are registered, and a
run-off vote in June is likely.
President Bill Clinton, speaking in Pittsburgh, praised the verdicts of the
federal court jury, saying they 'confirmed what many felt in their hearts'.
At the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, a rallying point for the
black community in Los Angeles since the riots, Reverend Cecil Murray
concluded: 'We are not going to have peace at last, but peace for the
moment.'

FT  19 APR 93 / Appreciating Japan's soaring exchange rate problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS

<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL economy of the yen-dollar exchange rate remains mystifying, as
the events of the past week demonstrate. Surely, with the US increasingly
hot under the collar over Japan's rising trade surplus, the surge in the yen
to record levels against the dollar ought to be a cause for celebration in
Tokyo? Nothing could be further from the truth.
Disapproving noises about the yen's rise have been seeping out in recent
months from the Ministry for International Trade and Industry, the Liberal
Democratic party and, recently, from Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno.
Yesterday finance minister Yoshiro Hayashi joined the chorus, declaring that
the appreciation had been too speculative and was having 'a negative effect
on the economy'.
It is easy to see why Miti is worried. Japanese companies are troubled by
weak domestic demand and squeezed profit margins. The appreciating exchange
rate, already 10 per cent higher against the dollar since the beginning of
this year, compounds these domestic difficulties by undermining companies'
ability to divert production abroad. With 60 per cent of export contracts
denominated in dollars, a stronger yen raises the dollar price of Japanese
exports in foreign markets while reducing the yen prices of foreign imports
into Japan. The Economic Planning Agency calculates that each 10 per cent
yen rise cuts half a percentage point from Japanese gross national product.
Harder to understand are the concerns of the Ministry of Finance and the
Bank of Japan. Economically, an appreciating currency is the inevitable
counterpart to Japan's growing trade surplus, needed in order to persuade
investors to provide the capital outflow to balance the trade surplus.
Politically, a higher yen ought to ease tension by meeting the US
administration's demands for tangible steps to reduce the trade surplus.
Financially, a stronger currency is a good way to keep a lid on inflation by
reducing import price pressures. The yen appreciation is already pleasing
inflation hawks: wholesale prices fell by 0.5 per cent in March, and were
2.3 per cent lower than a year ago.
The problem is that the short-term effects on the trade surplus of a strong
yen make the trade surplus bigger and so worsen Jaoan's international
relations. The reason is the close relationship between changes in the
yen-dollar exchange rate and changes in the trade surplus, as the chart
taken from the Bank of Japan's latest quarterly bulletin reveals.
When the yen appreciated in 1985 and 1986, the trade surplus grew too; when
the yen weakened throughout 1989 and 1990, the trade surplus contracted; the
rise in the yen since then has been accompanied by renewed growth in the
surplus. For, while a higher exchange rate makes Japanese exports more
expensive and thus should reduce volumes, it also raises the dollar value of
each export unit sold.
The chart breaks the change in the trade surplus into three components: the
change in the volume of exports and imports, changes in the price of imports
and exports, and changes in the product composition of exports and imports.
Exchange-rate driven price effects tend to dwarf the volume effect, at least
in the short run. While the rise in the yen between 1985 and 1987 cut export
volumes and raised import volumes throughout the rest of the decade, the
price effect of the yen's appreciation swamped the volume changes.
Little wonder the Japanese are worried about the yen's continued rise. The
rise in the dollar value of the trade surplus over the past two years is
almost entirely the result of the yen's appreciation since 1990, while the
latest trade figures show a monthly surplus in March of Dollars 13.8bn, 26
per cent up on the previous year. In time a stronger yen should should
reduce Japan's surplus by boosting import values. But the dollar value of
the surplus is likely to rise before it falls. President Clinton was right
to welcome the yen's appreciation at last week's summit with Japanese prime
minister Kiichi Miyazawa. But if he wants results, Mr Clinton will have to
wait.

FT  19 APR 93 / Showdown in US-EC procurement row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE denouement of the latest US-EC feud over government procurement is
scheduled to come today and tomorrow during the third meeting between the
top trade officials, Mr Mickey Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, Nancy Dunne
writes from Washington.
Either Sir Leon, the EC commissioner for trade, will agree to waive the
offending Article 29 of the EC Utilities Directive, which the US argues
makes it more difficult than ever for US companies to win telecommunications
and heavy electrical equipment contracts in Europe.
Or Mr Kantor, US trade representative, will ban EC companies from bidding on
various US government procurement contracts, a retaliation estimated to cost
Dollars 45m-Dollars 50m a year. Furthermore he will proceed to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to complain that the offending article
extends government rules to private sector activities, a Gatt violation.
The real contest between them has been and continues to be over the shape of
the negotiations. The US insists the subject is utilities procurement -
telecommunications and power equipment. The EC wants to bring in the entire
body of Buy America provisions, which apply to defence, transportation,
airports, waterways and other services.
The US complains that the EC is throwing in the iniquities of American state
governments, while ignoring the discriminations of its own sub-federal
procurement agencies.
In this week's face-off, Mr Kantor is in the enviable position of being
unable to lose. He is seeking, as an 'interim' agreement, a real opening of
the Dollars 15bn-Dollars 25bn a year EC utilities procurement market. This
would be achieved by a waiver of Article 29 upon certification that the US
gives EC companies 'comparable' access in the market.
If he fails to get the waiver and institutes the threatened sanctions, Mr
Kantor will have demonstrated his grit to Congress. This could leave the
administration free of the kind of congressional initiatives foisted on
previous presidents, who seemed more reluctant to act.
The US does not argue that it is without sin in discrimination in the
awarding of its government procurement contracts. Its transgressions are
rooted in the Buy American Act of 1933, discriminating against foreign
companies in federal, state and local bidding.
In fact a more unbiased source than the EC - a Gatt dispute settlement panel
 -months ago found that the US government had violated its multinational
obligations by applying a Buy American provision to the procurement of a
sonar mapping system by the National Science Foundation. The US, which
complains about others blocking Gatt panel reports, has yet to adopt the
conclusion itself.
However, both US and EC procurement markets are riddled with domestic
preferences. Comparisons are tricky because of systemic differences between
the Community, where publicly-owned utilities predominate, and the US, where
most companies are privately owned.
US officials say they have 'incontrovertible evidence' that foreign
companies have gained at times great chunks of the US government utilities
market. However, this is not all that much, as 92 per cent of the US market
is in the private sector. And if Asian companies have been better able to
overcome the 6 per cent bidding preference given to American companies under
Buy American laws, then the US still offers the EC twice as many 'bidding
opportunities' in overall government procurement contracts. According to the
US figures, EC companies get to bid on Dollars 16.8bn (Pounds 11bn) in the
US market, compared with Dollars 7.8bn for American companies in the EC
market.
All these numbers have been presented to EC officials in talks leading up to
this week's showdown. If Sir Leon agrees to the waiver of Article 29, he
will get US agreement to the joint study he has proposed of the US and EC
procurement markets. It does not matter that this proposal was more probably
meant to delay than hasten a settlement; Mr Kantor has taken it up as a
route to the multilateral negotiating table.
US officials say an 'interim' agreement will have a salutary effect on the
US mood as the two economic powers continue to work on an expanded market
access package to wrap up the Gatt Uruguay Round.

FT  19 APR 93 / Young US leader shatters old Japanese trade certainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese, who understand symbols, used to feel rather proud when Mr
Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister from 1982 to 1987, represented them in
international deliberations. At sessions with President Ronald Reagan he had
plenty to say, forging apparently genuine first-name relationships with the
US administration, appropriate for a member of the statesmen's club. At G7
summits he was equally vocal and often was not even the shortest
participant.
The contrast with Friday in Washington could hardly have been greater.
There, captured on global television, was the young and vigorous 46-year-old
President Bill Clinton towering over his diminutive Japanese counterpart,
73-year-old Kiichi Miyazawa, a reflective man but the last, and therefore
the weakest, of his generation of Japanese politicians to become prime
minister.
Worse than the symbolic physical contrast between the two men, Mr Clinton
was lecturing Mr Miyazawa in a way that no US president has spoken publicly
to a Japanese prime minister in living memory. Here was a president born
after the last war telling a man old enough to have represented his country
at the San Francisco peace conference in 1951 that the world had changed,
the US was changing and that Japan would have to change with it.
This is serious stuff for Japan. The US has been the bedrock of its
international constellation since 1945. More particularly, inside the
relationship, there was an absolute Japanese assumption, even as it became
economically mighty, that the man in the White House was their ultimate
protector, no matter what retaliation was threatened by Congress, no matter
how many Japanese radios were smashed on the lawns of Capitol Hill and what
American public opinion felt about Japanese takeovers of US institutions.
Mr Clinton was careful not to throw all the co-operative fruits of the last
two generations out of the window. He emphasised US commitment to regional
Asian security, never threatened to withdraw US troops from Japan or South
Korea, and was complimentary about Japan's role as G7 chairman in putting
together the Russian aid package.
But he made it equally clear that, as far the US was concerned, the end of
the cold war had altered the nature of US perception of its own national
security. 'The cold war partnership between our two countries is outdated,'
he declared. 'We need a new partnership based on a longer-term vision and
above all based on mutual respect and responsibility.'
For Mr Clinton, who does not consider himself a protectionist as classically
defined, the foundation is a new trade and economic relationship. It means a
reduction in Japan's trade surplus, if necessary by agreements on specific
sectors, replete with numerical targets. It also implies a continuous
engagement by Japan in promoting global economic growth beyond the series of
emergency stimulus packages that Tokyo has frequently contrived to produce
as a result of US pressure.
Mr Miyazawa had conceded that 'gaiatsu' (foreign pressure leading to
Japanese concessions) was 'perhaps part of our culture'.
But that sometimes leisurely practice now runs squarely up against a US
government disinclined to be patient or play ritualistic games. In Tokyo
last week, even Mr Warren Christopher departed from his nominal diplomatic
brief as secretary of state to press his Japanese opposite numbers on
specifics such as the Japanese personal computer market.
The US impatience on bilateral trade and with Japan's passivity in the
Uruguay Round negotiations may also extend to a growing intolerance with the
introspection of the Japanese political system. The ruling Liberal
Democratic party's domestic problems are well understood in Washington, but
attract little sympathy.
If 'change' is the present leitmotif of US politics, then the inability to
adjust in the Japanese system becomes all the more difficult to accept,
especially when the US can see that there is a new, rising generation of
more outward-looking Japanese politicians apparently hungry for power but
still consigned to the waiting rooms.
Certainly, Mr Miyazawa has left Washington, like none of his recent
predecessors, with presidential fleas in his ear. For a country like Japan,
always comfortable in certitudes, this is a very disturbing message.

FT  19 APR 93 / Miyazawa returns after talks in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, yesterday returned to Tokyo
after two days of talks in Washington to a chorus of concern about the
prospects for Japan's economic relations with the US on both trade and
macro-economic issues, Charles Leadbeater writes from Tokyo.
Most business leaders raised doubts about the wisdom of US demands for
quantitative indicators to measure foreign access to segments of the
Japanese market. There are also concerns that the US is embarked on a
strategy to talk up the yen, to help choke off the growth of Japan's trade
surplus with the US.
Mr Miyazawa's visit confirmed worries in Japan that the Clinton
administration will be more assertive than its predecessor in pressing for
measurable results in reducing the trade deficit.
Mr Miyazawa and President Bill Clinton on Saturday agreed to set up a joint
panel to design a forum for discussing ways to reduce Japan's trade surplus.
Mr Clinton stressed such talks would have to lead to measurable results in
opening the Japanese market to competitive US producers.
He also noted that a strengthening of the yen against the dollar would help
to reduce the Japanese surplus and that Japan's recent Dollars 117bn
stimulus package was only a first step in resuscitating the flagging
Japanese economy.

FT  19 APR 93 / Fiat may co-operate with Milan magistrates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S political corruption scandal is poised to take a dramatic new turn,
with signs of an agreement by Fiat, the country's biggest private-sector
company, to co-operate voluntarily with Milan magistrates.
The accord, hammered out between magistrates and the group's lawyers at a
lengthy weekend meeting, could see Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive,
testifying before magistrates this week.
This represents a climbdown by Fiat, which has been increasingly implicated
in allegations of bribes over public-sector orders. At least seven senior
executives have become embroiled in the investigations, including Mr Giorgio
Garuzzo and Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief operating officer and
chief financial officer respectively.
Before the weekend agreement, magistrates appeared poised to issue a stream
of further cautionary warrants, including some for unspecified Fiat
managers. It is believed the warrants, covering contracts for the Enel state
electricity generating authority and the state railways, have been
temporarily rescinded.
Mr Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, admitted at the weekend his company's
involvement in doubtful practices. He told a conference of the Confindustria
employers' federation in Venice: 'At Fiat, too, some episodes of incorrect
mixing with the political system have been discovered.'
However, Mr Agnelli tried to draw a distinction between individuals and
companies drawn into the corruption scandal: 'It is desirable that the
inquiries should define as soon as possible the real significance of the
episodes concerning us or other companies, and distinguish between those who
have been serious industrialists and those, by contrast, who have based
their fortunes almost exclusively on systematic collusion with the
politicians.
'Fiat's heart is that of a company commited to free and strong competition
in the marketplace.'
It remains to be seen how Fiat will co-operate with magistrates. The
inquiries have touched four areas of its activities: construction, with
investigations of the Cogefar-Impresit building arm; railway equipment,
notably for the new Milan metro line; gas turbines, with allegations of
bribes to politicians on Enel orders; and buses, where the group's Iveco
commercial vehicles subsidiary is being probed for alleged payments for
orders from the city of Milan.

FT  19 APR 93 / Sink or swim as currency storm abates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW that the storms afflicting the European exchange rate mechanism have
quietened, the survivors appear to be pulling up the gang planks on the
unfortunates swept overboard.
Meanwhile, the hunt started by Britain for 'fault lines' in the ERM seems to
have reached a dead end. This is likely to place a possibly permanent
barrier to the UK goal of re-entering the system some time after the end of
this year.
These conclusions follow from the spate of mostly-secret government inquests
into the currency crises which reach a new stage today and tomorrow.
In discussions in Basle, Switzerland, governors from the 12 European
Community central banks plan to finish a report to be handed to EC finance
ministers next month on what caused the turmoil and lessons from it.
The talks will centre on the outlook for Britain and Italy, whose currencies
were forced to leave the ERM last autumn. There seems little chance that
either sterling or the lira will re-enter in the near future, given that
other countries led by Germany appear disinclined to bend the rules to allow
weaker currencies greater support.
Also worried about the future are Ireland, Spain and Portugal, all of which
kept their positions in the ERM only through devaluation. They would
probably be in the firing line if new ERM selling pressures were to emerge.
Denmark, France and Belgium saw their currencies emerge bloodied but
essentially unbowed by the turmoil, leaving Germany and the Netherlands the
only countries in the system to emerge with their currencies unscathed.
Even so, now that all currencies still in the ERM are trading comfortably
above their lower limits against the D-Mark, the EC govenors' inquiry has
lost some of its initial impetus. The consensus from this study - and from a
parallel inquiry by the EC monetary committee of officials from finance
ministries as well as central banks  - appears to be that big reforms of the
system are neither desirable nor likely.
Mr Lamberto Dini, deputy governor of the Bank of Italy, says: 'A number of
views have been expressed (about ERM strengthing) but there is no intention
of changing the existing system.' Mr Dini is the chairman of yet another
working party - from the Group of 10 industrial nations, which includes
Japan and the US as well as European representatives - which is also
examining fallout from the ERM storm. The group is doing this in the context
of a wider look at world currency fluctuations and will present its report
to ministers in Washington on April 30.
Much of the discussion in all three committees has been about how to ensure
all the countries in the mechanism help out currencies under threat. Current
ERM rules put the obligation on the strongest and weakest countries to take
action, either by currency intervention or changes in interest rates.
An innovative UK proposal - under which all countries would share the
profits and losses of buying weak currencies in the effort to prop them up -
has found little favour. This has been on the grounds it would reduce
pressures on weak countries to take avoiding action by a devaluation.
The disapproval has been led by the Bundesbank, which in recent months has
taken an increasingly hard line on making sure countries stick to existing
ERM rules based around D-Mark supremacy. This is the case even though a
'burden sharing' arrangement might help the Bundesbank avoid a repeat of its
heavy losses last autumn, arising from its spending of an unprecedented
DM90bn on buying weak currencies such as lira and sterling.

FT  19 APR 93 / Yeltsin has the edge as his referendum nears: Russia -
Referendum

<TEXT>
THE final week of campaigning in the critical referendum on support for
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, on which radical reform in that country
is thought to depend, opens today.
The polls show a significant - but not overwhelming - lead for Mr Yeltsin.
This indicates that the result of the referendum next Sunday will set off a
new round of hostilities between the president and his opponents in the
Russian parliament.
Mr Yeltsin went to the historic city of Vladimir, east of Moscow, yesterday.
There he took part in the Orthodox Easter procession and held talks with
Alexei II, the Orthodox Patriarch.
On Friday, he had secured a carefully orchestrated chorus of support from
leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States, meeting in Minsk.
Seperate polls in Moscow, St Petersburg and in various Russian regions show
between 50 and 60 per cent of those questioned willing to express their
trust in Mr Yeltsin, but a smaller percentage was shown as intending to
approve his economic and social policies.
A Moscow poll by the Institute of Sociology showed 35 per cent approved the
economic policy, while 27 per cent did not approve and 24 per cent had yet
to decide.
In St Petersburg, a poll by the Sociological Scientific Research Centre
showed 56 per cent for Mr Yeltsin, with 28 per cent against - but with only
38 per cent supporting his economic programme and 39 per cent against.
Polls taken by the Gallup organisation for the Russian government, over the
past week and based on group discussions, show about 60 per cent support for
Mr Yeltsin, continuing support for the creation of a market economy, but
substantial scepticism towards the privatisation programme.
Mr Yeltsin's supporters are calling for a 'yes' vote to three of the four
questions in the referendum - to trust the president, to support his
economic and social policies, and to call for early elections to a new
two-chamber partliament.
They are calling for a 'no' vote to a question on early presidential
elections.
Mr Yeltsin has said he will issue a decree tomorrow, which will lay down
that only a simple majority of those voting will be required for victory to
be declared in the referendum. The Russian parliament has decreed that a
majority of the electorate is required - which the opinion polls show to be
impossible, since only 60-65 per cent intend to vote.
Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, said at the weekend that he
understood the Constitutional Court would rule this week that the
parliament's decree on the level of support needed was unconstitutional.
However, Mr Yeltsin has said he will ignore any ruling of the Constitutional
Court because he no longer trusts it.
The parliament in the Russian North Caucasian republic of Chechnya has moved
to impeach the republic's president, General Dzhokar Dudayev, a day after he
had dissolved the legislature and declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew, according
to the Interfax news agency. Mr Husain Akhmadov, parliamentary chairman,
told the agency that Gen Dudayev was being impeached for 'trying to carry
out a state coup.'
The general, a former Soviet air force commander, declared Chechnya - then
part of the larger Chechen Ingushetia - independent a year and a half ago.
He imposed a curfew and dissolved the parliament after two days of
demonstrations in the centre of Grozny, the Chechen capital, against falling
living standards.

<TEXT>
THE voters trickle into the cavernous school building, converted into a
polling station, with the solemnity of people attending Mass. Wailing sirens
suddenly puncture the tranquility of this balmy Sunday morning in Palermo.
Then, amid a screech of brakes, a stocky figures steps out of an
armour-plated Fiat Croma, surrounded by bodyguards. Mr Leoluca Orlando,
former mayor of Palermo and founder of La Rete, the rapidly growing movement
for clean government, has come to cast his vote in Italy's ninth post-war
referendum.
Mr Orlando is bundled forward, scarcely given time to greet a few
supporters. An implacable opponent of the mafia, he is the politician most
at risk in Sicily.
Inside an upper room, election officials respectfully check his identity
card against the electoral register (one for men, another for women). He is
handed eight coloured folders, a different one for each of the referendum
proposals, then disappears into a small booth. Only his legs are visible.
To read the fine print of the proposals should take an average of eight
minutes, but he emerges after little more than one. The first slip he casts
into the line of eight boxes is yellow - the key ballot for ending
proportional representation and introducing a system of majority voting in
the Senate.
Although he originally backed the referendum movement, led by former
Christian Democrat Mr Mario Segni, Mr Orlando has since come out against the
majority vote proposal, claiming electoral reform has been hijacked by the
traditional parties.
'If the majority system is accepted,' he told a packed crowd on Friday
outside Palermo's decaying opera house, 'in the north we will have the
regions nearly all represented by the Lombard League and in the south by the
(Christian Democrat) old guard. The yes vote will mean that wholly
discredited people will be called on to carry out electoral reform.'

FT  19 APR 93 / Evacuation of Srebrenica under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER, AGENCIES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS peacekeeping troops last night entered Srebrenica, the fallen
enclave in eastern Bosnia, and evacuation of the first of tens of thousands
of trapped Moslems began.
General Philippe Morillon, commander of the UN Protection Force (Unprofor)
in Bosnia, said in Sarajevo that Srebrenica was under world guard following
the arrival of 145 Canadian UN soldiers. 'We can now guarantee the survival
of Srebrenica.'
The Canadians will monitor a ceasefire, collect arms from the Moslem
defenders and help demilitarise the area under a plan for the Serb forces
besieging the eastern Bosnian town to withdraw from positions around it.
The Canadians entered the town to a hero's welcome just hours after Serbs
and the Moslem-led Bosnian forces signed a UN-brokered truce, said ham radio
operators.
French and British helicopters then began ferrying sick and wounded to
Tuzla, 70km northwest, under an agreement permitting airborne evacuation of
the 500 most desperate cases before an overland evacuation starts for all
those who want to leave the town. UN officials said 133 people were
evacuated by nightfall.
But it is unlikely the mass evacuation will get fully under way before an
agreement is reached on the fate of the defeated defenders of Srebrenica.
Shattered refugees who earlier managed to escape to Tuzla, the biggest
government stronghold, described 'unbearable' conditions after a year under
Serb siege in the town, set in the foothills of the Drina River valley.
'Everyone wants to leave. There's no food. The Chetniks (Serb forces) were
constantly shooting at us,' said Ms Azreta Habibovic, who was fortunate to
escape before the Serb bombardment which on April 12 claimed 56 lives and
wounded scores more.
French prime minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday Gen Morillon's mission
had been extended and there were no plans to recall him, Reuter reports.
This appeared to contradict defence minister Francois Leotard, who said last
week Gen Morillon was unlikely to be in his post by next month.

FT  19 APR 93 / Obituary of Turgut Ozal: Reformer who built on Ataturk's
legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURGUT OZAL, who died suddenly on Saturday, dominated Turkish politics for
the last decade. Appointed by the generals in the wake of the 1980 coup
d'etat, he was to oversee Turkey's critical transition to civilian rule,
becoming prime minister in 1983 and eventually succeeding Gen Kenan Evren in
1989 as the country's second civilian president since the coup.
His achievements as a reformer are second only to those of Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk, the country's founder. If Ataturk erected the social and political
pillars of a pro-western, secular Turkey, Mr Ozal was the architect of the
country's economic recovery and the driving force behind its policy to join
the European Community.
His relations with the military were one of the central contradictions of
his career.
He remained, to his death, the only Turkish politician strong enough to
challenge the military on key security questions. As if to symbolise his
independence of the generals, on one famous occasion he was to review troops
dressed in Bermuda shorts and a sun hat.
In many ways, Mr Ozal epitomised modern Turkey. A devout Moslem - he was
even said to have had ties with the fanatical Nakshibendi sect - he was
profoundly democratic in many of his political views.
He once claimed to be the first Turkish leader to use the word Kurd in
public; previously this troubled minority were referred to as mountain
Turks. He was certainly the first Turkish leader to contemplate a political
solution to the Kurdish problem, perhaps Turkey's single greatest challenge
today.
His loss will be strongly felt by moderate Kurds who looked on him as an
unofficial patron of the campaign for greater political and human rights.
His death occurs at a critical time, as Mr Suleyman Demirel's government
considers its response to the current ceasefire offered by the rebel Kurdish
Workers' party (PKK).
Mr Ozal was born in 1927 in Malatya and was an electrical engineer by
training. He worked at the World Bank in Washington in the 1970s, returning
to a series of posts in the Turkish private sector before becoming adviser
to the government of Mr Demirel. With the military coup of 1980, Mr Ozal was
asked to stay on, a move that soured his relations with Mr Demirel ever
after.
In the restrictive political environment that followed the coup, Mr Ozal was
able to push through an austerity package, which might have proved difficult
under a more democratic system.
The reforms centred on trade liberalisation, removal of exchange controls,
and in 1982 the rescheduling of Turkey's Dollars 3.2bn foreign debt. Within
three years, adopting classical monetarist strategies, Mr Ozal pulled
inflation down from 120 per cent to 30 per cent and doubled Turkey's
exports.
After a timely resignation in July 1982, he founded the Motherland party
(Anap), a curious mix of progressive and conservative elements, a coalition
of technocrats, businessmen and farmers. The party emerged as clear winner
in the restricted election of 1983. Somewhat reluctantly at first, the
generals approved Mr Ozal's choice of cabinet, formally handing over power
on December 13 1983. Anap won again in 1987 and Mr Ozal progressively turned
his energies to foreign policy.
He was admired if not liked by the political establishment. Some Turks
became concerned Mr Ozal's policies were threatening the country's European
identity, as enshrined in the Kemalist legacy.
In 1987, against the advice of many foreign ambassadors in Ankara, Turkey
applied for full membership of the European Community. A one-time Islamic
nationalist, Mr Ozal strongly contended that Turkey's application was
politely rejected, on the grounds of religion, by a Christian European club.
Throughout the cold war Turkey provided the Nato alliance with a bulwark
against the Soviet Union on its south-eastern flank. During the Gulf war, Mr
Ozal overrode strong public opposition to impose sanctions against Iraq and
to provide the US-led coalition with the use of bases, once more
re-asserting Turkey's western identity.

IN SPITE OF stepped-up sanctions and the threat of military intervention,
Serbs still believe that Russia will wrest them from the clutches of the
west.
Serb leaders are rooting for the victory of their communist-nationalist
counterparts in Russia over President Boris Yeltsin in the referendum set
for April 25.
They have fostered ties with Mr Yeltsin's fiercest opponents, who make
frequent visits to Belgrade and Serb-held territories in Croatia and Bosnia.
Serbia appears convinced that the US, faced with a choice between Bosnia and
Mr Yeltsin, will not force Russia to oppose Serbia, its traditional ally and
favourite of Russian nationalists. Remaining defiant even amid threatened
sanctions, Serb commanders pressed on to mop up remaining pockets of Moslem
resistance in eastern Bosnia.
Diplomats believe that, after Srebrenica, Serb forces will seize control of
Gorazde and Zepa, the last two strongholds to the south.
Belgrade radio, in the grip of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic,
yesterday railed at Mr Yeltsin after Russia abstained from a vote in the UN
Security Council on a new package of draconian sanctions on Serbia.
'Russia's abstention is nothing more than the shameful heeding of a western
diktat and the unprecedented interference in the internal affairs of
Yugoslavia,' said the radio, which frequently denounces Mr Yeltsin as a
traitor to Russia and the Orthodox world.
'The UN resolution apparently was adopted before the referendum on April 25
because the west is afraid that it will not win after Yeltsin falls,' said
the radio.
Mr Nikola Koljevic, a leader of the self-styled Bosnian Serb state, said on
Belgrade radio at the weekend: 'If the Serbs are punished for Srebrenica, we
will have to reveal the secret pact made with Mr Vitaly Churkin, Yeltsin's
special envoy to former Yugoslavia, before the referendum is held.'
Mr Koljevic hinted that Serbia could help topple Mr Yeltsin if their
'Orthodox brethren learned the truth about the Bosnian game', said the
radio, dismissing western outrage about Srebrenica as an 'unprecedented case
of media manipulation'.
'Serb military and political chiefs see the current situation as a revival
of the first world war and the Great Powers configuration,' says a western
diplomat.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, often warns that the war in Bosnia
is the beginning of the third world war and believes Russia will take a
stand against the west in the Balkans.
'Many wars have begun in the Balkans without Russia, but not one ended
without Russia getting involved,' Mr Bozidar Vucurevic, a lorry driver
turned leader of the self-styled Serb state in Bosnia, said recently.
'I am waiting for the day when Russia will air drop aid packets to the
Serbs,' said General Milan Gvero, deputy Commander of Bosnian Serb forces.
Serbian television devotes far more attention to the power struggle in
Russia than to the war in Bosnia. Strapped for cash after two years of war
and 11 months under UN sanctions, the television has only two foreign
correspondents. They are both posted in Moscow and constantly crowing about
any setback for Mr Yeltsin.
Despite the official ire and venom unleashed on Mr Yeltsin, Serb leaders
have even gone so far as to invite 'patriotic Russian forces' to intervene
in Serbia.
'Help us escape from the ghetto and destroy the dungeon in which the hellish
powers have locked us,' said a letter to Russian parliamentary deputies from
Serbian politicians and Orthodox Church leaders, recently published in
Vecernje Novosti, a Belgrade daily.
'Let your boats sail the waters of the Danube and the Adriatic. Let your
planes appear on our skies. . . Russia was always together with Serbia and
will be from the Pacific to the Adriatic.'

   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY appeared headed for a possible constitutional crisis yesterday after
the death of President Turgut Ozal.
Mr Ozal, 65, who collapsed on Saturday from heart failure, was a reformer
who for many in the west symbolised Turkey's return to democracy and
transition to a market economy.
His death is unlikely to signal a shift in Turkey's pro-western foreign
policy. But with no obvious successor and with party strengths in parliament
finely balanced, diplomats say there is a real danger the coalition
government of Mr Suleyman Demirel may become bogged down in infighting.
If no consensus emerges after four parliamentary ballots to choose a new
president, the constitution calls for general elections for a new assembly.
Having dominated the Turkish landscape, steering the country through the
Gulf war and the subsequent Kurdish refugee crisis, Mr Ozal had latterly
become more isolated from the political process.
His loss will perhaps be most keenly felt by the Kurdish minority, which had
come to look on him as informal patron of their campaign for greater rights.
His death comes as the government tries to frame a response to the recent
Kurdish ceasefire call.
The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but while the Motherland Party
(Anap) was in government Mr Ozal *something in here (HP) *
accrued considerable powers, particularly in foreign policy.
With the first parliamentary ballot to choose a new president due on April
27, two names have already been put forward.
Mr Husamettin Cindoruk, parliamentary speaker, has made little secret of his
presidential ambitions.
A lawyer who acted for Mr Adnan Menderes, the former prime minister executed
by the military in 1961, Mr Cindoruk has increasingly alienated government
support with his maverick performance, particularly his public opposition to
the recent government ban on private TV and radio, and his defence of the
legal immunity of Kurdish deputies.
A more popular choice would be the deputy prime minister, Mr Erdal Inonu,
the physicist son of Turkey's second president. Apart from the family name,
he is widely respected and as a reluctant politician would have no
difficulty in remaining non-partisan, something Mr Ozal found so difficult.
Much will depend on his party, the Social Democratic Populists (SHP). They
may argue that his departure could damage their standing at a time when they
face defections to the newly revived People's Republican Party (CHP).
Some deputies suggest Mr Demirel himself might also proffer his candidacy.

FT  19 APR 93 / Bosnian Serbs will quit talks: Anger over tighter sanctions
 -UN begins evacuation of Srebrenica wounded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOSNIAN Serbs intend to walk out of the international peace talks
chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen following the United Nations
Security Council's decision at the weekend to impose tighter sanctions
against the rump Yugoslavia.
This was made clear yesterday as UN helicopters began evacuating seriously
wounded civilians from Srebrenica, the encircled eastern Bosnian Moslem
town, under a ceasefire agreement negotiated between the military chiefs of
the Serb attacking forces and the Moslem defenders early yesterday.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told Belgrade Radio that the
self-styled Bosnian Serb 'parliament' would decide whether the Bosnian Serb
delegation would leave the talks before April 26 or after.
That is the deadline set by the Security Council for the implementation of
the new sanctions, unless the Bosnian Serbs sign the Vance-Owen plan,
dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.
The sanctions are intended to put pressure on Serbia to force the Bosnian
Serbs to endorse the peace plan. Under the sanctions, all countries would be
banned from transporting goods across Serbia and Montenegro, monitors would
be placed on Danube river ships, financial assets would be frozen, a
maritime exclusion zone would be set up in the Adriatic and Yugoslav
aircraft and trucks abroad would be impounded.
For the moment, however, sanctions appear to be having the opposite effect
from that intended, with Mr Karadzic angrily describing them as a 'diktat
and imposition'. Lord Owen, who has been advocating air strikes against
strategic bridges and roads in Bosnia as part of the effort to deprive the
Bosnian Serbs of vital supplies, is flying to Belgrade on Wednesday for
talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
His mission is widely seen as a desperate and possibly final attempt to
persuade Mr Milosevic to make the Bosnian Serbs accept the peace plan.
In the UK, Mr John Major, the prime minister, under growing pressure at
Westminster for greater military involvement by Britain to help the Bosnian
Moslems, discussed possible options with President Clinton in a 50-minute
telephone conversation yesterday. These almost certainly included air
strikes.
The two leaders agreed that the tougher sanctions against Serbia should be
imposed 'effectively and rapidly' and that loopholes should be closed.
In Srebrenica, French Puma and British Sea King helicopters flew out 133
casualties to the Moslem-held northern Bosnian town of Tuzla. They were
aided by 145 UN Canadian troops who entered the town to monitor the
ceasefire and start disarming the Moslem defenders. Evacuations by air of
some 500 badly wounded or sick people are due to continue for several days,
barring delays by Serbian inspections.
A UN spokesman said Srebrenica, which is surrounded by Serb troops within
rifle-fire range, was calm while the evacuation took place. Claims by the
Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio that theSerbs shelled Moslem defensive
lines around the town after the ceasefire came into effect at 2am local
time, could not be confirmed by independent sources.
The Canadian UN soldiers have orders to secure the demilitarisation of
Srebrenica, a town with a population of some 30,000 and one of the last
Moslem-held strongholds of eastern Bosnia, within 72 hours of their arrival.
The UN-brokered agreement, signed by General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb
army commander, and Mr Sefir Halilovic, the Moslem-led Bosnian army chief,
demands that all Moslem troops should submit their weapons and ammunition to
the UN forces by 11am on Wednesday. While it guarantees 'correct treatment'
for any personnel who hand over their arms to the UN, it does not provide
for the disarming of the besieging Serb forces.
Although UN spokesmen denied that the deal was tantamount to a Moslem
surrender and Bosnian Serb leaders continued to protest that they did not
aim to take the town, it seems that Srebrenica's survival as a Moslem
community is unlikely.
The decision by the UN Security Council to strengthen sanctions against
Serbia and Montenegro was taken late on Saturday, with 13 members voting in
favour and two - Russia and China - abstaining.

FT  19 APR 93 / Insurers seek curbson scrip dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Britain's largest shareholder groups is seeking a meeting with the
Confederation of British Industry to voice concern about the trend for
companies to offer dividends in the form of shares rather than cash.
The investment committee of the Association of British Insurers last week
discussed the spate of so-called enhanced scrip dividends issued by seven
large corporations in the past three weeks. The ABI wants CBI members to
agree that the use of enhanced scrip dividends should be limited to the
current year and to those companies with significant tax problems.
ABI members fear the consequences of some companies increasing the number of
shares in issue. 'They are increasing the amount of equity that they must
service and limiting the scope for future dividend increases,' one committee
member said. The scrip dividends are expected to increase each company's
outstanding share capital by 2.6 to 5.5 per cent.
If shareholders choose the cash option, their percentage holding in the
company will fall. Furthermore, many large shareholders, such as life
insurers and pension funds, rely on dividend cash flow to meet liabilities
and may feel unable to take up the enhanced scrip offer.
The ABI will also press the stock exchange for a new rule barring companies
from announcing enhanced scrip dividends after the ex-dividend date.
Investors who sell shares after the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive
the dividend payment. Accordingly, the share price normally falls after the
ex-dividend date because new buyers do not receive the dividend.
But news of enhanced scrip issues causes the share price to rise. Some
investors may have sold shares after the ex-dividend date but before news of
the enhanced scrip. This, argues the ABI, means those investors sold at a
price which was lower than it should have been. In enhanced scrip dividends,
companies offer shareholders an option to receive a dividend in shares that
is 50 per cent higher than the value of the cash dividend.

FT  19 APR 93 / Pakistan president ousts PM in power struggle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PAKISTAN'S president last night dismissed the government of prime minister
Nawaz Sharif and appointed an interim military-backed administration.
The decision was the climax to a bitter power struggle between Mr Sharif and
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who accused the government of corruption and
terrorising its opponents.
Mr Khan dissolved the national assembly and ordered fresh elections for July
4.
Troops loyal to the president guarded state television and radio in
Islamabad, but there was little sign of violence or unrest on the streets.
The 78-year-old president acted just hours after meeting Ms Benazir Bhutto,
the opposition leader, whose government was ousted in a similar move by him
less than three years ago. The meeting was widely seen as a thaw in their
relations.
The president replaced Mr Sharif with Mr Balakh Sher Mazari, a little known
feudal landlord from the province of Punjab.
The interim government will also include members of Ms Bhutto's party. One
of two ministers sworn in last night, Mr Farooq Leghari, is among Ms
Bhutto's closest aides.
Mr Sharif, who was at the time a protege of Mr Khan, won the general
elections held after Ms Bhutto's government was sacked on charges of
corruption in August 1990.
Mr Sharif initiated wide-ranging reforms to unshackle the economy from
bureaucratic constraints.
He claimed last night that his ousting was intended to sabotage his economic
policies and vowed to challenge it in court.
But senior government officials said the new government would try to
reassure the business community that its interests would be protected in the
face of fears of a reversal of Mr Sharif's policies.
On taking over his caretaker role, Mr Mazari described the business
community as 'the backbone' of the country. Less than 24 hours before his
dismissal, Mr Sharif indirectly accused the president of supporting the
government's opponents and campaigning to oust it.
The president said he was stepping in because of the recent resignations of
members of the national assembly and of government ministers, which had
worsened relations between the federal government and the four provinces. He
accused the government of 'maladministration, corruption and nepotism'.

FT  19 APR 93 / Patten says governors have legal duty to run school tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Patten, education secretary, is raising the stakes in his
confrontation with the teachers' unions by writing to head teachers and
governors to tell them they are legally bound to implement the national
curriculum tests.
The move comes as Sir Ron Dearing, who today becomes chairman-designate of
the Schools Curriculum and Assesment Authority, is due to start the review
of the tests announced by Mr Patten two weeks ago. Tomorrow, the Appeal
Court will start hearing the case brought against the National Association
of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, which is boycotting the tests, by
Wandsworth borough council, south London.
The high court has ruled that a boycott over high workloads would be a
legitimate industrial dispute. The Department for Education refused to
comment on speculation that it would try to rush through a change in the law
if Wandsworth's appeal were unsuccessful.
Mr Patten's letters, to be sent this week to representatives of every school
in England and Wales, will say the tests must go ahead. The education
department said yesterday: 'The chairmen of governors are responsible for
ensuring that the national curriculum is carried out, and that includes
testing. He is reminding them of their legal duty.'
It refused to speculate on the legal penalties governors might face. No
precedents exist for enforcing governors' legal duties in this area, but
they could come under pressure to discipline headteachers. Mr Patten is also
considering a campaign to promote the tests among parents similar to the
campaign conducted when tests for seven-year-olds were introduced two years
ago.
Speaking on Saturday at a conference of the pressure group Campaign for Real
Education, he also repeated his threat that funds for education would be cut
if the boycott goes ahead. 'How can I possibly argue the case for education
expenditure if I do not have the results to deploy, evidence of improving
standards, of money well spent?'
Teachers' unions reacted furiously to the news. Mr Doug Mc-Avoy, general
secretary of the National Union of Teachers, which is ballotting members on
a boycott, said: 'These are the actions of a man who is desperate to rescue
a failed system. He clearly recognises that the teach-ers' criticisms are
extremely well-founded and his insistence on going ahead is foolish. He's
painted himself into a corner, and he must have the courage to come out of
it.'
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'Mr Patten seems to be
writing to everyone except the teachers.'

NATO yesterday called on British and Turkish fighter jets to join the force
which this week began policing the Bosnian no-fly zone.
The UK is due to send six Tornado F3 fighters on Monday to Gioia del Colle
in southeast Italy. They will be backed up by two VC-10 tankers for
air-to-air refuelling.
The Tornados, based at Leeming in Yorkshire, were not included in the
initial enforcement plan involving US, French and Dutch aircraft. Britain
has offered a further six fighters if necessary.
Turkey is to send a squadron of 18 F-16 fighters over the weekend.

FT  17 APR 93 / City turned down Pounds 1.5m tent for EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, ANDREW JACK and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development approached the
Corporation of London last autumn with a request that it should spend Pounds
1.5m on a temporary structure for the bank's annual meeting, which is being
held next week.
The bank drew up plans to build a large tented structure in Spitalfields,
across the road from its Bishopsgate building in London. The proposals
included a bridge, to be installed by helicopter, that would link the two
buildings for the duration of the meeting, to provide extra security for its
senior delegates.
The corporation, asked to provide the accommodation for the meeting as a
welcoming gesture, rejected the proposal as too expensive.
The corporation also rejected an earlier proposal to consider building a
permanent conference centre, which could then be used for the bank's
meeting, on the Spitalfields site at a cost of Pounds 14m.
The EBRD's difficulties in finding a conference centre large enough to
accommodate the 4,500 people expected to attend its annual meeting began at
the end of last summer, when it decided to hold the meeting in London.
More details emerged yesterday of the materials and furniture which went
into decorating and fitting out the EBRD's new headquarters.
According to suppliers expenditure included:
Joinery for panelling, door frames and doors worth about Pounds 2.5m,
including large amounts of crown-cut sycamore.
600 desks made of steel and glass, to a design by Norman Foster costing more
than Pounds 600 each, supplied by Techno of Italy.
A custom-made carpet in a wide range of shades of green provided by Tyndale
in London, designed to ensure that it appeared to be the same colour
regardless of the different lighting.
Raised flooring from System Floors at a cost of more than Pounds 1.3m,
including 2,000 square metres on the first floor in Italian white veined
marble and 30,000 square metres of a more basic design on 11 other floors.
A designer bar furnished with 100 chairs representing European furniture
throughout the century in the style of famous designers including Le
Corbusier.
Mr Jean-Louis Berthet, founding partner of the firm of architects
responsible for the design of the EBRD's headquarters is a prominent figure
in French design.
He has worked on a number of commissions for Mr Saddam Hussein, president of
Iraq, including the interior design of the presidential palace in Baghdad in
1979, the Saddam Hussein International Airport in 1981 and the Council of
Ministers building in 1984.
The EBRD refused to comment on the way in which the architects were
selected, or on other aspects of the costs of refurbishing their
headquarters in Broadgate, London, as further details emerged of the high
quality materials used.
'We answer to our shareholders and everything has been completed within
budget. We have been extraordinarily transparent this week. Enough is
enough,' a spokeswoman said last night.
Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD president, wrote the preface to a book about the
work of the Berthet-Pochy firm published in the late 1980s by EPA Editions
in Paris. He emphasised his belief in the importance of interior design.
'Certain kings of France', he wrote, 'are better known for their chairs than
their achievements.'

FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays launches Dollars 300m bond in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS yesterday embark-ed on its second capital-raising exercise in a
week when it launched a Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) fixed-rate bond issue in
the US which will count as tier two capital for regulatory purposes.
The issue is the first by a bank in the US market which is convertible into
preference shares, which count as so-called tier one or core capital under
Basle committee guidelines. The Basle rules require banks to hold capital
equal to more than 8 per cent of assets, at least half of this in the form
of core capital.
The bonds are structured to allow Barclays to claim the tax-deductibility of
interest payments before conversion, while leaving it with the option at any
time to convert into tier one capital and so boost its core capital ratio.
The bonds, which Barclays expects to be sold mainly to retail investors in
the US, carry an indicative coupon of 8 per cent. If converted, the
preference shares will pay 9 1/4 per cent.
Mr Brian Worsley, assistant treasurer, said the issue was structured in a
way to discourage the bank to convert. If it did so, the higher interest
rate and loss of tax relief would raise its financing costs by more than two
percentage points. Also, the bank had a tier two ratio of 4.4 per cent at
the end of last year, compared with tier one of 5.8 per cent, leaving it
with little need to create more core capital.
The bonds yielded about 125 basis points over the US government's 30-year
long bond yesterday. Barclays raised Pounds 200m in the Eurobond market a
week ago.

SEVERN TRENT WATER
'Consumers have shown a willingness to spend more on services but some are
less willing to spend on waste water (sewage) projects which the regulators
are pushing. Customers are more concerned about the cleanliness of their
water, leakages and the replacement of lead'
WESSEX WATER
'When our researchers explained the cost involved in the EC directive on
urban waste water customers were shocked. The only projects for which they
have shown a willingness to pay more are those to prevent rivers running
low, improvements in taste of tap water and the removal of lead pipes'
ANGLIAN WATER
'Customers support improvements and accept they will bring higher bills.
Over three-quarters are willing to pay more to help implement the EC
drinking and bathing water directives'
SOUTHERN WATER
Interviews with customers on the implications for bills of cleaning up much
of the southern coastline are not yet completed
YORKSHIRE WATER
Will begin their survey in May, asking customers how they feel about
increases in bills from new sewage treatment plants in Leeds and along the
coast
WELSH WATER
'Initial research showed that our customers' paramount concern is better
quality of river water. Generally they are happy with the quality of tap
water'
NORTHUMBRIAN WATER
'We are finding that customers are prepared to pay a bit extra, for example,
to reduce the risk of discoloured tap water and to improve the quality of
coastal waters. On pricing, we expected them to say 'enough is enough' but
no-one is saying that'
THAMES WATER
'Customers want better quality, better standards, but at the end of the day
they don't want increases in price'
NORTH WEST WATER
'Most customers interviewed did not at first understand the link between
bills and the company' investment programme of more than Pounds 5bn in the
1990s. Over half the spending is on cleaning up the Mersey, beaches, and
sewerage treatment, yet many customers were unaware we dealt with these'
SOUTH WEST WATER
'Customers see the need for our massive investment programme - 31 schemes
clearing up 81 beaches. We will be pushing for additional financial support
from Europe and government. But our customers are only 2.6 per cent of
population and don't see why they should have to pay for cleaning up 30 per
cent of the country's coastline'

FT  17 APR 93 / Daf wins order for return of trucks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEYLAND DAF, the truck company in administrative receivership, yesterday won
a High Court order for the return to Britain of 210 unsold trucks that were
shipped to the Netherlands over the Easter holiday without its knowledge.
Contractors Edcrest and GM de Rooy, its Dutch parent company, which are in
dispute with Leyland Daf over unpaid bills, moved the trucks, worth about
Pounds 4m, from a compound at Leyland Daf's plant in Lancashire to de Rooy's
base near Eindhoven.
At the request of Leyland Daf's joint administrative receivers Mr Justice
Millett made a mandatory order for the return of the trucks to England
within five days.
Edcrest argued it had a right to retain the vehicles until the settling of
its claim against the company for between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m in debts
incurred before Leyland Daf's collapse.
In February an agreement was reached, pending a full court hearing of the
dispute, which allowed Leyland Daf access to trucks and vans stored by
Edcrest so that it could continue to trade, on the understanding that it
kept a minimum of 260 trucks and 200 vans in the Edcrest compounds as
security.
Leyland Daf has received an Pounds 8.2m order for 206 trucks from British
Telecom. The trucks will come from Daf's plants at Leyland, Lancashire, and
the Netherlands.

FT  17 APR 93 / Clear case of humanitarian horrors: While diplomats and
leader writers talk rubbish, women and children die
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON WEDNESDAY the US special envoy, Robert Bartholomew, met the former
psychiatrist, and practising war criminal, Dr Radovan Karadzic. Dr Karadzic
is more commonly referred to as 'the leader of the Bosnian Serbs'.
After his meeting Bartholomew proclaimed: 'What we are saying to them very
clearly - and by we, I mean the international community - is that the
military and humanitarian horrors have to stop now.' This is a fascinating
sentence and deserves parsing.
What is meant by 'very clearly'?
Bartholomew was speaking in the context of Lady Thatcher's call on British
and US television for immediate action against the Serbs to stop their
massacre of Bosnian Muslims. Yet on the same day as Bartholomew made his
position 'clear', his boss, the US secretary of state, Warren Christopher
said: 'Thatcher's prescription is one for only increasing the carnage . . .
a rather emotional response.'
So it is 'clear' that the US, in spite of Bartholomew's brave words in
Belgrade, is absolutely against providing or encouraging any military
impediment to the Serbian bombardment of Bosnian civilians. The US, in fact,
is interested in Bosnia only in so far as it affects relations with Russia,
and since Russia sympathises with the Serbian view, the State Department
will not jeopardise Bill Clinton's buddy buddy relationship with Boris
Yeltsin, merely for the sake of a few million measly Muslims.
But Bartholomew claimed that by 'we' he did not mean the US. He said 'we'
meant 'the international community.' This phrase should be consigned to the
dustbin of diplomacy. It occurs about four times in every newspaper leading
article on Bosnia. It is constantly on the lips of Douglas Hurd and Malcolm
Rifkind, when they seek moral authority for their policy of giving the
besieged Bosnians butter before guns.
What, actually, is the 'international community', for whom Bartholomew,
Christopher, Hurd, Rifkind et al, claim to speak? Who are the members of
this club? Can anyone join? Does it consist of the entire membership of the
UN?
Well, no. By common usage it does not include Libya or Iran. But does it
include India? Is Chad 'saying clearly' to Dr Karadzic 'stop these
humanitarian and military horrors now.' I think the good people of Chad and
their leaders know little of the troubles of the Bosnian Muslims and care
even less.
Does 'international community' mean just the security council of the UN?
Well, no again, unless the UN envoy to Bosnia thinks that in his strictures
to Dr Karadzic he is speaking on behalf of China's billions, but not for the
Japanese population, disenfranchised from the great honour of membership of
the UN security council. And what of South Africa? It used not be part of
'the international community'. Now, perhaps, it has country membership of
this club.
Possibly, when Bartholomew refers to international community, he means only
'those who regularly and reliably support the actions and utterances of the
government of the US.' That is quite a good working definition, particularly
for Hurd and Rifkind. It means they - we - are quids in.
Back to parsing the US envoy's pregnant little sentence: what on earth does
he mean by 'humanitarian horrors'? Human horror I understand, but not this
polysyllabic refinement. He surely does not mean horrors in the name of
humanitarianism. But that, actually, is the truth. We have a policy of
'humanitarian aid', which means that we are prepared to give food to the
besieged Muslims of Srebrenica, but not to lift an arms embargo which
prevents them from lifting the siege which is starving them, and which, when
the city falls, will result in further murders of women and children.
The Muslim soldiers, will of course, escape Srebrenica: in this war it is
the civilians who perish. In the name of 'humanitarianism' we leave these
people to their fate.
Hurd argues that to allow the Bosnians arms, would 'increase the quantity of
fighting.' Indeed it would, just as when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt
agreed to send arms to Britain in 1940 it increased 'the quantity' of
fighting in Europe: we were willing to fight more in the short term, in
order to promote a just settlement for the long term. Unfortunately, the US
is not now led by a man of the calibre of Roosevelt. As for Britain, Lady
Thatcher is absolutely right: we should be ashamed of ourselves.

FT  17 APR 93 / Private View: The accountant who plays in the big league -
Rick Parry, Premier League supremo, has created scoring chances. But will he
get to kick the ball?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYTHING is run by accountants these days, even English football. Was that
really appropriate, I asked Rick Parry, chief executive of the Premier
League, as its first season dribbles to a close.
'What can I say but 'Yes'?', he replied, adding hastily: 'I don't really see
myself as an accountant so much as somebody who is making use of the
training.'
With his big briefcase, little moustache and gently receding hairline Rick
Parry, not yet 40, might pass for a successful computer salesman from
Slough. His manner is brisk but bland. He employs the language of Briefcase
Man ('at the end of the day' is a favourite phrase) but, to be fair, not
once in two hours did he refer to The Bottom Line.
You call football 'the product', I observed.
'I slip into it from time to time. I actually don't see it as a product
because that's a gross oversimplification. To describe fans as customers is
certainly unduly patronising.
'Nevertheless, there are certain basic lessons which need to be learned.
Considering football has, or should have, a much more special relationship
with its fans than any other business has with its customers it's remarkable
how little football bothers to talk to its customers - far less than
Sainsbury's or Marks &amp; Spencer would, for example.'
Isn't it odd to use an industry or product model for what is after all a
game? Don't you represent the ultimate commercialisation of the sport?
'Not at all. I'm a fan at heart.' He might have added that he was a good
enough goalkeeper in his youth to be auditioned by Liverpool and Everton.
'Of course it's a sport, but that's too facile. At the end of the day it's a
sport which pays participants huge wages. Clubs have to be run as
businesses. They have to find about Pounds 250m to upgrade their stadia to
comply with the Taylor Report (on ground safety). It's much more than just a
game - always was ever since it became professional. Two Premier League
clubs are quoted companies.' (At mid-week Manchester United stock went above
450p, a year's high; Tottenham Hotspur stood at 92p, near its low.)
'I'm a football fan through and through. I happen to have gained hopefully
useful and relevant business experience. I'm not seen as a football person
by insiders still, but I don't see myself as sort of grey businessman being
brought in to become the sort of unacceptable face of football.'
Nobody seems to know much about Rick Parry. Even his secretary could not
think what to buy him for Christmas. He would be the first to admit he does
not stand out in a crowd and, in a game of big mouths, is accused of having
risen without trace. Yet the boy has come good; he's made the space, created
the chances - a record Pounds 304m TV deal with BSkyB and BBC, a record
Pounds 12m sponsorship from Bass - and he has dodged some heavy tackles from
the hard men among the 22 club chairmen who make up the Premier League
board.
The chief executive sat on a bar stool drinking Coke and shovelling peanuts
into his mouth. He nodded to Graham Taylor, the England manager, as he
passed through the hotel lobby. He took a call from the Premier League's
non-executive chairman, Sir John Quinton, former chairman of Barclays Bank.
What interests you apart from football, I asked him.
'Nothing at the moment.'
People say you are a closed book.
'Who says?'
The phrase is mine, I replied, but it's the impression you give. Yet you
seem approachable enough.
'I am, if anyone bothers to approach me. The thing that gets up my nose with
certain members of your profession is that I get patronising comments about
what I'm attempting to do from people who've never met me.
'I don't go shouting from the rooftops. I'm not flamboyant, I'm not looking
to make a name for myself. That's not my style. But I wouldn't say I was a
closed book.'
You don't go rock-climbing or potholing or breed Vietnamese pot-bellied
pigs? What about stamp-collecting - or train-spotting? I added unkindly.
Parry did not flinch. 'I don't really have a lot of time to climb mountains.
I used to do a lot of windsurfing. I used to sail. I used to play a lot of
football. I like going to the theatre when we get the chance. I'm very
family-centred really.'
He lives near Chester with his wife Kate, who has no interest in football,
and their sons James (10) and Tom (8), both keen players, on a salary of
Pounds 120,000 plus car. They are buying a new house about 300 yards from
their present one.
A change of scenery is always nice, I said.
Parry ignored this too, and looked serious. He had endured a lot of hostile
publicity last May, he said, when ITV was thwarted in its bid to screen the
Premier League. The family felt the pressure and he was determined to
preserve a stable home life.
Influenced by Brian Hall, a Liverpool player, who had studied science, Parry
took two maths and physics at A level and read maths at Liverpool
University. His father, the physical education instructor at Chester
College, advised him to get a professional qualification. He joined the
local branch of Arthur Young (now Ernst &amp; Young), qualifying as a chartered
accountant in 1979. He went to work for Hoseasons, the canal and cottage
holiday company in East Anglia, returning to Arthur Young as a sporting and
leisure consultant.
Through the firm's involvement with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and a
series of connections and coincidences Parry was asked to co-ordinate
Manchester's successive bids to host the Games. In between he was asked to
advise the Football League on its managerial efficiency. In 1991, the
Football Association, soccer's parent body, asked him to draw up a blueprint
for the breakaway Premier League (the old first division).
What is your relationship with the club chairmen?
'It's good. It's fine. We've had hiccups, we've had problems, but no
illusions. It ain't ever going to be easy with those 22. I've not come
across such passions, such extremes, in any other form of working life.'
What are they about these passions?
Parry sighed. 'I mean, you name it. I mean, it's the nature of the game.
They're competing against each other every Saturday. There are big clubs,
there are small clubs, northern clubs, southern clubs. There's a lot of
self-interest, but trying to do things for the greater good.'
Do they make you feel a bit small, a bit too youthful?
He laughed ruefully. 'No, they're OK actually. If you recognise that you've
been given two ears and one mouth and you use them them in that sort of
ratio it's quite helpful.'
You're the tactful type?
'We try to be. Doing the groundwork is the best technique. It's very
difficult in a room of 22 to run things off the cuff. Hugely difficult.
We've managed it on occasions because there was so much to lose . . .'
We?
'Obviously the chairman plays an important role keeping order at the
meetings.'
Parry became chief executive almost by accident. He was still a consultant
when he was asked to chair his first meeting. 'I didn't duck fast enough',
he said.
The clubs were going to decide whether or not to leave the League until
someone pointed out that the meeting would become a shambles without a
chairman. Parry's management training and Olympic committee experience came
to his rescue. He took the trouble to visit all the clubs beforehand and
listen to their gripes. 'You have to work on the principle that nothing goes
to the general meetings for a vote unless you know it's going to win. You
don't put it on the agenda if you don't have a two-thirds majority.'
There was a walk-out last year over the Bass sponsorship deal. Parry blamed
time pressure. 'At the last meeting the identical offer went through without
having to be put to a vote. That's a mark of how things have settled,' he
said.
'I've never tried to give the impression that I know the answers. What I've
tried to suggest is that perhaps I know the right questions. There are
plenty of people in the game who can provide the right answers. What I've
done a lot of in management consulting is to be a facilitator.'
A referee?
'Not quite. It's more than being a referee because you have to draw them
towards common conclusions rather than simply arbitrate. Facilitator is a
better word. I've had a lot of training.'
Group encounter training?
'Yes. The Arthur Young training technique.'
So your ability to read a balance sheet is . . .
'About 0.5 per cent of what I do. I mean the accountancy side is nothing,
frankly. It's the level of Week One of accountancy training. People pick on
the fact that I happened to train as an accountant as a useful label to
criticise me with.'
Could you ever be accepted as the real leader of the Premier League?
'It may evolve. But one of the things I'm happiest about is that in the last
six months I've largely managed to avoid the headlines.'
You don't want to be known as Mr Football?
'I've no pretentions or desires in that direction. I will get my
satisfaction from the thing being done properly. I've no desire to be seen
as the one who did it.' Parry said it so simply, it was hard not to believe
him.
We talked about the inflation that would follow the League's huge TV
contract. Parry said clubs were being forced not only to invest in their
grounds but to dissuade players from accepting the 'crazy money' offered by
Italian clubs. It was a European market now. 'Over there they are only
allowed to use a certain number of foreign players but they buy players,
they stockpile them to corner the market. That's terrifying.
'But at the end of the day this is back to what you said earlier. It isn't
just a business. It's a sport and it's a sport which is all about winning
and there is only one winner every year. So you'll never stop people playing
for high stakes, and investing in excessive wages and transfer fees in order
to win.'
So you won't turn be able to turn a bear garden into a gentleman's club?
'It's too competitive. We'd lose part of the essence of the game if we did.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVEN'T mentioned this before, but I and two friends have embarked on a
series of chess lessons so as to prepare ourselves mentally for the Nigel
Short-Garry Kasparov world title chess match in London in September. The two
friends are: John Major, who is prime minister of Britain, and Queen
Elizabeth II, who is head of the House of Windsor and not as glum as she's
painted, in fact is rather fun.
We meet in great secrecy - no, not at Buckingham Palace - and our lessons
last two hours. The reason for the secrecy is that our chess teacher is
Nigel Short himself, the 27-year-old prodigy-genius-Dalek who will become
Britain's first world chess champion (and earn a great fortune) if he beats
the barbarian Kasparov.
We had a lesson yesterday. 'Remember,' said Nigel, 'that chess is hard
physically and mentally. Grappling with your opponent's psyche can be
mentally very bruising. And don't think of it as intellectual. I mean, I'm
not even clever, couldn't mend a fuse. Nor does it run in families. Heredity
doesn't come into it. Top-class players come from a variety of backgrounds -
I used to be working class. But never in chess history have they been
fathered or mothered by first-rate parents. In chess terms, I mean.'
'How extremely fascinating,' said the Queen. 'It is just the same with
racehorses. Or even with actual dynasties. Top-class racehorses, such as
winners of the Derby, almost never produce progeny that match their own
exploits. One simply does not hear of it. As for actual dynasties, well
there's a sorry tale.' The Queen chimed with laughter, like a pink porcelain
bell. 'Most royal children set forth with all life's advantages, but fritter
them away. They fall into unsavoury company. Develop a taste for the
theatre. Talk to the trees and the sky. It must be in the blood. Such a
terrible waste.'
'How remarkably interesting,' said John Major. Chess is quite like cricket,
you know, in some of its particulars.'
After these pleasantries we knuckled down to a tutorial on the Scotch
gambit. 'Remember,' said Nigel, 'with white openings we are trying to gain
our share of the centre, best achieved by advancing the d- and e-pawns and
developing at least one knight towards the middle. On appropriate occasions
we find that a gambit proper, such as the Scotch, is most useful.
'After the opening 1, e4 e5; 2, Nf3 Nc6; 3, d4 exd4; 4, c3, the Scotch
gambit continues 4 . . . dxc3; 5, Nxc3. Black often declines with 4 . . .
d5, and then play can continue: 5, exd5, Qxd5; 6, cxd4 Bg4; 7, Be2. This
gives us some highly active pieces. I expect I shall use it against the
barbarian Kasparov.'
John Major looked puzzled. 'I must say, Nigel,' he said, 'that I am a bit in
the dark on this one. I am not, as it were, illuminated. It sounds more than
sufficiently complicated. It reminds me, I suppose, of the exchange rate
mechanism of the European monetary system - remarkably clever on paper but
liable to generate bother on a day-to-day basis.'
'Nonsense,' said the Queen. 'It is a perfectly simple gambit. Even a groom
could employ it. After 7, Be2, white continues with Nc3, Be3 and 0-0. It is
important to castle early, John. It is true that white's queen pawn is
isolated on d4, but as Nigel has just told us, there is more than adequate
compensation for this in the general deployment of pieces.'
'Absolutely right,' said Nigel, 'absolutely brill.'
'I have to confess,' said the prime minister, 'that I am more than somewhat
confused. I do not like gambits. In politics, you know, it pays to keep
things simple, even to play a dead bat, to get up on a soapbox and not try
to flim-flam. That is how I won the election, you know. I avoided all
gambits.'
The Queen said: 'How simple life must be for you in No 10 Downing Street.
One wishes one were so fortunate. In any case, John, even sharper than the
Scotch gambit is the Goring gambit, in which 4 . . .dxc3 is met by 5, Bc4 -
and off we jolly well go.'
Then we played some games. And then we chatted sociably. The Queen asked
Nigel if he would have to pay much income tax if he beat the barbarian
Kasparov.
'I hope not,' said Nigel. 'I've got a really brill accountant.'
'So does oneself,' said the Queen. 'It did not, in fact, help one.'

THE MOON BY WHALE LIGHT by Diane Ackerman Chapmans Pounds 15.99, 249 pages
'ALTARWISE BY owl light' was the line of Dylan Thomas which Robert Graves
castigated as utterly meaningless. The Moon by Whale Light is similarly
obscure, but we will allow it as a title. The author has poetry in her soul:
if, on a moonlit beach in Patagonia, she is more taken by the night-time
sighs and sneezes of the nearby whales than the source of their
illumination, it is forgivable. As so often in this book, the reader is
simply writhing with envy.
The New Yorker is, by tradition, a sponsor of good writing (and tolerant of
poetry, too). Diane Ackerman was commissioned by its editor to write the
quartet of essays which constitute this book, and the result is a curious
hybrid of proper reportage, poetic intelligence and wild-life documentary.
Bats in Texas and alligators in Florida, whales off Hawaii and Argentina,
penguins in California and the south Atlantic: these are the ultimate
subjects, but they are reached only via the means and the words - reproduced
verbatim, and at length - of those naturalists for whom they are a focus of
study. The author part tags along, part throws herself into the action.
The result is a success, on two counts. First, these naturalists are people
worth meeting and worth quoting. They come across as dedicated, sane,
non-rhetorical and gracious. They are not planet-saving bores. Second,
although the author has done some homework on the fauna, she has not
overdone it; and what impresses one most about her essays is not the
aggregation of scientific knowledge (although that is there) so much as the
almost child-like responses she records of her own encounters.
Pathos is inevitable in some of these eyeball-to-eyeball meetings (a bat
crawls around her head and gazes up at her 'with liquid eyes in which a
thousand truths of the rain forest were hidden'); but it is generally
tempered by good sense and, above all, by an ironic sort of respect.
It is ironic because human beings do not customarily expect to learn good
manners from animals. And yet, the tendency to anthropomorphise animal
behaviour imports injustice to some animals. This is most apparent with the
whales. Swimming alongside a serene mother and her calf, the author
registers that the disposition of the whale is, in fact, rather superior to
that of humankind. Mother whale keeps an eye on the vistor's movements, and
could blast her away with one whim of her flipper. But, again, eye contact
is made: 'I knew that if I showed her where I was and what I was and that I
meant her no harm, she would return the courtesy.'
The establishment of natural trust, which humans among themselves usually
relegate to Utopia, is also patent with the penguins. Since they have no
land predators, penguins are amiable to whoever comes to study them. In
fact, penguins seem to think that if you come to study them, it is an
opportunity for them to study you: check out how you feel, whether you might
be good for mating with - and so on.
The literary precedents for this sort of exercise are formidable, as the
author well knows. But it is saved from becoming some sort of cute bestiary
by a steadily understated sense of urgency. Most of the people Ackerman uses
as her agents for access to the animals are in the field because, if they
were not, there might be nothing there.
Green polemicising, as I say, is not dominant in the book. But, by
implication, it is a powerful contribution to the conservation case. Quite
unheard by us, bats are often shouting very loudly to each other. Whales
boom great submarine arias. Alligators have been chatting to each other for
230m years. Penguins give each other presents as part of their courtship.
All this is not a romance of nature: rather, a great advertisement for the
global village.

THE SLICING EDGE OF DEATH by Judith Cook Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 14.99, 234

WRITING PLAYS and spying on the enemies of your country appear to be
occupations that combine happily. During the first world war Somerset
Maugham, based in Switzerland, was turning out brittle marital comedies for
the London stage with one hand while sending back to Whitehall secret
reports on the activities of German agents in Lausanne with the other. In
leading this double-life Maugham was following in the illustrious footsteps
of a British playwright who appears a few paragraphs higher (above Marston
and Massinger) in the theatrical dictionaries: Christopher Marlowe.
In Marlowe's period the threat to the security and sovereignty of England
came not from Germany but from Spain. The Armada had been turned back, the
King of Spain's beard well and truly singed in 1588, but that had not
removed fears of a Spanish-led Catholic takeover, and these fears were
exacerbated following the execution of Mary Queen of Scots by the prospect
of an influx of Scottish Catholics under the banner of the new King, her
son, from over the border. No one was more concerned about this than Sir
Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spymaster-in-chief, who stood at the centre
of an intricate spider's web of intelligence activity spreading into
Scotland and over the Channel into France.
Around the time of the Armada Marlowe had put himself sensationally on the
theatrical map with Tamburlaine, parts one and two, performed by the
Admiral's Men with Edward Alleyn in the title-role. The brilliant young
playwright, son of a Canterbury shoemaker, seems in retrospect like a
glittering dragon-fly caught in the espionage web and ultimately destroyed
by it.
As were later spies, Marlowe was recruited while still an undergraduate at
Cambridge University. He interrupted his degree course to go on a mission to
Rheims where he infiltrated the ranks of Catholic priests disguised as
Huguenot refugees on their way to England. Back in London he put the finger
on them and they were summarily executed.
After Tamburlaine Marlowe had several more smash-hits to write - The Jew of
Malta, Edward II, Dr Faustus - but in spite of being the most successful
dramatist of his day, the long arm of the Service refused to let him be.
Was Marlowe about to embark on some secret mission when he died suddenly as
the result of a tavern brawl in the busy port of Deptford? It was a
nerve-centre in those days of two-way traffic to and from the continent and
it seems unlikely that Marlowe went there on a lunch date just for fun.
Speculation about the causes of his sticky end in Deptford has been rife,
with dozens of books aiming to solve the mystery. But with the 400th
anniversary of Marlowe's death on May 30 1593 coming up soon, the trickle
has become a torrent. Marlowe-mania is currently sweeping the bookshops and
theatres.
These three novels all cover exactly the same ground, spinning yards of
fluent fantasy from the few scanty facts and documents. They each come to a
different solution to the problem, and so does the play on the same theme,
The School of Night, by Peter Whelan, now at the Barbican's Pit theatre.
The salient point on which all the authors agree is that Marlowe's death was
not the fortuitous event that the inquest implied. They all detect the hand
of the Service as being implicated, either directly or indirectly. It was
Leslie Hotson, an indefatigable American literary sleuth, who unearthed the
findings of the official inquest on Marlowe's death. To fuel our suspicions,
it was conducted not by the regular coroner but by one directly responsible
to the Crown. 'In the event' says Judith Cook 'the official version raised
more questions than answers . . . '
It is the version presented in Cook's novel, The Slicing Edge of Death
(published on May 27) that I would advise anyone new to the game to read
first. It deals with all the main points in by far the clearest and most
comprehensible manner while stating in an Author's note at the end exactly
what is invention and what is derived from historical evidence.
Cook roots her exciting, readable novel firmly in the world of the
playhouses and she highlights the rivalry between Henslowe's company, to
which Marlowe was attached, and that of Richard Burbage, soon to be the
Chamberlain's Men, where 'the upstart crow' from Stratford was beginning to
make a name for himself.
Hamlet had not yet been written. In the little scene often cut in
performance where Polonius sends a pair of agents to Paris to spy on Laertes
and report back to him, as well as in the characters of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, we can see how strongly intelligence-gathering and its perils
pressed upon the minds of the Elizabethans. But if the Hamlet we know had
not yet come into existence when Marlowe died, there may well have been an
earlier version floating around by Thomas Kyd on which Shakespeare's play
was based.
The unfortunate Kyd is given centre stage in Christopherus, or Tom Kyd's
Revenge by Robin Chapman. One of the few alleged facts known about him is
that he had the misfortune to harbour among his papers a rough draft of a
blasphemous paper by Marlowe intended for Sir Walter Raleigh's putative
School of Night (a kind of Elizabethan version of the Cambridge Apostles)
which was discovered by the authorities when his lodgings were raided. Kyd
was arrested and after being tortured signed a confession denouncing his
former friend Marlowe as an atheist.
Kyd emerges as a tragic figure with whom Chapman identifies movingly. He
focuses on him in the period after his release when Kyd is attempting to
rehabilitate himself and come to terms with his betrayal of his friend. This
long wayward book is not for the squeamish but it is full of many fine
imaginative flights concerning the principal figures in Marlowe's life: his
patron Thomas Walsingham (cousin of Francis), Baines and Poley the
duplicitous false friends, Nick Skeres and Ingram Frizer, the hired thugs
(the latter twisted the knife on that fatal afternoon). Chapman makes it all
seem very complicated in terms of these individuals' motivations. But no
doubt, if we could know the truth, it was.
They all re-appear in A Dead Man in Deptford. Anthony Burgess, that maestro
of the mother tongue, has his own way of dealing with history, as a kind of
musical fugue in which certain motifs constantly recur - drunkenness,
blood-letting, whoring - and this novel is a typical Burgess performance.
The homosexual side of Marlowe's relations with his patron and his
performers is thoroughly exploited. Marlowe becomes a brash camp Elizabethan
Guy Burgess, strutting and preening his hour upon the stage. The nauseating
stench of the stews of a London infested by Plague comes across pungently.
The people of this period loved to play with words as if they were notes in
music and so does Burgess. In some ways he is closest to them emotionally,
but once again he has not given us an easy read.

FT  17 APR 93 / Books: Travellers' tales for anxious aspirants - Chloe Chard
on tourism and its limitations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHLOE CHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEATEN TRACK by James Buzard Clarendon Press, Oxford Pounds 35,357 pages
TOURISM, as James Buzard points out, has long been the object of
supercilious sneers: an article of 1865 suggested that the new package tours
organized by Thomas Cook offered 'a kind of Continental experience which is
to that obtained in the regular way precisely what a 'dicky' (a false shirt
front) is to a shirt.'
Since the beginnings of touristic travel early in the 19th century, Buzard
argues in this well-documented book (sub-titled European Tourism,
Literature, and the Ways to Culture, 1800-1918), there has been a tradition
of 'anti-tourism' which has established a sharp distinction between 'those
who feel enthusiasm' and those of limited sensibilities. Anti-tourists have
attempted to define their own experiences of foreign countries as 'authentic
and unique,' partly by seeking out places removed sharply from the more
mundane aspects of modern life.
Travellers aspiring beyond the banalities of the 'beaten track' have,
nonetheless, often been troubled by an uneasy awareness that they are
themselves trapped within the limitations of tourism. The final chapters, on
Henry James and EM Forster, place particular emphasis on this discouraging
realisation. Forster's writings, Buzard observes, show that those who
profess spiritual affinities with foreign culture can be every bit as
baneful in their effect on foreigners as more humble tourists.
In Forster's short story The Eternal Moment, for example, an English female
novelist returns to the alpine town of Vorta, which has become a popular
resort as a result of a novel she wrote about it 20 years earlier. On her
first visit, a handsome, athletic young porter made amorous advances to her
 -an episode she remembers with some excitement.
He now re-appears as the fat, prosperous concierge of the Grand Hotel des
Alpes; she realises that she herself, in bringing tourism to Vorta, is
responsible for 'his greasy stoutness, his big black kiss-curl, his waxed
moustache.'
Even in narratives of disillusionment such as this, it could be argued that
it is possible to discern traces of a more uncompromisingly romantic
approach to travel. Tourism enters into conflict not only with anti-tourist
fastidiousness but also with an urge to cast aside constraint, to act out
transgressive desires in foreign places, and to place one's self-identity at
risk.
When outlining the 'romantic' attitude towards travel, Buzard cites Samuel
Rogers' resolutely-staid definition of a journey abroad as a safe and
'innocent' outlet for potentially disruptive desires. A 'Byronic model' of
the lone wanderer escaping home and family also is mentioned briefly.
Byronism, however, is associated less with wild, destabilising promptings
than with a smugly self-confirmatory masculine pose - linked to the fantasy
of Italy as a 'woman-country . . . yielding itself to appropriation by male
imaginations from the North.'
Reference back to the life and works of Byron himself, Buzard demonstrates,
became an expected part of the standard ritualised itinerary of Europe: the
poet's reputation as 'the scandalous embodiment of an anti-British
Continentalism' was modified swiftly as his writings were quoted
sententiously by guide books and his travels invoked piously by local guides
and servants. '
Many sections of The Beaten Track are full of insight and crisp definition;
the book includes, for example, a brisk survey of the role of the guide book
in the early-20th century novel; and an elegant account of the 'family
abroad plot' in which ambitious but impressionable mothers and daughters
pursue social advantage and trivial diversion in Italy.
If the reader feels, nonetheless, a bit dispirited by Buzard's emphasis on
anxious aspiration, I recommend strongly the more cheerful view of tourism
offered by Evelyn Waugh's Labels. Waugh, happily, envisages 'the middle-aged
widow of comfortable means' attracted by travel brochures in which 'that
rosy sequence of association, desert moon, pyramids, palms . . . all
delicately point the way to sheik, rape, and harem.'

COLLECTED POEMS by Weldon Kees Faber Pounds 7.99, 180 pages
COLLECTED EARLY POEMS 1950-70 by Adrienne Rich Norton Pounds, 435 pages
WHAT more satisfying a name for an enigma than Weldon Kees, the American
poet whose car was found abandoned near San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge
in 1955? Was it suicide or a feint? No trace of his body was found, no
satisfactory explanation offered.
A recent Bookmark programme set itself the thankless task of discovering the
truth about Kees. It tracked him through the America of his lifetime - from
his mid-west, pre-Depression childhood in Beatrice, Nebraska, through his
years in New York City in the 1940s (where he made documentary films; worked
briefly as art critic of the Nation; wrote for Time and Paramount Newsreel;
painted canvases that allied him with the early abstract expressionists; and
wrote Brechtian songs for vaudeville) and back to San Francisco where he
took up classical jazz piano and collaborated on a book about non-verbal
communication, illustrated with his own photographs. All this apart, there
was the writing: short stories (still uncollected), a novel (published in
the US two years ago), and the poems now available in Britain for the first
time.
What sort of a man was he? A meteorite, by all accounts; a man of intense,
feverish activity. A chain-smoking poser; a country boy turned city slicker
(if the photographs are to be believed). 'He lived in a permanent and
hopeless apocalypse,' said Kenneth Rexroth, godfather of the Beats, who knew
him towards the end of his life. (That apocalypse was, of course, sustained
by drugs and alcohol).
He was a man of narrow and profound vision whose poetry, prosaic in style,
displays a kind of benumbed bitterness; a strange, obsessive, riddling
analysis of the heart's paralysis. From time to time, it has the desolation
of an Edward Lear: 'A white-faced man with sad, enormous eyes.' The light in
the poems usually is bleached, wan, colourless. Nothing is healed, nothing
shriven. Kees returns empty-handed from the search for life's meaning.
Although he lived 1,000 miles or more from the respectability of his family,
Kees, an only child, used to send home newspaper cuttings on his 'successes'
as a poet, film-maker, etc. Did his mother understand? When, two days after
his disappearance, the dusty, fusty couple appeared in San Francisco and
were taken to the bridge, his mother looked down at the water,
disbelievingly, and said: 'But he was never the athletic type.'
Kees published only three small volumes of poetry over 11 years and was
never regarded as a major figure during his lifetime. Adrienne Rich, on the
other hand, in a career as poet and libertarian activist that spans nearly
half a century, has become both a popular and a recognisably angry public
voice.
And yet, it was not always so - as her Collected Early Poems 1950-1970
demonstrates. In her first collection of 1951,for example, which is full of
the enormous assurance of youth, she regards everything with a calm,
aestheticising eye. There is an attitude of wise resignation before the
things of the world.
By the late 1960s, having passed through the political turbulence of that
decade, there is no such thing as inner and outer any more - everything is
political. The old language is the language of the oppressor and it must be
wrested from his grasp.

<TEXT>
'ABOVE ALL, pay attention to life,' wrote Henri Cartier-Bresson who, along
with Robert Capa, was a founding member of Magnum Photos in 1947. It has
been an edict to which Peter Marlow, the agency's president now, has
subscribed faithfully; his previous work has recorded the conflict and
suffering in war zones and refugee camps around the world.
Between assignments abroad, Marlow returned periodically throughout the
1980s to photograph the people and buildings of Liverpool. The cumulative
result is a powerful social document, Liverpool: Looking Out To Sea, now
showing at The Photographers' Gallery in London and also published by
Jonathan Cape (Pounds 35/Pounds 20, 111 pages).
Marlow's achievement is to penetrate the humanity behind Liverpool's media
image with an admirably unsentimental style that accommodates both the
artless, snapshot aesthetic of social landscape photography and more
painterly, chiaroscuro prints, such as those of men and boys scavenging in
rubbish dumps.
Never shy of the grand gesture (one of his contributions to the Hayward
Gallery's Magnum retrospective three years ago showed a US soldier grieving
before Washington's Vietnam war memorial, here echoed by a fan mourning the
Hillsborough victims), Marlow's ennobling, luminous tones inject a measure
of sympathy for a city once fat on the imperial plenty of the slave trade.
And, amid this wasteland, a river runs through it. Marlow points constantly
to the Mersey's embarrassed, disconsolate presence as a metaphor for the
city's decay and disuse. Empty of the ships that brought Liverpool wealth,
the only vessels to break its monotonous expanse are half-full ferries and a
Sunday afternoon yacht race where a white marker flag offers up a symbol of
surrender.

FADS, FASHIONS AND CULTS by Tony Thorne Bloomsbury Pounds 20, 310 pages
ONE MUST be so careful these days. Ask directions of a New Age traveller and
you might find yourself addressing, instead, a Smellie, a Soap Dodger or a
self-styled Cider Punk. Thanks to Tony Thorne's kaleidoscopic new guide to
the pseuds' corners and sub-cultures of modern Britain, New Men, New
Romantics and New Georgians can sit down and discover how new they really
are.
For Fads, Fashions and Cults is no ordinary dictionary. Its world is a
post-modernist one in which nothing has meaning but everything, from Cocteau
to cocktail sticks, can have significance. Cross-referencing frantically,
Thorne lays bare the song-lines of 20th century living. Like generational
lists from the Old Testament, he says a disco craze like Talking begat
Toasting which begat Dub which begat Rap. Hip Hop begat Body Pop which, in
turn, begat Rave.
Not everything is as crystal-clear as that, of course. Did Punks or the
Crusties ('Crusties practise a militant self-degradation involving drink and
drug abuse, personal filthiness and public obnoxiousness') beget Grunge?
Then again, which dissident hair-style came first: the Duck's Arse or the
Argentine Ducktail? Replies on a postcard to the author, who says he wants
his readers to answer back.
Some lines of enquiry lead nowhere. Trepanning, or drilling a hole in the
skull to release higher levels of consciousness, seems to have begat only
publicity for Dr Bart Hughers, a Dutch mystic who tried it in 1962.
Forest Therapy begat Tree Sniffing but little else. True, contemplating a
tree at close quarters while inhaling the resinous fumes given off by its
bark and leaves might, as our author speculates doggedly, have something to
do with the 'outdoor Shamanistic rituals of the Men's Movement.' But by the
time he has thrown in the Combat Games cult to boot, the reader has got his
song-lines well and truly knotted.
Like the four rivers leading away from Paradise, if there are four
grand-daddy cult fads and fashions which spawned the rest, then Hip Hop, the
Beats, Existentialism and the hula hoop appear to have a lot to answer for.
Indeed, we learn that the hula hoop looks forward to aerobics and back to
the Maori war dance.
'Only connect,' EM Forster once suggested as a means of comprehending modern
society. Reading this self-styled 'definitive' guide to modern culture, he
might rather have wished he hadn't.

FT  17 APR 93 / Arts: Easter at Salzburg is changing its tune - The
Wagner-and-verismo days are numbered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHADOW of Herbert von Karajan may have been displaced from Salzburg last
summer by the explosive impact of Gerard Mortier, but it still hangs heavy
over the Easter Festival. This is the private festival Karajan founded in
1967 for himself and his rich friends and admirers. Unlike the
publicly-funded summer event, which had an identity before and beyond him,
Karajan was the Easter Festival. Its 3,800 Forderer (supporters) paid an
annual fee of up to Pounds 800 to attend one opera performance and three
concerts, after each of which the standing ovation was as precisely
orchestrated as the music.
Since his death in 1989, the 'Karajan pilgrims' have continued to visit
Salzburg at Easter to pay their respects. There is still an air of mourning
 -exemplified this year by two performances of Brahms' German Requiem,
preceded by a minute's silence, with no applause at the end.
But the festival is finally being forced to look to the future and its
long-term survival. Without Karajan, some festival-goers decided Salzburg
was no longer worth supporting. Last year, the management had a nasty spat
with the new regime at the Summer Festival, on whom it depends for
co-production finance and set-building facilities. A power vacuum has
developed.
The Easter Festival is still a limited company controlled by Karajan's heirs
 -his widow Eliette and their two daughters, who have shown no more than
figure-head interest. The executor of the Karajan estate, the Swiss lawyer
Werner Kupper, has a big say, but he is out of his depth in the arts. The
festival administrator, Beate Burchhard, is not a strong personality in the
Mortier mould. The artistic director for the past three years, Georg Solti,
is a busy international conductor, not a native of Salzburg. The same can be
said of his successor, Claudio Abbado, who shared this year's conducting
workload.
But there is enough support - and reserve cash - to make plans, all of which
suggests this Easter may have been a watershed. Next year Abbado will
conduct Herbert Wernicke's new staging of Boris Godunov. There is talk of
Wozzeck in 1995 with Bryn Terfel in the title role. The rift with Mortier
has been patched up and an agreement signed for co-productions until 1997.
What matters now is the extent of Abbado's interest: whether he is willing
to learn new operas (Lulu for example) and make the Easter Festival
artistically, not just legally, independent of the Summer Festival. Whatever
the outcome, the Berlin Philharmonic is eager to continue its 25-year
association - conveniently so for Salzburg, because the orchestra's concert
expenses are covered by the Berlin Senate. The Easter Festival's
overwhelmingly conservative patrons may have to modify their traditional
diet of Wagner-and-verismo, but at least the artistic standard will be
maintained.
Salzburg at Easter has undoubted charm. The city is less crowded than in
summer, the weather more temperate, and there is just one daily performance
in the early evening, which helps to work up an appetite. Audiences may be
uncritical, but at least there is an air of concentration. Karajan knew what
he was doing.
This year's festival was a mixed success. In an all-Richard Strauss concert,
Martha Argerich provided just the right blend of temperament and virtuosity
to pull off the quirky Burleske, while Till Eulenspiegel found Abbado and
the orchestra in superlative form. As for Solti, his endearing mannerisms
and sheer energy at the age of 80 were fascinating  - he has never really
mellowed. But he and the Berlin Philharmonic inhabit different musical
worlds. Given anything other than extremely quiet or lyrical music, Solti
just drives through, an amalgam of nervous torso jerks, attacking downbeats
and wrist-flicking tics. The orchestra's inbred tonal warmth, by contrast,
softens the edges of everything it plays.
Last Saturday's programme of Beethoven's Second Symphony and Shostakovich's
Fifth provided the stylistic battleground. The orchestra's strings won out
in the slow movements of each, particularly in the meditative solemnity of
the Shostakovich. But Solti refused to let the Beethoven breathe, and made
the Shostakovich finale too triumphantly emphatic to hint at irony. Where
orchestra and conductor did find common ground was in the Prelude and
Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde, a perfectly-graded performance of
breathtaking translucence, which crowned a star-studded charity concert for
Bosnia on Easter Sunday.
The Berliners sounded less at home in the pit for Falstaff, this year's new
opera production. Where Verdi calls for a nimble spring-in-the-step, they
offered symphonic mass and less-than-sparkling ensemble. Their Vienna
counterparts, who have the opera in their repertory, will probably make a
better job when the production is revived in the summer. It was,
nonetheless, a Falstaff of high musical values. This was the work which
introduced Solti to Salzburg in 1937, as a 24-year old assistant to
Toscanini - who had played cello in the premiere 100 years ago. Now the same
age as Verdi was then, Solti paced the music with guileless ease, a master
of its mercurial moods.
His cast included Luciana Serra's flirtatious Alice, Marjana Lipovsek's
imposing Mrs Quickly and a delectable pair of lovers in Luca Canonici and
Elizabeth Norberg-Schulz. Paolo Coni sang Ford with virile authority, while
Kim Begley, Pierre Lefebvre and Mario Luperi made a well-contrasted trio of
comic comprimarios. Jose van Dam's Falstaff was no buffoon, but a stubby,
scruffy, cantankerous old terrier, capable of scuttling a Pistol twice his
size, alternately outrageous, dignified and randy. The acting was all in the
voice.
The staging was by Luca Ronconi, with designs by Margherita Palli and Vera
Marzot. Like so many before them, they were seduced by the monumental
breadth of the Grosses Festspielhaus stage, diluting the opera's intimate
atmosphere in decor of architectural vastness. Some of Ronconi's ideas were
distinctly odd: the Garter Inn resembled a bottling factory; Falstaff was
tipped into the Fords' garden fish-pond; the last scene was a nonsensical
Midsummer Night's Dream, with Falstaff's bedroom sprouting the foliage of
Herne's Oak. If this was Ronconi's idea of fun, then for once the joke was
on the producer.

GHOSTS by John Banville Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 244 pages
THE MUSEUM OF LOVE by Steve Weiner Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 214 pages
AIR AND FIRE by Rupert Thomson Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 311 pages
ODO'S HANGING by Peter Benson Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 251 pages
ON AN island facing the Atlantic, the unnamed narrator of Ghosts serves out
a personal penance for an unnamed crime. He has done his stint in jail; now
he is working on a book in the shadow of the island's resident art historian
and an irascible side-kick idiosyncratically named Licht.
Islands contain in narrower confines psychological as well as physical
geographies. Hence their fascination for writers. They invite intrusion no
less than metaphor. To this island, intrusion comes in the form of a
disparate group of people to shake up the narrator's near arcadian
existence, invoking unwelcome ghosts from his past. 'This is what happens to
you in prison,' the narrator reflects, 'you lose your past, it is
confiscated from you'. However, the past is richly retrieved in extensive
inner monologues evoked by the narrator's interplay with the newcomers.
This is a strange novel of startling contrasts: a brooding gothic mood
suffuses a pleasant pastel-tinted ambience. Ghosts is Banville's ninth
novel. His originality has not deserted him. Much of the writing flows with
a lyrical rhythm, and what a joy that is. Yet this is only half a
commendation, for the full-bodied resonance of language obtrudes, exposing
baldness of plot and some imperfectly-focused ideas.
By contrast, Steve Weiner's The Museum of Love is diamond-hard and lean. Its
opening sentence is compelling: 'In August that year a Lutheran farmer named
Ed Gien shot a social worker in the cranberry bogs.' From there on the hold
on the reader is sustained to the end with hardly a let up.
The hero, Jean-Michel, is a French Canadian Catholic. His father, a prison
warden, is depressive and violent. The young Jean-Michel hits the road,
embarking on an odyssey whose arbitrary comic brutality recalls William
Burroughs. Just about everything happens to him. His friends, his family,
move in and out of his story like a parade of exotics in a circus.
Jean-Michel is tough, resilient, totally without self-pity, and therefore
engaging.
This is a first novel of astonishing power and accomplishment. The writing
is superbly economical. Only a certain rawness of moral vision makes this
novel a whisker short of being brilliant.
At the close of the 19th century, the setting for Air and Fire, a steamer
makes its way to Santa Sofia, a remote copper-mining town in Mexico. On
board is a French engineer Theophile Valence, with his beautiful young wife,
Suzanne. His mission is to erect a metal church, whose 2,348 components are
packed in the ship's hold. The project is the brainchild of Gustave Eiffel,
with whom M. Valence corresponds. Ethereal and inexperienced, Suzanne yearns
for the kind of romantic love her eminently rational husband is incapable of
giving. Wilson, an American drifter can, so Suzanne believes, but won't.
Montoya, the flamboyant local army commander, wants to but is rejected.
Rupert Thomson manages some marvellous writing here, in a style well-suited
to the evocative, semi-fantastical landscape he creates. But the promise he
skilfully upholds through more than half the novel, is never quite realised
in the end: there is more Air than Fire to the story.
The Bayeux Tapestry propels the story of Peter Benson's charming novel.
Turold, a master Norman designer of imposing stature and turbulent
character, is commissioned by William the Conqueror's half-brother, Bishop
Odo, to create the tapestry. Reluctantly, Turold sails for England with his
dumb assistant Robert, the story's narrator. The 'real' story evolves side
by side with that which the commissioned tapestry records for posterity. And
it's a good one.

FT  17 APR 93 / Arts: Shaken and stirred by serial music - David Murray
applauds the 'Alternative Vienna' mini-festival on the South Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THURSDAY the South Bank began one of its timeliest and best-planned
mini-festivals, under the label 'Alternative Vienna'. That is a fairly sexy
label: it suggests something subversive of Vienna's notorious conservatism
about music - something brash and populist, and perhaps a bit tacky, as many
cultivated Berliners found Kurt Weill's theatre-music in the 1930s.
There is some kinship. Yet an alternative label might have captured better
why Kurt Schwertsik (born 1935) and HK Gruber (just turned 50) should have a
mini-festival built around their music: 'The Viennese Alternative'. Far
beyond Austria, many, many composers who were shaken and/or stirred by the
potent ideals of serialism, in the 1950s and after, have ever since been
seeking an Alternative like a Holy Grail.
On the one hand, serialism proposed a compositional means that could be both
'rigorous' and bracingly open-ended, with exciting room for development. On
the other its lofty disdain for tonality - an omnipresent power no less in
popular music (meaning the music we all grow up with) than in 'classical' -
challenged new listeners with the test of learning the rules of an
unfamiliar game. Only a few of them bothered to do that. Predictions that
modern audiences would slip naturally into the right listening-mode proved
over-optimistic by a very long way: between the general audience and an
educated sub-set, a chasm has yawned.
It was a continuing embarrassment that the works of Alban Berg - only
sometimes properly 'serial' and fraught with compromising tonal echoes -
remained the sole public triumph of the New Music. Composers nowadays, like
their colleagues in other arts, are acutely self-conscious about theory;
there have been no good theories to accommodate both serialism, with its
guiding premise about the 'democracy' of all 12 notes of the chromatic
scale, and the bald fact that our ears hunt out tonally biased roots.
Yet there is an escape-route: which is to remember that every creditable
theory about music - about any art] - follows practice, and does not precede
it. The first thing to be said about the music of Schwertsik and Gruber is
that it is directly engaging, sometimes hugely engaging, without trading
upon familiar routines (except to contradict them). Continual surprises are
essential to its charm, not least because in retrospect they seem to make
perfect sense. These composers deploy elements of well-worn styles in
unexpected orders, and a strictly up-to-date sensibility shines through.
They are close colleagues, but not twins. At the start of the 1960s, when
Gruber had just retired from the Vienna Boys' Choir and taken up the
double-bass, Schwertsik was a committed disciple of the Darmstadt school.
With Friedrich Cerha he had already founded the ensemble die reihe ('the
row', ie the Schoenbergian 12-note row, and by extension any new serialist
methods) - a senior Continental equivalent of the London Sinfonietta. But
doubts about communicability were setting in; Schwertsik was attracted by
John Cage's musical anarchism, and he also became a friend of the young
Cornelius Cardew, then a frustrated under-labourer on Stockhausen's arcanely
elaborate scores.
While Cardew turned to writing for transparent popular appeal with a frank
political message, Schwertsik published a manifesto inveighing against
narrow serialist dogma. He had already produced the 'Violin Concerto' we
heard on Thursday, really a five-piece suite of exquisitely dry, contrasted
manners, all deeply quirky - weird little ensembles for accompaniments (but
peculiarly telling), abrupt silences at unexpected places, the solo role
bundled briskly from foreground to background and back again; but always, a
limpid lyrical line.
The young Russian Sergej Stadler delivered it with all the right lusty
innocence; Franz Welser-Most drew beautifully wry support from his London
Philharmonic. It was appalling to hear them return after the interval to
play Mahler's Symphony no. 9 so badly - ill-tuned, raw and rough - and to
watch Welser-Most's extravagant windmilling achieve only a first movement
that sounded like a kit of unassembled parts, middle movements of shrill
crudity, and a heedlessly loud, vulgar finale. There must be more to the
story; perhaps there had been some kind of cataclysm in the Green Room.
While Gruber played double-bass in die reihe, his music never travelled far.
By the start of the 1980s, however, his 'pan-demonium' Frankenstein]] - a
monster cabaret on gallows-humour verses, for himself as rampant chansonnier
and a brittly twinkling orchestra (due here on April 27) - began to make the
rounds of all the musical capitals. A first Violin Concerto soon confirmed
that there was a unique Gruber idiom, besides a delectable sweet-and-sour
sound (he loves vibes, marimbas, xylorimbas and glockenspiels), and that it
was rich enough to nourish a substantial work.
His virtuoso Cello Concerto (April 24), commissioned by Yo Yo Ma, is a
miracle of evasive wit and charm, a lovely gift to the repertoire. Londoners
are still waiting to hear his intense, spidery, intimate Violin Concerto no.
2. What makes the Schwertsik-Gruber front a significant Viennese
Alternative, and not just Alternative Viennese, is that they have found a
musical diction that answers to ideals widely entertained, but scarcely
realised anywhere else.
To be open and appealing to non-theoretical ears; to rise to succinct,
complex expression nevertheless, escaping the constraints of popular
Minimalism (a second-rate Alternative); to eschew stock routines and cosy
pastiche, whilst acknowledging roots in the old musical basis - a lot of
composers wish they could manage that] If you care about where 'modern'
music might be going, you should go and hear some of this stuff. At the very
least, which is already a lot, it will be fun.
Further 'Alternative Vienna' concerts tonight, April 17, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30
and May 6; details from South Bank Centre box-office

WOLF by Jim Harrison Flamingo Pounds 4.99, 225 pages
A GOOD DAY TO DIE by Jim Harrison Flamingo Pounds 4.99, 176 pages
FARMER by Jim Harrison Flamingo Pounds 4.99, 160 pages
WARLOCK by Jim Harrison Flamingo Pounds 4.99, 262 pages
IN A time where courageous publishing decisions are thin on the ground,
Flamingo's publication for the first time in the UK of four early novels by
the grossly undervalued Jim Harrison deserves a standing ovation. Harrison
is among the most accomplished American novelists of his generation, a
raucous yet urbane storyteller whose books provide a useful map to the
personal and national midlife crises that grip his country.
Wolf (1971), Harrison's first novel, tells the story of the frazzled and
mercurial Swanson, a failed romantic of 33 years who returns to the wilds of
his native Michigan after abortive attempts to find meaning in 1960s
America. For five miserable, booze-free days, he fruitlessly tries to get a
glimpse of the vanishing timberwolf before it becomes extinct. As he
searches, he reflects on his own tenuous existence: drinking, wandering and
engaging in a series of disastrous love affairs, all the while tortured by
the notion that 'I don't want to live on earth but I want to live.'
Though thin on plot, the book is full of humour and anger. Swanson is the
sort of left-handed rebel whose excesses and screw-ups stand more as a
condemnation of his diseased culture than any personal shortcoming. He is a
man in the throes of a spiritual hangover, blinking awake after a
decade-long binge, gasping for a glimpse of something primitive and pure to
make the pain go away.
This anger becomes increasingly focused in Harrison's second novel, A Good
Day to Die (1973). Again, the hero is a dispossessed young man whose
attempts at marriage and career have fizzled out. Lacking anything better to
do, he teams up with a speed-addicted Vietnam vet and his redneck girlfriend
in a crazed plot to blow up one of the many dams clotting America's west.
'It occurred to me I should question my motives but found that I had none,'
the narrator confesses at one point. It is a taut, compelling story about
people at war with themselves and their era, a howl of environmental outrage
clothed in a fast-paced adventure story. Finely poised between farce and
tragedy, it conveys the moral vacuity of Nixon's America with a rare
fervour.
A different, quieter sort of energy fuels Farmer (1976), the story of a
42-year-old schoolteacher who has reached a Frostian crossroads in his life
and has to choose which path to take. Joseph has just lost his job and must
decide whether to begin working his ancestral farm or flee it to live near
the ocean he loves without ever having seen. To complicate matters, he is
engaged in two love affairs - one with a flighty student, the other with his
widowed childhood sweetheart.
Harrison establishes these conflicts with a steady and subtle hand, evoking
the sense of quiet dread that grips many men when they reach the middle
point of their life. This crisis is examined more riotously in Warlock
(1981), arguably Harrison's best book and undoubtedly his funniest. It tells
the story of Johnny Lundgren, also 42, who loses his cushy job and sinks
into morose self-absorption, jeopardising his marriage and waistline in the
process.
He snaps out of it when a local millionaire hires him to straighten out his
Byzantine personal and financial affairs. Lundgren turns into a cod private
eye, travelling from the wilds of Northern Michigan to the equally dangerous
mansions of Palm Beach in a series of increasingly hilarious adventures. It
is as wildly raunchy as Farmer is understated, a book of high farce and low
humour.
These four books, taken together, provide a fulsome portrait of the American
male's soul every bit as incisive as Updike or Roth. Harrison is a writer
whose ribald humour is balanced by a tight-lipped sensitivity, whose love of
the rugged outdoors fails to mask the connoisseur of gourmet food and fine
art.
But, in the end, what makes Harrison such a pleasure to read is the sheer
inventiveness and grace of his prose. As he states in Wolf, 'An obtuse
paragraph is always toxic.' Well, in these remarkable books the writing
remains as toxin-free as Harrison's beloved Upper Peninsula must have been
when the wolves were more common than that troublesome creature, modern man.

<DATELINE>
   IN A programme note to his new Antic
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
given its first London showing on Thursday night at Sadler's Wells - Kim
Brandstrup identifies what led him to make this danced version of Hamlet.
Not narrative, but 'what lies behind the words'. This has also been
Brandstrup's concern in such significant pieces as his Peer Gynt and The
Dybbuk, and may be understood in Mysteries, his commentary on Duke
Bluebeard's Castle.
Brandstrup's vision is refined, potent. His theatre is - thanks in part to
what Karsavina called 'blessed poverty' - one where every effect is reduced
to its mechanical or physical essence, and, like the dance, resonates with
meaning. This is what I find so convincing about his work, and it is what
makes Antic fascinating and powerful. As with Noh, or with the theatre
dreamed of by Edward Gordon Craig, we enter a world of allusions, symbols.
Appearances are essences; less is superbly more. And in Antic - as with his
exquisite Orfeo for London Contemporary Dance - Brandstrup has looked to an
earlier theatre form as frame for his choreography. (And he has been joined
by the same magnificent Orfeo collaborators: Craig Givens for design; Ian
Dearden for score; Tina MacHugh for lighting, who share Brandstrup's
imaginative subtlety and economy).
Antic owes certain of its attitudes to the 17th century Trauerspiel of
Northern Europe, a melange of sentiment and melodrama. Craig Givens sets the
stage with grand simplicity by means of panels of almost spectral tapestry,
with chairs, a table, the only properties. Costuming is of the period,
sombre save for warm earthy shades for three actors in the play scene. The
'look' is austere, very beautiful. And Tina MacHugh lights this world with
ideal sensitivity to every dramatic point. Ian Dearden's score mixes
electronic and instrumental sound to provide music both atmospheric and
sustaining of the action. Like the choreography, it adjusts exactly to the
idea of a baroque style re-cast for today.
The choreography is that subtext Branstrup has discerned behind
Shakespeare's words. Passions, motives, emotional unease, are exposed in
dancing that is impressive in its perceptions as in its ability to explore
feeling. We may identify incident and characterisation from the play - the
closet scene; Polonius' death; Ophelia's madness - but more significantly,
we are taken into the minds or memories of the characters, and see how
obsessions repeat, how psychic wounds remain open, how Hamlet's sufferings
hedge him in.
Images are everywhere sure, vivid: the mad Ophelia moving from one frozen
pose to another; Hamlet circling the stage in a swirl of action that tells
of his indecisions; Claudius arranging the seated Gertrude in a pose, as he
has earlier placed Ophelia; Hamlet, at the last, held like a child on the
shoulders of his ghost Father. Branstrup's theatre is compact of such
memorable dynamics and such visual coups.
There are excellent performances from the ten members of Arc Dance: Jeremy
James as Hamlet; Mark Ashman and Souli Yates as Claudius and Gertrude;
Joanna O'Keeffe as Ophelia; Norman Douglas, Andrew Titcombe, David Scinto,
Joy Constantinides, Daniel Belton, Patrick Mahoney. They provide ensemble
playing of rare sensitivity.
Antic was made possible by sponsorship from the Stanley Thomas Johnson
Foundation; Daniel Katz; the Leche Trust; the Mathilda and Terence Kennedy
Charitable Trust. It is lamentable that Branstrup's company does not receive
full funding from the Arts Council. I would urge Arc Dance to the attention
of commercial sponsors: Brandstrup's serious and beautiful work stands in
splendid contrast to the mediocrity and vulgarity that is so industriously
promoted and bank-rolled as modern dance in this country by official bodies.
Antic receives its last performance tonight at Sadler's Wells Theatre

FT  17 APR 93 / Arts: Lille parades its artistic legacy - Patricia Morison
visits the French at the National
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE magnificent paintings, David's 'Belisarius', Delacroix's 'Medea', and
Courbet's 'Une Apres-dinee a Ornans', make a compelling case for a visit to
Tradition and Revolution in French Art, 1700-1880 at the National Gallery.
This exhibition is surely one of the most wide-ranging and informative
surveys of French art to have been seen in Britain.
The exhibition comes from the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Lille, one of the best
public collections in France. The museum opened in 1809, a few years after
Napoleon had signed a decree permitting favoured towns to build museums at
their own expense for works of art confiscated during the Revolution. The
museum is now closed for rebuilding (reopening December 1994), and meanwhile
parts of the collection have been sent abroad. It is a shrewd move, of a
piece with Lille's commercial ambitions. The idea is that, once the Channel
Tunnel is open, travellers crossing the mournful coastal reaches will flock
to Lille as to a beacon of French culture.
Jacques-Louis David's 'Belisarius' of 1781 is a marvellous painting, noble
and pathetic. The contrast is an affecting one, between the blind old
warrior and the golden child who stands between his knees. Both gaze
imploringly at the compassionate lady who drops a coin into the outstretched
helmet. A stormy sky casts menacing shadows over Byzantine Constantinople,
an omen of the divine displeasure incurred by Emperor Justinian when he had
his great general blinded. The soldier with his hands raised in horror is
not one of David's happier passages, but makes the point that a state which
outrages the moral sense of its citizens cannot prosper.
Opposite 'Belisarius' hangs one of Delacroix's grimmest images, 'Medea', the
fugitive poised to slit the throats of her two struggling infants. Sketches
make clear how the artist wrestled to balance this complicated composition,
drawn in essence (and perhaps with deliberate irony) from Andrea del Sarto's
'Charity'. A shadow across Medea's brow, missing in the oil sketch, is a
masterly touch which shows that evil has entirely possessed this unnatural
mother.
These two paintings could illustrate any textbook account of French art's
progress from neo-classicism to romanticism. The third huge masterpiece,
Courbet's 'Une Apres-dinee a Ornans' of 1848, represents the shocking
arrival of realism on the scene. It is now a wreck because Courbet used
bitumen and litharge, but thanks partly to restoration, the real thing turns
out to be more legible than in reproduction.
After the preceding paintings, the shock is still palpable. Here is an
artist who thought that his friends, unremarkable chaps relaxing after
dinner with a smoke, a fiddle, and a bottle of wine, were a fit subject for
a massive canvas. It was not at all the same thing as painting artists in a
studio, a conventional subject here represented by Boilly's studies for his
'Studio of Isabey', part of an attractive group of paintings by this painter
from Lille.
Courbet's scene is powerfully rustic and yet not the time-honoured depiction
of peasants, as in Boilly's 'Mon pied-de-boeuf' and a queasy Millet of a
mother spoon-feeding her children. A new kind of peasant painting was about
to appear, solemn moments in village ritual. The famous example from Lille
is Jules Breton's 'Procession to erect a Crucifix', itself based on
Courbet's 'Burial at Ornans'.
And yet, so powerful is the mood conveyed by the 'Apres-dinee' that its
underlying theme seems clear; the power of music over the senses. To be
sure, it is a revolutionary painting in manner and technique, yet it is
still rooted in a traditional subject. Such moments of realisation are many
in an exhibition which fills a lot of gaps. The National Gallery's own
collection of French art is patchy, even though the Wallace Collection
compensates handsomely. However, Tradition and Revolution includes many
unfamiliar artists who rarely find their place in textbook accounts of
French art.
Unfortunately, the first room marks a dangerously low point with a feeble
piece of mythological eroticism by Greuze and two laughable 'Combats between
Minerva and Mars'. The first won Joseph-Benot Suve the 1771 Prix de Rome.
The version by David is a terrible thing, so clumsily put together in
boudoir shades of sky-blue and rose, that it seems incredible he ever
achieved anything great. Most certainly that was not within the grasp of
Jean Raoux, specialist in Vestal Virgins, by whom there are two truly
terrible paintings of Virgins Ancient and Modern.
Frightful things also lurk in the later 19th century, such as Amaury-Duval's
'The Birth of Venus', and 'Achilles and Priam' by Bastien-Lepage, a painting
so awful as to exert a mesmeric fascination. But there are many paintings to
set against these, such as Gericault's 'Race of the Riderless Horses' and a
glowing vase of flowers by Delacroix. Here, then, is a broad view of French
art from Rococo to Impressionism (just, with two landscapes by Sisley and
Lepine), as well as a powerful reminder that Lille vaut le voyage.
Exhibition closes July 11. late opening until 8 on Wednesdays

FT  17 APR 93 / Arts: Cheek by Jowl - a tour de force / Michael Arditti
talks to director Declan Donnellan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL ARDITTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Lysander and Demetrius stop jockeying for position and agree to pursue
Helena 'cheek by jowl', they can little have guessed that their exit line
would provide the name for the most successful theatre company of recent
years. But then, what's in a name? In Brazil Cheek by Jowl are known as
'face to face', in Argentina 'elbow to elbow', in Uruguay 'shoulder to
shoulder', in Spain 'flesh and nails' - and somewhere even 'arse in
knickers.'
Few companies embodied the self-sufficient spirit of the 1980s more
successfully - or more humanely. Frustrated by their inability to gain work
from any established source, director Declan Donnellan and designer Nick
Ormerod decided to mortgage their house and go it alone. They applied for a
small Arts Council grant, patched together a nine-week tour and hit the
road.
From the start the company established a reputation for exciting small-scale
productions of the classics; although the size of the operation is often
underestimated. As Donnellan says, 'it's only in London people talk of our
studio work; elsewhere we perform in huge auditoria'. An accompanying
reputation for irreverence is, in the director's view, equally unfounded:
'From where we are, we are middle of the road purists'.
After initial success with The Country Wife and Othello, it was their 1984
season of Vanity Fair, Pericles and Andromache which made their name with a
metropolitan audience. The three productions exemplify the essential
elements of the Cheek by Jowl approach - the narrative clarity and overt
theatricality of Vanity Fair, with its heroic doubling by seven actors of 40
characters and inventive set in which boxes and banquettes became
battlefields, boudoirs and ballrooms; the stylistic freedom of Pericles with
its mime, music and direct address; and the rescue of Andromache from years
of classroom tedium and theatrical neglect.
Their repertoire has remained resolutely classical: seven Shakespeares, two
Restorations, one each of Calderon, Corneille, Racine, Ostrovsky, Sophocles
and Lessing. In 12 years they have included only one new play, Donnellan's
own examination of his Irish heritage, Lady Betty. And yet he explains that
this neglect is utterly pragmatic: 'It's rather ridiculous that we're
performing plays by people so incredibly dead. But the reason is that we
don't have the means to evaluate new ones. We get masses and masses of
scripts which we simply don't have a chance to read.'
It becomes increasingly clear that this pragmatism informs their whole
operation. They never choose a play to score specific points, aesthetic or
political, but rather to explore its meaning within a particular company.
The main exception was in 1991 when they chose to examine the gender
confusions of As You Like It with an all-male cast.
Their current production is Alfred de Musset's Don't Fool With Love, which
reaches the Donmar Warehouse next week in Donnellan's own translation. He
places it in the direct line of earlier revivals such as Andromache and Le
Cid and its mix of styles fascinates him: 'It moves from an opening of
commedia-type drunken priests to intense romantic duos which might have been
written by Flaubert. It's a cross between Madame Bovary and opera buffo.'
Donnellan sees the keynote of his direction as the liberation of his actors'
imaginations: 'to help them act better, to steer them on the path that is
most truthful.' What is yet more unusual is that it is also the keynote of
Ormerod's design. Not a sketch is committed to paper until he has worked
with the company for at least two weeks. And, uniquely in contemporary
British theatre, he remains present throughout rehearsals.
Such respect for their creativity is the reason that so many actors clamour
to join Cheek by Jowl. The irony is that while both artistic directors
consider it to be an actors' company, it is popularly perceived as a two-man
band, existing solely to promote their own work. Only one production has
ever been entrusted to an outsider, their former assistant Lindsay Posner.
Certain actors do however remain constant; indeed it was the desire to
create parts for company stalwart, Anne White, which led to two of their
most contentious creations: the foul- mouthed female porter in Macbeth and
the sex-changed King of Naples in The Tempest. But Donnellan insists that
they never consciously try to be different. 'It may sound a paradox, but the
truer you are to the play, the more original you will be. The more you try
to put yourself in, the more you'll end up like everyone else.'
My own criticism would be less of such incidentals than of an emotional
reserve. It is sometimes easier to admire the wit of a Cheek by Jowl
production than to be fired by the passion. And, although Donnellan
considers the greatest privilege of his work to be the poetry, his belief
that poetry is what lies behind the words, rather than the words themselves,
can lead to an underselling of the verse. Poetry is, famously, what gets
lost in translation; to which Cheek by Jowl have been more susceptible than
most. In ten years of intensive international touring, they have become our
leading theatrical ambassadors. They played in Eastern Europe before the
revolutions. In Prague they risked official displeasure by using a press
conference to salute the imprisoned Vaclav Havel. In Bucharest their female
King of Naples, seen here as Mrs Thatcher, was taken for the still more
authoritarian Elena Ceaucescu.
Now that the cry of freedom has been heard, they stand at the forefront of
cultural exchange with the new Romanian regime and next year will mount an
epic production of Boris Godunov, first in Bucharest and then in Manchester,
starring Ion Caramitru, who was that country's transitional vice-president
and last seen here in the role of Hamlet. Only once have they been
compromised by politics, when Macbeth was prevented from touring Chile for
fear General Pinochet should see it as a reflection of his own career.
After twelve years on the road, 1650 performances, and a pervasive influence
on the style of British classical production, its directors could be
forgiven for sitting back on their laurels - or at least their Olivier
awards. But they remain dedicated to touring and discount the alternative of
running their own theatre as one where artistic considerations are submerged
in those of patching up leaking roofs. And, although they have diversified
with productions at the National such as Fuente Ovejuna, Angels in America
and the forthcoming Sweeney Todd, their primary commitment to the company
remains. It is a commitment as much personal as professional. For, if not as
symbiotic as Gilbert and George, they are rarely apart. Indeed the key to
their success lies in their total embodiment of their own ethos: living and
working 'cheek by jowl'.

EASTER broadcasts began on Good Friday with Radio 1's Talk of the Devil, an
anthology of evil, ranging from Paradise Lost to the bombing of Nagasaki,
with music by Elizabeth Parker from the Radiophonic Workshop and readings by
Dr Leslie Griffiths, the Rev Steve Chalke and DJ The Man Ezeke, a
Restafarian. Michael Wakelin produced.
At the other end of the scale, Radio 4 has swapped its morning Bible slot
for Something Understood, a collection of spiritual but not necessarily
religious English verse. Donne, Herbert and the rest are there, of course,
but so are many poems by modern writers. The selection of readers is as
imaginative as the selection of writers. David Benedictus produces.
The Thin Blue Line, Radio 4's four-week series on the United Nations,
produced by Anne Sloman and presented by James Naughtie, examines the
internal work of the UN and its capacity in the field. The first programme
(Thursday, repeated tomorrow) assessed the practical influence of
Boutros-Ghali on the UN. 'The end of the cold war,' he says, 'means the
democratisation of international relations, the new role of the United
Nations'. Boutros-Ghali is one of those recorded, civil and military, not
only on the 37th floor of the UN building in New York (where the Peacemaking
and Peacekeeping Departments are), but in Zagreb, Cambodia and Cyprus, with
occasional action-bites that emphasise the cleft between a decision and its
realisation on the ground. The Canadians arguing with Serbs in Pankracs, the
Royal Navy patrolling the Mekong River, the troops fighting boredom in
Cyprus, these stress the gap between UN decisions and work in the field.
Naughtie can be an ace reporter on his various expeditions, and does not
take sides - perhaps just as well. There is a written-in-advance feeling
throughout that is a handicap in a current-affairs piece. Two days before
the first programme went out, he had to report on the news that Prince
Sadruddin Aga-Khan thought the Bosnian activities reflected 'the worst
bungling since the end of the cold war', and that 'the moral foundations of
the UN were at stake', thoughts much unlike Boutros-Ghali's, though rather
like Lady Thatcher's.
The same disadvantage dogs Radio 4's six-part series Ice Cream to Eskimos,
that began last Saturday. This scans the troubles of advertising agencies
working on unpopular accounts, for the British Field Sports Association to
popularise fox-hunting, for NACRO to promote the employment of ex-prisoners,
and for CFW (Care for Family and Womanhood) against feminism and the
employment of women. In this first programme, we had the easy answers - the
fox is killed quickly; many ex-cons have no resources but valid skills;
women's abilities are better suited to the home than the police or the armed
forces.
Yet circumstances invade. Foxes, yes; but on Costing the Earth (Sunday, also
Radio 4) we had the slaughter of pilot-whales by the Faroese, also regarded
as a sport. Well, there are five more Saturdays for the arguments, which are
matters of opinion, not the politics of The Thin Blue Line. In a fortnight
we are to hear that the anti-feminism campaign has been relinquished, but no
casualties are reported.
Less amusingly unwell than Jeffrey Bernard lately, I spent about ten hours
with radio drama, of which I most enjoyed the start of Edith Wharton's The
Age of Innocence (Radio 4, Wednesday). The 1920 world of New York snobs
monitoring the progress of Newland (Andrew Wincott), newly engaged to sweet
young May (Cathryn Harrison) but in danger from fast Ellen Olenska (Suzanne
Bertish) is refreshingly unlike the romance of our own day, and Christopher
Reason's adaptation should sustain the novel's excitement if all six parts
are as good as this. David Hunter directs.

FT  17 APR 93 / How To Spend It: Chanel . . . the name to whisper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the big brand names Chanel is the one that has attracted the greatest
hoopla. In the late 1980s no fashion groupie went anywhere without her
quilted bag, with its overlapping double C motif, declaring her allegiance
to a special club. No-one was in doubt over the provenance of those
chain-handled handbags, braided jackets, gilt and pearl earrings and -
ultimate accolade of real cult status - an awareness of factories in Hong
Kong, Korea and Taiwan which churned out copies.
But what was there for the chaps? Where were the cult accessories for him?
Nowhere, so far as most of us knew. But lurking quietly on the shelves, all
this time, have been Chanel's own versions of that ubiquitous power symbol -
the motif tie. Every bit as well-made and desirable as other better-known
labels, it has been a strangely well-kept secret. A few women who went to
Chanel to shop for themselves noticed them and bought them. But, when it
came to ties, for a man to think of Chanel was almost unheard of.
All that may change now that word is getting out. Chanel ties are
recognisably in the familiar, traditional mood of the executive power-tie.
Just as other purveyors of neckwear to the board-room set have moved into
motif ties, so Chanel has its own offerings. This summer's motifs take in
old-fashioned toys, drums, racing-cars (sketched above), hot-air balloons,
as well as motifs from traditional English sports such as cricket, tennis
and football. New silk knitted ties (one of which is sketched here) come in
plains and stripes and sport the gold chain to keep them hanging straight
just like the jackets.
There are also several club stripes but no spots. Prices start at Pounds 55
for the silk motif ties and the knitted versions are Pounds 45. There are a
few, luxurious, expensive accessories all with essential Chanel touches -
washbags (sketched below, Pounds 230), wallets, credit-card holders and the
like.
All can be found at Chanel shops at 26 Old Bond Street, London W1 and 31
Sloane Street, London SW3.

Post sniffs fragrances fit for the most discerning noses

SOMETHING STRANGE has been happening to perfume. Where once public relations
blurb used to wax lyrical about green notes and oriental essences, today the
language has changed. The deconstructionists, having finished with clothes
are moving in on perfume.
Listen to Japanese designer Issey Miyake, talking about his own perfume,
L'Eau D'Issey, launched last year: 'For me the most beautiful perfume for a
woman is water. Water is like a surge of energy: it has upward positive
movement; spiritually it's more of a fountain than a trickle.' Well . . . er
. . . perhaps. But wouldn't it just be easier to bottle some spring water
and leave it at that?
Listen next to French designer, Jean-Paul Gaultier, darling of the French
Haute Boheme, whose first bottled elixir goes on sale in Harrods this week:
'It's one part dusty loose powder, like my grandmother wore - I think it was
old Coty; one part that smell you get when you are sitting in the front row
of the theatre - for me I think of going to the Chatelet when I was 12 - and
the curtain goes up, and the hot lights are on the costumes, wigs and sets,
and you breathe it all in; and, just to be modern, one part nail polish
remover.'
All very frank, very modern and very barrier-breaking but I cannot help
wondering whatever happened to jasmine and ambergris, to musk and tuberose,
to seductive nights and scented mornings, to romance and mystery ?
But, hark, what have we here? Jean-Paul Gaultier is on about eternity - you
will, I am sure, remember eternity, that staple of PR perfume utterances.
'Why hasn't he thought about it (ie creating a perfume) before?' asks the
blurb, 'For the sake of eternity,' comes the Delphic answer. Ah, but of
course.
Instead of water, Bulgari has drawn on the 'ancient Oriental tea culture and
the more profound sense of the rituals connected with it' for inspiration
for its new perfume, Eau Parfumee, Cologne au The Vert.
For a text it has taken some lines from Lin Yutang, a contemporary Chinese
writer: 'There is something in the essence of tea which guides one towards a
world of serene contemplation of life'. So there is and Eau Parfumee looks
as cool and green and serene as any Oriental tea ever did.
Kenzo has a more traditional source of inspiration - summer - for his latest
perfume which is just about to be launched. Kenzo, it seems, loves summer.
He sees it as a 'symbol of happiness, of openness to the world, of freedom
without end . . . ' an 'invitation to the pleasures of living in rare
communion with nature, celebrating the union of body, mind and sun.'
So Parfum D'Ete is 'A song to summer, his muse, his inspiration.' It 'dances
like a sunbeam, softly caressing the skin with a warm and fragrant wind.
Inside us, sun-filled, exhilarating pictures of summer come alive,
transporting us away from today towards gold, eternal fields.' Goodness, I
cannot wait.
Clearly, what we are seeing is a new mood in the traditional world of
perfume and this extends beyond the conception and the smell to the design
of the bottles.
Where once the talents of Baccarat and Lalique and great designers of the
day combined to produce bottles of lavish seductiveness, today's bottles
perfectly express the new mood in the world of perfume.
Issey Miyake's bottle, as befits the most intellectual of fashion designers,
is strong, sculptural, simple and clean. It exudes an air of purity and
strength. A slender, tapering, conical-shaped bottle (described as 'timeless
 -pure and flowing, just like water') of clear glass which allows the
perfume to be seen is finished by a 'silver' conical top.
Jean-Paul Gaultier's is a joky, funky, pink torso of a woman. It may look
absolutely 1990s but as new-age thoughts go this harks back to the 1930s and
1940s when many scent bottles, including a famous one by Schiaparelli, came
woman-shaped. But, as Jean-Paul Gaultier puts it: 'As it is a fragrance for
a woman it was obvious that the bottle ought to be woman shaped.'
The torso/bottle comes packaged in a slicked-up version of a tin-can which
has a ring-pull opener. Gaultier admits that there is a certain perverseness
at work here: 'Nobody before thought of a can as a classy packaging.' He
simply took a pair of scissors and cut up a tin can which he gave to a
jeweller to smooth down. The result, as Jean-Paul Gaultier must be
satisfactorily aware, is indubitably different.
The Bulgari bottle is - like the tea ceremony - all serenity. Clean - lined,
frosted glass reveals the cool pale green perfume and the classily simple
silver top is etched with the Bulgari name. Classic, timeless, elegant.
As for Kenzo, summer has clearly set him (and co-designer Serge Mansau) off.
We have a bottle of frosted glass shaped like a leaf with fine indentations
of leaf-veins, which comes in an aquamarine blue box imprinted faintly with
a sheaf of grasses bound with raffia.
Traditionalists can take heart, for all the new-age language, the talk of
breaking barriers and the hint of iconoclasm behind the designs all four of
these perfumes smell quite nice.
L'Eau d'Issey, for instance, is light, refined, and will never embarrass you
by shouting too loudly. Gaultier is bright pink but is richer, more sensuous
and could happily be worn to the grandest soiree. Bulgari smells of citrus
and if you go on sniffing 'the green tea essence,' so runs the blurb, 'is
slowly released to give one a truly refreshing feeling.'
As for Kenzo's oeuvre, it is hard to define: light but more floral than the
others, it, too, has the inestimable merit of being nice and quiet and
well-behaved. Not the sort that, like some of its transatlantic cousins,
would knock out all other contenders in an olfactory contest.
Prices: L'Eau D'Issey, is Pounds 68 for 15 ml of the Extract, Pounds 32.50
for 50 ml of the Eau de Toilette Spray and there is a range of body lotions,
creams, gels and soaps as well. Major stores and selected chemists and
perfumeries.
Jean-Paul Gaultier, Pounds 90 for 30 ml of Extract, Pounds 32.50 for 50 ml
of Eau de Toilette. Available for the next four weeks at Harrods and after
at selected stores and perfumeries.
Bulgari's Eau Parfumee is Pounds 140 for 350 ml and is available exclusively
in Bulgari's London shops at 172 New Bond Street and at Harvey Nichols,
Sloane Street, London SW1.
Kenzo's Parfum D'Ete is Pounds 47.50 for 7.5 ml of Extract Natural Spray and
Pounds 32 for 50 ml of Eau de Toilette. Available exclusively from Harrods
from May 17.

AS A RELIEF from all those teetering wedge and platform-heeled shoes that
the fashion pundits would have us don this summer, I offer Keds as my
contribution to foot welfare.
Keds have long been a cult shoe in the US, but in the UK they are only just
beginning to be well-known.
Keds have lots of things going for them, not least is price. The most
expensive versions - in soft Nubuck leather - are Pounds 39.95 a pair and
the least expensive - the canvas and denim range - are just Pounds 19.95. At
these sort of prices it is possible to build up a small collection to go
with every outfit.
Apart from the price, Keds are also welcome because the range, leather and
canvas alike, is completely machine-washable and machine dryable, too.
Informal, insouciant, practical and fun, canvas Keds are not the shoes to
wear to formal functions but are great for wearing around the house or for
doing the shopping or teaming with summer day-clothes.
The leather versions, which also have no heel, are slightly more formal in
feel and could be teamed with the new, long skirts.
In the canvas range, the Champion Oxfords are in all the fashionable, useful
colours such as black, grey, khaki, white, navy and red. Then there are also
tartans and denims, plain and flowered patterns. For the really young and
funky there are also glittery versions in bronze, gunmetal grey and silver.
There is also now a new finish which Keds calls 'Sandwashed Silk' though it
is important to note that they are not made of silk - the name is derived
from the fact that the finish is silk-like in feel.
These come in a range of colours (including summery colours such as pale
green, butter yellow, navy and red) and cost Pounds 24.95 a pair.
The shoes are widely available at branches of Carvela and Russell &amp; Bromley.
If anyone has any difficulty in tracking down a local stockist they could
ring Shoon, the distributors, on 0458-834019 where Ruth Staple, who is in
charge of Customer Service, will do her best to help.
Photographed above is a small selection from the canvas range.

FT  17 APR 93 / Fashion: Never wear your Barbour to shop at Peter Jones -
The rights and wrongs of rural attire / Dressing for the Professions, The
Country Set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH have a greater nostalgia for a vanished rural past than any
other nation. Dreams of Arcadia, Mother Nature, Merrie England, images and
fantasies of rustic simplicity, bucolic innocence, sylvan peace and pastoral
purity pervade UK art and literature. Immersed in an overwhelmingly urban
culture, Britons all crave a slice of the country.
But where once their aspirations may have focused on the artless peasant
plainness of the unaffected cottage with roses round the door, in recent
years their focus has shifted upwards towards the manor house of the country
gentleman. They yearn to be there in the setting of the PG Wodehouse caper,
the Agatha Christie plot, the television dynastic saga. And so well have
they been able to study its ambiance, its mores, its rituals and its clothes
that they feel they know just how to fit in. Indeed, funded by the new
riches of the 1980s, many tried. But many failed. And it was often their
clothes that left them on the outside, peering in.
'Clothes in the country,' says Ewa Lewis, the social editor of Tatler
magazine, 'are really all about suitability and practicality. It may look as
if an arcane set of rules applies but, really, it is to do with the work of
the countryside, the fact that life is inevitably led as much outdoors as in
and that, therefore, you have rough terrain and real weather to deal with.
'So, looking wrong can happen in two ways. You can wear clothes which are
unsuitable because they are impractical - leather jeans, spiky high heels,
fabrics you can't wash the mud off - or because they are in the wrong mood:
too formal, too glossy, too city-glamorous. You can also earn the derision
of the country set by wearing what they see as working gear in the town.'
Nigel Hadden-Paton, born to the country, snorts in agreement: 'You could
always tell a yuppie by the fact that he wore his Barbour for shopping at
Peter Jones.' Bumble, his wife, adds: 'And by his white socks. And by his
girlfriend's taste for stilettos worn with trousers - my pet hate.'
Barbara Daly - who, with husband Laurence Tarlo, is a transplanted townie -
says: 'You instinctively go for the functional and relaxed, rotating your
London wardrobe down to the country when it starts to date. The only time I
have felt out of place is when I have worn a short skirt or a tight body or
one of my sharp suits or something in the evening that is too sparkly, too
revealing or too glam.'
Nigel and Bumble Hadden-Paton live at Rossway Park in Hertfordshire, a
handsome Victorian house in 1,220 acres of which 620 acres are under the
plough. Nigel is reducing this every year as he returns more of it to
woodland and parkland in order to extend the game crop and his hospitality
events business.
A former officer in the Blues and Royals, he says: 'When I left the army
after 13 years and Bumble and I took over the estate, it seemed to me I had
a choice. I could, at 35 and with two children, take myself off to
agricultural college and learn to farm; or I could retain our farm manager,
who knows exactly what he's doing, and find some way of being able to afford
him.'
Using the house and park for conferences and corporate entertainment - a
day's shooting is very good for bonding an executive team - proved the
answer.
For the landed gentry, opening their doors to outsiders is, increasingly,
the best way to retain a much-loved but expensive-to-maintain family home.
It exploits gently that yearning for access which the rest of us share.
Nigel's strong selling line in his small brochure is Rossway's 'feeling of
calm and serenity which restore a sense of balance and perspective amid the
pressure and hurly-burly of everyday life.'
It is not just a line, though. As you enter Rossway's tiled and pillared
hall with its speadeagled tiger skin (the animal was shot by Nigel's father
in 1956), glassy-eyed stags' heads and welcoming fire, you can almost hear
the calls of house guests greeting each other in excited anticipation of a
jolly weekend of rural sport, large meals, and many changes of clothes. It
was a style of life with which the rest of the world has, retrospectively
and thanks largely to movies and Ralph Lauren, fallen in love.
The grand English country house style reached its apogee in Edwardian times,
due in large part to the expanding railway network bringing weekend guests
'down' quickly and comfortably and bearing them away again before they
became boring.
It flourished through the 1920s and '30s and was maintained stalwartly
through the 1950s and '60s with a smaller staff, fewer courses and warmer
clothes. But it declined through the 1980s as mass entertaining became too
expensive and difficult logistically because of the problems of getting
domestic help.
'Of course,' says Bumble, 'it is still nice to have a party for the weekend
and we still do it, but it is much more informal these days. In the summer,
for instance, we usually have supper in the kitchen. Nor do you need an
elaborate wardrobe. Or, in any sense, a 'correct' wardrobe. You just don't
do all that changing any longer, and country people are much less
husky-and-green wellingtons than they used to be.
'If we are dressing in the evening, it is more likely to be a half-change
where the men wear a smoking jacket and trews with velvet or needlepoint
slippers, and the women can pass in almost anything as long as they look as
if they have made an effort.'
Running the house as a business has modified Bumble's wardrobe. 'I have to
have some clothes which are smart in a country way. The wonderful thing
about the past few years is designers like Paul Costelloe, Mulberry and
Nicole Farhi who understand the country and produce excellent clothes which
are sturdy, stylish and timeless. High fashion just does not look right.'
Nevertheless, much of her life with Nigel and their four children is lived
out of doors. When not on hospitality duty, she tends to live in corduroy
breeches.
'When we were clearing out the maids' rooms upstairs, I found a pair of
coachman's breeches which fitted me perfectly. When I wanted a replacement,
I asked Nigel's tailor, who quoted me Pounds 400 to make them. So, next time
we went back to Cyprus - where we were once stationed - on holiday, I took
them to Mr Osman in Nicosia who copied them perfectly. I have several pairs
now.'
'Neither of us,' says Nigel, 'is really a jeans person. My working clothes
are my holiest jersey, scruffiest boots and a Viyella shirt. My father
always wore breeches, stockings, brown shoes, a shirt, a tie, a moleskin
waistcoat, a tweed jacket and, if it rained, a Barbour. Even for tying the
woods] Even when dealing with the clients, I tend to wear just a slightly
smarter version of my workwear. That's politeness.
'It would be ridiculous for me to climb into a tweed suit just because I
might think that's what they expected. We're not running a theme park, after
all.'
Ewa Lewis says: 'If there is a point to dressing correctly for the country,
it is under-dressing. And the level of conformity required varies from
county to county. If you misjudge it in Gloucestershire, Berkshire or
Hampshire, it is not going to be as noticeable as it would be in
Lincolnshire.
'I have noticed, too, that while town imports may ape country work-wear
during the day, they make no concessions in the evening. This means that, in
their fashionable outfits, they tend rather to outshine the country ladies
in their black velvet skirts and frilly white blouses.
'But I doubt if anybody really notices unless they have to be carried across
the puddles from the Land-Rover because their shoes are non-functional.
That's when you look silly.'
Lewis dismisses the widely-held belief that country folk like to affect
scruffiness as an aspect of a cultivated eccentricity. 'The upper middle
class squirearchy may, indeed, aim to look as battered as possible but,
although most country people's kit may be old, it is always impeccably
maintained.'
'The rule,' says Bumble Hadden-Paton, 'is no self-conscious dressing up. No
wafting around like something out of a Ralph Lauren ad. Apart from that, you
dress for practicality and to look as nice as possible.'

FT  17 APR 93 / Fishing: Mayfly make me mad - Tom Fort thinks you can have
too much of a good thing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MY dry fly apprenticeship, I displayed all the characteristic intolerance
of youth towards the mayfly. On the stretch of the upper Kennet which I then
fished, the insect did not appear. Nor would it have been in the least bit
welcome if it had. We much preferred our modest hatches of well mannered
olives and delicate pale wateries. Our view of the mayfly carnival was akin
to that of monks hearing reports of Roman orgies.
I no longer fish the upper Kennet, so crystalline and lovely in those days,
before it was stricken by drought. I have moved down river, to a fishery on
which the mayfly hatches in abundance. And my snooty attitude towards it has
been necessarily modified.
A good deal of the old prejudice does survive. I cannot help thinking that
there is something gross and undignified about the mayfly season, which is
an affront to notions of fly fishing as the most refined and graceful of
pastimes.
Partly, it is the behaviour of the fish. We like to think of trout as
reasonably discriminating creatures, which help themselves in moderation at
Nature's table, and examine our imitations with a critical eye. But all this
goes out of the window with the arrival of ephemera danica. Gluttony and
piggishness rule in the frenzy to swallow as many of these fat, luscious
titbits as possible. Our chalkstream trout become like schoolboys who find
the tuckshop left unlocked.
The scale of the hatch is also over the top, provoking excess succeeded by
biliousness and torpor. The fish, stuffed to their gills, circle
dyspeptically to the bottom, contemptuous of anything as puny as a trickle
of olives.
'If only', one exclaims irritably as one surveys the unbroken surface in
early July, 'if only Nature would organise matters more sensibly. Why could
not the mayfly be supplied little and often, rather than in one colossal
binge?'
A hatch of fly should be an unassuming affair. It should not blot out the
sun, obscure the meadow, form a hovering cloud over the river. The fisherman
does not really wish to have huge insects settling on his ears, festooning
his hat, creeping across the lenses of his spectacles. Nor, if he has any
sensibility, does he care to see his favourite river transformed into the
aquatic equivalent of the classic French film about gastronomic frenzy, La
Grande Bouffe.
I am, of course, overstating my case. The scenes of abandon I have described
are hardly the norm. And when they do occur, they tend to involve fisheries
recently stocked with large numbers of greedy, simple-minded trout whose
ingrained instincts of caution and common sense are nullified by the
transfer from stewpond to river. There was, for instance, a day on the Test
last year, when the water heaved and a discarded toenail would have brought
a rise.
On stillwaters, the mayfly hatch is likely to be as maddening as any other.
I am thinking of the great Irish lakes, such as Corrib, where more often
than not the surging hope which attends the start of the mayfly day is
transformed into despair by the time a fishless evening is reached.
I am also quite unjustifiably blackening the reputation of the insect
itself. It is a lovely and fascinating creature, and I am well aware that
its appearance is one of the wonders of the angler's year. Who am I to
denigrate it, and the sport in inspires in these harsh times?
What, above all, quickens the heart about the mayfly season is the matter of
BIG fish. It is the time par excellence when the disciplined angler can put
aside thoughts of quantity and may reasonably pursue the dream of the
monster. It is the time at which the five and six pounders which one has
been told exist actually offer proof of the fact. It is a time for putting
oneself to the test.
I confess now that I have done so - and I have failed. The memory of the
episode is still painful, but they say that self exposure is part of the
healing process, so I shall relate the tale.
There is a sidestream which leaves the lower Kennet by some hatches and
rejoins it some distance downstream. On its meandering journey it is
connected to a lake, which a few years ago was home to a few, very large,
wild brown trout. In the mysterious way of the mayfly, it hatched on the
stream but not on the lake. So, when the hatch was at its height, the
leviathans would move into the stream to feast.
I spotted one feeding beneath a tangled gorse bush. There were sucking
sounds and ripples of a character calculated to promote panic and
incompetence.
The luxuriance of the surrounding vegetation made normal casting impossible.
On my knees, I thrust the end of my rod through the thicket, and lowered a
French partridge on to the water. It travelled slowly into the monster's
lair, and there was a noise like a wet kiss. I tightened, and thereafter the
drama was played out at paralysing speed.
The fish went upstream, turned, headed past me, dived, broke me; and I never
even got off my knees. Trembling and panting, like a mountaineer at high
altitude, I stumbled away.
A little later, I bumped into the keeper and recounted the terrible story.
He endeavoured to console me by telling me that he had seen this fish, or
enough of it, to estimate its weight at eight pounds. He did not think it it
was possible to land such a creature in such a spot.
I am a few years older now, and I still have not caught a chalkstream trout
half the size of the one I lost that afternoon. But the giants are still
there, which is why, come the end of the month, I shall be prowling the
river bank, apologising to mayfly and trout for having been so rude about
them, and hoping against hope for a chance to make amends.

FT  17 APR 93 / Brazil goes nuts for a new king: Christina Lamb meets three
'royals' as the country votes on whether to restore the monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EIGHTY-year-old man with caterpillar eyebrows, bushy moustache and a
floppy felt hat, living in a candy pink and white palace in the mountains
above Rio de Janeiro and speaking Portuguese with a thick French accent, Dom
Pedro Gastao de Orleans e Braganca seems an unlikely threat to the Brazilian
republic. But the great grandson of the country's last emperor, together
with a radical right-wing recluse and a former surfer, is one of three
eccentric candidates campaigning for Brazilians to vote for the restoration
of the monarchy in a bizarre plebiscite on Wednesday.
Dismissed by most politicians as 'maluco' or crazy, the so-called 'royal
option' is drawing astonishing support from Brazilians fed up with a
presidential republic which has left Latin America's biggest country with
the world's worst income distribution, 1,500 per cent annual inflation and
rampant corruption.
Only one elected president has completed a mandate in the past 65 years, the
rest opting out through suicide or resignation, dying before taking office,
forced out by military coups or impeached, as in the case of the last
President Fernando Collor. By contrast, the 67-year-long monarchy, cut short
in 1889, is regarded as a golden era of stability and glory.
After a century of prohibition of monarchist politics, tell-tale gold crown
lapel pins are being sported by public figures as diverse as Paulo Protasio,
the head of Rio's Chamber of Commerce, Mario Henrique Simonsen, a
conservative former finance minister, Sandra de Sa, a left-wing folk singer
and Dona Neuma, the first lady of Rio's oldest samba school.
'It's a natural choice for a country where social groups and events such as
carnival always use 'king' to refer to something good and dignified,' says
Roberto da Matta, one of Brazil's best-known sociologists and himself a
monarchist. But the chances of Brazil reverting to its ancient title of
kingdom are being weakened by a split in the House of Braganca, the
Brazilian royal family. At the last count, there are a dozen imperial
relatives with claims on the throne and little in common except for the
Braganca name and bright blue eyes.
Of the three leading contenders, Dom Pedro is the most senior member of the
family and most direct descendant of the last emperor, Dom Pedro II. He
divides his time between Seville in Spain and Brazil's royal winter capital
of Petropolis, where he lives surrounded by oil paintings of his ancestors
in a palace that used to be the emperor's guest house. Riding horseback
along the cobbled streets, where he has long been a tourist attraction, Dom
Pedro is also a popular figure among locals, who shout 'Long live the king]'
as he passes.
'It is not that I am asking to be king but if it is my duty to save my
people then I will,' says Dom Pedro, in between complaining about the
difficulty of finding blacksmiths to shoe his English thoroughbred.
Stressing that 'a monarch should protect his people against the government,'
Dom Pedro refers to his nephew, Spain's King Juan Carlos, as providing who
an 'extraordinary example'.
Dom Pedro denies that monarchy would be a step back, asking: 'Is there a
greater example of modernity than Japan, one of the most traditional
monarchies in the world?' But his claim is jeopardised by the fact that his
father renounced his rights to the then-defunct throne in 1908 in order to
marry a Czech countess of non-royal lineage.
His most serious rival is his cousin, 54-year-old Dom Luiz, whom Dom Pedro
describes as 'a crazy fanatic who thinks going to the beach is a sin.' The
oldest of 12 brothers, Dom Luiz is a member of a right-wing militant group
called Tradition, Family, Property, which allegedly lit candles in support
of military dictatorships in the 1960s and '70s.
Although he ventures rarely from his modest apartment in Sao Paulo, Dom Luiz
promises to break his vow of chastity and marry 'if it is necessary to
produce heirs.' His eloquent lawyer brother, Dom Bertrand, who acts as his
spokesman, says: 'The republic has brought nothing but political chaos and
economic decadence. Under the monarchy, we were a first-world country with
the world's second telephone and postage systems.'
He claims that monarchy would be a cheap option for Brazil, and says: 'The
running of (Britain's) Buckingham Palace costs only 20 per cent of Brazil's
presidential palace running costs.'
The most active candidate is 38-year-old Dom Joao Henrique, Dom Pedro's
favourite nephew. Known as Little Prince Johnny, the glamorous former beach
bum has swapped his surfing gear for European suits, and riding the waves of
Bali for a hectic programme of talk shows and speeches. A regular figure in
Rio's social columns, Dom Joao runs a hotel, the prince's guesthouse, and is
a leading environmental photographer.
Surrounded by royal memorabilia in his rented sea-front flat, where ancient
leather-bound tomes jostle with modern art and jazz books, Dom Joao argues:
'The system is totally rotten. Even if you put an honest man in the
presidency, it will not work because the president is elected and prisoner
of political parties and economic interest groups. A king, by contrast, is
impartial.'
He adds: 'Restoring the monarchy will not achieve immediate miracles, such
as reducing inflation or making food appear in the mouths of the hungry
millions, but at least it would give stabilisation.'
Were the royal option to prevail in the plebiscite, it would be left to the
nation's congress to decide on who should be crowned - and it is there that
Dom Joao's chance lies. Several political parties have already asked him to
run for senator or congressman. But the mere fact that a big industrial
country should, in the 1990s, even be contemplating restoring a monarchy
that was unseated more than a century ago reflects tremendous disillusion
with the present system.
Public disgruntlement has increased in recent months as those named in the
Collorgate corruption scandal continue to stay free to enjoy their wealth,
Meanwhile, the new president, Itamar Franco, has got through a record three
finance ministers in six months.
With so many other problems to tackle, and a largely illiterate population,
the farcical nature of the plebiscite was highlighted by an poll last week
which found that 52 per cent of those questioned did not understand what
they were voting for. Apart from choosing between monarchy and
republicanism, Brazil's 90m voters must also decide between
parliamentarianism and presidentialism, begging the question of what would
happen if they vote for both presidentialism and monarchy. The level of
confusion is illustrated by Marcia, the cleaner of the Financial Times'
Brazil office, who says: 'I am going to vote for the king as president.'

FT  17 APR 93 / Jeepers - how about those creepers?: Stuart Marshall gets
dirty, just like the settlers of old, taking the Rubicon Trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WOMAN in red perched on the rocky outcrop like an overweight Lorelei.
Before her, a seemingly endless line of four-wheel drive vehicles taking
part in the Jeepers' Jamboree inched their way laboriously up a smooth
granite slope as steep as the roof of a house.
'Jeeping,' she remarked, in one of those turbocharged American voices that
can be heard in the next county, 'is creeping, and walking is quicker.'
She was absolutely right.
The fastest way of covering the worst 15 miles of the Rubicon Trail would
certainly be on foot. 'Jeepers' is the generic term for people who
rough-ride for pleasure in four-wheel drive vehicles that are mostly, but
not exclusively, Jeeps. The Rubicon Trail is to Jeepers what Cowes is to
yachtsmen or Wimbledon to tennis players. It starts at Georgetown,
California, and goes east to the shore of Lake Tahoe, rising to just over
7,100 ft (2,185 m) at its highest point.
It begins innocuously because much of the 71 miles (114 kms) is on paved
country roads. The going gets difficult enough for four-wheel drive to be
desirable at Loon Lake, which is only eight miles - but four hours driving -
from Rubicon Springs. A few hundred yards further on and four-wheel drive is
essential.
The Oxford Dictionary defines a trail as 'a path or track worn by the
passage of persons travelling in a wild or uninhabited region'. That sums it
up perfectly. The region through which the Rubicon Trail passes is wild. You
may spot brown bears if you are lucky, though all I saw were dozens of paw
marks in the mud. It is also uninhabited and consequently quite unspoiled.
Commercial logging is out of the question. The tall pines that find living
space between the granite masses grow, die and and rot where they have
fallen.
It was Indian country before white men first went in with packhorses in
1844. Later, engineers dreamed of a wooden tunnel to pipe water from Lake
Tahoe (altitude 6,229 ft, or 1,917 metres) to San Francisco, 200 miles (334
kms) away. It came to nothing.
When mineral water was found at Rubicon Springs in the 1880s, health freaks
beat a path there. Wagon loads of timber were eventually hauled in to build
a hotel which operated until the 1920s. Guests arrived first by
coach-and-four and later by 10-passenger Pierce Arrow motor car.
Even though the trail was then regularly maintained, it must have been an
appalling journey. Perhaps that was why the hotel failed in the 1920s. Years
later, the building collapsed under heavy snows. There is now no sign it was
ever there.
The Rubicon Trail reverted to the wild. Snow shuts it from November to June
and the thaw brings floods which wash down new rock piles and create fresh
mudholes. Every year, the lie of the land as seen by a Jeeper changes. When
I joined the Jeepers' Jamboree and drove the Rubicon in an open Jeep
Wrangler, windscreen folded on the bonnet, much of the trail was like the
bed of a mountain torrent. Which, of course, in winter is what it is.
It was the 40th Anniversary Jamboree last year. More than 1,500 people from
across the US had converged there, driving and riding in 500 vehicles. It is
rated the most difficult American off-road event open to all comers. There
are no prizes. Simply to get into Rubicon Springs, camp overnight, enjoy a
noisy and uninhibited party and get out again with the vehicle in one piece
is reckoned to be reward enough.
Half a ton of New York steaks, sufficient beer to stock a large pub, a
generator-powered sound system and, because this is the US, a grand piano
had been airlifted in, slung in nets under a helicopter. Every piece of
litter that could not be burned on a huge bonfire was picked up and carted
out again. Part of the Jeepers' code is to leave the wilderness as they find
it.
That night, as I crawled filthy and unwashed into a pup tent, I had a
thought. If the hotel had still been there, it could have made a fortune
selling hot showers at whatever price it cared to name. As it was, staying
dirty seemed the lesser of two evils. The only way to clean up was to
clamber down to a cold, snake-infested river.
Recreational off-road driving is really the mechanised equivalent of trail
riding on horseback. The Rubicon Trail is its pinnacle but at four-wheel
driving's broad base, thousands of American families climb aboard their
vehicles every year and head for the wilder areas of their vast country.
Some go on their own, others in convoy with a few other vehicles. They take
tents, sleeping bags, plenty of food and water, petrol and oil. Plus, if
they are wise, essential spare parts, some tools, a jack, an axe, shovel,
towrope and CB radio.
But is going cross country on four wheels the soft option?
Compared with hiking or mountain biking - and I saw people doing both - I
suppose it is. As for riding the Rubicon, I would not have risked a
half-decent horse on the harsh, boulder-strewn terrain. I could see no signs
of anyone having done so.
Driving a Jeep has to be less physically taxing than using muscle power but
it certainly is not easy. A week afterwards bruises traced the seatbelt's
line across my body. The technique of driving across country as rough as the
worst parts of the Rubicon Trail is to do everything very slowly indeed. If
you tried to go quickly, you would smash the vehicle, an ugly prospect in a
remote area.
In four-wheel drive with the transmission in low range, a Jeep Wrangler's
4-litre engine has power enough at tickover to let it clamber over rocks the
size of cabin trunks. If a boulder looks surmountable, you drive the Jeep's
wheels over it. Never let the rock get under the vehicle. If you do, the
axles ride up and you are stranded, wheels spinning in the air.
Defiles of V-shape with a floor narrower than the Jeep's track are driven
through with the sidewalls of the tyres wedged against the rock. It is cruel
treatment for a tyre but the oversized Goodyear radials took it in their
stride, as they did everything else.
The Jeep Wrangler I used had automatic transmission which meant ignoring a
cardinal rule of off-roading. This is to keep your foot off the brake pedal
when going downhill and let the drag of the engine, equally distributed to
all four wheels by the transmission, control your speed.
But automatics, unlike 4x4s with manual gearboxes, tend to run away even
when locked in low-range first gear so now and again slight braking was
essential. It worked on the ultra-rough but basically grippy rock but would
have been a recipe for disaster on the muddy hillsides European four-wheel
drivers are used to.
The Jeep, I am glad to say, is well protected underneath. However carefully
I drove there was the odd crash and bang as the steel plates armouring the
engine and transmission came into contact with boulders. But nothing broke.
None of the 20-strong British team had any mechanical mishaps or, even more
remarkably, any tyre trouble.
Four-wheel driving in wild areas is a potentially controversial activity. In
the Lake Tahoe area, the authorities and local people take a generally
tolerant view. But not all approve. One of the toughest and roughest
sections of the traditional Rubicon route was out of action last year.
Militant objectors had used explosives to bring down tons of rocks and block
the trail. The alternative route, though, could not have been much less
testing than the original.
The Forest Service of the US Department of Agriculture insists on managing
off-road driving and has authorised the use of off-highway vehicles (OHVs)
only on certain listed trails, the Rubicon included.
It lays down a number of conditions which it says must be observed if the
sport-cum-recreation is to have a future. This says: Tread only where
motorised vehicles are permitted; Respect the rights of others to enjoy
their activities undisturbed; Educate yourself on OHV rules and regulations;
Avoid meadows, wildlife, livestock and private property; Drive responsibly
to protect the environment and preserve opportunities to drive on public
land.
It was all very different 40 years ago when Mark A Smith organised the first
Jeepers' Jamboree. Then, more or less anything went. But, as the sport
became more popular and numbers of vehicles increased, so did an awareness
that the environment was fragile and had to be protected.
Smith stepped down as 'Jeepmaster' after last year's Jamboree but says he
will retire from four-wheel driving 'probably when I die.' Now into his late
sixties, he looks as rugged as the Jeeps he loves, and good for many years
of off-road driving to come.
If the participants in the 1992 Rubicon Trail Jamboree were anything to go
by, Jeeping is a sport that mainly attracts the middle aged and over. Most
couples in their 20s and 30s are probably too busy bringing up families to
go four-wheel driving into the wild blue yonder. In any case, a wilderness
is hardly the place to take young children.
But when the call to that great off-road driving course in the sky finally
comes, several Jeepers have chosen to be laid to rest in the land they loved
to bang and crash about over.
What look like their graves (actually, it is where their ashes were
scattered) can be seen at one side of the Rubicon Trail. Headgear ranging
from baseball hats to Stetsons was doffed by last year's participants as
they lurched by, already dreaming of this year's event.

FT  17 APR 93 / Property: Shute first and worry later - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHUTE HOUSE near Shaftesbury, Dorset, is somewhere I could move at once.
Mainly Georgian, it combines rural relaxation with urban sophistication and
has an unusual sense of the garden coming right inside.
Step outside and you see what a garden it is - one of the greatest of the
20th century in England. Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe designed it to be an integral
part of the countryside. Thanks to having the river Nadder rise there, he
achieved a rare harmony by creating a spectacular set of ponds, canals and
streams.
Everywhere, you hear the sound of running water. In the main water garden,
designed like Moghul gardens in India, the small falls make different tones
as the water runs through. The ponds reflect plantings that survive only if
they delight the eye - the camellias are a joy. It is an architectural
garden, using statues, earthenware jars and topiary in box and yew to
reinforce a magical blend of man and nature. If I had Pounds 1.25m, I would
call Savills (0722-320 422) right away.
Halkin Gate House off Belgrave Square, London SW1, is totally urban and
provides a chance to peep into the life of the super-rich. Two town cottages
with a grand facade have become a splendid house of impressive workmanship.
A new second floor holds a huge master bedroom suite, with the shower tucked
into the angle of the roof, and the basement has been dug out to take a
swimming pool large enough for doing proper lengths. De Groot Collis
(071-235 8090) offers the house at over Pounds 6.5m for a lease ending on
Christmas Day 2050.
The Property Misdescriptions Act has now been in force for two weeks and
already it has caused a fine stir among agents who are having to tone down
their purple prose and be as quick to mention minuses - the disco next door
or the motorway at the bottom of the garden - as they always have been with
the pluses. False or misleading statements can lead to Pounds 5,000 fines.
It is far too early to see how the act will work and what attitudes local
trading standards officers will take. But it should inhibit rogue agents and
help buyers by letting them know the snags before they make long journeys to
inspect properties. Reputable firms have little to fear, provided they can
show they have acted with due diligence. In the longer run, though, sales
particulars may reduce to little more than a list of rooms and their sizes,
and the make of the boiler.
Owners should not throw away receipts for improvements, repairs or
maintenance (including for leaseholders' service charges or rent for common
gardens or tennis court) as the estate agents may ask to see them one day if
you decide to sell.
Easter marked the start of the season for visiting stately homes. A useful
guide to what is open and when - covering houses anywhere from Bantry, Co.
Cork, Ireland, via Spencer House, London SW1, to the Queen's at Sandringham,
Norfolk - is the Historic House Directory 1993 (Pounds 7.95) prepared by
Norman Hudson of the Historic Houses Association. Its information includes
advice for couriers and coach drivers, which will help those organising
groups: Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, for instance, lays on meal
vouchers, a rest room and television for drivers. The directory also lists
properties where you can stay as a paying guest, those that are now hotels,
and houses that can manage corporate entertaining and other special events.

FT  17 APR 93 / Property: Suddenly, life on the farm is attractive again -
Gerald Cadogan discovers that the economic clouds over agriculture now have
some silver linings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN

<DATELINE>
   BLACK Wednesday
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
September 16 1992 - brought UK farmers an unexpected bonanza. Sterling's
fall against the European Currency Unit (Ecu) brought them windfall gains in
the 'green pounds' which are paid by the European Community under the Common
Agricultural Policy for farm support and premiums.
Then there was the low price of land (down 60 per cent in real terms over
the past 13 years, says estate agent Savills), halved interest rates, and a
realisation of just how generous were last year's changes in inheritance tax
(IHT) relief for farms. Suddenly, agriculture was looking attractive again.
Farm land now costs roughly Pounds 1,000-1,500 an acre (with the best silt
land up to Pounds 2,500). The farmer receives the newly-enhanced payments
for what he produces and can benefit from other money-generating schemes. He
might, for instance, 'set aside' 15 per cent of his arable acreage and
receive around Pounds 106 an acre a year, the precise amount depending on
the Ecu exchange rate. (He must, however, rotate that 15 per cent and,
sooner or later, will have to set aside his best land).
Among other spurs, the government's farm woodland schemes pay well and
encourage planting broad-leaved trees rather than conifers. There is even a
Hedgerow Incentive Scheme which, ironically, pays Pounds 1.50-2.50 a metre
for replacing hedges when, 20 years ago, farmers got grants to take them
out. And the interest rate cuts - provided they are maintained for a long
time - are a big help, as farmers rely on overdrafts to smooth their
seasonal business.
As for IHT, the 1992 Budget brought 100 per cent relief for farms in hand if
they have been occupied for two years. (For tenanted farms, the relief is 50
per cent). It is hard to think of a greater stimulus, especially as using
contractors to do the work still counts as farming in hand. Businessmen
considering farming will welcome this arrangement. So will working farmers
thinking of retirement; they can pay someone else to do the slog without IHT
worries.
That there was any farm market at all last year is significant. Strutt &amp;
Parker, for instance, bought and sold 67,000 acres in 144 transactions. The
sellers had had enough of high interest rates and the struggle to make a
profit. Most of the buyers were other farmers, often those who had pulled
out of the market in the 1980s (when businessmen channelling money into
farms pushed up the prices) and saw a chance to round off their holdings
while land was cheap and they had some money. Indeed, farmers who have
survived the past two years have done well; the Ministry of Agriculture
estimates that their incomes rose 24 per cent in 1992.
Buying land still looks attractive, and prices have hardly gone up. Why?
James Laing, of Strutt &amp; Parker, explains: 'There is uncertainty ahead,
including what will happen when the green pound is re-set in July.' He has
just sold all but one in a portfolio of nine farms around the country for
Refuge Assurance, which regards them now as non-core investments. But the
green pound might not suffer that much, although the sceptical are hedging
against the Ecu or selling their crops forward to lock into present rates.
Nicholas Leeming, of Humberts, points out: 'The farming lobbies of France
and Germany are pretty vociferous. Levels will be set to suit them.' That
will suit UK farmers equally.
A substantial increase in land prices is unlikely unless supply cannot match
the increasing demand. And although there are potential long-term bear
factors - such as a rise in Hungarian cereal production, forecast by
Savills' Bertie Ross - the future looks rosier than for a long time. Laing
suggests that a businessman wanting to invest should probably go for an
arable acreage because it is 'simpler and less risk.'
Farms are available everywhere, with prices that include the farmhouse and
outbuildings (although there is a shortage of large estates). And some make
money from activities other than simple agriculture. Newton farm in Fife,
Scotland, is one such. Close to St Andrews and Leuchars station for
Edinburgh and London, and on offer from Strutt &amp; Parker in Edinburgh at over
Pounds 500,000 for the main farm of 494 acres, it has a clay pigeon shoot,
an off-road driving course for 4 X 4 enthusiasts (Pounds 12 an hour), and a
trout loch that produced Pounds 38,600 in 1992.
Cardwell farm, near Holbeach in Lincolnshire, grows cereals and vegetables
on grade one silt land three miles south of The Wash. It is so productive
that it does not need ancillary businesses and Savills offers its 990 acres
as a whole for Pounds 2.3m, or in 10 lots. The same agent is selling a let
estate of 599 acres at Bishopsthorpe, near Grimsby, for over Pounds 450,000.
This comprises the more usual grade two and three land and produces rent of
Pounds 29,315 a year.
In rich country near Evesham, Gloucestershire, Hoden farm is just 194 acres
of arable (although formerly a dairy unit). Charles R. Phillips is looking
for around Pounds 300,000. Firs farm at Farnborough, near Banbury,
Oxfordshire, is a 211-acre mixed operation on offer through Howkins &amp;
Harrison for around Pounds 500,000.
Just on the market - for the first time in 60 years - is Snitterfield fruit
farm near Stratford-upon-Avon with 162 acres, 85 of them orchards and 16 for
pick-your-own soft fruit. Four cold stores holding 50 tonnes apiece keep the
produce fresh. The farm has been split into lots but the total guide price
is around Pounds 580,000 (from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley).
In Powys, Wales Phillips is selling Bron-Rhydd, in the hills near Llanwrtyd
Wells, for Pounds 450-500,000. It has 530 acres for sheep and cattle. In
south-west England, Strutt &amp; Parker in Exeter offers Stream farm at
Broomfield, near Taunton, in one or two lots - totalling 222 mixed acres -
for around Pounds 475,000. Last year, the owners opened a two-acre lake for
fishing rainbow trout at a charge of Pounds 1-1.50 a day - which included
two fish to take home.

FT  17 APR 93 / Motoring: Racing that's hard to beat - How to put the fun
back into driving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROADS get more crowded and stressful every month, holiday weekend
tailbacks are awful and driving a car really is not much fun any more.
Right? Well, yes. For most of the time, motoring is something one has to do
to carry on a normal business and social life. The modern motor car -
refined, reliable, comfortable and safe - is easy and effortless to drive.
But fun? Surely not? And the Queen's highway is no place to have fun on. It
is there to let you and me and about 24m other drivers go from A to B and
back again without inconveniencing, frightening or banging into one another.
For fun, you must get off the road. Off-road is usually taken to mean across
country but it also covers private circuits. On both, you can enjoy yourself
without breaking laws or putting anyone (including yourself) at risk.
Providing facilities for this kind of fun has become big business. At
various sites one can first be shown how to drive a racing car and then be
allowed to have a go. Which was how I found myself in the company of about
20 other people at a wind and rain swept Brands Hatch racetrack in Kent.
The Brands Hatch Racing Circuit company, Europe's largest organiser of
racing instruction courses, also operates from Snetterton, near Norwich, and
Oulton Park in Cheshire.
After a briefing that stresses commonsense and safety, candidates start by
driving three laps with an instructor in a race-prepared saloon car - in my
case a Ford XR2i - complete with roll cage and full harness.
It is not a foot-hard-down and hang-the-tail-out kind of drive. You are told
to keep below 4,000 rpm. And warned that if you overdo it, you may be asked
to leave the circuit.
The instructor explains basic racing technique. It boils down to doing all
braking and gear-changing in a straight line on the approach to a corner.
Then, with the car set up properly, you accelerate, clipping the apex of the
curve and using the full width of the track as you exit.
At this early stage of race driving training, speed takes second place to
smoothness because you cannot have one without the other. 'Be gentle. Coax
the car; don't fight it,' is the instructor's theme - and, together with the
need for ceaseless concentration, the main practical road-driving benefit.
It must come as a surprise to 'boy racer' candidates who had equated fast
driving with a heavy foot on the accelerator and sawing at the steering
wheel.
So far, the experience is not wildly different from driving a normal car on
a miraculously wide and deserted road. The next stage - eight laps in a
single-seat Formula First 1600 - is something else.
I insinuated my legs into the sharp end, felt around for the pedals, lowered
myself into the unpadded seat until my full-face helmet was just poking
above the body and pressed the starter.
Compared with a Formula 1 car, the Vauxhall Astra engined FF1600 is a toy, a
Mickey Mouse racer. But the engine, only inches behind one's head, growls
excitingly. As the car weighs next to nothing its acceleration matches a
Porsche 911 Turbo's and it turns likes a gazelle pursued by a hungry lion.
After a settling-down lap, I enjoyed myself. Having to use only the top two
gears and strictly observe the 4,000 rpm took away none of the excitement.
Handling a tiny, twitchy single-seater on a track streaming with water is a
full-time job. One's horizon is limited by the rev counter, the two mirrors
barely visible through a rain-spattered visor and a pair of front tyres
flinging fountains of water high in the air.
I was quite sorry to be flagged in at the end of my drive. Having squelched
back to the debriefing instructor I asked him how on earth people like Nigel
Mansell saw where they were going when they drove F1 cars in pouring rain at
up to three times the speed I had been doing. 'With great difficulty,' he
said. I believed him.
An initial race-driving trial at Brands Hatch costs Pounds 79 on a weekday,
Pounds 89 at weekends and a super trial (the main difference is that you get
more driving) is Pounds 149 (Pounds 159 at weekends). About 15,000 people,
ranging from teenagers to pensioners, have a go each year. One in four of
them is female.
Most candidates come just for the fun. Many have had courses as birthday or
Christmas presents and may never go on a circuit again. It can, though, be a
hesitant step toward a career in motor racing: former World Champion James
Hunt drove his first single seater at a Brands Hatch circuit.
Race driving training is not the only kind of fun motoring offered. There
are also courses in off-road driving - the mud and slime variety  - in
Suzuki Samurai 4x4s as well as in skid control.
Of great potential road safety benefit is Earlydrive, which gives children
their first experience of driving a real car on simulated urban road
layouts. There is no lower age limit but they must be over 4ft 10in (145 cm)
tall so they can reach the pedals. For details, telephone 0474-872331.

FT  17 APR 93 / Sport: Sevens brings home the cash - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NED HAIG and David Sanderson are the two Scotsmen credited with inventing
seven-a-side rugby late in the last century - the first tournament was held
at Melrose in 1883. I wonder what their reaction would be to the World Cup
Sevens tournament which began at Murrayfield, Edinburgh, yesterday morning
and finishes tomorrow afternoon?
Perhaps it is better not to ask. On the other hand, the Scots themselves
have given it an emphatic vote of approval. Tickets worth more than Pounds
1m have been sold and many more would have been sold if the rebuilding of
the west stand been finished. As it is, ground capacity is limited to
37,500.
The Sevens are brought to you by the same people who ran the full-scale
World Cup in Britain in 1991 - Rugby World Cup Ltd. ITV is transmitting
several hours each day. The sponsors are similar: Famous Grouse, Mizuno,
Bass Breweries and South African Airways. In subsidiary roles are Unisys;
Gilbert, the ball manufacturer; Umbro, the equipment maker; Medisport, the
supplier of medical equipment, and Citroen.
The World Cup Sevens is an ambitious title for an event that might in time
become as all-embracing as its name suggests but is little more at present
than an upstart cousin to the real sevens tournament the Hong Kong Sevens,
which was staged recently. The World Cup Sevens to that event is as
margarine is to butter.
There will be similarities, one of the most likely is that southern
hemisphere countries will dominate at Murrayfield as they did in Hong Kong
where the semi-finalists were Fiji, Australia, Western Samoa and New
Zealand.
Fiji, in particular, concentrate on sevens these days, perhaps to the
detriment of their performance at the 15-a-side game. They have competed in
25 events already this year and, in Waisale Serevi, they have the
outstanding sevens player in the world. Watch for him. He has a most
distinctive style: one minute he is lurking at the back of his team, some
way from the ball; the next, he will be running in for a try.
The Australians are making a big effort to win at Murrayfield, the undoubted
incentive being the chance of adding the sevens to their World Cup title.
Their team is built around David Campese (who is even more devastating at
sevens than at 15-a side), Michael Lynagh and the huge, strong and fast
forward Willie Ofahengaue.
Sevens is a lot more than half as enjoyable and half as good as the fuller
version. At its best, it can be sublime: seven men weaving intricate
patterns on a full-size pitch until one or two of them, by deft handling and
quick interplay, work a man clear. Then, watch him go  - sometimes, from 60
or 70 yards.
I grew up watching Ian Laughland mastermind London Scottish to victory in
the Middlesex Sevens in the 1960s, and then Gerald Davies dazzle his
opponents with speed and footwork when he helped London Welsh dominate this
event 10 years later. Those days are gone, along with pounds, shillings and
pence and the three point and four-point try. No longer are speed and guile
the two most important characteristics in sevens. A substantial physical
presence is just as important.
The Fijians and Samoans have brought a physical edge to sevens that has
turned it from a sort of high-speed touch rugby to a high-speed,
highly-physical game. The final in the recent Hong Kong tournament was
described by Dick Best, the England coach, as one of the most brutal games
he had ever seen.
Each player needs to be fast, most should be robust, and one or two in each
team must be play-makers. These are the characteristics needed to cope with
someone like Fiji's Mesaka Rasari who is 6ft 5in, more than 17 stone - and a
sprinter.
While the World Cup Sevens provides a feast of rugby, it is an
organisational nightmare: 24 teams - including many hardly known for their
rugby such as Latvia, the Netherlands, Korea and Spain - compete in four
pools of six. Minutes are vital. The semi-finals tomorrow start at 15.32 and
15.49 and the final iself at 17.16. Blink and you miss a match.
Weather permitting, the tournament will demonstrate the attraction of sevens
rugby. But there are doubts it will catch on in Europe as it has in the
southern hemisphere. Weather, fixtures, and the strength of the 15-a-side
game are all against the growth of the shortened game. So, you had better
make the most of it while you can.

FT  17 APR 93 / Sport: A season at a slower pace - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELCOME to the new cricket season, to the rugs, hot drinks and music of ball
on bat.
It has been a long winter. There has been nothing to keep cricket fans going
through the barren months since the end of last season, except newspaper
descriptions of the English Test team failing in India and Sri Lanka, weary
with too much cricket.
There may be too much to play, but there is never enough to watch and such
as there is depends on the weather. It always has done, of course, and bad
weather has always led to what the editor of Wisden in 1974 attacked as 'the
practice of contrived finishes on the third day.'
Today these contrived finishes are used as an argument in support of the
four-day game, which is with us on trial for the next three years. It will
mean fewer county matches - 17 instead of 22 - but the hope is that these
will be fuller and better than three-day matches. Even rain should leave
time for both sides to bat and bowl their way through two innings and reach
a genuine result.
We shall see.
I think the real question for English cricket is not how long its games
should be but whether these games, be they three, four or five days long,
can cash in on the popularity which the one-day game has brought back to
cricket.
One of the keys to success in longer games is balance. I write as one who
has sat through countless hours of medium pace bowling leading nowhere, not
challenging batsmen, not inspiring other bowlers and certainly not
entertaining spectators. It is not strength in one-pace depth, but a balance
between speeds: fast, medium and slow, and between types: seam, spin and
drifter, which is most likely to cope with the varied demands of longer
games.
Uncovered wickets would probably boost an assorted range of bowling,
including more slow and spin, but with batsmen skittled out on drying
wickets like the 'sticky dogs' of Derek Underwood's great days, county games
would be more likely to last two than three or four days. You cannot win.
But you can have a go.
Sussex's captain, Alan Wells, used Ian Salisbury's leg spin with increasing
confidence last season and Salisbury took 79 wickets in the county
championship, while Sussex strike bowler Franklyn Stephenson took 40.
Bowling in the classic spinners' style of match-winning bursts, Salisbury
took 23 wickets in Sussex's last two games, against Lancashire and
Yorkshire, whom he mesmerised into ignominious defeat.
Sussex have followed this up by signed off-spinner Eddie Hemmings. At 44,
sacked by Nottinghamshire, Hemmings is nothing if not experienced and, most
important, is a partner in spin for Salisbury.
I am a believer in partnerships, with bat and with ball. They are pivots of
strength, which the English Test team so sorely lacks. Northamptonshire's
Alan Fordham and Nigel Felton, competent but not brilliant batsmen, opened
their county's batting splendidly last season, working as a pair. Wasim and
Waqar showed how devastating a bowling partnership can be.
Somerset have shown enterprise in signing Mushtaq Ahmed to provide an
element of the unfathomable and to work in harness with off-spinner Harvey
Trump, backing up the pace attack of Andy Caddick and Mark Lathwell. I look
forward to watching Somerset's double acts this summer.
At Derbyshire, much will depend on the extent to which bowlers Ian Bishop
and Dominic Cork can settle into a high-powered, high-speed opening
partnership. Devon Malcolm is always fast, often wayward and usually lonely
 -a true Derbyshire man. One reason Derbyshire have sometimes done well but
never triumphantly well in recent years is the individual and erratic nature
of its cricket. If captain Kim Barnett can work his talented players, not
least the slow left-arm bowler Richard Sladdin, into a coherent team, then
with John Morris starting to bat consistently as well as elegantly, the
county could be a formidable proposition.
Unlike Derbyshire, Essex are used to being a solid, well balanced team,
thanks to years of astute management by Keith Fletcher, now departed for
national service. Essex's confident steadiness is reflected in the way their
overseas signings, such as Mark Waugh and Salim Malik, come back for more.
Kent are pleased with themselves for achieving this with Carl Hooper, who is
going to do another year of bowling as well as batting for them. They are
also pleased with their wicket-keeper, Steve Marsh, latest of a long line of
good Kentish keepers. There is something about Kent - wind? grass? cider? -
that breeds good wicket-keepers. Marsh kept wicket happily last season to
the off-spin of Hooper, the zippy fast medium of Martin McCague and the slow
left-arm of Richard Davis.
If only England would copy the many counties profiting from the services of
a good keeper. The Test team needs a proper keeper. Batsmen who also keep
wicket should not spill over from one-day into county and Test cricket, any
more than bowlers who can throw the bat a bit should replace genuine
all-rounders.
A powerful all-rounder like Chris Lewis, who averaged 49.25 with the bat and
took 40 wickets for Nottinghamshire last season, would have helped to lift
Yorkshire, Worcestershire and Durham from their bottom three places in the
county table last year.
Of these, Worcestershire's next-to-bottom was the most humiliating, after
their sixth place in 1991. Among other things, they were hurt by fast bowler
Graham Dilley's continuing injuries. It seems rare for any player, certainly
a fast bowler, to get through a season without an injury. Sometimes it looks
as if injuries are an indication of a team's unhappiness. The answer is not
concentrated fitness, which brings strains and stress fractures galore, but
a confident captain knowing when to push his team and when to let its secret
resources bear fruit for itself.

FT  17 APR 93 / Sport: Power vacuum in the Afrikaner's game - South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BEDFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUGBY and politics lie at the heart of Afrikanerdom. There is a certain
natural symmetry, between reform of the body that runs the Afrikaner's
national sport and the search for a new political order.
After more than 44 years of apartheid, the stumblings towards a new
democratic rugby system inevitably reflect the political fumblings of a new
South Africa, trying to find its way towards some kind of third world
democracy.
Just as there are no obvious leaders to take South Africans out of the
escalating mess in the country as a whole, so there are, after Danie Craven,
no readily identifiable leaders with the charisma to take the most important
sport in South Africa in the direction which it requires.
When the South African Rugby Football Union finally came into being through
the amalgamation last March of the predominantly white South African Rugby
Board and the predominantly non-white South African Rugby Union, no one
foresaw that the doughty Craven, who had already been president of the white
union for 35 years, would die within nine months of having become president
of the amalgamated body - even though he was 82 and had not been well for
years.
Craven was succeeded for only two months by Fritz Eloff, his vice-president
of some 23 years. A month ago, Ebrahim Patel, the long-serving former
president of the non-white players became president of the new body, as
agreed at the amalgamation. Patel will hold the post for a year. Patel is
something of an unknown quantity, because black and brown rugby had such a
low profile. He was fiercely anti-apartheid and fiercely opposed to the
white establishment.
Finally, in March of 1994 there will be a genuine vote and a president will
be elected. The 19 executives of all colours, who elected themselves to a
two-year stint as the first representatives of this new phase of South
African rugby, will have to be properly elected to serve on an executive
body of 11; a more manageable size.
The national government has been in power for too long (since 1948) and
wants to cling on in the new South Africa in spite of the almost daily
revelations of misconduct. Similarly, the administration of rugby has been
bogged down. Until recently, rugby presidents and officials, once elected,
stayed on forever and an autocratic system of administration prevailed.
But Jan Pickard, president of Western Province, the most powerful of the old
white SARB provincial unions, has resigned because of ill health. The
presidents of three of the wealthiest, and therefore most powerful,
provincial unions - Koos Vermaak of Eastern Province, Nick Labuschagne of
Natal and Steve Strydom of Orange Free State - have all resigned or been
voted out of office following questions about financial matters. All were at
times candidates to succeed Craven.
Suddenly there are few contenders for Craven's old jobs. In this league
Louis Luyt, the president of the Transvaal Rugby Union, is the only one left
with any sort of pedigree. But he is a maverick. He attracted controversy
when he sanctioned the playing of Die Stem, the South African anthem, at the
test against New Zealand in August. His forthrightness, a commodity rare in
South African rugby and is not always appreciated by his peers. He has
frequently been voted off rugby's hierarchical executive; only to be asked
to return.
I believe he has taken the initiative in trying to shake up the
administration of South African rugby. It is his union which made the first
and largest contribution (in excess of R2m - Pounds 450,000) to the SARFU's
development programme for the black townships. I believe Luyt's heart has
come to be in the right place, and even if he does ruffle feathers, he loves
what he is doing in rugby and could just be the least worst successor to
Craven.
Johan Claasen, the respected former Springbok and president of a less
affluent, smaller and therefore more neutral former white union, Western
Transvaal, would have been a contender for the presidency too. With Craven's
death he may have reconsidered but six months ago he told me he was not
interested in the job.
Although the names of others, mainly former white players outside the
administration of South African rugby, have been mentioned, the autocratic
system meant that younger, more progressive, thinkers could not easily be
accommodated. It would be difficult for anyone who has not been involved in
the nitty gritty of the game to walk into rugby and simply take over the
presidency.
For the immediate future at least, the clout in South African rugby will
remain with the six former white unions. They have the money and while they
have it they will also have much of the power to pull strings within rugby.
But the six, the Currie Cup unions, are also fiercely competitive and it
might not do to have one of their presidents elected president of SARFU at
the expense of the rest.
This could mean that Patel is elected next March; provided that, in his year
in office, he remains neutral between provinces, as Craven was, and shows
that he understands that the key to the presidency is not what he gets out
of rugby but what he can put in. While Patel is in the running for the
presidency, no other black or brown South African will, dare to run.

FT  17 APR 93 / Travel Focus, Italy: Sunstruck Puglia, home of Horace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORDS my schoolmaster once used when none of us knew what he meant -
'Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' - now come back to me whenever I look at
a map of Puglia.
There it is: 240 miles of rugged, gorgeous, sun-struck earth, with its very
own 'heel' in the Gargano peninsula and its own 'toe' below, in the curling
tip of land from Otranto on the east to Gallipoli on the west.
'Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Andrews minor - give me an example.'
Sir? Back then, aged 10, I was flummoxed or day-dreaming. Now I might lob
Puglia at him as an impertinent geographical illustration. The development
of the individual (Puglia) recapitulates the development of the species
(southern Italy).
And not just in appearances. Puglia in its time has been over-run by every
ragged army that ever set bruising foot on Italy's larger foot. Greeks,
Saracens, Normans and Spanish left calling-cards: from bits of old temple to
the mini-casbahs of Bari, from Norman cathedrals (Trani) to Spanish-baroque
churches. Meanwhile, the Swabians under Frederick II left a legacy of
castles, notably the spectacular polygonal Castel Del Monte, resembling a
giant threepenny bit on a hill.
But the largest invasion force, in Puglia as in all Italy, has been
tourists. They may be more merciful here than almost anywhere else. Still my
advice is: retreat from the ports and beaches, avoid 'gateways to Greece'
like Brindisi, and enjoy the hinterland of olive-tree-dotted plains,
wandering donkeys, sleepy sun-baked villages, grape-dressed tavernas,
boundless vineyards and, above all, trulli.
Trulli give southern Puglia its bizarre, knockout enchantment. Sometime
between 2,000 and 1,000 BC - the travel books are vague - these cylindrical
stone cottages with cone-shaped roofs first appeared in the area. The roofs
themselves are topped with white crosses or other adornments. When the owner
wants more room for himself, or his family, or his goats, or his television,
he knocks down a wall and attaches another stone cylinder plus cone roof
plus cross (or star or sickle or satellite dish). Result: south-central
Puglia can look like Disneyland gone delirious.
If you are hurried, Alberobello is the place to visit for a definitive
eyeful. Here the white-topped trulli cascade down the town's main hill.
If you are unhurried - much better - get into a car and roam over the
plains. Here the wacky edifices are in their natural, random habitat. You
spin past the cone-homes from town to town, and southern Puglia really is
worth covering entire. In clockwise order from Alberobello these should be
your major points of call:
Polignano sul Mare. Leave the car on the edge of town; thread the narrow
medieval streets; peer over limestone cliffs into a rock-slapping sea. Then
eat in the dining-room of the main hotel which looks out into a floodlit sea
cavern.
Ostuni. This hill village near the coast can snow-blind the unwary
passer-by. A man-made cliff of dazzling white, Ostuni is composed of rearing
town-walls flush with slit-eyed houses, of higgledy churches and piggledy
towers. Note the splendid 18th century Spanish obelisk and the fulsome views
from Largo Castello.
Lecce. Showcase for baroque architecture. The soft local sandstone allowed
17th century Spanish-influenced chisel-masters to run amok. Enjoy not just
the shapes of the churches and palaces but their colouring too: deepest
honey mellowed by the sun.
Otranto. Horace Walpole never slept here. His Gothic shocker, The Castle of
Otranto, came straight from his imagination. Never mind. The town boasts its
own grand guignol character and history, including an Archbishop who was
sawn in half and 800 citizens who were decapitated, both in the wake of a
1480 AD Turkish siege; and it has its own haunting beauty: a glorious
Romanesque cathedral, a craggy Aragonese castle. In the old port, linger
romantically to enjoy the moon over the water.
Gallipoli. Good beaches to the south.
Martina Franca. Welcome back. You are now in trulli country again. Wander
through this Moorish-flavoured town, feel its medieval heart, and then gaze
from the 14th century town walls over the cone-roofs of the distant valley.
The poet Horace, who studied his advocacy of wine and song during hours
normally appointed for homework, was born in Apulia and knew what it was all
about. It is the capital of the grape. It sluices Italy and much of western
Europe with vino da tavola and sometimes even adds quality to quantity. Try
Castel Del Monte: a fruity red with a hint of bucolic insouciance.
Horace, if he lived today, might also sample the fish restaurants on the
coast. And if the poet felt like a trip to the hills he could visit Selva di
Fasano, where two majestic restaurants await. Fagiano's serves delicious
goat meat and if you ask politely it will pour wild mushrooms over the
regional pasta speciality, orechiette (little ears). Down the road is a
pizzeria where the products emerge from the ovens spitting like volcanoes
and waving tiny sage-leaves as surrender signals.
Since sun-dried tomatoes and oil-soaked vegetables are also local
favourites, you will probably realise that Puglia is a bit Greek. My theory
is that it snapped off from western Greece thousands of years ago and
drifted aimlessly across the Adriatic. It bumped into Italy during siesta
hour and started attaching itself geologically and culturally.
My schoolmaster once nodded vigorously at this theory when I put it to him.
But then it was the end of term and he was hurrying to get away for his
Italian holiday.

FT  17 APR 93 / Travel Focus, Italy: To Sicily with a strawberry blonde -
James Bentley is thoroughly upstaged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE NEED to promote Sicily,' said Dr Bevacqua, 'so I'm offering you and a
friend two weeks' half-board there, plus a car.' It was October. That
evening, I told my wife the good news. 'But who will pick our walnuts?' she
asked. In vain I replied that this time the squirrels could have them.
So then I rang my younger daughter, who lives in France. 'I'll be on the
next plane from Toulouse,' she said. Her swift response was a bonus, for
Emma-Jane is a strawberry blonde, and such hair drives Italian men into
ecstasy.
'Che bella,' they would cry when she was little, signalling their affection
by an affectionate, excruciatingly painful pinch of her cheek. I shall never
forget the sight of her chubby infant legs pounding the sand as she tried to
escape from yet another adoring Italiano.
Immediately on our arrival in Sicily I realised that little has changed in
the psyche of the Italian male since my daughter grew up. From the start,
no-one spoke to me, not even the man at the car-hire, who asked her whether
she or her 'grandfather' would be driving. As if I might not understand,
Emma-Jane replied in Italian: 'Il mio nonno guidera.'
Meanwhile, I was placing our baggage in the back seat. The car-hire
attendant cautioned me. 'We are close to Catania,' he admonished. 'A couple
of youths could ride by on a motorbike, smash your window and steal the
cases.' So he kindly placed our luggage in the boot.
As I drove away he called out: 'Be careful. They drive fast in Catania.'
They certainly do. The moment we arrived there we stopped, to let my nerves
calm down. Fish, meat and fruit markets abound in Catania.
At the fruit stalls in little alleyways, stallholders were gingerly handling
prickly pears with rubber gloves. Once you enter the inner city, the
atmosphere is different, with an 18th century cathedral (it was founded
seven centuries earlier), fountains and the 13th century Castello Ursino.
It was time to drive north to Taormina, where our hotel was the Villa Riis.
From the balcony of our room we gazed at lazily-smoking Mount Etna. I loved
the hotel swimming pool and was disappointed in its food: excellently
cooked, but German in style, for the hotel was filled with Germans. I prefer
to eat German food in Germany, in Sicily, Sicilian food. Each evening
Emma-Jane and I compensated by drinking copious quantities of Donnafugata, a
wine named after the heroine of Lampedusa's Sicilian novel, The Leopard.
As the citizens never fail to remind you, Guy de Maupassant once observed:
'If someone should spend one day in Sicily and ask, 'What must I see?',
without hesitation I should answer Taormina.'
A long narrow street guarded at both ends by a fortified gateway is flanked
by crumbling buildings and centres on Piazza Duomo, which is cooled by a
fountain dated 1635.
The little Romanesque cathedral has a superb sculpted main doorway and
another one, equally fine, on the north side. Opposite rises the town hall,
above Tony's bar. Boutiques display videos depicting Etna erupting,
accompanied by the strains of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.
We decided to drive up the volcano. Emma-Jane collected bits of lava as
presents - cheap gifts, as she put it. That evening my wife phoned. As we
told her about our day, we could hear at the other end of the line the
strangled sobs of one who had always wanted to climb Etna and had passed up
the opportunity.
On our last day in Taormina we explored the Greek theatre, rebuilt by the
Romans and overlooking the sea. A guide was lecturing a group of Americans,
so Emma-Jane and I free-loaded the tour. He was telling the Americans not
about the theatre but about what they really relish hearing - the cost of
hotels, including half-board at the Villa Riis.
'Half-board', he added, to our deathly horror, 'does not include wine.' That
evening, as the waiter brought our accustomed bottle of Donnafugata,
Emma-Jane declined it with the words: 'Papa has drunk a little too much
today.'
Lava helps to mark out the patterned walls of the finest Arabic-Romanesque
building in Italy: Monreale cathedral, with its Benedictine cloister. 'To
visit Sicily and not see Monreale', runs a local proverb, 'is to go as a
donkey and return as a brute' (which rhymes in Italian).
Among its splendours is a vast cycle of mosaics depicting scenes from the
Old and New Testaments. William II, the third of the Norman kings of Sicily,
founded this magnificent building in the 1170s. Who knows what else he might
have commissioned had he not died at the age of 37?
Sicily is a small island, and soon we reached Agrigento. Founded in 580 BC
by colonists from Gela, its valley of the temples encompasses, in my view,
finer buildings than Athens itself. Grooved sandstone pillars, pediments and
broken columns speak of a long-dead civilisation. Under them dogs snoozed in
the sun, and cats scurried where once ancient gods and goddesses were
worshipped.
At Agrigento, our hotel restaurant was closed, so we went to eat complex
pizzas at a pizzeria along the coast. As ever, the proprietor took to a
strawberry blonde, so we stayed drinking with him. The following morning he
turned up at breakfast in our hotel, this time garbed as a waiter.
It was time to leave for Siracusa. I was driving gently when a Catanian
(recognisable by the number-plate of his car) shot past me, screeched to a
crumping halt and then drove on again. He had struck a stray sheep as it
wandered in the road.
I drove cautiously past its flailing legs, while Emma-Jane urged me to stop
and tend the dying beast. Usually she is stronger-willed than I am, but this
time I resisted, and drove on to Siracusa, with its ramparts and a cathedral
built on the site of a Greek temple.
Siracusa is a port boasting architectural riches bequeathed by the Normans,
the Aragonese, the Catalans, the Greeks and the Romans. Undoubtedly its
Greek theatre is the most impressive in the western world.
As a bonus, Siracusa also has a magnificent Roman amphitheatre. In the
quarries that supplied the stone for these monuments are caverns in which
tyrants imprisoned their enemies. One of them is an echo-chamber, where (so
the guides tell you) the screams of the tortured would reverberate to
terrorise other imprisoned unfortunates.
I had fixed a meeting with Siracusa's head of tourism. Before we arrived I
was not sure whether Vittorio Gallo had intended to give us lunch, but once
he spotted my assistant he instantly suggested that we eat together.
As they talked and I tucked into the fantastic fish caught off Siracusa
(squids, oysters, smoked swordfish, king prawns, kippers, salmon), I
congratulated myself on my foresight in arranging to be her father.
James Bentley's visit to Sicily was arranged by Dr Aldo V Bevacqua of Italia
nel Mondo, 6 Palace Street, London SW1E 5HY, tel: 071-828-9171.

<TEXT>
THE STORY two weeks ago about my magical mystery flight to Bali aboard
Garuda, the hapless Indonesian state airline - we stopped four times and
endured a door-to-door travelling time of 28 hours - has drawn a reply from
Timothy Knight, managing director of Eastravel, writes Michael
Thompson-Noel, Travel editor.
Eastravel, an air travel consultant and organiser based in Ipswich,
specialises in tailor-made holidays, especially to the Far East.
Knight writes: 'Whilst I fully agree with your philosophy of ensuring the
most direct or non-stop flight for a long-haul journey to a single
destination, those flights on quality airlines which stop en route offer the
opportunity to stop over, thus getting far better value for money and a
chance to break up the journey into smaller sectors.
'For example, the journey undertaken by yourself to Indonesia could have
been just a one-stop flight with Singapore Airlines, which Eastravel offers
as a possible choice; or up to three stops flying with Emirates (the airline
of the United Arab Emirates). The stops could be selected in either
direction and then combined with Singapore Airlines' (one-stop) flight in
the other.
'En route to Indonesia, Emirates offers Dubai and the Emirates with a choice
of adventure and superb hotels; Sri Lanka, with possibly a chauffeur-driven
tour; and then Singapore, a gateway to Malaysia. All these possibilities
could be combined with an overland tour in Java ending finally (exhausted)
in a Bali resort.
'Similar journeys can be organised to Japan and Korea, Australia and New
Zealand, via numerous Oriental countries.'
This is all quite true: the market in stop-over travel is large and growing.
You can do virtually anything you want and stop anywhere you want, though
you need a perspicacious travel agent to help you wade through the fine
print and spot the best-value deals.
As Timothy Knight acknowledges, my whinge was about the time taken on Garuda
just to get to Bali. I didn't want to stop in Paris, Abu Dhabi, Singapore
and Jakarta; but I did.
If you are planning a single-destination long-haul holiday, try and get a
non-stop flight. Failing that, insist on the most direct (fewest stops)
flight available. You may encounter trickiness. Many airline staff use the
word 'direct' to imply 'non-stop.' I have heard them do it time after time.
Keep flying hours to the minimum. Do not patronise airlines that take you
all round the houses for obscure reasons of their own.
I used to have a rule that 15 hours' flying time was the maximum I would
consider without a proper stop and rest. It sounds wimpy, but I plan to
re-adopt it. If you fly for 20 hours or more you can suffer severe
jet-smack, and that can spoil your holiday.
If you can afford the time for genuine stop-overs and mini-breaks as a way
of interrupting your journey, get some specialist brochures, including those
of the airlines. Eastravel has its own. (Eastravel: 79 Norwich Road, Ipswich
IP1 2PR, tel: 0473-214305/210770, fax: 0473-232740).
Useful for would-be holiday litigants is Successful Holidays, And What To Do
If They're Not, by Michael and Jacqui Welham, which serves three broad
purposes. It decribes the parties involved in travel, from operators and
agents to travel associations. It steers you towards holiday success with
pointers and advice. And it explains the varied options for winning
compensation if things go wrong.
It offers numerous case histories, and describes the impact of the new EC
directive on package holidays. There is a directory of addresses and
telephone numbers for government offices, tourist boards, embassies, travel
associations, airlines, vaccination centres, what have you. Available in

FT  17 APR 93 / Travel: Ho-ho, Ho Chi Minh - Nicholas Woodsworth travels
out-of-season to the Vietnamese capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANOI, for me, begins on the back of a motorcycle some 1,200 kms to the
south, in the early-morning streets of Saigon.
Sitting behind Mr Ha, I have my baggage slung across my back and my heart in
my throat. Mr Ha runs the tiniest of businesses from a narrow ground-floor
hallway in central Saigon; he owns half-a-dozen bicycles and rents them out
to tourists. But he is such a kind man that when I asked him about taxi
transport to Tan Son Nhut airport for a dawn flight to Hanoi, he insisted on
taking me himself.
No problem at all, he indicates with sign language and the few English words
he knows; he has a motorcycle. Mr Ha's mime of revving a motorcycle engine
is not the most convincing, for he has only one arm. But his offer is so
kind I take it anyway.
Does one ask for a sign-language explanation of such a misfortune in the
middle of Saigon's anarchic traffic? One does not. One simply holds on and
prays. But over coffee at the airport Mr Ha demonstrates how he lost his
arm.
Using his stump to hold down a piece of paper, he draws row after row of
stippled lines with a pen, and makes deep rumbling noises in his throat. 'Me
Hanoi VC. Viet Cong.' He giggles, apologetically, as if the whole thing were
some mild and amusing embarrassment, a fault of his own. In 1971, a
20-year-old recruit with the army of North Vietnam, he was hit by shrapnel
in one of the United States' countless B-52 carpet bombings of Hanoi. It is
one of the sadder introductions I have had to a city.
Not so sad are Massimo and Sandro, whom I meet aboard a Vietnamese Airlines
Tupelov bound for the capital. They are Milanese freelance
photo-journalists, collecting stories and pictures to sell to some of
Italy's more lurid colour magazines. They have just claimed an Italian scoop
for their coverage of the Miss Saigon beauty contest. They are on their way
north to interview General Giap, military mastermind of colonial France's
defeat in Indochina and second only to Ho Chi Minh himself in the pantheon
of modern Vietnamese heroes.
Today Giap is an old man and no longer a central committee member but, none
the less, difficult to see. How was that arranged, I ask, full of
admiration. I have found even simple administrative procedures here
maddeningly complicated. It was nothing, they say with only the tiniest
shrug of Latin bravado, simply a short call to the ministry of information.
The countryside as we approach Hanoi reminds Massimo and Sandro of the north
Italian plain in winter. In February the table-flat surface of the Red River
delta is chilly, grey and wet. Fresh from the colour and sunlight, the
sensual distractions of the south, the Italians are already finding Hanoi
depressing. As we land they are once again discussing Miss Saigon's legs.
We install ourselves in the Gold Hotel in the centre of Hanoi. Like the rash
of new hotels that have sprung up in the last year or two, it tries to cater
to the tastes of Hanoi's growing number of foreign visitors. Homesick,
Massimo tries the spaghetti bolognaise.
His eyeballs roll upwards with the first fork-full - Hanoi, he reports to
the maitre d' who hovers anxiously behind him, still has some way to go in
matters of western cuisine. The maitre d' apologises profusely: he is not
familiar with Italian food. In fact, he is not professionally familiar with
food at all. He is a plastic surgeon who has taken a second job to make ends
meet. Things are difficult these days in Hanoi, he tells us. How much does
he make at the hospital where he works, we ask. About Dollars 11 a month, he
replies. We stop complaining about the food.
In the afternoon we go for a walk. For anyone arriving from the bright
tropical bustle of Saigon, Hanoi in February is a dismal place, drab, dour,
dejected, dressed in funereal grey.
This is the season marked by what French colonists called the crachin - spit
 -and the Vietnamese in their own language more poetically refer to as 'rain
dust.' When dry winter air sweeps southwards out of central Asia and meets
humidity over the Gulf of Tonkin, a fine mist of suspended water particles
descends upon the city for weeks at a time. It is cold, thin and cheerless.
Outside, I can hardly believe that north and south Vietnam are two parts of
the same country. Saigon's boulevards are lively and cheerful, a zingy blend
of commercial hustle and outdoor social get-together. There is laughter,
shouting, music from sidewalk speakers. For visitors there are inquiring
glances, imprecations from cheeky children, ingenious sales pitches to buy
watches or cauliflowers. There is contact on Saigon's streets, and
foreigners get drawn into its life whether they want to or not.
There is little contact on Hanoi's streets. Massimo, Sandro and I walk
through the grey crachin beside the Hoan Kiem, a lake that lies in the city
centre like a sheet of cold slate.
Decades of hardship, sacrifice and autocratic rule seem to have left the
people of Hanoi without much joy or ability to express it. There are no
smiles, no hellos, no propositions commercial, salacious or otherwise.
Hunched old men in glasses, dark raincoats and berets drift by us, the last
of a colonial generation. Younger generations seem hardly more cheerful - in
browns and greys and olive drabs, in khaki pith helmets and worn-out
military surplus wear they go their sombre way. Hanoi's people seem no more
high-spirited indoors than out. In a cafe so cold that its patrons wear
their Russian-style hats with the ear-flaps down, we sit in doleful silence.
Attempts at conversation bring the shortest of answers. Even the dogs here
are uncommunicative; in the market of the city's old quarter we watch a
women with a large cleaver dismember a cooked, lacquered dog and set out its
head as an advertisement. Massimo, still homesick, says it has the same eyes
as his dog back home.
The days pass, the interview with General Giap, to which the Italians have
invited me, comes no closer. I suspect it never will. Over Hanoi hangs not
just a mist but the heavy hand of a Confucian-style, by-the-book bureaucracy
designed not to facilitate but to inhibit. I take myself off to see Ho Chi
Minh.
Since 1975, Ho has resided in a grey marble and granite building not far
from Hanoi's military Citadel. He seems to be as popular in death as he was
in life. Every day fleets of buses make their way past magnificent colonial
villas to deposit school-children, factory workers and village peasants at
the mausoleum of the man who did away with French Indochina.
No photography, no shorts, no hats on heads, no hands in pockets, no
irreverence. These are the rules that govern a pilgrimage to the glass
sarcophagus deep in the bowels of the mausoleum. Shuffling slowly forward in
an awe-struck queue, I gaze at Ho's famous wispy beard, his bald,
liver-spotted pate. He is waxy-looking.
In the past, Ho's thin, embalmed body has spent two months a year in Moscow
undergoing maintainance. With Russian aid and personality cults things of
the past, what will happen now?
Far livelier is the small group of elderly men I meet every morning in a
shabby cafe not far from the hotel. They are retired academics from Hanoi's
universities. Mathematicians, physicists, literary lecturers, they spent
their youth studying in France. Today they are back on the left bank once
again, reviewing de Chardin, debating the philosophes, arguing for or
against Gide. Why, I ask them? On their tiny pensions, they laugh, it is the
only pleasure they can afford - just the price of a cup of coffee.
For Dollars 4 apiece, Massimo, Sandro and I go to the VIP Club, just about
the hottest - indeed, just about the only - night spot in town. After four
decades of isolation, Hanoi is opening up to the outside world. Down the
road, the Credit Lyonnais has opened an office. The Bank of America has
announced its intention of doing the same. The Pullman Hotel group has
renovated the Metropole, now the most elegant hotel in town. Not even the
infamous 'Hanoi Hilton', the prison in which downed US pilots were kept
during the war, is to be spared; soon it, too, will be converted.
For foreigners, diplomats and for the government officials wealthy enough to
use it, the VIP Club is a taste of another world. There are disco hits and
strobe lights. There are sophisticated bar girls who drink Johnny Walker
Black Label. There is one machine that produces clouds of vapour, another
that spills out bubbles. Sandro dances, surprising party cadres with
innovative Mediterranean gusto. For a while, even Massimo cheers up.
It is all short-lived, though. The next morning, after a final phone call,
the Giap bubble pops. As they pack their bags, they consider the bright
lights of Manila, the charms of Jakarta, the lures of Bangkok. They consider
just about anywhere, in fact, that will get them on an aircraft out. I take
a train to Haiphong and that much reputed north Vietnamese wonder, Halong
Bay.
The countryside around Hanoi is as poor as any I have seen in Asia. I am not
even sure I am on the right continent; from the rail line you can see mud
huts as miserable as any in Africa. South-east Asia's technological
revolution seems to have by-passed the Red River delta.
In the port of Haiphong, I find a Moscvich communal taxi to take me on to
Halong. Despite the lace curtains in the back window, it is old and ailing.
Halfway there, we grind to a halt in a stretch of greasy mud. The driver
crawls under the engine and bangs away. When he is finished we have
everything but battery power and an ability to change out of third gear. We
four passengers gather behind the car and push as fast as we can. It coughs
into life and we throw ourselves in through the open doors. Ninety minutes,
several villages and many startled chickens later, we arrive at Halong
without having slowed down once.
'You must stay in Room 208 at the Halong Hotel 1', a French tour guide had
drooled at me in Hanoi. 'Catherine Deneuve slept there, you know, when she
filmed Indochine.'
With or without Catherine Deneuve's bed (I end up in Room 106 at the Halong
Hotel 2), I find the bay superb. From the town of Bai Chay I board a tour
boat in a heavy drizzle. Slowly, as we head out over calm water, the crachin
lifts and delicate bobbing sampans appear. A few minutes later, Halong's
3,000 green and sheer-sided islands, each a miniature alp, emerge from the
mist.
I am elated. This is as cheering as a chat with General Giap. I only wish
Massimo and Sandro could be here. Miss Deneuve's is one north Vietnamese
address they would have enjoyed.
Worth knowing:
Hanoi's cold and foggy winter is followed by the blue skies of spring: the
best time to travel in the north is between April and October.
Independent travel is possible in Vietnam and Royal Thai Airlines, Cathay
Pacific and Singapore Airlines all fly to Saigon and Hanoi from London for
between Pounds 600 and Pounds 750 return airfare.
In London, visas, air travel, accommodation and car and driver can be
organised by Vietnam Tourism, tel: 081-961-0117. A two-week tour, exclusive
of airfare, costs about Pounds 1,000.

NOW IS a good time to buy sea kale.
The leaves - waxy, blue-green and coarsely toothed - are tastiest when young
and should be steamed and eaten with melted butter and flakes of freshly
grated Parmesan or eaten raw in salads. Michael Paske grows it on his
Grantham, Lincolnshire, farm following roughly the same methods used by
Victorian gardeners. The cut fresh vegetable is available by mail order
until the end of July; a standard pack of 500 gms costs Pounds 6.50,
inclusive of post and packing. It is also available at Waitrose supermarkets
at Pounds 1.45 for a pack of 135 gms. Ring 0400-50449 to order.

FT  17 APR 93 / Cookery: Nice, nutty and healthy - Buckwheat, a substantial
staple, shows its lighter side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I USED to associate buckwheat only with Russia and sturgeon. Flour made from
tiny, nutty buckwheat seeds and raised with yeast produces blinis which,
when teamed with the roe of that fish and tots of vodka, make a memorable
feast. The grain itself is also traditional with the flesh of the fish (or
sometimes with salmon), together with mushrooms, onions, dill, butter and
soured cream, the whole lot wrapped in a brioche parcel known generally as
coulibiac.
Now, I have learned that buckwheat is also a staple food of the people of
Valtellina, in the northern fringes of Italy where the alpine peaks that
rise from the valley are so snow-packed that you can ski in high summer.
The buckwheat dishes I ate there were wonderful - and very substantial. The
coarsely-ground seed is mixed with maize meal and whipped up with butter and
cheese to make taragna, a splendidly rich variation on polenta. Buckwheat
flour is used to make ribbon noodles called pizzoccheri. A dish of the same
name - consisting of the noodles cooked and served with potatoes, cabbage,
garlic, sage, butter and cheese - is marvellous, rib-sticking fare and just
the ticket to revive you when you have spent the day swooping on skis or
pony-trekking.
Recipes like these are too good to miss, but I shall save them until next
winter. Instead, I shall make some lighter suggestions - for which you will
need to buy a packet of buckwheat flour or saraceno. You will find it sold
in many health food stores as well as Italian specialist shops and
delicatessens. Store it in the refrigerator when you get it home; it will
keep better, and longer, than if you leave it in a kitchen cupboard.
Use small quantities of buckwheat flour to replace some of the wholewheat in
bread-making. This gives loaves good, nutty flavour, agreeably light texture
and an attractively-speckled look. I also like using buckwheat in batter
and, particularly, shaping the batter into small cakes, like king-size drop
scones.
Serve them for brunch or Sunday supper topped with similarly large
mushrooms, fried or baked with garlic and butter. Add a scattering of chives
or dill plus, perhaps, a few rashers of bacon on the side. Or, offer them as
a generous first course for dinner teamed with sauteed chicken livers, onion
marmalade and soured cream, or a fresh tomato salsa with basil.
Last, buckwheat batter without the pepper can be served for breakfast to
spread with butter and honey or marmalade - a lovely change from toast or
croissants.
BUCKWHEAT BATTER (Makes 8 rounds about 4 inches in diameter)
Ingredients: 2 oz buckwheat flour;  1/4 teaspoon baking powder; a good pinch
each of Maldon salt and freshly-ground black pepper; 1 oz butter, at room
temperature;  1/4 lb cottage cheese; 3 tablespoons milk beaten with 2 large
eggs.
Method: Put the buckwheat flour and raising agent into the bowl of a food
processor or blender. Season, add the butter, cut into dice, add the cottage
cheese. Mix briefly. Pour on the liquids, adding them through the hole in
the lid while the machine is running, and continue processing until the
ingredients are blended to a thick, creamy batter.
Heat and lightly butter a small griddle or omelette pan. Ladle enough batter
into the pan to make a 4-inch circle and cook over moderate heat until
bubbles begin to show and the batter is sufficiently cooked so that you can
slip a spatula under it easily.
Flip it golden side up and cook for a few seconds more until the second side
is set. Then, remove it from the pan, wrap it between the folds of a napkin
and slip it into a low oven to keep tender and warm while you cook the rest.
Serve in any of the ways described above.

FT  17 APR 93 / Food and Drink: Let's go for a bite at the opera -
Restaurant critic Nicholas Lander combines a night of culture with a meal on
the town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOING TO the opera or a show in central London? Then where do you go to eat?
There are increasing pressures on achieving that elusive sensation of
combining an uplifting cultural experience and a good meal. Cost and time
are the most obvious as opera, concert and cinema ticket prices rise and
managements, in an effort to minimise overtime after 11.30pm, bring forward
their curtain-up.
Bringing your own sandwiches for the interval may be one way of staving off
the hunger pangs. For others this may detract from the pleasures of the
first act. And what about eating out after the performance when there are
fewer restaurants and cafes open until the early hours? Here are some ideas
about where to eat. It is not a definitive list and it is obviously best to
book in advance to let the restaurant or cafe know your requirements. For
combining an evening meal with a night out I have split central London into
areas - the places around Shaftesbury Avenue, the streets near the English
National Opera, in St Martin's Lane, and eateries near Covent Garden,
Wigmore Hall, the Barbican and the South Bank. They are placed in two
categories: the first for special celebrations and when you are on expenses,
the second for when you are paying yourself. Bon appetit]

FT  17 APR 93 / Computing: Secret of the free Windows software - A hidden
word-processing package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S top word processing package sells around 1m copies a month, with
over 22m sold to date. Is it Word for Windows perhaps, or WordPerfect, or
maybe Wordstar? No, compared with THIS package these are small potatoes. The
top seller sells more than all three put together.
So which is the world's best-selling word processor? The answer, of course,
is Windows Write, which comes free with every copy of Microsoft Windows.
I have been using Write for a couple of months now and very impressed I am
too. All the basic functions are there - word wrap, cut and paste, layout
controls, and the full range of Windows fonts. Very similar in appearance to
Microsoft Word for Windows, Write only lacks Word's heavyweight features for
handling multipage documents and sophisticated page layouts. For the
two-finger typist who wants to produce basic letters, memos and reports
Write is ideal, and its simplicity makes it one of the easiest packages to
learn.
But the computer industry despises the simple and applauds the complex, so
Write is virtually ignored. Of those 22m purchasers of Windows, I would be
willing to bet that a high proportion have no idea that Write exists, let
alone that they own a copy. If there is a PC in your office which has been
bought during the last two years, there is a good chance that unknown to you
Windows Write has been sitting there all the time. Perhaps you should take a
look?
You will need some help to find your way around Windows and Write.
Unfortunately, the Windows manual is difficult to use. Nor can I find any
recommendable self-teach books. Few of them take Write seriously. The best
of a mediocre bunch is Robert Cowart's Mastering Windows 3.1 (Sybex).
I have put together a brief tutorial to help you find out whether you have
Windows on your PC and how to get started on Write. I have assumed you are a
non-mouse user so a mouse is not required. (By the way, if you do not use
Windows you may believe that you cannot use it without a mouse. Not so. In
fact, the key to becoming productive in Windows is to forget the mouse and
to master the keyboard commands just like a DOS package. A full set of these
'keyboard shortcuts' can be found in Appendix C of the Windows manual).
1. First, check that you have Windows: start up the computer. It should
display C:&gt; (the 'C prompt') Type CDWINDOWS and press Enter. If the screen
now displays c:windows&gt; you are in business
2. Type WIN and press Enter. The Windows screen appears, headed
'File-Options-Window-Help'.
3. Call up the 'Window' option by holding down the Alt key (to left of the
spacebar) and pressing W.
4. Use down arrow to highlight and select 'Accessories'.
5. The 13 Windows accessory programs (Paintbrush, Notepad etc) appear.
Write's icon is a quill pen. Use the arrow keys to highlight Write. Press
Enter. The heading 'Write - (Untitled)' appears over a File-Edit-Find menu.
You are now in Windows Write.
6. Bring up the 'File' menu by pressing Alt-F.
7. Press the right arrow six times to go through the other menus, finishing
at the Help menu. 8. Now, from the Help menu option, press right arrow once
more. You see an unexpected menu headed 'Restore, Move etc'. It shows the
all-important Alt-F4 key which is rather like Escape in DOS. There are also
commands for varying the size of the screen. 'Maximise' the Write screen now
pressing X.
9. Press Alt-H for Help and Enter for Contents. Press down arrow to list all
the features of Write. Look at the bottom one - 'Document Help Commands' by
pressing the Tab key repeatedly and working your way down (if you go too
far, shift-tab will take you back).
10. Exit from Help by pressing Alt-F4. You are now back at the blank
File-Edit-Find screen. At this point either start experimenting or use
Cowart, chapter nine.
Cut and paste in Write is delightfully easy. Try this. Type three lines of
text. Now move line one to below line three as follows: move the cursor to
the start of line one; Shift-Down arrow to highlight line one; Shift-Delete
key to delete line one. Move the cursor to below line three; Shift-Insert
key to insert line one.
If you use a mouse you can accomplish most of the above by moving and
pointer to the instruction you want and clicking the button.
You will find that the rest of Write is similarly elegant and simple. No
wonder this is the world's best selling word processing package.

FT  17 APR 93 / As They Say In Europe: Manana arrives - a bright Euro-dawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Easter headlines read 'Socialist Party in crisis meeting' and 'Elections
to be brought forward.' The big opinion pieces were written by earnest men
with titles like 'Professor of Moral Aesthetics at the University of
Montpellier.' Spain is like other nations, but with more respect for other
nations.
All I know of the country comes from the papers and history books. And the
papers are as dull as are the domestic concerns of Spain these days.
Apart, that is, from one glorious period last year when El Pais offered a
specially commissioned detective story to coincide with the Olympics. One
memorable episode opened with the words, 'Inspector Carvalho left the
Serbian javelin thrower in her delirium, singing the Internationale, and
wended his way back from the hospital to the building of the International
Olympic Committee.' Those unfamiliar with post-modern Catalan
deconstructionism would do well to study the works of the writer, Manuel
Vazquez Montalban.
That aside, Spain is the most normal of countries. It has thrown itself into
the process of integration with astonishing enthusiasm, its nationalism is
expressed in foraging for as much cash as Brussels can provide.
It accepts the whole Maastricht ethos and much else: subsidiarity? Certainly
not. Federal Europe is the thing. More power to Brussels' elbow.
Perhaps this is because Spain spent 40 years of this century subjected to
the kind of crass, introverted nationalism that dominated others for 20 at
most. But then it probably spent most of the last millennium in that
peculiar state. Spain is the one European nation that has shuffled off its
unsavoury past through its own efforts and, in effect, 'reinvented itself.'
The normalisation of Spain means that for foreigners the dark allure of Holy
Week in Seville has been overtaken by images of nihilistic self-indulgence
limited only by the possibilities of a packaged fortnight: El Greco
submerged by Salvador Dali.
It is not the land of Gerald Brenan's wonderful Spanish Labyrinth. Today
Homage to Catalonia would be a publicity handout from the Barcelona Tourist
Board. Hugh Thomas' Spanish Civil War is a magnificent history that might be
of another country. And no bad thing.
The dark side that has nearly disappeared may not be worth having, but there
is something about the European-ness of contemporary Spain that is all
wrong. 'Africa,' ran the cliche, 'begins at the Pyrenees.' That is hardly
true today. The road signs are the same as the French and, although the
country stretches as far west as Ireland, the time zone is that of Berlin
and Warsaw.
It is 20 years since I found myself chatting to a woman in Bilbao who told
me that her father had not been able to speak to anybody in his home town,
Pamplona, since the day Franco landed in 1936. On hearing the news over the
radio while playing cards in a local bar, he said, 'That means trouble.'
From that moment he ceased to exist in the eyes of his friends. They joined
the requetes, a fanatical army of Carlists, unorthodox monarchists, who
supported Franco's cause and seemed even crazier than the African Legion
which would marched into battle under the slogan 'Long live death and down
with intelligence.'
The man went to republican territory; I asked his daughter what he did then.
'Oh, he became a Liberal Democrat,' she said.
'What did that mean?'
'It meant he shot everyone who wasn't'
Today, I imagine, that man and his one-time friends are reunited, the only
irreconcilable differences are over the relative merits of football teams.
The Spain of anarcho-syndicalism and clerical fascism has disappeared with
the end of a nation that seemed to exist in a permanent corrida. Spain has
become efficient, manana just means 'tomorrow.'
In Italy 500 ago there was a saying, mi venga la morte di Spagna - 'Let my
death come from Spain.' It was a prayer, which, if granted, would guarantee
for immortality. Today such a prayer would mean death delivered
custom-wrapped by Federal Express in 24 hours together with a 'genuine
hand-tooled morocco leather-bound coffin and miniature stainless steel-style
Toledo sword replicas.'
The press holds few comforts for the traditionalist: the Letter from the
Editor in El Mundo last Monday concerned the row in the Socialist Party and
appeared under the headline, 'Both sides are right.' I could find only one
remnant of Espana autentica in that edition of the paper. It was in a story
headed, 'A source in the Ministry of Defence says that a woman is less
stable than a man.' Many members of the armed forces do not accept a woman
as an equal 'and still less would they take orders from one.' Somewhere the
real Spain still exists.

FT  17 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business, Press Review: Long haul in the
spice trade - Clive Fewins on the slow growth of Fox's and its strategy for
showing its wares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPICES bring variety to the life of the Pester family. When Mike Pester, now
59, bought the loss-making Fox's spices for a Pounds 200 25 years ago he
inherited a business that owned one ageing Renault 4 van, sold a small range
of herbs and spices, and had a trading loss of Pounds 25,000.
'It was a marvellous time to buy,' said Pester. 'The tax credit kept the
Inland Revenue off my back for the first few years, I was gradually able to
buy stock from the former parent company, and the van stayed on the road for
another three years.'
At the time Pester was a salesman with the now defunct Cavenham Foods. Fox's
spices, was part of the group's German operation.
Nowadays 'Mr Fox' as Pester is known throughout the trade, controls a
company with nearly 400 product lines, 1,000 retail outlets, a workforce of
35, a fleet of 17 vehicles, and a turnover of just under Pounds 1m.
Fox's name is most in the public eye at large agricultural and other shows.
Its wares can be sniffed out by foodies at some 50 shows, including The
Royal Show and the Ideal Home Exhibition. Forty per cent of sales come from
shows. The rest come from mail order, the trade, and retail sales.
Pester decided on the show policy in 1971. 'It was simple really,' he said.
'We found the sales of spices and herbs slumped in the summer because people
refrained from eating heavier cooked meals and ate salads instead. At the
time we had no product answer.
'But by selling at low prices direct to the public at shows we found the
supplies they bought from us lasted a whole year and our loyal customers
returned, rather than buying at inflated prices from their local supermarket
in the interim period.'
The move into shows was the start of a period of expansion that has
continued in spite of the recession.
'If anything the recession has done us good. More people are eating at home
and using herbs and spices to make cheaper cuts of meat more interesting,'
Pester said.
He also thinks that entry into the European Community in 1973 aided
business.
'Food prices went up and the English housewife was forced to do what her
continental equivalent had been doing for years - making cheaper meats more
tasty by the use of herbs and spices.'
At the same time there was the large increase in the popularity of ethnic
foods - both in restaurants and at home. Pester supplies herbs and spices to
many of the shops and restaurants opened by Asian immigrants in Britain in
the last 20 years.
The expansion of the company, which is jointly controlled by Pester, his
wife Fay and son Andrew, 31, has been steady but unspectacular.
All this will change in May, when Fox's moves from the former village garage
at Wilmcote, Warwickshire that has been home for the past 17 years, to a new
headquarters in nearby Stratford-on- Avon.
The 12,000 sq ft former printworks will give Fox's four times the space it
has in Wilmcote. Nearly all the extra space will be used because Pester
plans to expand into 'wet mixes' or pastes. This will create at least half a
dozen jobs.
Wet mixes will mean more raw materials arriving in huge sacks from the spice
merchants which supply Fox's, but they will also mean a big saving on the 30
or so lines that the company buys ready mixed from a Dutch supplier.
These lines consist of bumbus, for cooking Indonesian dishes, and sambals,
an Indonesian chili relish. An old Indonesian friend of Pester's, John
Stekkinger, who works in the Netherlands, will be on loan for a few weeks to
help commission equipment and to work on the new mixes.
The cost of importing heavy, ready-mixed spices is high. It is also
expensive to mail the wet mixes in glass jars and these can break. Fox's
post the sambals and sauces in glass jars but Pester and his team are
looking at other methods, such as the plastic vacuum packs for mailing the
mixtures.
'The gains from the expansion will rapidly pay off the cost of the bridging
loan we took out at the end of last year to cover the period between the
purchase of the new building and the eventual sale of the Wilmcote
premises,' he said.
'Making everything we sell is the obvious way to go. In addition it gives us
better quality control and more chance to develop new lines and means of
presentation, notably converting some of the dry mixes, for which we have a
excellent reputation, into wet mixes.' Novel methods of exploiting the mail
order market will be the other top priority in the new building.
'We have three representatives more or less permanently on the road in vans
and estate cars,' Pester said. 'Delivering a small order to a far-flung
place can be uneconomic, so we plan to make more use of professional
carriers and to use our sales force more to develop accounts with large
caterers and public bodies.
'Combined with the greater space available to expand our mail order section
this is the way we see the business going for the next few years.'

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Investments with a sense of Balance
 -A sector that looks attractive for first-timers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK Balanced sector might seem attractive for investors making their
first move into unit trusts. Funds invest in a mixture of bonds and equities
and, accordingly, tend to have a relatively high yield - which can be made
even more appealing in a personal equity plan.
As a sector, UK Balanced ranked eighth of 21 in the industry over the three
years to April 1, with the average fund returning 24.9 per cent
(offer-to-bid with income re-invested); and seventh of 20 over 10 years,
with an average return of 284.2 per cent.
To qualify for the sector, a fund must have no more than 80 per cent of its
portfolio in either shares or fixed interest. This gives the manager a lot
of latitude. At the most conservative end, the fund could have 80 per cent
in gilts and the rest in utilities such as water stocks. But an aggressive
manager could have 80 per cent in equities and the rest in convertibles.
So, first-timers need to choose a fund which meets their own risk
preference. Unit trust managers should be prepared to send potential
investors an annual report, setting out the fund's policy.
The best performer in the sector over 10 years is Henderson Extra Income.
Manager Kate Medd tries to run it for the private investor: her portfolio is
split 80 per cent equities and 20 per cent bonds and she tends to favour
high-yielding shares, a section of the market which has performed well over
the past few months.
Over three years, the fund is 17th of 33 and it has an above-average
performance over both one and five years. The present quoted yield is 5.06
per cent.
Over the short term, the best performer is Perpetual High Income. This fund
is top over both three and five years and second over one year. Neil
Woodford, who runs it, says the maximum 80 per cent is invested in equities.
The trust holds more than 80 stocks, with no position worth more than 5 per
cent. In terms of selection, it has been recovery-oriented.
Although Woodford admits the move into recovery stocks might have been
premature, it meant the fund was well placed for the market's post-ERM
change of direction. The trust has moved gradually into an overweight
position in medium and smaller sized companies, which also has improved its
showing in recent months.
Perpetual's performance - which has won it a number of fund management
prizes - brought in a lot of funds from Pep investors at the end of the
1992-93 tax year. Micropal quoted its size on April 1 as Pounds 62m, but
Woodford says the valuation is Pounds 95m now. The latest quoted yield is
4.52 per cent.
N&amp;P's Higher Income trust is second in the sector over three years and top
over one year. The trust is managed by Capel-Cure Asset Management (which
also runs the highly successful Capability Growth and Capability Special
Situations trusts).
Crispin Finn, co-manager with Leonard Klahr, says it does not own any
conventional bonds but has a mixture of equities and convertibles. The trust
takes a contrarian view and has benefited from its holding of recovery
stocks. At Pounds 3m, it is small, but funds are flowing in with the help of
the link to the National &amp; Provincial building society. The present quoted
yield is 5.07 per cent.
Gartmore's High Income fund is third in the sector over 10 years. Ross
Watson, the manager, says it has a 35 per cent weighting in fixed interest;
it switched into these because of a disappointing performance from
high-yielding shares. The fund has a below-average performance over one,
three and five years. Its latest quoted yield is 5.02 per cent.
The launch of three funds with a bond-equity mix earlier this year indicates
this is a sector of the market which is likely to grow. Broadly speaking,
the higher the proportion of bonds, the greater the yield and the more
attractive the fund is to income-seeking Pep investors. A maximum of 49 per
cent can be held in bonds for a trust to qualify for Pep status.
Cazenove's Bond and Utility fund, which has a 7 per cent yield, should
appear in Micropal figures for the sector next month. But M&amp;G's Managed
Income trust, although it will have a bond-equity mix, is classed in the
fund of funds sector and Fidelity's High Income fund will be classed under
UK equity income. The vagaries of unit trust classification do not make the
investor's life any easier.

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Mortgage gloom for the self-employed
/ A look at the limited options available

AS MORTGAGE lenders sit poised waiting for a housing market recovery, the
self-employed and those whose earnings are not regular are finding it no
easier than before to get a loan.
Lenders who had their fingers burnt in the credit-happy 1980s are
understandably more cautious. The weak housing market has hit their own
mortgage books, while the recession has made them extra careful about the
prospects for those who run their own business or depend on commission
income.
Ian Darby, of mortgage broker John Charcol, believes the clampdown could
have gone too far. 'A gradual process which started two years ago is now
reaching its peak,' he said. 'It is a very tough market for the
self-employed.'
Some types of lending are no longer obtainable - including 'non-status'
loans, where lenders were prepared to grant up to 65 per cent of a home's
cost without references. These mortgages, regarded now as the most
irresponsible of all, disappeared in the mid-'80s.
'Self-certification' loans have diminished, too. These involved applicants
putting up a large deposit - usually 25 or 30 per cent of the loan - and
giving details of their income or spending. The lender would not normally
seek to verify income but would want to see a previous credit reference.
While variants on this type of loan remain available, they are sparse and
mostly from centralised lenders.
For self-employed applicants, the standard minimum demand from the large
building societies is to see three years' fully-audited accounts. 'That time
scale gives them time to become established, and indicates to us the income
they are taking from the business,' said the Halifax building society,
Britain's biggest lender. 'We would expect a regular income from the
business by the third year - that is what we are interested in.'
The Halifax will consider giving a loan to those whose business has been
running for three years but can produce accounts for only two. It will not
accept those working on commission. But Alliance &amp; Leicester says that if
the commission is regular, it will consider a maximum loan based on half the
annual commission earnings.
Abbey National, the second-largest lender, says it wants proof the
self-employed can afford to make regular payments. It also requires three
years' audited accounts, but says there is flexibility in cases where the
company has been formed because of a split. Abbey adds: 'We take a view on
the business too, - we look for signs of how robust it is.'
Ian McKenna, of mortgage broker Blyth McKenna, says some people may find
that the bank handling their business deals might consider providing a
mortgage on more flexible terms than the societies. And some of the
centralised lenders - which fund their businesses through the wholesale
markets instead of deposits - may be willing to give loans on less rigorous
terms than the societies.
Centrebank, a division of Bank of Scotland, has a 'special status' loan for
those with a minimum deposit of 30 per cent. Applicants state the nature of
their employment and the bank will take up a previous lender's reference
(although first-time buyers will also be considered) and a bank reference.
It would not usually want confirmation of income. The application fee is
Pounds 200.
Self-employed people wanting more than 70 per cent of the purchase price
need to provide a letter from an accountant stating their income for the
previous three years, and a set of the past year's accounts.
Capital Home Loans, the UK mortgage arm of Credit Foncier de France, does
not ask for detailed accounts although it will contact the accountant to
verify the details supplied by the self-employed person - who must have been
in business for at least three years.
The maximum proportion lent will be 75 per cent of the value of the house,
up to Pounds 150,000. Re-mortgages also are considered, to a maximum of 70
per cent of the value. The completion fee is Pounds 175 and the
mortgage-holder pays a quarter percentage point above the present standard
variable rate of 7.95 per cent. But first-time buyers are not eligible.
Earlier this month, Prudential launched a mortgage for the self-employed. It
requires a letter from the accountant confirming that the business has been
trading for 12 months and that the applicant can afford the payments. The
loan is for a maximum of 75 per cent of the purchase price and there is an
arrangement fee of Pounds 250. While the interest rate is 9.8 per cent, the
Pru says this is due to come down soon.
The Bank of Ireland and UCB also accept self-employed people on flexible
terms. However, the choice in the market is not wide.
McKenna blames the problem generally on 'a knee-jerk reaction to what has
gone on in previous years when lenders generally abused the non-status
facility in order to gain market share.' He adds: 'Those picking up the tab
now are the good customers in the self-employed market.'

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Pension opt-outs soaring

MANY companies affected by the recession have, unofficially, stopped
contributing to their pension schemes. But this problem can be hidden from
scheme members and stay beyond the reach of watchdogs.
When selling group pension schemes to company directors, insurance companies
commonly emphasise the flexibility allowed over payment of contributions.
'It's all part of the sales patter, particularly in money purchase schemes,'
said one pension sales executive this week. 'You control the costs, you have
flexibility. If profits are down next year, it doesn't matter - skip a
year.'
This message had been put into practice often during the recession, he
added, with the result that up to two years' worth of pensions contributions
could have been missed before the insurance company took any effective
action.
'When a company gets into difficulties, pension contributions can be a good
source of additional cash flow,' said Mike Hayhurst, product development
manager at Save &amp; Prosper. 'It might be a short-term thing and the
contributions turn up (eventually).'
Hayhurst said that to avoid problems of this kind getting worse Save &amp;
Prosper now shut down any pension scheme where contributions have gone
unpaid for three months, and told scheme members.
S&amp;P has also recently negotiated a change of practice with the Occupational
Pensions Board, which monitors the adequacy of pension scheme resources.
'We feel the OPB really does not have any teeth,' said Hayhurst, explaining
that the board's only sanction was to withdraw the certificate allowing a
scheme to contract out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps).
Now, instead of simply reporting to the OPB that a company pension scheme
had gone into arrears on its contributions, and leaving matters to seep
through the usual channels, Save &amp; Prosper made a direct request for removal
of the contracting-out certificate. 'At that point, members' rights in Serps
are at least restored,' Hayhurst added.
Meanwhile, 60 members of the CTU Limited pension scheme, some past pension
age, have experienced the perils of the normal procedures. More than 2 1/2
years after their company went out of business, they have no firm news of
their pensions.
The CTU scheme was set up in 1988, to be operated through Eagle Star. CTU
fell Pounds 60,000 short in its pension contributions in 1988, and missed a
further Pounds 170,000 in 1990. None of this was known to members at the
time.
Eagle Star says it reported the missed contributions to the OPB several
times but the board did not withdraw CTU's contracting-out certificate until
after the company had gone into receivership in June 1991.
Independent Trustee Services Ltd, which was appointed as independent trustee
by the receivers at the start of 1992, has been involved almost ever since.
Director Chris Martin described it this week as a Catch 22 situation. 'The
OPB has been asking us to state that the assets of the scheme are sufficient
to cover the guaranteed minimum pensions,' he said.
'We have told them we can't do that because we suspect they are not. They
say that if we can't give that assurance, then we can't wind up the scheme.'
It also meant the trustees could not switch the scheme's assets out of Eagle
Star's unitised fund and into cash or gilts.
Martin said the OPB finally had agreed to accept a statement from an actuary
that the assets would be sufficient to pay the premiums to get the members
back into the state scheme. But he pointed out that this all might change if
a successful claim could be made on the Department of Employment for up to
one year's worth of missed contributions.
This claim would have to be made with the help of the Official Receiver,
with whom negotiations are in progress. But Martin warned: 'That is a long
way from getting a claim processed.'
